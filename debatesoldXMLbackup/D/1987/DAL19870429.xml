      <P>I should like to ask for some advice on my own behalf and on behalf of other Members of this House. Yesterday you disallowed ten questions from me to the Minister for Education. All of these questions asked for details of how the £11 million extra cut in education was to be found in the Education Vote.</P>

      <P>No, it is also on the other question I sought to raise on the Adjournment regarding dental benefit for spouses, which was announced by us when we were in power and agreed to by Fianna Fáil.

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons) Denis Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious again to emphasise the main thrust of the budget, the need for national recovery of our economy.  Specific areas have been identified by the Government as having the potential required to help us towards national recovery.  The budget has given a boost to the economy and created an awareness in the minds of the people that we are on the correct road to recovery.  The budget has been accepted in a most extraordinary manner as being what the country requires.  Within the area of my responsibility as Minister of State the formation of a new Department of Tourism and Transport clearly demonstrates the importance the Government attach to the tourism industry. There has been a failure over the years to identify this sector as one of immense potential.  We have had to cope with descriptions such as the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce with Tourism tagged on at the end or Forestry and Fisheries with Tourism added as an afterthought.  Now we have the Department of Tourism and Transport with tourism identified as an area of immense potential.  The integration of transport policy in the new Department is of major significance given the pivotal role of an efficient and competitive transport system in the development of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Department will identify the areas of activity of Government Departments and State agencies that can be incorporated to produce attractive packages for tourism.  The regional tourism organisations need not be abolished, as <Col N="400" /> somebody else had in mind but their needs should be clearly defined.  There should be no duplication or overlapping of functions or activities with Bord Fáilte and the RTOs.  However, there is a clear need for closer co-operation between all bodies to ensure that their contribution in their respective fields is understood and seen to be part of a coherent plan for the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>The enormous loss to our economy of our market share relative to our main competitors is something we are addressing immediately.  One matter of importance was access transport costs which remains one of the main factors in the loss to the Irish economy.  Proof of a change, if it was needed, is evident in the upsurge in air passenger traffic between Dublin and London following the lowering of fares on that route in response to competition from a new carrier.  A considerable increase was recorded compared with the static traffic volumes on the route between 1980 and 1985. However, we are not fully satisfied and we intend to pursue economy in fares for access transport to Ireland.  Because of our location as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, we think that emphasis must be directed to the lowering of access costs for visitors.</P>
    <P>The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> gave a firm commitment to achieving export growth and, in particular, to substantially increasing our share in the world tourism market. The policy document, &ldquo;Putting Growth Back into Tourism&rdquo;, also states that revitalising tourism must be a top priority. We are honouring that commitment and we will continue to do so.  I have returned from Brussels where I attended a two day conference on tourism.  It was a stimulating experience for me to find that the emphasis we have placed on tourism and the direction we are taking in the expansion of the industry are seen by our colleagues in the EC as the direction they also wish to take, realising the huge potential there is in tourism and the creation of employment from its development. In 1986, 337,000 tourists came here from mainland Europe and spent <Col N="401" /> £88 million.  German visitors totalled 100,000, French 90,000 and Dutch 33,000.  Given the premier ranking of Germany in world tourism our performance in this market is extremely disappointing. There were also 71,000 visitors from other areas in 1986, over half of whom were Australian, realising revenue of £26.2 million.  Many of these visitors were of ethnic groups, and while access transport is a major factor influencing the non-ethnic traffic, the level of domestic cost is equally important.  The potential of tourism will be developed vigorously by this Government.</P>
    <P>The current budget allocation for Bord Fáilte is in excess of £24 million.  The previous Government proposed a reduction to £20 million which the current Government reluctantly endorsed in view of the necessary curbs which had to be introduced on public spending.  Bord Fáilte will implement this saving by engaging in a more carefully targeted promotional campaign.  In the past the board have concentrated on what is known as destination advertising where fairly large sums of money were spent on generalised media advertising campaigns. This approach to marketing may have been appropriate in the past but this Government have directed that Bord Fáilte should now utilise a more targeted strategy.  It is not expected that there will be any fall-off in tourism either in revenue or in visitor number terms in the coming year.  Indeed, it is expected that there will be a satisfactory increase in tourism in 1987.</P>
    <P>The budget, while it indicated a saving need as I have outlined, allowed for an increase in capital grants.  An amount of £2 million was granted in 1986 for the hotel and guest house reconstruction and development scheme which has been continued because, first, it is intended to operate for only one year and, secondly, the Government want to evaluate very carefully the impact of the scheme to see whether a grant scheme of this sort is as effective as possible in generating investment in the accommodation sector.  All other capital grant schemes administered by Bord Fáilte have been continued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> In the budget also we included an extension of the business expansion scheme to tourism.  That scheme offers a tax incentive to potential investors by enabling them to obtain tax concessions in respect of £25,000 per annum of their investment in approved companies.  For far too long the lack of incentive to invest in this industry has had a detrimental effect on the industry.  We have taken this decision conscious of the need for investment in the industry from people not directly involved in the industry who see it as an area worthy of investment. For many years the tourism sector have been pressing for an extension of this scheme which up to now was confined to manufacturing industry.  We accept that substantial investment in tourism accommodation, amenities and facilities would help enormously in the necessary development and operation of the tourism product.</P>
    <P>Finally, if I may be permitted to become a little parochial possibly in regard to the area of the country from which I come, let me say that the entire region of the south west accounts for about 30 per cent of tourist activity in this country.  In that regard regional tourism organisations have a vital role to play in helping the tourist industry to develop and realise its full potential.  These organisations are working on the ground and are in a unique position to assess tourism's strengths and weaknesses.  If we are to achieve a sustainable level of growth the industry needs to expand into specialist markets and to package and organise the products which these segments of the market require.  The concept of specialist holidays presents new opportunities for the expansion of the tourist industry.  To expand on that we tend to emphasise the weather factor.  Our climate is not of its nature to be concentrated on for holidays, but we have other strengths if that is a weakness and we ought to diversify into those strengths to expand our industry. At the moment a firm of consultants are examining this aspect of the industry, the cost effectiveness of State expenditure on tourism and the potential <Col N="403" /> market for the various specialised products. Their findings should help us to determine areas of development which deserve priority attention.  It is hoped that this examination will be concluded by the middle of next month and on receipt of the consultants' views we will have the further information that is so urgently required to point the direction for industry in future decades and also to ensure that our strengths are utilised for this year, even though we are four months into the year.  We intend in all our actions to develop the industry.  The Government can point the direction and give leadership, Bord Fáilte can stimulate and coordinate development but the success of the strategies adopted will depend on the response and support of those directly involved in the industry as well as those indirectly involved who benefit from tourist spending.  In this regard I hope that the business expansion scheme will attract finance from those who benefit indirectly.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that in an industry with the potential of the tourist industry we have missed our opportunity through lack of commitment and leadership but that opportunity will not continue to be missed.  We will be totally committed to this industry as a means of creating jobs which in turn will boost the economy.</P>
    <P>We often associate tourist spending only with hotels and transport, but at least 60 per cent of tourist spending goes elsewhere. The range of businesses who make their money from tourism have an obligation to invest some of it in tourism development.  We appeal to the sectors who indirectly benefit from tourism, although they would not see themselves as part of the industry, to invest in tourism development.  I already mentioned the RTOs who have a ready structure through which local energies can be harvested to develop tourism.  We acknowledge the commitment and support already given by many businesses in the commercial sector but we want more firms in the commercial sector to get <Col N="404" /> involved.  We can sell more to the tourists, if we produce, stock and display the products they want.</P>
    <P>The development of tourism is not only about selling goods and keeping the environment clean although the environment is something on which we should concentrate.  As this is the year of the environment we should use the opportunity to create an awareness among people of the need for a clean environment for our wellbeing as well as to encourage visitors.  First impressions are lasting impressions.</P>
    <P>About 80,000 jobs depend directly or indirectly on tourism.  There is great potential for increasing that number of jobs in the future.  If we are more courteous in serving our visitors in relation to accommodation and shopping requirements, they will be encouraged to return and to spend more which means more jobs and not just in the sectors directly identified with tourism.</P>
    <P>In relation to access transport I must express my appreciation of the efforts of the local authorities in the south west region and also the West Glamorgan County Council not to mention the commitment of the previous Government. Despite the budgetary constraints on us we intend to support by means of the start up grant, the UK link between Cork and Swansea.  I had the privilege of formally launching that link recently.  For an area like the south west the potential is tremendous.  As a result of this link the number of visitors will increase enormously during the coming years.  The commitment given by local authorities to set up this company is fully acknowledged, and I wish it well.  It may be considered that the fares for access transport may not yet be at the level we would hope for, but never before have the fares by air and sea been so attractive and never before was there such a choice of ways to travel between the UK and Ireland.</P>
    <P>The ferry link, in addition to its value to the people who use it, to the tourist industry and to the commercial life of the south west, has provided a morale boost to the people of the region.  Goodness <Col N="405" /> knows, the area needed the sort of morale boost that the reintroduction of the link provided for them.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled, and it is on the record of this House, that in a plea to have that ferry service restored I made the longest contribution in any single debate in the last Dáil extending over one and a half hours.  I am more than pleased that the service has been restored.  Indeed to raise the morale in the area, as a Government, we have a few more things to do for the tourist industry.  Despite the budgetary constraints on us I am confident that the proposals to upgrade the airport in Cork will be proceeded with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already touched on the subject of the environment.  Bearing in mind that this is the year of the environment there are a number of other matters in this area of vital importance to the tourist industry.  Litter is one.  I suppose I would be correct in describing its abolition as our first priority.  We must create an awareness in people's minds of the damage being done to our environment by the indiscriminate dumping of litter on our streets and in our countryside generally.  We must make it known that it is not acceptable to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Planning is also very relevant in the sphere of the environment, as is water and sea pollution.  Indeed marine wreckage and conservation needs fall under this heading also.  As a nation we have learned what it means to have a wreck such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> sited off our coast with its potential dangers.  The action taken and continuing to be taken by this Government since assuming office must be acknowledged.  There is also the tremendous work being done by the relevant local authority in ensuring that the surrounding beaches do not suffer any ill effects.  While on the subject of our environment I would request that local authorities and the Departments of the Environment and of the Marine would grapple with the situation obtaining in such matters.  My Department will be taking an active interest in developments in relation to all of these issues.  As a further indication on this Government's <Col N="406" /> commitment to tourism I might reiterate that there will now be an interdepartmental committee whose task will be the co-ordination of all efforts in regard to tourism.  We hope to strengthen the hand of this committee, raising its profile, which decision will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The awards of excellence, giving recognition to local authority efforts, are worthwhile.  These awards are presented annually and include those nationally for tidy districts, commercial streets, tidy beaches and so on.  These afford an opportunity to extend an awareness of our environment about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>Signposting is a matter requiring immediate attention.  Last year Bord Fáilte held a three day seminar, in association with An Foras Forbartha for planning officers throughout the country.  We shall implement the positive recommendations emanating from those discussions so that Bord Fáilte will continue to play a forceful role in the activities of the environmental awareness bureau by way of representation on the management committee.  There are reports prepared on water pollution and a draft policy document has now been prepared.</P>
    <P>We shall also encourage the preservation of heritage houses, the cost of maintaining which has become prohibitive in many cases and constitutes a heavy financial burden on their owners. In turn that leads to their deterioration which must be remedied.  The social employment scheme has been identified as a means by which their maintenance may be assisted.  I hope the provisions of that scheme will be used extensively in ensuing years.</P>
    <P>The European year of the environment has as its overall objective the organisation and promotion of a programme of events and activities aimed at raising public awareness with regard to improving and protecting the environment.  The environment awareness bureau acts as the national committee for Ireland.  They have now formulated a number of flagship projects.  Plans are afoot to secure <Col N="407" /> sponsorship of the programme from a number of sectors.</P>
    <P>Increasing the range and facility of the various local authority services is another primary task of the Government and my Department.  In order to achieve higher growth levels our tourism industry needs to expand into specialist markets, marketing the project and amenities those markets require.  It must be remembered that the modern tourist is more activity conscious than his predecessor.  Bearing in mind that our weather is not something we can sell easily we must concentrate on holiday activities.  In order to acquire a more significant share of that growing market it is important that we identify the activities we can offer by way of augmenting the holiday enjoyment of potential tourists.  It has already been proven that there is an appreciable market for many of our amenities, amenities that are almost too numerous to outline.  Some examples are golfing and inland fishing. The Department of the Marine will no doubt pay attention to our deep sea and off shore fishing and will encourage its development from a tourism point of view.  Other amenities are boating, orienteering and hill climbling.  Then we have our culture, our heritage and our Irish language.  We can hone in on all these activities to attract visitors to our country.</P>
    <P>Latest research shows there are other markets for special interest products such as agri-tourism and scientific tourism. The list can be added to almost daily.  We intend to spur on the identification of these areas of activity and provide for the tourists the information and the direction they need in order to partake in these activities.  I am aware that the consultancy team have almost finalised their study of the effectiveness of State spending on tourism.  This analysis, when submitted, will provide the basis for Bord Fáilte in determining priorities when setting about the tasks of expanding and diversifying the range of products available. We must also identify areas to assist the provision of extra facilities in resorts and other locations.  They have been <Col N="408" /> unsuccessful in expanding these facilities, We must generate an extension of the holiday season and encourage longer stays by visitors by way of improving facilities and expanding the range of activities.  In this context we need more all-weather facilities as a primary consideration.</P>
    <P>In the internal market for tourism we must provide and encourage the provision of adequate playgrounds, adventure playgrounds, for our own children as well as for the children of visitors.  A small fee could be charged for admission because when such a fee is payable, it is usually the case that more respect is shown for facilities like the ones I have mentioned.  The income from the fee could be used to provide entertainment in those playgrounds and also to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the children. In that way it would also create employment.</P>
    <P>Apart from resort and holiday centre facilities, Bord Fáilte continue to fund and support individual projects in locations where there is a demonstrated tourism content.  That is as it should be. We cannot of course continue to expect the Exchequer to fund all the activities. That is why, on a number of occasions, I have mentioned the need for investment from the commercial sector and from everybody who can play a part in extending this industry.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted &mdash; this projection is based on current trends and on discussions and meetings I had in the past few weeks &mdash; that the demand for centres offering multi-activity holidays will increase significantly during the coming years.  It is therefore essential to encourage further improvements in those centres so that we can attain the standard of their counterparts in Europe.  There is a range of activities, some of which I have already outlined.  As I said already, the list is endless.  Many of these activities are organised worldwide with affiliated international bodies.  This assists greatly in identifying the size of the potential market.  It enables direct marketing to the people involved.  I contend that we have not done sufficient up to now in <Col N="409" /> selling the strengths of our tourist industry but that is now behind us.  We have set the direction in Government and we intend to pursue it.  Everybody involved realises that the direction we are taking is the correct one.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the RTOs.  I would like to see more recognition, by way of funding, of the RTOs by the business community.  The regional tourism organisations have a crucial role to play in the development of tourism.  They have an abundance of local knowledge and ideas to assist the development process. Having been given encouragement, they can encourage local involvement in the development of tourism.  They are ideally positioned to develop and exploit the tourism potential of their respective regions.  Fifty five per cent of the budget of the RTOs is provided by Bord Fáilte. Their contribution amounted to over £2.3 million in 1986.  The balance of the budget of the RTOs is provided by local authorities, about 13 per cent; membership subscriptions, about 7 per cent and commercial activities undertaken by the RTO's about 25 per cent.  There is an obvious need for greater financial involvement by the local communities in the running of the RTOs.  The commercial sector contributed only 7 per cent to the cost of their local RTOs, yet 60 per cent of tourist revenue is spent on items other than hotel accommodation and transport.</P>
    <P>Value for money is an area which has been, and still is, causing some concern. The main factors which caused high prices for tourists in Ireland were the high rate of inflation in the early eighties, the high rates of VAT on essential elements of the tourism product like accommodation, car and boat hire, meals, drinks and petrol, high access costs partly attributable to the fact that we are an island and there is no road or rail access for our major markets and lower labour and other costs, particularly in the Mediterranean, and the long haul destinations.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that inflation is now down to 3 per cent.  VAT has been reduced to 10 per cent for accommodation, car and boat hire and meals. <Col N="410" /> There has been increased competition &mdash; and this is the crucial one &mdash; leading to lower prices initially on air access routes. On the Dublin-London route there was a fairly substantial reduction and on the United States-Ireland route the prices were very competitive compared with the United States and other European city rates.  It is hoped that this more competitive régime can be extended to routes other than the cross-Channel routes in order to maximise access possibility and price competitiveness.</P>
    <P>A balance needs to be struck between low prices for the tourists and a reasonable level of profitability for the tourist operators.  The hotel industry have had particularly low profitability for the past five or six years, and this inhibits not only re-investment but also an increase in employment.  In this context the recent commitment by the Irish Hotels Federation in their policy document to maintain price levels is very welcome and I want to acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Value for money is a concept which must be kept in perspective.  Good standards and quality must not be sacrificed merely to bring about low costs.  At the same time it is conceded that tourists have been ripped off.  This is hard to control.  Community pressures and an appreciation that this attitude is unproductive in the long run will be the only way in which value for money for tourists can be ensured.</P>
    <P>Import substitution forms part of the direction we intend to follow in the future.  The sharp decline in the performance of the domestic market in recent years is a matter of serious concern. The poor summers of the past two years and the decline in the level of discretionary income has not helped, but a more forceful marketing approach by the industry and Bord Fáilte highlighting the attractions of Ireland and putting together holiday offers at competitive prices, particularly activity related holiday packages, should restore growth in the home market.</P>
    <P>Previous Governments reduced VAT on a range of tourism related products. This, coupled with this Government's <Col N="411" /> efforts to contain inflation, will make Ireland a more attractively priced holiday destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's Budget Statement on 31 March he outlined the budget policy for 1987 and future years. He stated that public expenditure must be curtailed.  I welcome the recognition of this fact by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party, albeit at a late stage.  I hope the measures proposed in the budget will in fact have the desired effect, as stated by the Minister.  He also stated that: &ldquo;The Alternative is a substantial increase in taxation which is just not acceptable&rdquo;. However, we have under this budget exactly that &mdash;&ldquo;A substantial increase in taxation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have witnessed over the past ten years or so the inordinate growth of services provided by the State for the citizens. This is the reason we have such high Government expenditure, and directly related to that, high taxation on individuals. We must restrict expenditure and reduce levels of personal taxation and, as the Minister says rightly in his Budget Statement, this require that the provision of public services will be curtailed. I would welcome a definite statement from the Minister and the Government that this is in fact what they intend doing.</P>
      <P>It seems that the restriction of services or grants under any given scheme to a certain number of people still involves large scale administrative costs.  This is where the vast bulk of the State's current expenditure is going.  The only way to reduce it substantially is actually to eliminate whole schemes in selected areas which will then relieve the State of the burden of administering those schemes in any way.  Why should we continue to tinker with industrial grant-aid and subsidies when what we must generate is a willingness to compete in the market. Since the budget, the OECD in their recent report have urged us to abandon the strategy, if it is one, of grants and subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants in Ireland have become a way <Col N="412" /> of life, an entitlement in the minds of many of our people.  It is time that grants to industry, for instance, were reviewed in a fundamental way.  Even the Telesis report and the White Paper of the previous administration did not question the rationale of their existence.  If we look at the financing of industry we can readily identify the need for equity capital and loan capital at low rates for a long term. I submit that the present method of grant-aid by the State is not the best use of those State funds.  It creates a dole-mentality in industry, and does not easily fit side by side with the philosophy of initiative and enterprise.  The State would serve all better by considering its role as facilitating the provision of equity finance and cheap long term loan capital instead of grants.  This could be done by a national equity fund managed on a commercial basis to which all people and institutions could subscribe and where a certain minimum interest rate could be guaranteed by the Exchequer.  For loan capital the Exchequer should, by guarantees or by subsidised interest rates, enable much more loan capital to be available from the private lending institutions.</P>
    <P>These schemes have merits over grants in the following way: the dole mentality is abolished in industry; much less Government funds are handed out; funds are released from private lending institutions; and in investing in the equity fund the people as a whole can become aware of and interested in the viability and growth of industry.  Of course, in order to attract international investment, since grants are used by our competitors, we probably will have to continue to afford this incentive.  Nevertheless, if my suggestions are accepted then a much wider range of incentives would be available to put together an attractive flexible package at less cost to the State.  Grants are a blunt and unsophisticated incentive, and it is time they were critically examined.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the area of job creation and the effect the budget will have on jobs, it is plainly evident that the thrust <Col N="413" /> of this budget has been to reduce employment in the building and allied areas even further.  This will undoubtedly have the effect of increasing the burden on the State for payment of more unemployment benefit and assistance.  The way the three grant schemes have been abolished demonstrates a lack of foresight and understanding of the possible situation in which many thousands of people find themselves.  They have entered into agreements on the basis that they would be eligible to receive grants and find that these grants have been abolished retrospectively.  Whereas I realise that no Government could have continued these grants in operation because of the way they had got out of hand &mdash; which, of course, should have been foreseen long before now &mdash; Government action should not set out to create inequities.  This is exactly what this measure did and it is these inequities which caused the Government to change their tune on the implementation of the abolition of these grants.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for the Environment in the Dáil on Tuesday explaining the most recent interpretation his Department were giving to the budget ruling but it remains unclear and is unhelpful to the many people who are caught in this anomalous situation.  Complaints have been made over the last two weeks that it is almost impossible to get in contact with the Department even on the special telephone lines made available for queries from Deputies.</P>
    <P>This has led to the ridiculous situation of hundreds of questions appearing on the order paper for the Minister for the Environment referring to individual queries as to whether certificates of grant approval will be issued.  It is an appalling waste of civil servant's time, not to mention Deputies' time and also the time of the individuals who are attempting to clarify the position for themselves and extricate themselves from arrangements where possible.  If the Minister had seen fit to publish clear and unambiguous guidelines allowing for his new interpretation of the regulations, much public money would have been saved by not <Col N="414" /> having to go through the farce of answering these hundreds of queries.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Minister showed inadequate foresight in the framing of his budget is that concerning the new 35 per cent withholding tax on professional fees.  I approve the move towards the payment of tax in the current year for those who are not at present paying it in this manner.  Any move which ensures that those who are not paying their fair share of tax, or are not paying their fair share of tax on a current basis, will do so is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>However, where this measure falls down is that it is not an attempt to gather on a fair and equitable basis.  It represents yet another crude attempt at gathering funds, no matter from what source, and no matter what the result is of this exercise. It is worth pointing out that there is a very serious issue here which has become overlooked in the light of the stringent measures which the budget introduced. Many companies in construction-linked professions are presented with very real difficulties, particularly where a company are heavily dependent on State contracts. In many cases income from this source could represent up to 80 per cent of total income.  Over recent years many companies in the architects', engineers' and surveyors' professions have disappeared because of the contraction in the amount of business available.  Those who remain in business have cut their overheads to the bare minimum, and are employing as few staff as it is possible to operate with. In many cases fees for State contracts are received after long delays.  Their cash flow is, therefore, precarious at the best of times.</P>
    <P>The Government are implying by implementing a 35 per cent withholding tax on gross fees that these fees represent income or profit.  That is very obviously not the case in the great majority of firms who take on State work.  They have overheads such as salaries, wages, rent, interest payments, etc., which must first be deducted from these fees before any profit or income for the directors can be made.  It seems only equitable that these firms should be required to pay tax on <Col N="415" /> the same basis as everybody else in the community, that is, on the basis of tax on income over and above legitimate and necessary expenses.</P>
    <P>There is also a further sub-category of these firms where all the principals have the status of employees and pay tax on a current or PAYE basis.  In these circumstances all members of the company pay tax weekly or monthly within the PAYE system.  The Minister in his budget speech made the point that he was attempting, by means of this tax, to draw into the net of taxpayers who pay on a current basis some of those who now pay on a previous year basis.  As I have demonstrated, there are firms who might be in receipt of State fees who will not fall into the category of paying on a previous year basis and, therefore, should not be subject to this extra tax, which is in effect the State borrowing money at a nil interest rate, from those whom it is employing.  What will happen in effect is that companies in this situation will have an intolerable burden by way of cash flow, additional financing facilities and the additional interest charges on such facilities imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Some firms, particularly small firms, will have to close down.  We will, therefore, further damage the infrastructure of the construction industry to which we are still clinging despite the deep recession.  It is quite likely that foreign firms will step in to take up the slack. These firms already have the advantage that they do not have to charge VAT on their fees and will, therefore, be in a position to undercut Irish firms.  The Minister in his budget speech referred to the possibility of refunds where no tax liability was incurred.  This is not a solution as the refunds will only be made after the companies have ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to immediately make adjustments in the rules guiding the implementation of this withholding tax so as to make it equitable, and to take into account situations where full tax is already being paid on a PAYE basis.  The Progressive Democrats will be moving substantial amendments to the Finance <Col N="416" /> Bill on this matter when it comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm that the Progressive Democrats favour the transfer of taxation to a current year basis, as we have outlined in our policy documents, when we promoted the idea of self-assessment to achieve this.  What we are seeing in the Minister's crude attempt to increase Government income, albeit on a once-off basis, is a measure which has not been thought out and which will have to be adjusted if the most serious and devastating consequences are to be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in his speech on the budget to this House laid great emphasis on the need for the Government to create new jobs as distinct from simply preserving existing employment.  I applaud him when he calls for a concerted effort to be made on the part of each sector in society. I also agree with him that regular and meaningful discussions with outside bodies such as employer and trade union organisations are essential if such a concerted effort is to be co-ordinated and to take effect.  However, it is the job of the Government of the day to give a lead and to show where the priorities lie for the country.  We are in danger of creating, with our many work schemes and youth training programmes, the artificial phenomenon known as the tertiary sector, that is, publicly funded works to be carried out in the community which would not otherwise be done.  Why must the State inevitably be the employer on these social work schemes?  For example, the social employment scheme at present is funded and administered by the State. It seems to me that we could redirect our funds so that they would be benefiting other sectors of the economy, for example, such as tourism.</P>
    <P>We could be contracting out work in each county to clean up and maintain areas, funding these contracts instead of directly employing the participants in the social employment scheme.  However, the contractors would be required then to use a particular category of worker, i.e. those who were previously unemployed, or unemployed for longer than a <Col N="417" /> year.  Many counties and local communities would have work of this kind which they could pinpoint, and I suggest that people employed on such schemes would be happier to be directly employed by a contractor from whom they might expect to obtain more work in the future than to be doing a stint on one of the retraining or employment schemes available through the Government.  It also has the advantage of placing the onus for administering the work on the community. We should avoid the creation of a parallel labour force of people asked to work for lower wages simply because they have no jobs.  This also undermines the value of other insured, particularly manual, employments.</P>
    <P>The increase in numbers involved in the social employment scheme announced in the budget of 1,500 and the increase to 40,000 on the many other manpower schemes could, in many instances, be said to be using the State funds for merely stopgap measures.  This is not good enough from a party which in the past ridiculed the use of such schemes to alleviate unemployment.  The fact is that young people in Ireland do not aspire to places on work experience or such schemes.  They do not want to be passed on from one temporary working environment to another.  Versatility and adaptability are good and perhaps necessary qualities to survive in employment today but let us not make a virtue of that necessity and let us not fuel even greater cynicism about the State's capacity to generate employment opportunities. Young Irish people are not submissive to the promise of temporary aid; their answer is more and more to follow the emigration trail.</P>
    <P>As for the older and long term unemployed who will be directed more towards the social employment scheme, I note the allowance for single people will be reduced to £60.  So be it, if that is all the State can afford.  The real problem with this scheme is that by freeing participants for the remaining two or three days of the week we are actively institutionalising the black economy.  If the State offers employment at all it should be seen to <Col N="418" /> encourage participation in insurable employment in the white economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the subject of restrictions on public service pay and recruitment, I see that the Government have no option but to tell the public sector workforce at large that enough is enough.  The Minister in his Budget Statement referred to two major factors accounting for the size of the public service wage bill at £2,840 million. These were, the rates of pay and also the number of public servants.  He undertook to take action on both fronts now and though there will be undoubtedly many who feel that their special pay increases are worthy of granting, the simple fact that there are simply no resources with which to pay.</P>
    <P>He also gave notice that no provision for any further general increase after the expiry of the present pay agreement would be made.  This would seem to be a basic underlying fact in any negotiations that take palce between the Government and the public service unions.  However the Taoiseach was very reticent when questioned in the Dáil on Tuesday of this week.  He was not prepared to say that this basic requirement of Government policy had been set forth by himself and his Ministers when they met representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  To talk of exploratory talks between the social partners as to how best to tackle the nation's financial problems without each side setting out their position is a nonsense.  Yet the Taoiseach was reticent about this aspect of the meeting to the Dáil.  I believe the Minister for Finance was correct in his assessment of the public sector pay problem in the budget.  I urge him and the Government to adhere to the terms of the budget in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about reductions in the numbers of public servants, particularly those who are employed in the public service area which is directly financed from the Exchequer. The whole question of the structure of the public service and of the curtailment of numbers in it is a very wide one.  It requires us to look at each Department in turn, and as the Department of the <Col N="419" /> Public Service were beginning to do until recently, to co-ordinate efforts at rationalisation. I have to confess to being very disappointed to see that the Department of the Public Service are now incorporated in the Department of Finance.  It seems this Department are pivotal where reform of the public service is concerned. They simply cannot get the attention they deserve if they do not have a separate Minister.  The priorities in the Department of the Public Service of reforming the service, re-allocating personnel, motivating personnel and restructuring generally will become secondary to those of the Department of Finance which are essentially concerned with setting wage limits and restricting budgets.  My point is that budgets do indeed have to be restricted but they must also be restricted in the light of the most effective service we can get for this amount of money.  In particular, the growth of some Departments, associated bodies and agencies is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>It reflects on the lack of co-ordinated planning that takes place at departmental level.  For instance, in the Department of Industry and Commerce most of the planning that takes place happens outside the Department and in the agencies attached to it.  There is, therefore, no particular curb on the growth of these agencies, as they wish to increase the scope of their influence and control.  The public service will continue to grow unless a tight hold is taken in each Department of the planning of that Department, and in particular unless existing sections are actually closed and their staff reallocated where they are particularly needed.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the scheme of career breaks has come to an end in the Civil Service.  I see this as a retrograde step.  This scheme enabled those who wished to take a break from their career in the service, often in order to try out a different career.  As a somewhat convoluted form of voluntary redundancy it has its virtues, particularly where reductions in the numbers of the public service employees are required.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position <Col N="420" /> with regard to this scheme as being a help in the achievement of his objective of reducing numbers.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome, as I said at the outset, the conversion of Fianna Fáil to the realism which the Progressive Democrats have been speaking about since their inception.  I very much regret that not alone does this budget not make any provision for any restructuring of the tax system and alleviation of individual taxpayers, but it actually heavily increases the tax burden so that from April this year 47 per cent of our taxpayers will pay tax above the standard rate.  It also makes no real attempt to reduce Government expenditure.  The numbers of savings increased through greater economies as set out in the Principal Features of the 1987 budget, presented with the Budget Statement, indicate that there is a very large grey area surrounding many of these proposed economies.  This may well have the effect later in the year or at year's end of allowing the public finances to remain out of control.  For the sake of the country I hope I am wrong but I would like to be more sure of the Government's resolve and leadership in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Government on the expeditious way in which they brought forward this budget.  This budget is an effort to redress the situation which has arisen over the past number of years and which has not been tackled.  In the short time available to the Government they have framed this budget which, with other measures taken, shows they will endeavour to get our public finances in order.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council in their report of November 1986, &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986 to 1990&rdquo; stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The achievement of a more rapid and sustainable rate of growth and the correction of the chronic imbalances in the public finances will require a more considerable degree of sacrifice from this society.  If such sacrifices are to be accepted without compensation being <Col N="421" /> sought, it is essential that they are shared equitably across all sections of society.</P>
    <P>The key word in that quotation is &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;. It is important to stress that if this nation is to survive and if our economy is to survive we have to make sacrifices right across the board.  This budget has generally been accepted as a strict and tough one.  Having said that, it cannot be denied that expenditure cuts and measures have been made right across the board in an effort to see that equity prevails. These cuts being made must be made if we are to get the economy back on the road to recovery.  The budget addresses itself to reducing the Exchequer's borrowing requirement.  To do this, various measures have been announced which are bitter to swallow but, in order to get the finances back on the road to recovery, we as a nation must be united rather than allowing sectional interests to demand and agitate for their own political gain.</P>
    <P>All major political parties went into the last election proclaiming that such measures had to be taken. It is now up to them to back this budget as an honest attempt to set out on the road to financial stability.  Nobody can expect miracles overnight.  This budget is merely doing what should have been done many years ago.  Already, we have seen that the budgetary proposals are having an effect, as can be witnessed by the definite downward trend of interest rates.  Also a dramatic fall in cross-Border trade is plain to be seen.</P>
    <P>This budget goes even further than that proposed by Fine Gael in January.  It proposes a further reduction of 1 per cent in the borrowing target as set down by the Fine Gael budget.  It is financially more stringent on the one hand, while it is far more humane than the proposed Fine Gael budget.  Most commentators on the budget have concentrated on a number of items.  They have done this without highlighting the reversal by my party of a number of harsh measures in the proposed Fine Gael budget.  I shall <Col N="422" /> give a number of examples.  We have now no prescription charges; the rural dispensing scheme has been restored; the career guidance posts have been restored; social welfare increases of 3 per cent have been brought forward to July rather than October 1987; unemployment benefit is for 15 rather than 12 months as proposed; there is no increase in the waiting period from three to six days as proposed by Fine Gael; eligibility for disability, unemployment and maternity benefits comes after four years not five as proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The reversal of these measures will help those who are less well off.  They are the people who have suffered more than most in the last number of years.  The rest of us should be prepared to make sacrifices to ensure that the burden on the less well off people in our community is lessened.  This is why I say the budget leans more heavily on those sections of the community than on the very low income groups.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the NESC report, it further advocates a more effective and equitable taxation system.  Fianna Fáil in their budget started this process.  They have stated that as soon as possible they will move to have two-thirds of all taxpayers paying at the standard rate.  It has been recognised that our system of tax is top heavy and complicated.  This is why such schemes as self-assessment are being favourably accepted.  Tax equity is a much used phrase.  Attaining it has eluded successive Governments over the years.  However, the proposals in this budget go some way towards showing that the tax system will be fair and that no particular section will be treated more leniently than others.</P>
    <P>The withholding tax may be a bitter pill to swallow for some but it shows that the Government are resolute in their aim to get tax equity into the system.  Deduction at source has been a feature of our taxation system over the last number of years.  PAYE taxpayers have had it for years.  Now it has been proposed that that section of the taxpaying community which has come in for its fair share of criticism over the last number of years <Col N="423" /> will have it.  It will be necessary, however, to examine the workings of this tax in detail to ensure that no firm goes out of business.</P>
    <P>The building industry suggested that the budget was not kind to them.  I cannot agree with this.  This budget will help to cultivate an economic climate in which interest rates will fall.  This, in turn, will help to increase demand in the industry and, in particular, in the dwellinghouse sector.  The recent drop in Central Bank interest rates shows that already this budget has had an effect on the economic climate.  A continuation of this trend will lead to the needed growth which, in turn, will assist the building sector.  The strengthening of the £ sterling is also another factor which will aid their recovery.</P>
    <P>A feature which will help the building industry is the extension of the business expansion scheme to tourism.  The decentralisation programme is also being recommenced.  We still have &mdash; and I think this is forgotten by many commentators &mdash; the new house grant of £2,000 for first time purchasers and also the scheme of improvement grants for disabled persons and for essential repairs. Over the last two years the so-called black hole has led to hundreds of thousands of pounds leaving the country by one means or another.  Various factors have been blamed.  I come from a Border constituency and such constituencies have suffered because money has been transferred illegally across the Border to banks in the Six Counties, thus reducing the amount in circulation in these areas. The budget has targeted a number of areas which will help to redress this problem &mdash; the tax treatment of expatriate remittances and also non-residents' accounts.  The trend of the reduction in interest rates will also help this aspect of our economy.</P>
    <P>On the job front, Fianna Fáil have spearheaded an initiative to help the many long term unemployed.  Jobsearch has shown already in pilot schemes around the country that it has the capability of bringing together the various <Col N="424" /> State agencies in a positive effort to provide opportunities for our many unemployed. There have been 40,000 vacancies set aside in Manpower services, while 12,000 places in the special Jobsearch courses will also be available.  This scheme, together with other developmental and employment creating measures as already outlined by us, will help to redress the dire unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The day of hand-outs is over.  Before the election, many announcements were made in County Louth promising aid. These promises were made, knowing full well that it would be we who would have to implement and pay for them, not those who were making the promises.  Every project from now on will be examined carefully to ensure that there is no waste of public finances.  Efficiency must be the name of the game.  The public will not thank us for not ensuring that their money is well spent.  My own County Louth has suffered more than most over the last number of years.  The January 1987 figures on the live register for Dundalk are 4,348, for Ardee 1,340 and for Drogheda 4,196.  This does not take into account the many people who have emigrated from the area.  There has been a massive decline, particularly in Dundalk, in the manufacturing industry.  The retail and service sector there has lost nearly 400 jobs.  This again has reduced the purchasing power in the Dundalk area.  The cycle goes on.</P>
    <P>Every other area in the country has had to put up with the problem of the recession.  However, the Dundalk area along with other Border areas has had to deal with the further problem of cross-Border trade.  Commentators and economists have estimated that somewhere in the region of £300 million per year has gone out of this economy in this fashion. For example, petrol sales in the Border counties have gone down on average by 25 per cent during the last four years.  On a half-mile stretch on the Dundalk to Newry road, six petrol stations have closed in recent times while a futher three have gone out of business on the Castleblayney to Dundalk road.  Many traders <Col N="425" /> living across the Border in the Six Counties have become millionaires overnight because of the wide disparity of prices between one side of the Border and the other.  Traders in Border areas must welcome this budget.  Today a trader in Dundalk ran across the main street to ask me to congratulate Mr. MacSharry for the measures that have been taken in this budget because over the last number of weeks there has been a decided improvement in trade in my home town.  Other Deputies from Border areas have told me that the same is the case in their towns.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's first step to redress the Border problem was to appoint many Border Deputies as Ministers and Ministers of State.  This is in stark contrast to the last Government where there was not one Border Deputy at the Cabinet table. The next step they took was not to propose any increase in excise duties on the old reliables following on from the UK budget.  Their most effective proposal of all was the restriction on duty-free allowances. This will stop the huge day trip trade across the Border which comes from all over the country.  Shortly before Christmas I stood at the Border for half an hour and I counted 24 buses going northwards, apart from cars and vans. No economy could put up with that much longer.</P>
    <P>Locals on the roads between Dundalk and the Border have confirmed to me that there has been a huge drop in traffic northwards since the budget.  I have spoken with a number of customs officials on the Border and they have confirmed that the number of long distance day trippers has fallen off dramatically since the budget.  This will give the customs officials much more time to patrol the Border so as to stop the more largescale smuggling which has been a very heavy drain on local economies.  On Easter Sunday 1986 the road leading out of Dundalk was full of cars and buses going northwards.  This year the road was bereft of this traffic, it was going the other way. One customs official stated that during a certain period on a recent Saturday in Carrickcarnan only 500 vehicles crossed over the Border whereas on the same <Col N="426" /> Saturday the previous year during the same period 4,000 vehicles crossed the Border.</P>
    <P>Some commentators and retailers in the Border areas were too quick to criticise the budgetary proposals in this regard.  It is now generally accepted, even by people on the other side of the House, that these measures have been a godsend to the Border areas.  Despite many representations and deputations the previous Government stood idly by and did nothing while the Border economies floundered.  It has cost the State nothing to bring in these regulations and I wonder why they were not brought in by the last Government.  If they had been brought in three or four years ago the Border economies would not have been allowed to go into the dire situation they are now in.  The measures taken in the last few weeks show that the Government are aware and worried about the cross Border trade problem.  I hope that they will be the first of many measures which Fianna Fáil will take in Government to ensure that the Border economies recover.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion recently concerning the Single European Act.  A great proportion of this discussion related to sovereignty, neutrality and foreign policy.  What has been forgotten is that the rationale behind this Act is to break down more quickly than has been happening to date the trade barriers between member states.  This is something which people like myself who live along the Border must be aware of.  This is one of the reasons why people should vote in favour of the Act.  Not only are Border economies being crucified by the variation in duties between North and South but the main roads leading to the Border are completely clogged up with commercial vans and articulated trucks awaiting clearance at customs posts.  This has caused much agitation to residents in the immediate area of the customs posts. It is no great advertisment for our country to tourists coming into the jurisdiction. The total abolition of trade barriers would herald an end to this congestion and would lead to the freer movement of <Col N="427" /> goods between member states.  A vote against the Single European Act would be a vote for further isolation, thus leading to further economic problems for our country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced recently that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, would have responsibility for urban renewal affairs.  I am pleased about this because I come from a town where the main street has more &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs than anywhere else in Ireland.  To its detriment during the last local elections this featured on news programmes shown in England, France, Germany and America,to name but a few.  It is estimated that up to 50 business premises in Dundalk town are up for sale.  Dundalk must be included in any urban renewal package. Money has been set aside by the Anglo-Irish fund for urban renewal projects in Border towns.  I am hopeful that these measures will give businesses in the area the necessary impetus to come back to the centre of Border towns and particularly my own town, Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement by the Government to extend the natural gas pipeline through Drogheda to Dundalk will be welcome news for Louth as it will help to entice new projects into the area and make relatively cheap energy available to them.  It will also help the beleaguered factories in the area to survive.  The public can be assured that we in Fianna Fáil will examine every possibility so as to ensure that the Border areas recover.</P>
    <P>This budget is the first step on the long road to recovery for this nation.  The Government have shown, by this budget, that they are prepared to take the necessary harsh steps to ensure this recovery while at the same time minimising the burden on those who can least afford it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the budget debate to date has been concerned with Members on this side of the House congratulating the Minister on the recognition of financial reality within the State and Members on the other side of the House saying the exact opposite to what <Col N="428" /> their colleagues stated in this House for a period of four years during the lifetime of the last Government.  Like everyone else in my party I welcome the fact that the Government have recognised the financial realities and the need to reduce the current budget deficit.  They have recognised the need for realism in the area of public pay settlements.  At least to date they have given vocal expression to that recognition but whether they implement much of what they have been talking about remains to be seen.  Economists outside this House and political commentators have talked of the fact that the Government are now taking the tough decisions.  Leaving aside some of the mistakes made on individual issues, from the point of view of the economic well-being of the State they have welcomed generally the approach articulated by the Minister for Finance in the budget debate.</P>
      <P>What has been ignored largely to date, except for the purpose of the odd political side-swipe, is that if the approach now taken by the party opposite had been taken during the preceding four years many of the financial difficulties the State is currently experiencing could have been tackled more effectively.  I was not part of the previous Government.  I was a member of the major party in that Government.  I am prepared to accept, on occasion, that that Government made mistakes just as, no doubt, Members opposite will accept that while in Opposition, on occasion Fianna Fáil made mistakes. The mistakes which the Fianna Fáil Party made in Opposition were of a nature so astounding and so culpable in the light of the current approach taken by them in Government that they deserve a further comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a period of four years when the previous Government were in office Fianna Fáil, as the main Opposition party, said from this side of the House that stringent financial measures were not necessary and that income tax reliefs could be provided.  They encouraged and assisted every interest group in the State who were making demands on the public finances to heighten those demands and <Col N="429" /> to put pressure on the Government to capitulate to financial demands many of which they are now saying cannot be met. They stirred the political pot to a degree which I would regard as politically unacceptable in the light of the acceptance of the state of our economic plight.  For four years Fianna Fáil in Opposition sought to undermine the economic policies which the then Government were seeking to implement so as to bring about economic recovery.  They used every ploy and every tactic, when in Opposition, to do that. We do not have to look too far to look at individual interest groups who were encouraged by Fianna Fáil to so behave. They were manipulated and used by the Fianna Fáil Party to undermine the economic policies of the previous Government and to get Fianna Fáil Government with no regard being had to the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>An interest group worth referring to in this context are the teachers and the teachers' unions.  In this House we all know the history of the teacher's pay claims.  I am not going to refight old battles with the teachers' unions.  We know that the previous Government took a view, in the context of the parlous state of our economy and the level of the current budget deficit, that people should not be put to paying a greater sum by way of income tax than they were paying.  The Government took the view that the State finances could not meet the arbitration award which was made in favour of the teachers.  There followed a massive public campaign on behalf of the teachers' unions which was supported by Fianna Fáil both inside and outside this House.  It was led by people who are card carrying members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were in positions of leadership in some of the teachers' unions and who used their position to manipulate teachers into carrying out industrial action and holding public meetings which were designed to do one thing.  They were not designed to protect the position of teachers. They were not designed to further increase the excellence of the Irish educational system.  They were designed and organised to undermine the economic <Col N="430" /> policies of the previous Government and to create a political situation whereby Fianna Fáil would be returned to Government.</P>
    <P>What has happened since is quite clear from the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance and the position taken by the Minister for Education.  The various demands made by the teachers' unions, supported by Fianna Fáil in this House less than 12 months ago, are now not acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Party, they are going to be resisted and will be opposed.  They will be opposed because Fianna Fáil accept now that the economic conditions cannot sustain the type of expenditure on the public finances that the demands on the teachers' unions would seek to force.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election the teachers' unions sought support from Members of this House for their £75 million outstanding wage claim.  Individual teachers sought commitments from candidates to pay the £1,800 alleged registered debt due in back pay claims.  I wonder how many Members elected to this House to represent the Fianna Fáil Party signed letters to individual constituents who were teachers promising to provide the £1,800 registered debt and promising that if Fianna Fáil got into Government the £75 million outstanding on the arbitration award would be met? Why is it that at least one person in a position of leadership, if not more, in one of the major teachers' unions happens to be an adviser to the Minister for Education? Is it merely a coincidence that that particular union in the weeks leading up to the general election encouraged teachers to hold public meetings in schools in constituencies throughout the country to pillory Members of the Government parties for their failure to meet demands made by those unions?</P>
    <P>Where are the meetings since the election? What public meeting has been held in any school organised by the INTO, ASTI or the TUI seeking to make demands on public representatives because of the Government adhering to the policy adopted by the previous <Col N="431" /> Government with reference to vice-principals? Where are the public meetings being held by teachers calling on Deputies and other public representatives to seek renewed commitment to their pay demands?  Where are the postcards?  I do not want to re-fight the battle with the teachers.  Many members of the teaching profession were led up the garden path by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition and they truly believed the promises made to them.  They went along with the nod and the wink routine which was carried out in the interest of political expediency and were genuinely of the view that the previous Government were not dealing properly with the economic problems and in some way had picked out the teachers for persecution, because that was the perception that Fianna Fáil, in Opposition painted.  Of course the reality is different and many of them now realise that in fact steps taken by the previous Government were not taken out of malice and were not taken because there was a failure to recognise the heavy burden placed on teachers in the job they do, but were taken out of economic necessity.</P>
    <P>Any Government who had funds available to them and in circumstances where the financial state of the country was not such as to make wage claims of the nature processed by the teachers unpayable, would pay those moneys but what Fianna Fáil did when in Opposition was to take groups like the teachers, to heighten their expectations as to what was achievable and to manipulate and use them.  They used teachers' unions to manipulate the previous Government and undermine the economic policies that that Government sought to implement.  The majority of those policies are now implemented by Fianna Fáil in Government.</P>
    <P>This raise an issue we have not yet debated in this House on this budget, that is the issue of political integrity.  There is within the context of the parliamentary process a role to be played by the Opposition and a role to be played by the Government of the day, and the Opposition have a duty to oppose actions taken by the Government where they believe <Col N="432" /> such actions are wrong and to tease out actions taken by the Government where they think such actions may be correct, but believe they require clarification. However, the Opposition have a duty to the country not to undermine actions taken by the Government, action which the Opposition know are in the interests of the country.  They have a duty not to mislead the electorate into believing the Opposition hold views which in fact they do not hold.  In effect, during the course of the last four years, the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition, as they did during the course of the general election campaign, lied to those people who voted for them to put them into government.  They falsely misled the electorate as to what the policies of that party would be in government and deliberately sought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To avoid creating disorder in the House I would be happy to say that Fianna Fáil misled the people they were talking to.  They misled them to a gross extent and this had a debilitating effect on the Government in the conduct of financial policy and in resolving many of the economic problems that still remain to be resolved.  That effect can be seen in other areas as well.  For example, how many local authorities dominated by Fianna Fáil members &mdash; certainly this applies to the two in Dublin, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council &mdash; in 1986 at the behest of members of <Col N="433" /> Fianna Fáil passed motions abolishing water or other charges which the local authority had previously held to be necessary in order to provide basic local services? How many candidates representing Fianna Fáil in the local government elections in 1985 knocked on doors telling people that these charges were not necessary, and that if Fianna Fáil candidates were elected to local authorities, such charges would be abolished? How many members of Fianna Fáil in local authorities at successive local authority meetings throughout the country stated that the funding for local authority services should be provided through central government and that there was no question of local charges being necessary? How many criticised central government in 1986 for not making good the moneys that would be lost to the individual local authorities, of which they were members, if such charges were abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we have a situation whereby Fianna Fáil, because of their actions while in Opposition considerably hampered, if not rendered it impossible, for local authorities to collect much of the moneys due by way of local charges and which were necessary to provide basic local services.  The action taken by managers in local authorities to seek to recoup payments of moneys due from charges which had been made in 1984 and 1985 was undermined.  Where are we as a result of this budget?  Local authorities throughout the country find that their allocations from central government this year are reduced.  Within Dublin city and county, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin Corporation are in a state of crisis because of the reduction in funding from central government.  Dublin County Council, a local authority designed and provided to cover the entire area of local administration in the county which is the fastest growing area in western Europe, find their budgetary allocation cut by this Government by 15 per cent, a reduction of £6 million on the sum made available to Dublin County Council last year by the previous Government.  What is going <Col N="434" /> to happen now on Dublin County Council? What are those councillors who abolished local charges going to do when Dublin County Council seek to agree their Estimates?  That local authority have in the past few weeks had to raise a loan of £6 million, so that they can simply continue to function.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that in office the party who sought to tell people that services could be maintained, that local charges were not necessary, that they paid their income tax and that all the funds required by local authorities should be provided by central government, have cut dramatically the capital allocations and financial allocations to local authorities. Within the city and county of Dublin there will be one of two choices: either local charges are raised or services are considerably reduced and staff are laid off and rendered unemployed.  In this context we are not talking just about temporary staff, we are talking about the possibility of local authorities throughout the country having to make some of their own staff redundant for the first time in the history of this State.  Legal consequences could result from that apart from the personal and major difficulties that could be created for people placed at risk in that context.</P>
    <P>On Dublin Corporation the Fianna Fáil councillors are playing a game with the general public.  They are pretending presently, for the sake of their own political face, that they are not in favour of local charges, knowing absolutely that in the event of local charges not being adopted by the corporation, corporation services will collapse.  That is the party of honesty and integrity in the area of economic policy, the party who, when in Opposition sought to undermine the ability of local authorities to collect funds independently, free of central government, to provide local services that were required.  This is the same party who, when in Opposition, sought to encourage different interest groups who are paid through the public sector to press demands which that party knew to be unrealistic and which they now tell us they are resisting.  Is it any wonder that <Col N="435" /> the credibility of politicians is so low when people observe politicians behaving in that way?</P>
    <P>While I welcome the late conversion of the Government to the economic realities of the current plight of the State, I deplore the absence of any real political honesty or integrity in their behaviour during their years in Opposition.  And I still wait to see how they are going to explain to the people who elected them the reason for that conversion and the reason why each member of that party during the course of a general election effectively made a presentation to those who voted for them which was not the correct view and the honest view of what they were going to do.  I would have a great deal more respect for them if they had laid it on the line to the teachers and to other groups that they were not going to meet their claim if elected to Government and had not sought to manipulate them in the way they were manipulated during the course of those years.</P>
    <P>What about other areas, the area of health?  We have had in the past few days a very clear indicator of the impact on our health services of the policies that are now to be implemented.  It is extraordinary that the man who is now Minister for Health and who was accusing the previous Government 12 months ago of trying to demolish the health services is now seeking to implement some policies that the previous Government regarded as unacceptable when in Government. This is even more extraordinary when you realise the extent to which Fianna Fáil dominated the health boards in 1985 and 1986 and sought to create enormous difficulties for the Department of Health when that Department sought to control the expenditure of the health boards.  We have heard the Minister on television talking about the fact that health boards have raised overdraft facilities in previous years in order to maintain services and that each health board have commitments now to repay debts that this Government want to see discharged during this year.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Health has not <Col N="436" /> yet publicly told the people is that nearly all of those health boards who raised those loans have a majority of Fianna Fáil members who deliberately engaged in what I would describe as health board politics to undermine the fiscal and financial controls which the previous Government sought to impose on health boards to ensure, first, that health boards did not overspend and kept within their financial parameters and, secondly, to ensure that within those parameters full and proper services were provided.  The level of cuts which this Government are now seeking to implement in the area of health and some of the steps that have been taken would not have been necessary if the Fianna Fáil-dominated health boards had behaved properly and responsibly, aware of the financial realities during 1985 and 1986.  It is time that was acknowledged, recognised and accepted and that we stopped playing politics with the health boards in a way that undermines the health services to a dramatic degree.  What about the other promises that were made in the area of tax?</P>

All we needed was to have Fianna Fáil in Government and, like the market gardener, they would sprinkle their few seeds on the paths and all of a sudden all our problems would be solved, we would all be going for growth, jobs would be provided and tax reliefs would be implemented.</P>

They cannot be assured that the current Government will not renege on another commitment made when in Opposition, namely, that they would not abolish mortgage interest relief altogether.  I wonder whether the reduction in mortgage interest relief this year is simply the initial step.  The Government may have decided to take off a couple of hundred pounds in the first year and see how many people shout.  Perhaps next year they will take off another few hundred pounds and eventually abolish mortgage interest relief altogether.</P>

      <P>Is this the first step along the road to abolishing mortgage interest relief?  Is this a once-off?  Will the allowance be reduced further next year?  Can people who are committed to make mortgage repayments rely on the Government to ensure that next year there will not be a further reduction in the interest allowance? Of course, Fianna Fáil in Opposition were not going to abolish mortgage interest relief or reduce it.  They were going to provide tax equity and reduce everyone's tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What else in this budget casts considerable doubt on the credibility of the party opposite and their intentions?  I recall many occasions during the past four years when Members opposite raised the <Col N="438" /> need for new and better school facilities, pressing individual cases to ensure that the capital building programme would not only be maintained but increased. They criticised the previous Government for not providing even greater finance than was provided.  It now appears that this Government are intent on sabotaging the school building programme.  In saying this, I am not making an idle allegation or raising a hare for party political reasons.  I am relying on replies I received yesterday to Dáil Questions with reference to three particular schools in my own constituency, which no doubt are a microcosm of what is happening throughout the country in respect of the school building programme.  We know that in this budget £100 million has been wiped off capital expenditure.  We are not quite sure exactly what is to be affected but it appears that the education area will be one of those most affected.  There are three particular schools to which I will refer briefly since I intend on another occasion to raise the matter in the House.</P>
    <P>Whitechurch national school is a Church of Ireland school in South Dublin which caters for an increasing and growing population of Church of Ireland children. It is currently sited in a dilapidated building, grossly overcrowded with totally inadequate facilities.  Rats occasionally appear running across the floor. Under the previous Government all the preliminary steps for the provision of a new school were taken.  Tenders for the work were received in November 1986 and were sent to the Department of Education. Sanction was expected in this school year for the building of a new school, which the Department had recognised was not merely necessary but essential and in respect of which the school had already acquired the site.</P>
    <P>Sanction to commence building was expected from the new Government, of whatever political persuasion, but the school is now in a state of crisis.  In reply to a Dáil Question yesterday, the Minister stated that no funding will be made available during this financial year for the building of this school.  I do not know why the Minister has picked out this particular <Col N="439" /> school in this way.  It is a Church of Ireland school and the parents have no alternative Church of Ireland school within a reasonable distance to which they can send their children.</P>
    <P>The second school, which is also a Church of Ireland school, is Rathfarnham national school.  It currently has sufficient children to accommodate ten teachers within the Department of Education's regulations.  It will have in excess of 300 children in the educational year beginning in September 1987.  Tenders for the building of a large new extension have been approved and now only await sanction to sign contracts for the building of the extension.</P>
    <P>It was expected that the new Government would give the necessary sanction, following the budget, to allow contracts to be signed and building work to commence, but, it is clear from the reply I received yesterday in the House that no such sanction will be forthcoming this year.  Within one constituency there are two Church of Ireland schools that are grossly over-crowded and have children accommodated in inadequate facilities. A portion of the Rathfarnham parish school is so suspect that when snow comes in the winter the school has to be vacated in case the roof falls in on the pupils.  It has been acknowledged that in the case of one area a new school is required while in the other area a major extension is needed.  It was expected that sanction would be given for both projects out of this year's financial allocation following the election of the new Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister for Education has decided that work should not proceed on those schools.  The Minister suggested that funds are not available but I am aware that more than £6 million is available in her Department that could be utilised to provide the facilities that Rathfarnham parish school requires and the new school required at Whitechurch.  I wonder if anyone in Fianna Fáil in the course of the general election campaign indicated to people in the Dublin South constituency that if they were returned to office those schools <Col N="440" /> would not be built.  I wonder why Church of Ireland children who need proper school facilities, who have a constitutional right to a primary education, should be deprived by the Government of proper and adequate school facilities. There is no alternative school for those children to attend.</P>
    <P>I should like to give another example of what I am talking about in the area of education.  I can recall that during the lifetime of the previous Government Members suggested that that Government might not be committed to the building of a community school in Knocklyon in my constituency.  Such a school is badly needed.  All the preliminary work on that project had been completed and the former Government promised that it would open in September 1988.  Successive Governments, of different political persuasions, made commitments to that project.  Yesterday I received a reply from the Minister for Education which made it clear that not only will building not commence this year but that there is no possibility of the school opening in September 1988.  It is questionable if the school will ever open.  Will the Minister for Education tell the House if a commitment by a previous administration to provide a school in Knocklyon is no longer applicable?  Will that school be built?  What will the community in Knocklyon do with its huge young population if the school project does not proceed?</P>
    <P>The party who talked about the need for greater capital expenditure in the area of education are not only reducing it beyond an amount never previously contemplated but are effectively preventing the building of new schools that are badly needed, and nobody can deny that.  While as a general approach we may accept and applaud the Government for recognising finally the financial realities of the State we must point out that they are adopting measures in some areas that are very questionable.  They are undermining, and have considerably undermined, the integrity of all Members of the House.  It used be said that generally speaking one could not rely on what politicians said about <Col N="441" /> anything and the Government, in their approach in the last four years, and in their conversion in recent weeks, have shown how true that saying is.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the 35 per cent withholding tax included in the Minister's budget proposals.  The Minister said this provision was being introduced in the interests of tax equity and referred to the fact that it would put individuals in the same position as those in the PAYE sector.  It is clear that, in making the announcement about the withholding tax, the Minister had no idea about the implications of the tax, how it will be implemented, the effects it will have.  It appears that he was unaware, or ignorant, of how an ordinary business operates in respect of those he envisages will be affected by this tax.  The tax appears to be based on an assumption that, if the person carries out work of a consultancy nature for the State, that person is an individual, is self employed, paying no overheads, employing no staff, with virtually no outgoings and who on any fee received from a State body is receiving a fee that is purely profit.  There are very few who could be said to come within that category.  We await to see whether the tax will be included in the Finance Bill and I wonder whether the Minister is still as committed to the tax as he was on budget day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to hear from a Member on the Government side if the tax will emerge in the Finance Bill in its original form or if it will be considerably modified.  I suspect that if it appears at all it will be in a considerably modified form.  The reason is that the possibility of this tax taking effect as and from 6 June has resulted in a big number of firms issuing protective notices to employees because they believe the implementation of that tax will render their businesses financially unviable. There are many chartered quantity surveyors, consulting engineers and a plethora of other firms and organisations who see the tax as a crude measure that will <Col N="442" /> render it financially impossible for them to continue to operate.</P>
      <P>The tax seems to pre-suppose that all those in receipt of payments directly from Government Departments, local authorities or health boards fall into the category of self employed people and that their taxes are not paid on a current or PAYE basis.  There are organisations and businesses operating, for example, in the consultancy field which are established as normal trading companies within which the principals, directors or owners act in the capacity of employees of the company. In those circumstances such individuals pay income tax on a current or PAYE basis.  Company profits, if any, are taxed in the normal way with the difference that there is a surcharge of 10 per cent on any profits which are not distributed.  It should also be noted that in some companies distributions, if any, over and above normal salaries of principals or directors or owners are made by way of directors' fees, thus attracting immediate tax liability also on a current or PAYE basis.  Many of the consultancy firms I am referring to are major commercial undertakings in their own right, operating in markets inside and outside the State, giving considerable employment and requiring a high degree of management skill to achieve the fine balances between income, expenditure, cash flow, charges and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the balance of expenditure currently that the position of the construction industry is heavily dependent on the public capital sector.  Many firms in the construction industry are placed at serious risk by the proposal envisaged by the Minister for Finance. That proposal will create major problems. It is inequitable and unfair and it will impose an intolerable burden by way of cash flow on a great many companies and will result in them seeking additional financial facilities from banks and incurring unnecessary interest, ultimately making themselves financially unable to operate.  Construction consultancy firms are particularly placed at risk by this proposal. That is ironic considering that Fianna Fáil in Opposition proposed that <Col N="443" /> they would inject an additional £200 million into the construction industry and presented themselves as the saviours of that industry and all those who work in and for it.</P>

If that does not take place and if without further delay the Minister for Finance does not clarify his intentions with regard to this tax, jobs will be lost that we can ill afford to lose.  Firms who seem currently to be financially viable will go out of business. I call on the Minister at this stage to intervene, if not in this debate as he has already spoken and must await the winding up of the debate, prior to publication of the Finance Bill which is some weeks away and which will be published very close to 6 June, the date on which it was proposed this tax would apply.  I urge him to clarify the manner in which it is envisaged this tax will work.  How is it to work?  How will credits be given?  At what stage will a company be able to reclaim moneys?</P>

      <P>What gap will there be from the time an application is made to reclaim moneys withheld until those moneys are provided?  Is this not effectively a financial dodge to require firms operating properly in business, completing their tax returns promptly, providing a service to the Government and Government bodies, to make in a sense an <i>ex gratia</i> loan to the Government to enable the Government to conduct the business of Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will any interest be repayable to those firms on the moneys withheld between the time they are withheld and when they are paid back to those firms if it is accepted that there is no reason for those <Col N="444" /> moneys being held?  What will be the criteria applicable to determine when an application for repayment should be granted and when it should not be granted?  Will it depend on someone in the Revenue Commission confirming that company accounts are in order and up to date, or will it depend on someone in the Revenue Commission confirming that all tax payments had been made up to date?  What happens if a tax assessment is subject to appeal?  Will a repayment of withholding tax wait for determination until some appellant decision is made? How is it to interact with the other taxes in particular where a firm establish that all of their directors receive only a salary and that they all pay PAYE?  When that happens, on what basis can there be justification for ever withholding 35 per cent of the fees properly earned by that firm which that firm need to utilise to discharge their overheads and pay the wages payable to their employees?</P>
    <P>What will happen to a firm who indicate to the State that they are not in a position to pay in full the sum due by way of PAYE by 30 April in some financial year or cannot make all their PRSI payments because the money they utilise to make those payments is withheld under the withholding tax and they are awaiting receipt of money due to them under that tax before they can make payments?  It seems that this tax has opened a Pandora's box of complexity in the tax area which, if not clarified very shortly, will place many businesses at serious risk.  It is creating a great deal of worry for many people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have now been served with protective notice and see their jobs clearly at risk and do not know what is to happen to them and their families from 6 June.  Therefore, I call on the Minister either outside this House or within it, well before the publication of the Finance <Col N="445" /> Bill, to clarify the manner in which this tax will be implemented and the legal criteria under the proposed Finance Bill that will be applicable with reference to this tax.</P>
      <P>The party of tax equity indicated in Opposition that they would ensure that all paid their fair share of tax.  Many people living in urban areas who regard themselves as burdened by the sum they have to pay by way of taxation, be they self employed or in the PAYE sector, welcomed the measures taken by the previous Government in providing a land tax to ensure that tax evasion within the agricultural sector was minimised and to ensure a proper return by way of tax from the farming community.  Many people regard it as equitable that a land tax should be introduced, particularly having regard to the gigantic financial investment by this State and by every taxpayer in the State in the agricultural sector. Apparently the party of tax equity have now taken the decision that the land tax is to be abolished.  I am still awaiting a detailed explanation to the PAYE sector as to why that is the case.</P>
      <P>I am still wondering what has happened to the trade unions who were yelling for a tax of this nature during the lifetime of the previous Government and who welcomed it.  I am amazed at their silence on the abolition of the land tax by the present Government.  Is that an issue the trade union movement will raise with the Government during the discussions that are apparently to take place and are taking place to work out some co-operative economic policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that any party who have talked about tax equity would come into this House and in one fell swoop in a budget statement announce the abolition of a tax that was to ensure a degree of tax equity that did not exist until that legislation was passed through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about other areas which have direct relation to the budget. <Col N="446" /> I have made reference already to the mortgage tax allowance and what happened there and to the greater imposition on young people that will arise as a result of this budget because of the reduction in the mortgage interest allowance.  Many of the actions taken by the previous Government were designed to ease the position of people in the purchase and acquisition of houses, to reduce the levels of expenditure incurred by them and to provide incentives to people to purchase their own houses rather than rely on the local authority housing system which costs the State so much.  In respect of that many people are living in local authority houses who require a leg up to get into the private housing sector and are pleased to get such a leg up.</P>
    <P>Two separate actions were taken in different areas by the previous Government. One related to the various subsidies and allowances made available with reference both to the surrendering of local authority houses and the acquisition of houses in the private sector by people residing in local authority houses.  The other was the financial measures designed to assist the construction industry by providing various grants for the carrying out of various house improvements.  Other measures also were taken in the context of building societies to ensure that the societies did not abuse their dominant position in the market or require charges or payments to be made by people borrowing money from them who were dependent on the societies and on getting a loan from them to acquire a house.  It seems that this Government are less than enthusiastic about seeking to enforce the building society legislation passed through this House and which sought to ease the financial position of people and to provide them with some protection against the dominant and domineering attitude taken by many building societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment to what has <Col N="447" /> taken place in the past few weeks in this area, something in respect of which there appears to be little or no public comment to date and which poses a direct challenge to Government and to the commitment of this Government in enforcing the building society legislation.  That legislation was designed to ensure that couples buying houses could not be subjected to duplication in regard to legal fees.  It was designed to ensure that if people employed solicitors to whom they paid fees for the acquisition of their homes they should not also be required to pay legal fees incurred by a building society for carrying out legal work on behalf of a building society.  It was never logical and could never be defended that a couple purchasing a house and requiring a loan should have to pay legal fees in duplicate.  It was something forced on people dependent on building society loans by building societies, because it suited them, and people could not oppose the approach they were taking.  Despite the passage of that legislation and the spirit of that legislation, a number of building societies are abusing their position and are not complying with the legislation. Currently, the Educational Building Society requires a legal fee of £80 plus VAT to be paid by any person to whom they make a home loan.  The First National Building Society requires a fee of between 1 to 2 per cent of the loan they provide and the Irish Permanent Building Society requires a legal fee of between 1 to 3 per cent of the loan.  The approaches taken by these societies are in flagrant breach of legislation.  They seek to undermine that legislation.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment have a duty to bring it to the attention of the societies that these fees should not be charged and are not lawfully enforceable.  I urge the Minister to take any action he deems necessary to seek an explanation and a justification from those societies as to why they are charging those fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As and from 27 March 1987 the £5,000 housing grant was withdrawn, as were the entitlements to the various improvement <Col N="448" /> grants.  The manner in which the £5,000 surrender grant was withdrawn is probably illegal, is probably challengeable in the courts, and is politically questionable. I do not understand why in a budget delivered on 31 March 1987 these grants were cut back as at 27 March 1987.  It would be quite proper and usual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Has the Minister for Finance taken any steps through contracts with local authorities to ascertain how many people signed contracts for the purchase of new houses on 30 March 1987 expecting to be able to rely on the £5,000 surrender grant?  Will the Minister for the Environment clarify the circular letter of 16 April 1987 which was sent to all local authorities with reference to the surrender grant, when he referred to the fact that applications on hand for which certificates of provisional approval had not issued on or before 27 March should also be further processed where the applicant satisfied the local authority that on or before that date he had entered into legal binding commitments on foot of a legitimate expectation of receiving the grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any decent lawyer acting on behalf of a couple purchasing a house would make it a condition of the contract that they would only be bound by the terms of the contract upon a grant they were relying <Col N="449" /> on being approved.  If one signed a contract in October 1986, in September 1986 or even in August 1986 subject to that condition, if for some reason an approval was not yet forthcoming and one was waiting to purchase a house, it would seem that if there was a condition in that contract which stated that it was subject to this grant being made available that contract will no longer be enforceable. There is now considerable confusion in local authorities.  Those people who signed contracts assuming that they would get these grants without any conditions and who could be regarded as behaving legally irresponsibly will benefit under this circular and those people who behaved legally responsibly will be discriminated against under the terms of the circular.  There is an urgent necessity for the Minister to clarify what approach must be taken by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the trade union movement and the discussions taking place with the Government, in the light of much of what has been said by the ICTU and the leading people in the unions represented by the ICTU, it seems that the ICTU need to clarify exactly their position in the context of tackling the two major problems which face us, the level of the current budget deficit and unemployment. In recent years the unions have been more intent on seeking to get increases in wages for their union members than in seeking to protect the position of the unemployed by agreeing with Government that policies be implemented which may result in lesser wage claims being made or which may result in it being agreed that no increases in wages will take place, certainly in the public sector, over a period of years in return for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>There is a direct correlation between unreasonable wage claims or an insistence on maintaining a particular wage claim and the provision of alternative employment.  Politicians, Governments and unions have a duty to take economic measures which are primarily designed to create employment and that area should have a priority over and above any wage claim that may be made by any individual <Col N="450" /> group in any sector.  The behaviour of the unions to date gives rise to considerable concern that whereas they seek to pretend they are representing the unemployed in the creation of employment, all too often actions taken by unions have not ensured additional employment but have brought firms to a close, have resulted in the loss of jobs, and all too often wage claims of an unreasonable nature have been pressed and have decimated small country towns and brought to an end major industries on which those towns relied.</P>
    <P>A microcosm of the approach taken by unions has been seen in the Dublin area where unions which have members in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have effectively stopped the management of Dublin Corporation and the management of Dublin County Council from fully utilising the social employment scheme and creating at least temporary jobs for many of those people who have long been on the unemployment register and who wish to obtain such jobs and get work experience and who, instead of being on the dole, could make a real contribution to the provision of social services.  For the past 18 months trade unions have prevented the creation of jobs in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  They have sought to sabotage the social employment scheme which the previous Government provided and which now appears to have the support of the present Government, although when in Opposition they questioned the validity of this scheme.  No union can properly defend taking action which prevents the creation of new jobs be they full time or temporary.  I would hope that, in the discussions the Government are having with the unions, the full support of the ICTU will be sought for the social employment scheme and that all the difficulties that have been created for local authorities utilising the provisions of those schemes to provide additional employment within their areas will be eliminated.</P>

      <P>It must be clear to all of us that if this country is to make real progress in the future all our efforts must be concentrated on the pursuit of real and sustained economic growth.  This is the only way in which we can get our people back to productive employment vital for the country at large.</P>
      <P>In our first budget we all have shown our willingness to begin the serious task of battling with the many problems besetting our country and which inhibit the expansion of our economy.  Clearly it is necessary to restore confidence in the economy.  This can be done only by making the type of decisive start initiated in our 1987 budget.  In so doing it is known where Fianna Fáil stand on the task before them in the next few years, especially the need to set specific targets in terms of our budget deficit and to adhere rigidly to them.  In the short period of time since they have assumed office Fianna Fáil have demonstrated that they are not content with merely balancing the books but are availing of the opportunity to take several initiatives to begin the process whereby our economy can be shaken out of its deep slumber of the last few years.  The reduction in interest rates, forecast for later in the year and which has already begun, will, we hope, have a significant impact in encouraging capital investment in industry, leading to increased output, thereby helping to stimulate further economic recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiatives recently announced by the Government to extend the national gas grid to Dundalk, to pursue diligently the redevelopment of the Port and Docks site and the establishment of a financial services centre on the site serve to demonstrate clearly this Government's commitment to stimulating job creation in an effort to get more and more of our people back to work.  Once we have provided for our needs in natural gas requirements I hope that the Minister for Energy and Communications will establish contact <Col N="452" /> with the Northern Ireland authorities at an early date with a view to opening negotiations for the sale of natural gas to Northern Ireland.  It is unfortunate that previous attempts by the Coalition Government to sell this source of energy to Northern Ireland &mdash; which would obviously be of benefit to our economy&mdash; ended in failure.  In view of the acknowledged large amounts of natural gas deposits off our southern coast it would be of considerable benefit to our economy if we could become an energy exporter.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his decisive action to deal with the gross abuse of cross-Border traffic which has been going on for many years. Deputy D. Ahern, who represents a Border constituency gave the House graphic details of the effects on the economy of those regions of this cross-Border traffic.  He was able to demonstrate clearly the effects of the decision of the Minister for Finance in relation to the changes proposed in regard to cross-Border traffic and trade.  Indeed the devastation of this trade has put a whole area along the Border in the doldrums in recent years.  There was the Iudicrous situation in which, on the northern side of the Border, development of shopping facilities went on at a very substantial rate in recent years while simultaneously, on the southern side, shop after shop closed down.  The Dundalk situation is a case in point and has been referred to already by Deputy D. Ahern.  All of us have acknowledged that something had to be done to deal with this very difficult situation.  I would have to pose the question of why the Coalition did not or were unable to act on the matter.  It will be remembered that Coalition Deputies raised this problem repeatedly here and elsewhere, apparently without success. The Minister has indicated that his most recent action will boost our economy by something in the region of £300 million and £400 million annually.  That is the value of the trade calculated to have been lost across the Border annually.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very difficult climate in which we find ourselves, this <Col N="453" /> budget has very positive features.  For example, at a cost of £19 million, it has been possible to increase all weekly payments of social welfare by 3 per cent, bringing those increases forward to mid-July next.  This is a distinct improvement on the proposals contained in the Fine Gael budget which had not anticipated introducing such increases until November next.  The extension of dental and optical treatment benefits to dependent spouses of insured workers &mdash; sought for many years &mdash; will be welcomed by all. Fianna Fáil's commitment to achieving that extension as quickly as possible on assuming office will be realised in October 1987.  It is right and proper that this should happen.  I should like to mention also the considerable improvements in the family income supplement scheme. Like the social welfare changes, these will come into effect in July next.  Fianna Fáil have always attempted to help the poor and weaker sections of our community. Notwithstanding the prevailing difficult economic climate in which we find ourselves this budget ensures the continuance of this trend.</P>
    <P>Recognising the very difficult economic and financial situation obtaining the Minister for Health has very wisely taken the view that the health services should not be allowed to deteriorate through the necessary limitation of State funding. Therefore he has decided to propose alternative methods for their financing through the imposition of charges for certain services.  Some confusion has arisen with regard to these charges.  I believe that when their details are explained they will be found to be much more acceptable than might appear to be the case at first glance.  The Minister has very humanely created categories of people who will be excluded from both out-patient and inpatient charges.  He has specifically stated that it was the particular concern of the Government that these charges should be applied only to those who could afford to pay them.  Special care was taken by the Government to ensure that the most needy and vulnerable in our society would be excluded.  When the Minister has had an opportunity to examine the <Col N="454" /> operation of the health services in greater detail I hope he will address himself to the under-utilisation of certain resources within the health services.  In passing I might mention the case of Cheeverstown House in Templeogue which has received very considerable funding from the Exchequer, at present accommodating numbers of mentally and physically handicapped people far below its real potential.</P>
    <P>Representing the constituency of Dublin South-West, which includes Tallaght and Clondalkin, I particularly welcome the restoration of career guidance posts by the Minister for Education.  With the huge numbers of young people attending schools in these areas the position of a career guidance teacher has been rendered especially important.  It is accepted by those in the educational sector that the proposal in the Fine Gael budget to abolish these posts would have led to very severe difficulties, particularly in deprived and disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Our national debt has doubled from £12 billion to £25.4 billion in the four years since 1982.  If this country were to continue the same rate of borrowing our national debt could well reach £35 billion by 1990.  For example, the servicing of the national debt in 1985 cost more than the total receipts of tax from the PAYE sector.  Given the deterioration in the state of our public finances in recent years we must have the courage to face up to the essential and difficult tasks lying immediately ahead.  The time has passed when we should continue to mess about with our future.  We should remember that our future has been mortgaged, not once but twice or three times.  What we are now attempting to do is guarantee our children's future.</P>

      <P>A special committee, chaired by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, TD is preparing Ireland's response to the invitation from the Australian Government to participate in their bicentenary celebrations in 1988.</P>
      <P>Irish people have made a remarkable contribution over two centuries towards the development of Australia, about one-third of whose population is now of Irish descent.  I am convinced that the resulting ties of friendship between Ireland and Australia will be further reinforced by the active participation which the Government are planning in the celebrations. I regret that I am not in a position at this stage to say whether an official visit by me to Australia will form part of the programme of official projects which we are planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the number of people living in Australia who are of Irish descent is higher, as a percentage of total population, than that of any other country?  Is he further aware that until comparatively recently two-thirds of the Government of New South Wales were of Irish descent? I think it is about a half at present.  Would the Taoiseach consider that a visit by the Prime Minister of this country to Australia might assist this country in developing ties there which would be beneficial to our economy?</P>

      <P>I assure the Taoiseach that it probably would help this country. Given the number of leading office holders of Irish descent, and the natural goodwill there is for this country in Australia even in such places as Federal State Parliaments, the High Court, and so on, would the Taoiseach consider that developing ties with Australia, a democratic and consumerist society, would be not just mutually beneficial but particularly beneficial to this country?  Will the Taoiseach actively pursue the development of good relations with Australia?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government intend to take any initiative in the United Nations or in any other forum to encourage and foster progress on multilateral nuclear disarmament; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was the case with Fianna Fáil Governments over the years, the present Government are determined to play the active and constructive role in matters relating to disarmament which Ireland, as a neutral country, should be <Col N="457" /> playing, in particular in the area of nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>The Government are following with great interest developments in the arms control dialogue between the US and the Soviet Union.  We are encouraged by the progress in these discussions and hope they can be marked by agreement in the near future.</P>
      <P>While Ireland is neither directly nor indirectly involved in the dialogue we welcome its comprehensive nature and the prospects which it holds of agreement, for the first time, in reducing the numbers of nuclear weapons of the super powers.</P>
      <P>The elimination by both sides of intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe, which is an area in the super power dialogue where agreement seems closest, would represent a welcome step in reversing the nuclear arms race and in easing tensions generally.  The Government hope, however, that the elimination of such weapons in Europe would represent but a first step in eliminating all nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the current focus in the area of arms control and disarmament is in the bilateral field.  Nonetheless, we remain deeply conscious of the importance of the multilateral dialogue in the United Nations framework which is where Ireland has the opportunity to make its principal and distinctive contribution and where we have played a positive and constructive role through the years.  We are planning full and active participation in the forthcoming conference on the relationship between disarmament and development in August-September, in the Autumn UN General Assembly and in particular in the Third Special Session on Disarmament which is scheduled to take place in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Taoiseach in June 1982 I addressed the Second Special Session on Disarmament in New York.  I put forward on that occasion a five-point agenda on which I believed the nuclear powers needed to take urgent action.  Since then there have been developments including the commencement of the talks mentioned between the super powers on <Col N="458" /> nuclear arms reductions but there has been little, if any, progress made in other areas and in particular on the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  We will constantly keep in mind, in the light of the forthcoming events and of the bilateral dialogue between the US and the USSR, what actions on our part in the multilateral arena would be worthwhile in pursuit of our goal of nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that comprehensive statement but it does not answer the question.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is taking far too relaxed an attitude to this matter to say, as he has said, that Ireland is neither directly nor indirectly involved?  Does he not agree that there has been some disquiet following his statement in the House on 22 April last to the effect that the question of disarmament is something about which we need not be concerned as long as it is clear that we are not involved?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that, given our status, it is possible for us to take initiatives that will assist both the bilateral and the multilateral dialogue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood what I said on that occasion.  Of course we are urgently interested in all disarmament issues.  Irish Governments generally have indicated a clear wish to contribute in so far as they can to disarmament efforts.  I include all Irish Governments in that.  I have taken a very keen personal interest in particular in nuclear disarmament.  What I referred to on that occasion was the question of security arrangements in the Community and the discussions which might or might not take place between the member states of the European Community about security and military matters.  I said that in so far as our Community partners wished to discuss security matters among themselves, that need not trouble us as long as it was clear that we were not involved in any such discussions of a military nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if my remarks caused any confusion in that regard.  I reiterate for <Col N="459" /> the benefit of the Deputy that the Government hope to follow in the footsteps of all previous Governments in taking any action of a constructive nature available to them in regard to disarmament generally and particularly nuclear disarmament in any fora in which we might be represented but particularly in the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is a matter of intense and immediate concern to us that discussions should be taking place concerning the number of nuclear missiles that are either sited on the Continent of which we are a part or aimed at that Continent?  Will the Taoiseach agree that we should further consider what specific steps we, as a directly interested party while not involved in any military group, might take to push that dialouge along to a conclusion that will reduce the number of missiles either located in or aimed at this Continent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I regard it as desirable that we should take any useful action available to us.  The Deputy will understand that, to be realistic about the discussions at present taking place between the super powers, we have no specific role to play in that regard except to encourage from the sidelines the efforts that are being made.  That is what I was referring to in my reply.  Apart from doing everything we can to encourage the participants in these disarmament talks to persist with them and, if possible, to succeed, I am not sure there is much else we can usefully do.  However, I think the Deputy will agree that there is a lot we can do in the United Nations forum.  In the autumn we will have an opportunity to play a part there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that it would be useful if, in the first instance, we were to consider what kind of action we might take, in his own phrase, from the sidelines and secure the necessary agreement here publicly for such action, and if, having made that <Col N="460" /> decision, we were to make it clear to other countries, both those involved in bilateral dialogue, in which I agree we cannot directly interfere, and those which are more active in the multilateral framework, in order to push them along the road on which they now seem to be prepared to start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in general agreement with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's very comprehensive reply, his deep interest in disarmament and the deep interest of the Irish people in fostering peace, would he consider instructing his ambassadors to the effect that they could offer this country as a suitable location for summit talks, be they bilateral or multilateral, in the interests of peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good suggestion and I think it has been done on occasion in the past.  I would be glad to ensure that our diplomatic service generally would make it known that we are prepared to act as host for any such discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am speaking from memory but I think it is a fact that our diplomatic service has conveyed that view from time to time.  If there was anything of that nature by which we could contribute to multilateral disarmament discussions I am sure every Member of this House would wish us to be positive in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions in this House I have indicated the position of my party and of the Government in regard to nuclear disarmament. I indicated that this is probably the most urgent single problem in the international area today.  I am not quite sure exactly what further action the Deputy would wish but I am glad to avail of this opportunity to say that this Government would be anxious to play any useful role they could at international level in regard to nuclear disarmament in particular.  Also, it would be the policy of this Government to maintain this island as a nuclear free zone and we would wish to take any action available to us with regard to the increasing meance of civil nuclear power and to do anything we could to convey our anxiety about nuclear installations.  As the Deputy will recall, this House passed unanimously a resolution in that regard and this is still the unanimous position of the Irish Parliament with regard to the nuclear menace generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if it is intended to amend existing protective legislation for employees to bring part time workers within the scope of the legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out first that in relation to much of the protective legislation administered by my Department, no distinction is made between full and part time workers.  For example, all occupational safety and health legislation &mdash; the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979 &mdash; apply to workers irrespective of the number of hours worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to other protective legislation where the number of normal working hours is a factor affecting eligibility, the Deputy will be aware that provision was made in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, to <Col N="465" /> reduce to 18 hours the threshold for qualification for the protection of the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The question of amending the threshold further continues to be kept under review, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the cost implications for employers and for the State.  I am afraid, however, that in present economic circumstances it would not be possible for me to hold out any hope that the existing threshold can be reduced in the immediate future in the light of the cost considerations involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there are in excess of 54,000 people designated as part time workers and that 90 per cent, if not more, are women.  Since late last year, many women workers have been driven into part time work as a result of the effect of the equality legislation.  Does the Minister not believe that there is an urgent need to amend the legislation so that these workers will be covered by the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and similar legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's figures are correct.  Part time workers are covered by most legislation.  Previously, a person had to work for 21 hours before becoming eligible but that was reduced two years ago to 18 hours under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  There is, quite clearly, a cost factor involved in reducing the hours and, although we would like all workers in permanent, part time jobs to be covered by legislation, it cannot be done now as employers are under considerable stress maintaining the present level of employment.  I have read many of the submissions of the trade unions in this regard and they are also very anxious that all workers should be eligible.  In regard to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, a review is taking place to see what can be done in regard to part time workers.</P>

Where it can be proved that employers are flouting the regulations and employing people for 17½ hours &mdash; I hope it is not a widespread practice &mdash; some mechanism will have to be found to stop the practice.  They are the same employers who employed people for 20½ hours when the regulations three years ago specified 21 hours.  The Department are examining the matter, not just in relation to unfair dismissals but also in regard to general legislation in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Approval was given in 1986 to Cork Corporation to employ 255 persons under the social employment <Col N="467" /> scheme.  At present 150 persons are employed.</P>
      <P>In order to remain within the budget originally allocated for the scheme in 1987, it was not possible to increase the number of participants on the corporation project.  However, as a result of the announcement about additional resources in the budget, further workers may be recruited for Cork Corporation from May onwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed under the new scheme to maintain the level of persons employed at that which applied last year?  Can the Minister assure me that 255 persons will be employed in Cork Corporation when the new scheme commences? Is the Minister aware &mdash; I am sure he is as the city manager in Cork has communicated with him &mdash; that it is imperative for the success of the scheme to have more than 200 persons employed because with fewer than that the scheme is non-viable and is not self-financing?  It is critically important that the numbers should be maintained.  Has the Minister communicated his desire to Manpower that the scheme should be maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Pending the review in May, I cannot say what the figures will be but this applies to all the Cork schemes.  Last year the quotas in some parts of the country were not taken up. The quota was calculated on the basis of the regions and the long term unemployed. Some areas did not participate; Dublin and a number of other areas opted out but they are now involved in the scheme so there is a reduction in some regions.  The highest figure in Cork was 243 in August 1985.  At the end of 1986 approval was given for 255 persons, 150 of whom are still employed.  We must try to avoid overruns in the figures for any region and, therefore, Cork will be reviewed in May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As many jobs were started during the previous year, does the Minister agree that it will be necessary to maintain the level at 250 people?  Many jobs are nearing completion and it would be money well spent to allow a quota similar to that of last year.  If he is not prepared to do this, money will have been wasted on half finished schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>The figures will be increased in the south-west region from 1,162 to 1,299.  I am sure Deputies appreciate there is a far bigger demand this year because of the success of the social employment scheme.  In the general budget the overall figures will go up by 1,500 to try to maintain an average of well over 8,000.  The interest in the scheme is far greater than the previous Minister foresaw when he set the original target of 10,000.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that CERT would not regard it as an unmitigated bonus to find themselves transferred to the Department of Tourism and Transport, that they see themselves as an integral part of the manpower and training world and that they would wish to retain their links with the Department of Labour and the other training agencies?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy gives the view of the council of CERT.  There are three options.  They can remain as an independent organisation.  At present, they are not an independent body as they are tied in with the Department of Labour.  Secondly, they could be transferred to the Department of Tourism and Transport or, thirdly, they could be linked to the new national training and <Col N="470" /> employment organisation in a formal way.  They are the three options.  I have spoken at some length with the officials of the Department and the agencies concerned. This month I attended a meeting of both the AnCO and CERT councils. There is a strong view that CERT as an independent body have been very successful. Equally, there are difficulties regarding the input made by the hotel industry to the operations of CERT.  A balance has to be struck between the two. I hope that with the co-operation of their spokesmen we will be able to finalise these arrangements in the next week or two.  I can then being back the Bill which my predecessor almost had through the House some time ago.</P>

      <P>I have outlined to the Deputy what are the three options.  The matter is under review.  I have also answered the question which the Deputy raised as regards the input of the hotel industry to the training provided by CERT.  I have raised that question with CERT.  I would have to be satisfied that there would be an increase in the level of training.  At the same time, I have to recognise that CERT as a training organisation are extremely successful.  The work they are doing for the industry is considered in all quarters to be outstanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the role which CERT are playing.  Does the Minister not think that the tourist industry is receiving preferential treatment over other industries? If other industries were to be supported in the same way, the cost would be enormous.  CERT are providing an unique service to the hotel industry and the tourist industry generally which is not available to other sections of industry.</P>

That particular body make a net contribution of £50,000 towards the running costs of CERT but in return receive a service to the value of approximately £5 million.  The real opposition to any change in the status of CERT is not, as they would loudly protest, uniquely concerned with the undoubted quality of CERT but with the extraordinary value which they themselves derive.  Could the Minister indicate if he proposes to have discussions with the Irish Hotels Federation to see if they are prepared to make a realistic contribution to match the taxpayers' contribution?</P>

I have put my views as expressed here, and the views expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan to them.  I hope that following the meeting I have had with them I will get a response.  To be quite clear about it, I do not believe that they could fully fund CERT as that would be unrealistic. What I am seeking is an increase in the contribution they make for a job which is well done by everybody in the industry.</P>

      <P>The previous Minister indicated that he had hoped to have this review completed by early 1986.  The last reply I received was on 3 December 1985 and the Minister at that time indicated that he had hoped to have the review completed by early 1986.  Presumably, the new legislation would then have been brought before us.  Can the Minister indicate what is delaying the review, whether the review has been completed or whether it is a question of the formulation of legislation?  Can he also indicate whether he intends to include a provision which will not allow dismissal for reasons of religious belief or political allegiance and that these will be specifically excluded in any new legislation he brings forward?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is correct.  A review has been going on for sometime, parts of which have been completed.  The officials of the Department and the previous Minister endeavoured as far as possible to examine the areas which were causing difficulty in order to get some agreement.  There has to be a consensus.  The main issues are well outlined in the reviews undertaken to date.  I would like to see this review reaching completion.  This is not easy as there are many difficulties as regards the legislation.  Many employers perceive this legislation as creating major difficulties and disincentives to taking on people. The previous Minister and outside interests have carried out a number of reviews to prove that that is not the case. The advice I have received is that we should bring forward a document to try to convince people that there are certain <Col N="473" /> initiatives which could be taken in protective legislation to improve the information flow.  It is my intention that during the summer the results of a number of reviews, which have been carried out both inside and outside the Department, will be brought forward in a booklet and we will seek agreement as regards what amendments should be made.  To bring forward amendments that would create further difficulties for employers would not lead to any progress.  It would be a further disincentive to employing people and would not help the people we are trying to assist.  We should be trying to create jobs.  I do not wish to do anything which will be seen to be negative.  To answer the Deputy's question, I will shortly bring forward not new legislation initially but a document which reviews the present legislation.</P>

      <P>While I accept that the Minister must try as far as possible to gain a consensus, surely he will agree that it is this House which formulates legislation?  There have been widespread demands for reform of this legislation to prevent unfair dismissal on the grounds of one's private life, religious or political beliefs.  Can the Minister indicate whether he is thinking along those lines and whether he will be including that kind of recommendation either in the discussion document he is producing or in the final legislation he may intend to bring in?  Can he also tell me if there is a proposal to reverse the situation whereby of the people who succeed in bringing a successful case for unfair dismissal the number who succeed in being re-employed by their employer is very small and the compensation they receive in many cases in no way compensates them for the loss of their jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support.  At least we are making some progress in bringing forward the booklet. The type of case the Deputy mentioned was debated in this House last year and there were a number of questions tabled on the subject.  The conclusion reached, <Col N="474" /> following examination within the Department and the seeking of legal advice which was accepted by the last Minister, was that because of the fact that it would not be legally possible to provide for all eventualities in legislation, the problem was simply not amenable to solution by way of amendment to the 1977 Act.  The result of that, in effect, is that the type of case to which the Deputy is referring continues to be decided by the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the courts on the basis of their judgment or the employer's overall reasonableness in dismissing an employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any views on what the appropriate period is to qualify for the protection of the Act? Is he happy with the present 12 months or would he see that being shortened? Secondly, is he aware of the suggestion that different criteria should apply to employers of different sizes, in other words, that more rigid obligations would apply to larger employers and, by extension, less rigid to smaller employers? Does he see any merit in that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the reduction of the service requirement for qualification which is at present one year, I have a view that that should be shortened. There were different periods put forward in some of the reviews.  ICTU's request was for 26 weeks.  If possible, that is the period I should like to see.  It would be a more favourable one on the basis that employees normally serve a 26 week probation.  Again, that is one of the matters under review for the obtaining of ideas.  As to whether there should be some scaling, some of the difficulties with which the previous Minister had to deal were brought on by lack of that.  We are asking small employers who are open to difficult market positions to confront the same kind of legislation as larger employers who can have all the expertise available to them.  This is a question on which we might get more progress and more agreement if there were scales.</P>

      <P>Reviews of this Act have been going on and have been fairly well in the final stage since the autumn of 1984 and nothing has happened since. This question does not just refer to the Unfair Dismissals Act but to some of the legislation where the preception is that it is prohibitive to try to employ people. It concerns examination of the different legislation under that area.  In the booklet I shall seek broad views.  Deputies, including myself, have been asking questions during the past few years.  Everybody interested is not aware of what should be done.  Rather than having disagreement on legislation which has been brought forward, we should seek prior agreement.  Then perhaps we can get legislation.  Following the issue of the various reviews and the debate on the subject, it will be next year before we will see legislation.</P>

      <P>The House having been advised by the previous Minister on 4 February 1986 that, in addition, legislation would be introduced to extend the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act to cover Bord Gáis Éireann, Irish Steel and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, on the reintroduction of the Bill will the Minister include those three organisations?  Has the Minister any proposals to include Radio Telefís Éireann in the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act?</P>

      <P>We are looking again at what semi-State bodies should be involved in.  The position is that the last Government, rather than extending the three already in the Bill by three other boards, dropped three from the proposals. I shall review the overall position. There are some people involved in the sub-board structure who at this stage do not want this to go ahead and perhaps others may wish it to.  I have asked for some further consultation so that immediately on the introduction of the Bill people will not be seeking a further extension to it.  At the same time, I do not wish to delay the procedure.  The previous Minister did much work in this area and brought the Bill before the House.  I should like to bring it back as soon as possible.  If there is not agreement on the area of the sub-board structure and a will to co-operate, there is not much point in having participation.  That is why people are undecided.  I would follow the view of the former Minister on that.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate whether in the range of bodies he has in mind Radio Telefís Éireann, in particular, is one of these?  Without making any undue comment, it seems to be a glaring omission by the previous Government and according to the Minister's reply here today in terms of the proposed extension.  Could the Minister comment on the lack of agreement?  I do not follow the point which he made in his <Col N="477" /> earlier response.  It would seem that the primary persons to be concerned in worker participation are the workers themselves.  I cannot understand that there would be disagreement among workers about involvement on these boards if and when established.  Could there be a timescale indication from the Minister which might help us?</P>

      <P>As early as we can.  The Bill has been in the House before and we wish to bring it back.  I did not see any reference to RTE in any proposal.  On the question of disagreement, the whole idea is to prevent workers from having to have recourse to the Labour Court and other areas.  Minor difficulties would be able to be sorted out at shop floor level. There must be agreement by personnel managers and shop stewards to a process which allows for that.  There is no use in having a sub-floor structure when, every time there is any little disagreement, people go around that.  Some of the listed agencies do not seem to have such agreement. I want to review those agencies and perhaps there are others who may have sorted out some arrangements between management and workers since the Minister brought the Bill before the House.</P>

It will be a nonsense of a Bill if it is not funded.  Unless the Government have made certain decisions to fund it, I suggest that its introduction is a sham.

      <P>The question of declaring 1 May as a public holiday continues to be under consideration by my Department.  Any decision on it would appropriately be taken in the context of a review of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.  In that connection, I note the points made by Deputy Bell in support of the proposal.</P>
      <P>I have to say, however, that, having regard to the current economic situation, I would not regard the present as an opportune time to introduce a measure which would give rise to a further increase in costs for employers generally, including the State as an employer.</P>

      <P>I must have the Minister's reply off by heart at this stage. The same reply has been given since April 1984 and perhaps before that.  The Minister indicated that a review continues. Could he say how active that review is? When was the last time he or his Department had discussions with the ICTU or the FUE or both?

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he has satisfied himself with the operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act to date; if his attention had been drawn to the fact that in the majority of cases where dismissal is found to be unfair, financial compensation is awarded rather than reinstatement or re-engagement; his views on whether money will compensate for unfairly losing a job; if he will consider amending the Act so that, when a dismissal is found to be unfair, reinstatement must be provided unless there are compelling reasons not to do so, and that any such reasons must be stated in the recommendation or determination as appropriate; his views on the practice of deducting social welfare payments from financial awards; and if he will take immediate action to end this unfair practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, has in general worked well in that it has afforded unfairly dismissed employees a clear avenue of redress.  There is also evidence to suggest that as a result of this legislation there has been less industrial conflicts or dismissal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of redress for unfair dismissal, I would agree that, ideally, the injured party should be re-employed. However, this may not always be feasible. The present tendency towards the award of compensation rather than re-instatement or re-engagement simply reflects the two realities that (a) in some instances re-instatement or re-engagement is not a realistic option where there has been a complete breakdown in the relationship between the parties, and (b) in many cases compensation is the preferred choice of the employee.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal and the rights commissioners have wide experience in this area and, in my view, the choice of solution in any particular instance is best left to their judgment in <Col N="487" /> the light of the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
    <P>As regards the practice of deducting social welfare payments from financial awards the reasoning behind this is the provision in the Act that the employee should be compensated in respect of any financial loss incurred by him which is attributable to the dismissal.  Clearly, the financial loss of an unfairly dismissed employee is mitigated by any other income received &mdash; such as social welfare payments or, indeed, remuneration from alternative employment &mdash; and this is simply reflected in the amount of the compensation he is awarded.</P>
    <P>As stated in reply to another question I am at present studying the outcome of a review recently undertaken by my Department of various issues which have arisen under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 &mdash; including those mentioned by the Deputy.  When I have concluded this examination I shall indicate what measures, if any, I propose to take in this area.</P>

      <P>I recognise the importance of close co-operation between education and training and along with the Minister for Education am fully committed to strengthening the links between labour and education.  I will be working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education in this regard.</P>
      <P>The objective of the more effective co-ordination of education and training will be a priority in the policy guidelines to the National Employment and Training Authority when it is established.

      <P>I am aware that the Deputy, when Minister of State, established what I consider was an extremely useful co-ordinating committee to deal with areas that overlapped, particularly in regard to education, training and manpower services.  The White Paper provided that a Minister of State would be in charge but that is not now so.  As a Minister of State is required to chair that committee it is necessary to examine the position, and a report on co-operation and co-ordination between the education and training authorities in the provision of vocational and preparation training is currently being drawn up to decide how this will be handled from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there are widespread resources, physical resources and resources in terms of expertise and manpower within the education area, that are not being availed of to the extent they should be by those in Manpower?  Will the Minister accept that greater use of those resources would achieve a more cost-effective service?  What proposals has the Minister to ensure that the labour world make full use of everything that is available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a huge amount of information within education that should be, and in some instances is, passed on to the training agencies.  The proposals in regard to training and education which the Deputy was involved in will continue to be examined with a view to co-operation and co-ordination.  As the Deputy has outlined, clearly there is a waste of resources from the education system and when somebody leaves that system in transition to work, be it to Manpower services or some alternative training scheme.  There is a report from which we can see how that work will be followed <Col N="489" /> on, although there is not now the same Minister of State who was there for the early proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a directive to all of the agencies under his influence that, when embarking on a project, they should ascertain whether there are resources within the education world that would be of benefit to them and direct them to avail of those resources as a first option before looking elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point and I will examine it.  I referred in my first reply to the policy guidelines and the national employment training authority. This matter can be discussed again.  When the organisations are co-ordinated it will be far easier to have a better relationship and more co-operation with education than at present.</P>

I wrote to AnCO on 10 April asking for a comprehensive report on the outcome of the investigations and the action taken.

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="529" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, and thereby abolish stallion licensing.  Under the 1934 Act, entire stallions aged two years and upwards must be licensed.  However, thoroughbred stallions which are used exclusively for thoroughbred breeding, or which are either kept in training for racing or used for racing, are exempt from licensing.</P>
      <P>The Horse Breeding Act is over 50 years on the Statute Book.  At the time of its enactment the position of the horse was very different.  Numbers of horses were very much greater and the horse was virtually the only source of draught power on farms and was a most important means of transport especially in rural communities.  The criteria of selection were largely dictated by the uses of the horse at that time and there was, of course, nearly total reliance on visual inspection as a means of selection.</P>
      <P>The position of the horse has changed dramatically in the period since the enactment of the 1934 Act.  Horse numbers have declined sharply because of advances in the mechanisation of agriculture and the widespread use of motorised transport.  The horse is now predominantly used for sporting and leisure activities and the breeding goals and objectives have altered accordingly. Modern animal breeding techniques, incorporating objective measures of performance, have been introduced into horse breeding programmes in this country and throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The actual numbers of stallions licensed decreased from 1,000 in 1970 to about 500 in 1984.  These figures reflect the general decline in the numbers in the horse population during this period.  The actual licensing inspection itself was confined to a clinical examination and had little real impact on breeding merit itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in the numbers of stallions, the change over time in the use of the horse, the development of more modern breeding methods and the fact that the licensing inspection itself had little intrinsic merit, all lead us to the conclusion that <Col N="530" /> it is time to abolish licensing of stallions. Both the thoroughbred and the nonthoroughbred sectors of the horse industry also accept that stallion licensing will not be required in the future and they agree that it should be terminated.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have serious reservations about this Bill and in particular the halfbred industry which over the generations has brought honour and glory to Ireland and has generated substantial revenues for this country.  Radical change of the kind proposed involving the termination of the existing stallion licensing arrangements should not be made without a clear statement of policy on the future of the industry, a discussion of the alternatives and options to replace the existing licensing system and, above all, a clearly expressed view on the future objectives of the industry and how they are to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The timing of this Bill is particularly inappropriate.  To a large extent we are operating in a vacuum at the moment with the decision to abolish Bord na gCapall.  As yet we have no clear idea as to the administrative structures of the operating procedures to be put in place by way of replacement.  Until these issues are fully clarified we are merely compounding the existing confusion by abolishing additionally the existing stallion licensing system at this time.  Quite a number of issues should be raised here and I invite the Minister in his reply to provide answers to them.  Unless and until these issues are fully clarified I do not think it is right to go ahead with the repeal of the 1934 Act.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister see the halfbred industry developing in the years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the number of draught mares here, we have achieved international success over the years in show jumping circles out of all proportion to our numbers.  I am told that out of the top 20 show jumpers in the world today over half of them are from Ireland.  This formula for success should not be lightly interfered with.  There is no understanding of this issue in the Minister's <Col N="531" /> speech nor is a vision for the future expressed in it.  Where does the Minister see the industry going and how does he see us getting there?  We need a clear statement of policy from the Minister on the development of the horse industry. Without this it is impossible to lend support to a measure of this nature.</P>
    <P>What system is proposed for the future?  Is it to be a total free-for-all without any licensing?  Is there to be a form of licensing?  Is there need for a panel of independent judges to assess animals?  I invite comment from the Minister on the point that there will be need in future for some form of independent stallion inspectorate.  Involved in that inspectorate we need people who are impartial and who are seen to be impartial as there must be a clear avoidance of conflict of interest on the part of those involved. Drawing on the resources of the Department, the veterinary profession and the many people who have an interest in this area, I am satisfied that there would be little difficulty in gathering the advice and expertise to enable such an independent inspectorate to be set up at low cost.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, which is notable for brevity, there is no discussion as to the kind of system of registration of animals envisaged in the future.  There is a general reference to modern animal breeding techniques having been introduced here but there is no discussion or reference to registration of animals.  At the moment we have the Bord na gCapall register.  What is to happen to that if Bord na gCapall is to be abolished?  There are other registers for show jumpers and for ponies.  There are registers for different purposes from the point of view of identification, performance, breeding and so on.  This issue has been totally ignored in the Minister's speech and it needs to be fully clarified.</P>
    <P>Other areas are not touched on at all in the Minister's speech and they need to be clarified.  There is the question which excited a considerable amount of interest in the horse world, of the importation of non-thoroughbred stallions.  Some people believe that it is the right way <Col N="532" /> forward and others are strenuously opposed to it.  The way to deal with this issue is not to totally ignore it.  Some people are pressing for the importation of other strains.  What is the policy on that?  Does the Minister feel this is the right way forward or is it something that should be opposed?  Is there a case to be made for allowing such importation on an experimental basis where the results can be assessed over a period under controlled circumstances?  These and other issues have been totally ignored by the Minister and I am raising questions which must be fully teased out.  It is rare enough that we have the opportunity here to have a discussion on the horse industry and the occasion should be used for a full examination of the issues and for clarification of the issues.</P>
    <P>There is the question as to what should be the policy in relation to national hunt sires.  This has caused some controversy and it has been totally ignored by the Minister.  There is also the question of the various sanctions which existed in the 1934 Act.  Under section 13 the Minister was entitled to:</P>
    <P>refuse to grant a licence under this Act in respect of any stallion which appears to him&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to be affected by any contagious or infectious disease, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to be affected by any other disease or defect prescribed as a disease or defect rendering a stallion unsuitable for breeding purposes, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to be inadequately prolific, or</P>
    <P>(d)  likely by reason of its defective conformation or physique, or otherwise, to beget unsuitable progeny.</P>
    <P>Under section 23 of the 1934 Act there was an authority which enabled the Minister to order castration of certain stallions found to be unsuitable.  What is the situation if the 1934 Act is entirely repealed?  What powers would the Minister have to deal with animals found to be unsuitable and which may be considered quite undesirable?  There is a danger here of throwing out the baby with the bath <Col N="533" /> water.  Is it wise to so lightly set aside the powers the Minister has at the moment?</P>
    <P>Administration costs are dealt with in detail in the 1934 Act from the point of view of licensing, including the prescription of certain fees which today would hardly buy a box of matches but which were probably relevant at that time.  That issue has to be fully clarified. Where do we stand at the moment?  Our present system over the decades has produced spectacular results.  The onus of proof lies with those who propose a radical change such as that proposed in the repeal of the Horse Breeding Act of 1934. It is necessary that those who propose this repeal should clearly indicate the future position so that at the very minimum we can know that the same kind of results can be achieved in the future.  In the context of the very short opening speech by the Minister, this onus of proof has not been discharged.  As Opposition spokesman my duty is to urge caution.</P>
    <P>What is necessary is a degree of public debate on this issue.  No doubt there are many people throughout the country with far more expertise than I in this area. This is a time when they should be invited to express their views, when they should be asked to draw on the depths of their experience and expertise and express a view on how the various issues I have raised should be tackled, in particular whether the proper way to tackle them is by way of a simple repeal of the 1934 Act involving a total abolition of the licensing system.  Only when these issues have been fully and properly discussed and clarified will it be possible to map the road ahead which is in the best interests of the horse industry.  The Minister has failed to discharge the onus on him which is to convince this House that this change should be made.  Apart from dealing with the various points I have raised and others which no doubt will be raised in the course of this debate I would seriously suggest that the Minister should consider a deferment of this Bill until such time as there has been reasoned public debate on the issue, until such time as those with serious concerns, as I have, about the <Col N="534" /> steps proposed have had an opportunity of expressing their views and of having them considered.  I suggest this in a very non-political way, all the more so to a Minister who happens to be a constituency collegue of mine.  The steps now proposed should not be taken hastily. It is necessary to have this debate, not just in this House but throughout the country, in particular among those with a strong interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>Once that public debate has been concluded the issues will be very clear and it will be possible to have a reasoned and sensible reaction, with decisions arising therefrom.  Until that takes place, until such time as the various reservations I have expressed &mdash; and others which may be voiced in the course of the debate &mdash; have been fully answered, I cannot support this Bill at this point.</P>
    <P>I end as I began, that I find the timing of this debate particularly inopportune. We have what amounts to a vacuum at present, with the proposal to abolish Bord na gCapall and to compound the situation by abolishing the Horse Breeding Act without any clear delineation of the future development of the industry. That would represent a leap in the dark and, on that basis, I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the repeal of the Horse Breeding Act means that the Government will withdraw from the horse breeding industry. Has the Minister any new proposals or legislation in mind governing the horse industry?  Our thoroughbred industry has an international reputation second to none.  Irish bred and trained horses are to the forefront of the international racing industry.  The value of the thoroughbred horse industry to Ireland in terms of employment and foreign earnings is inestimable. There is also a spin-off effect in terms of international advertising and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the exemption of stallion nomination income the industry receives no significant State aid in the form of tax relief or public expenditure entitlements. That exemption is very important and has been mainly responsible for the growth <Col N="535" /> of the industry in recent times.  Most of the top grade stallions now standing in Ireland would be standing elsewhere were it not for this exemption.  Also tax relief on activities which would take place elsewhere, in the absence of relief, does not incur any net cost on the Exchequer. The continued success of the Irish thoroughbred breeding industry is not guaranteed by the continuation of a favourable tax regime, important though that may be, and intense competition from overseas leaves no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>The Irish non-thoroughbred horse industry which also has a high reputation throughout the world seems to be in a serious and steady decline.  In terms of climate, limestone lands and horse management ability Ireland enjoys many natural and inherent advantages. However, we are not unique in this respect.  There is a distinct danger that we will fall far behind our European neighbours and lose the esteemed position we now hold.  In their election manifesto the Government recognised the warning signs in this regard and promised a development of the halfbred horse industry under a reorganised Bord na gCapall.  Are we to assume that this proposal has been confined to the waste paper basket; was it just another election promise not meant to be followed up?</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a serious decline in the non-thoroughbred horse industry with serious reductions in the breeding of quality halfbreds.  From 1979 the number of mares covered has fallen from 6,630 to 4,810 in 1985, representing a fall of 27.5 per cent.  In the same period the number of live foals from thoroughbred sires has decreased from 2,728 in 1979 to 1,723 in 1985, a reduction of 1,000 over the entire period.  More disturbing still is the figure for 1985 when only 127 registered Irish draught foals were recorded.  From the figures quoted it is now clear that the halfbred horse industry faces a crisis in relation to the availability of adequate supplies of quality horses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> The Minister should introduce alternative legislation to help the horse industry out of its present crisis.  Other countries like Great Britain and Germany, who traditionally bought their halfbred horses for showjumping and hunting in Ireland, are now adopting their own breeding programmes.  It is interesting to note that the United Kingdom has an Irish draught stallion register in operation.  It is difficult to understand how this decline has arisen in what has been traditionally a farming enterprise, especially when one considers the restriction on production of beef and milk and the frantic search for alternative farm incomes and sidelines ranging from deer to wild fowl, and other exotic species. In the halfbred horse we have a ready market, the tradition and the know-how.  I would hope the Government would give this industry the necessary shot-in-the-arm, the developmental incentives it requires, in order to take its rightful place as a successful alternative farm enterprise.  The non-thoroughbred horse industry was traditionally a very large farm enterprise in Ireland but it went into decline for various reasons about 20 years ago, one reason being the motorisation and mechanisation of agricultural machinery.  Indeed the intensification in other areas of food production rendered that activity unpopular at the time.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that most of the primary products now supported by the Common Agricultural Policy are in surplus it would be feasible financially to encourage a return to horse breeding as an important and viable farm enterprise. In an effort to maintain farmers' incomes at a reasonable level they have been given EC aid, headage grants and so on to produce products already in surplus.  I suggest such aid could be directed in certain cases to products which are not in surplus.  The half-bred horse industry is a very worthy recipient of such funds.  Such an idea would be enhanced as it goes hand-in-hand with leisure activities such as horse riding and hunting and could form part of an agri-tourist industry which the EC are so anxious to promote <Col N="537" /> in areas of surplus and in peripheral areas.</P>
    <P>There is room for expansion in the number of brood mares, particularly of the traditional Irish class which is the source of the half-bred horse.  There is a potential for export to the EC, to the Far East, the Middle East, the USA and other countries.  There seems to be an unlimited market for good show jumpers. We have the ability to fill these markets but we need to organise proper breeding programmes.  The general promotion and expansion of the horse breeding industry goes hand-in-glove with the EC proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy and the regional and socio-structural policies. If we are serious about revitalising the horse breeding industry and if we are serious about promoting the industry as an alternative or an additional farm enterprise, one which is viable and appears to our partners in the EC as worthy of support with funds from the EC, then we must first put our house in order.  By that I mean we must give the necessary funds and the necessary impetus to the horse breeding industry in order to put it on an upward spiral.  We can then look to the EC for funds to maintain that upward spiral and to expand the industry generally.  This means that the Government, and the Department of Agriculture and Food in particular, must appear to be giving their full and active support at the highest political level to the development of the horse breeding industry as a viable and alternative farm enterprise.</P>
    <P>We have modernised our beef and dairying industries far beyond our wildest dreams in a short period of time.  We have brought them to such a point of success that we now have a surplus.  This goes to prove that the job can be done if the resolve is there on the part of the Government, and in particular on the part of the Department of Agriculture and Food to see that the necessary steps are taken to put the horse breeding industry on a firm footing.  The Government also have a major role to play in creating the right environment to allow the Irish horse breeding industry to develop its full <Col N="538" /> potential in the leisure and agri-tourism field.</P>
    <P>There is a certain feeling in Ireland that anybody connected with the horse breeding industry or anybody who partakes in horse riding or show jumping for leisure is an elitist type person.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In other European and American countries horse riding and other horse related leisure activities have become very big business. When one considers we are near the end of the 20th century, when we are informed we will have more leisure time and that we need more outdoor pursuits and considering our location for holding equestrian events and for all types of horse riding and horse-related activities, we have within our grasp a wonderful resource.  This will be developed by the right type of Government input and encouragement at the highest level.</P>
    <P>We have many of the necessary institutions and the framework required to successfully give the impetus to the horse breeding industry which it now requires. There is an active role for ACOT in the provision of courses and the organisation of meetings and seminars at county level. ACOT have proved their worth in the organisation, the development and advising in the areas of dairying and beef and in the accompanying increase in quality in these aspects of agriculture.  We have all come to understand that no development of output, no increase in production and no plans of any sort would have continued and sustained success without being based on a good well worked out, well researched and well financed marketing plan.  If farmers are to rear increased numbers of top quality horses, it will be absolutely essential for the marketing side of the industry to be substantially improved.  Otherwise there will be no continuity and stability and we will have one year of glut when prices will be very low and another year when the numbers are scarce prices will be high. This happened in many an industry and in many aspects of agriculture and farming in the past.  We should be able to learn from the lessons of the past and not <Col N="539" /> allow it to happen in the horse breeding industry.</P>
    <P>The Irish sports horse must be promoted throughout the world.  We must provide facilities to ensure that buyers from as far away as the US can visit local sales and marketing centres.  The building of modern training schools and centres similar to those available in many other European countries should be encouraged. Our properly constituted and organised horse board would have a role in co-ordinating the establishment of such marketing centres.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister, if he intends to repeal this Bill, to take some of the ideas of the Progressive Democrats on board and give the horse breeding industry the necessary shot in the arm which it now requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Bill which has been welcomed by those engaged in the breeding of thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred horses.  The Bill is also to be welcomed in the context of the overall budgetary strategy of the Government in so far as the repeal of the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, will result in a modest saving on Exchequer expenditure.  Any development resulting in such a saving, if it does not do any harm in other ways, is to be welcomed having regard to the widespread view of the House that Government expenditure is to be kept to a minimum in areas where activities have become obsolete.  I am satisfied that if the view of the horse breeding industry and of the Minister is that this legislation has become obsolete then that is so.  I have taken the precaution of reading the legislative history of the Act which is proposed to be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to refer to the introduction of the legislation by the then Minister for Agriculture, the late Dr. Ryan. On Second Stage of the Bill in this House in 1933 he adverted to the fact that there was then in place a Horse Breeding Act of 1918 which prohibited the servicing of mares by unlicensed stallions.  He pointed out that it was necessary to apprehend <Col N="540" /> the owner of the stallion or the owner of the mare using a stallion for such purposes when the stallion was unlicensed. There was a practical difficulty in enforcing the legislation.  The purpose of the legislation was to bring in a broader control so that unlicensed stallions could not be kept, much less used for the purpose of servicing mares.</P>
    <P>Remarks have been made from the opposite side of the House today in relation to the possible damage which this Bill might do to the horse breeding industry.  It is interesting to note that the thoroughbred breeding stallion was at all times excluded from the legislation.  If one is to trace the history of the thoroughbred industry from 1934 to the present date, it seems that this industry has not suffered from a lack of any formal licensing procedure.  In the thirties, forties and fifties there was a risk that farmers would use the draught horses on their farms for breeding purposes without taking particular care to ensure the best breeding standards.  The marketing forces which operate in the horse breeding industry now did not operate many years ago and it was tempting for farmers operating at subsistence level who had a mare, an ordinary plough horse, to bring it to the neighbour's stallion which was not a licensed stallion.  In this way an informal procedure would evolve, because there would be a lack of a proper selection of breeding animals.  That was a particular danger which beset the draught horse breeding industry at that time.</P>
    <P>Specifically the thoroughbred was excluded from the Act because at that time a thoroughbred was not used for any purpose other than racing and people operated to maximise the return from their animals by selecting the very best thoroughbred stallion they could afford. The same position obtains now as far as the non-thoroughbred horse breeding industry is concerned.  These horses are not being bred as beasts of burden but as part of our horse industry which essentially is a leisure industry geared towards providing half-bred and fun horses for pony activities, show jumping, hunting <Col N="541" /> and so on, for which they are renowned throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the Minister's approach to this matter, I am satisfied there is no onus of proof in relation to the need for this legislation.  Happily this legislation has become obsolete.  I hope it will be beneficial to the horse breeding industry in so far as those people involved in the non-thoroughbred breeding section of the industry will not be faced with the cost of having stallions inspected, which would have been a not insignificant cost in some cases.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues raised about the future of the bloodstock industry may be strictly outside the ambit of this legislation but nevertheless I wish to make one comment.  One can say what one likes about providing back up services for the bloodstock industry &mdash; financial incentives here, there and everywhere, making overall plans, and talking about the bloodstock industry as a viable substitute for milk, beef and cereal production which have become restricted in certain areas due to changes in Common Market policies and the fact that there has been a massive increase in production in the Common Market countries as well as in Ireland &mdash; but the real problem besetting the agricultural industry is ever increasing costs and the failure of prices to rise.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years the market for the horsebreeding industry was determined by forces outside this country and the market price at any given time and over any given production period was very much a constant in the equation of farm costs and returns over which the farmer and the breeder had very little control.  Primarily the farmer is concerned about the overall cost structure of production in the bloodstock industry. Among these costs will be the cost of capital in the context of the Government's strategy and it is to be hoped that interest rates will fall to a significant degree thereby leaving farmers and people in the bloodstock industry a good deal freer to make the choice to switch from dairying, beef, sheep or cereal production to horse breeding.  It is as simple <Col N="542" /> as that.  It depends on the general economic situation and in particular the cost of capital.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in the livestock industry is very conscious of the long production period.  People wait a long time for a return on capital because they have to rear an animal until it can be sold.  There is a long gestation period with the horse and a subsequent period of husbandry until the young foal has reached a stage where it can be sold.  This involves very significant capital investment if one is involved in top breeding stock because these people want saleable products which can be sold on the national and international markets.</P>
    <P>The net capital is made available through a general decline in interest rates.  I cannot see any value in examining all the other meritorious variables in the development of the horsebreeding industry, but wherever this industry has prospered it has gone hand in hand with the very generous availability of capital.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a problem about having an adequate supply of good Irish draught brood mares due to the fact that the draught mare is required for nothing but leisure purposes.  Nevertheless the overriding consideration would be, and it should be spelled out clearly here, that the economic position will determine whether the bloodstock industry will prosper, just as it determines whether the dairying, cattle sheep or cereal industry will prosper.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCoy set out a number of demands in an unqualified manner.  In the present context these demands would have to be set out in conditional terms, showing that the underlying economic conditions would justify the Government's expenditure, and he outlined areas where Government expenditure could be justified.  I say, with respect, that they can only be justified in the context of a realistic overall growing economy for farmers to invest very significant sums in horses that, ultimately, could cost them a great deal more in interest, feeding and general husbandry than they might ever realise on a market over which they have no control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> I am not as well versed in the horse breeding industry as I am in the breeding of other farm animals, nevertheless I come from an area where the horse breeding industry plays a very important role in the rural &mdash; and indeed urban &mdash; economy.  I wish to express my thanks to the proprietors and employees of the various bloodstock establishments which I visited where, with some pride, they showed me their stock and the type of employment available in specialised bloodstock establishments.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the bloodstock industry needs to be modernised.  One of the most remarkable factors in relation to the modernisation of the industry is that no matter what is done in relation to general administration, planning and other aspects of the industry, it is not an easy task to eliminate or significantly reduce its labour input.  If there is to be an expansion in the bloodstock industry in the forthcoming years &mdash; as I hope there will be &mdash; I will be heartened if such an expansion brings with it the prospect of increased jobs in the areas affected. Labour of an intensive kind in the industry cannot be replaced by mechanisation or a change in technology, at least for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>It is with some alarm that I read the Minister's speech this afternoon if we can dignify as such the few words he gave on this important topic.  I am not addressing my remarks to the Minister of State; I appreciate that the speech was the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, who cannot, understandably, be here today.  Can these one and a half pages represent the interest of the Department of Agriculture in our half-bred industry?  To be fair I do not think it does but the impression is given that this is all they have to say at the moment on this vital, flagship industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to rethink the Bill which asks us to repeal the Horse Breeding Act.  No sections of that Act deserve to be highlighted but it is all we have and the only protection and legislation <Col N="544" /> through which the industry can have any control.  Bord na gCapall have rightly been abolished because they did not do what they were intended to do; they did not service the small farmer who had one or two half bred mares, knowledge of the industry going back decades, which he did not learn from a book and which no civil servant, with respect, would ever acquire unless he or she was reared in a similar situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite unequivocal. For some years I have been calling for this course of action because I have been in fear as to what would happen in the half-bred industry.  I have had a reasonable interest in the industry over the years; this country owes so much to it, although perhaps we do not recognise it.  The board, albeit the intentions were good, when they were set up in 1970 did not achieve what we expected and they have now been abolished at least for the moment.  We must reassess the situation and decide the right way forward.  When Bord na gCapall were set up in 1970 there were approximately 12,000 non-thoroughbred brood mares breeding. When the board were abolished the number was down to 5,000.  That is the only statistic which needs to be highlighted and it says it all.  If we are to have the half bred brood mares to produce our sport horses as they are now termed &mdash; I hate the expression but I accept that it is very convenient and describes what we are all talking about today &mdash; and if we are to talk about marketing our sport horses and to have the raw material for Irish horsemen and women who are renowned worldwide, we must breed them and we must have a pool of brood <Col N="545" /> mares.  We are now down to under 5,000 breeding annually and, with less than a 50 per cent foal return we are talking about fewer than 2,500 foals each year. The industry is in a state of alarm and crisis.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister not to proceed with the Bill at present.  When it was originally published the decision had not been taken to abolish Bord na gCapall.  Fairly reasonably at the time, an argument could be made that we were duplicating the work of Bord na gCapall in relation to their horse register, that in theory they were doing a more thorough job than the licensing system would allow.  The board have now been abolished and we intend to throw the baby out with the bath water, literally closing the stable door, if you do not mind me using the pun, and throwing out the only legislation under which we could tackle any problems that might arise.  I urge the Minister not to do any more about the Bill until he has outlined the future of this industry quite clearly.  What is the future of the Irish horse register?  The Minister said that the thoroughbred and indeed non-thoroughbred industry, have come to the conclusion that it is time to abolish the licensing of stallions.  The whole story of the scrub bull will pass into folklore if the Minister really means what that statement says.  Come back, Paddy Sheehan all if forgiven, for those who remember his contribution on that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what the Deputy means by that so I will ignore it.  This is a most serious issue and I am not surprised that the thoroughbred sector of the horse industry also accept that stallion licensing will not be required in future. Why should they?  Wetherbys look after that problem for them and some of the best national hunt sires, our thoroughbred sires, are not good enough for the Irish horse register.  Some of the best breeders send their prize winning mares <Col N="546" /> to national hunt sires for bone, jumping ability and everything else but, for some peculiar reason, that is not acceptable for entry to the Irish horse register because it has not been approved by X, Y, or Z in Bord na gCapall who are supposed to include them.</P>
      <P>The stories are legion.  The Minister should ask the few people still breeding half-breds and the even fewer who have stallions what the truth is.  The Minister should not listen to the official story which he will be given because he will only hear the nice bits.  The rest of us know what goes on and the horse industry, more than any other, has two sides to it.  Those of us who have any association with them know that they are a crafty and brilliant lot but that they would buy and sell you and me and every official in the Department of Agriculture.  There is only a small number of counties producing half-breds.  These include my own county of Wexford, Counties Tipperary and Waterford, and maybe Counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  Down along the coast you would have Counties Clare and Cork and very few across the Shannon. Those are the counties where you have the concentration of the 4,500, maybe 5,000, half-bred brood mares that are still breeding.  These are owned by small farmers who know what they are talking about.  They know what Bord na gCapall were worth to them &mdash; not one farthing. The last board said that their priority was to resolve the difficulties in relation to the purchase of stallions and to have these stallions standing at strategic locations in the counties where the mares still were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first number of years the board bought nothing at all.  If you questioned them as to what they had bought, what sales they had been to or what they had seen around the country, you were told that it was a very difficult job to purchase stallions.  I think the Minister would agree that you do not purchase stallions by leaving your office desk and travelling to Newmarket or any other sales.  The purchase of a stallion is a job which goes on 12 months of the year.  It can be done only by people in the field, by people who would know what they were looking for, <Col N="547" /> who would know a parrot mouth, a wind sucker or a whistler when they saw one.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to investigate some of the purchases made by Bord na gCapall in recent years to see what I am alluding to.  There is no point in giving expenses to anyone to travel to sales here and there, not one but several, to come back to say there was nothing suitable. The only stallions of the type we would be looking for and which would reach the sales would be those which could not be sold at home because anyone who knows their business, particularly the horse business, has them spotted weeks and months ahead.  They are watching them on the racecourse.  They are watching them at the shows around the country.  They are watching them from yearlings up.  The good ones are gone before they ever get to the sales ring.  We think we can trot into the sales ring and that what we are looking for will all appear one after the other on the production line.  Do we realise how important the half-bred industry is to this country?  There are 20,000 to 30,000 people employed directly in the industry.  If you were to give the IDA sufficient money to create that number of manufacturing jobs there would be little left in relation to your budgetary considerations.  We are talking about people who have been reared in the industry, who have been servicing the industry.  Regrettably, many of them very often are not well paid but they are people we will never replace.</P>
    <P>We have the climate and we have the limestone land here.  We have the basic raw materials which we do not need to import and we have the track record.  I remind the Minister that the first time the Irish National Anthem was played abroad was over the head of the Irish horse and our showjumping team. Today, we are being asked to fire out the only legislation, however inadequate, we now have to try to put some discipline into this industry and to protect it for the future.  The Minister is asking my colleagues and I to believe that it is time to abolish all licensing of stallions.  I take it he is asking us to believe that any <Col N="548" /> stallion on the Irish horse register, whoever may be looking after that in the future, will suffice.</P>
    <P>A third of those registered are nearly 20 years old and another third never get a mare at all.  The Minister should go through the facts.  They have been there so long that no one in their right mind would consider sending a mare to them. There are a few you may or may not consider.  Having waffled and prevaricated, for whatever good reason, for some years the board towards the end of last year finally purchased five or six stallions.  I know, because they boarded them in a particular man's place not too far from where I live while they were looking for homes for them.  Some of my colleagues because of their concern for and love of the industry went to see those stallions.  They only saw five of the six. The stories I got in relation to the thoroughbred stallions which had been bought and considered suitable for inclusion on the approved stallion list concerned me greatly.</P>
    <P>If we have no licensing do not ask me to swallow that we will continue with this farce of the approved list as it now exists, and only allow registered mares which are covered by horses from this list to have their progeny subsequently included in our register.  It cannot happen unless the Minister wants to see the end of this industry and we are very near the bottom.  I remind the Minister that in 1970 there were 12,000 mares breeding.  We have fewer than 5,000 today and the number continues to dwindle.</P>

      <P>The tragedy is further compounded by the fact that most other farming enterprises are in surplus. Nobody wants the production from the other primary areas of agriculture at present whether it is milk, cereals, certain tillage crops, beef or anything else.  Here we have an industry we have always shone at but which for some reason we have never translated into profits for the primary producer, the person with the brood mare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Its structure must be looked at.  The incentives for the half-bred brood mare must be replaced.  We took away the £15, or perhaps it was the £20, for foal registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We took that away a few years ago and Bord na gCapall said they were putting the money into stallions.  I have already been over that course.  We took away the only incentive the mare owner had to register the foal and we did precious little else about it when we took from them the few miserable pounds they were getting.</P>
      <P>Registration &mdash; that is another laugh &mdash; in theory is excellent.  In fact, every sport horse performing in this country or being sold should be registered because when we have the successes abroad the pedigrees of the horses should be instantly traceable as the mares could be still alive.  In this way tremendous kudos and spin-offs could be created for the places where these mares were still standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago the statistics read something like this: 39 per cent of yearlings were registered by Bord na gCapall but when those yearlings became three year olds only 9 per cent of them were registered.  Let us consider the reasons for this.  Basically they are, first, that the register is of no particular advantage as you are not penalised for having an unregistered horse and secondly, it was often easier to throw the plastic green covered passport over the ditch as the purchaser approached, particularly if the stallion's progeny happened to have become unfashionable or proved not to have been as good as originally thought they would have been.  You get far more for selling something said to be by whatever is in fashion than selling an animal which is by something which is unfashionable. The dealers know what they are at.  I would not pretend to be at the races with them, neither should the Minister nor the officials of his Department.  They will use the register if and when it suits <Col N="550" /> them.  It is tipped over the ditch down the lane more often than not because they prefer not to look at the pedigree which is recorded in it.  Either we have a register which is worth pursuing with and I think it is worth pursuing with and worth nailing down, or we abandon the farce and tell the industry we are not interested in it.</P>
    <P>At present we are pretending that there is concern and that we are going somewhere.  The practice is far from what the theory is.  That area needs urgent attention.  I would like to see the register continued by some of the other bodies who at present are in registration.  That was another problem.  The IPS, the SJAI and Bord na gCapall have been involved in registration and we have green, pink and other coloured passports.  Many a person had an animal with three different passports.  The bodies concerned were not able to get together in order to have one system of registration. Ideally, that is what we need.  I hope that through the Minister and his Department we could get the various equestrian bodies to agree to a central system of registration which could be computerised to a certain extent.  This would be extremely efficient and would give the service our breeders need.  People could come back looking for another animal out of a particular dam because it had been performance tested, as it were and had made its way to the top in the showjumping circuit or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking us to agree to abolishing the licensing of stallions and to depend on a list of approved stallions. Please, Minister, do not abolish, even in theory, the possibility of licensing stallions until you are satisfied that the alternative will safeguard the industry.  As it is now, it will not and it cannot.  Please do not proceed in this fashion because of the state of the industry at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave as one of the reasons which led him to the conclusion that it was now time to abolish the licensing of stallions &mdash;&ldquo;the development of more modern breeding methods.&rdquo;  The mind boggles.  I take this to be a sort of cloaked innuendo in relation to AI and the general use of AI in the horse industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> More modern breeding methods can mean a great deal.  Could it be that some people in this country want free access and the free introduction of the warm bloods from Europe?  Let us look at the difference in the success of the different types of policy.  AI might have some benefit in relation to a top class show jumping mare or if you had a very old, very successful stallion and wanted to cover more mares in the season than would be physically possible for the horse himself to cover.  How are you to deal with the whole area of registration of the progeny? What will the progeny be said to be by? One can virtually then take one's pick. It is Hobson's choice.  There could be several hundred foals in the one year by one sire.  Who will have control of AI and exactly the source of it?  Who will accept that for registration in the Irish Horse Register as being by the horse it is said to be by?  Yet there will be no licensing. The Horse Register will be filled with these horses, the produce of a mare that will have been inseminated artifically and we are supposed to accept the truth of it.</P>
    <P>If we were dealing with any other industry but the horse industry, we might be able to sit down and discuss this matter more logically, but one needs to have some experience of how they work.  Some are already at that racket, even though they have to cover the mares in the more conventional way.  How would we control the progeny and the outcome of such matings if it were to become widespread?</P>

      <P>It may also refer to the fact that they want warm bloods to stand in this country.  Let us look at Germany which has perhaps one of the most controlled policies in relation to breeding They are into the warm bloods in a big way with their Hanoverians.  First, the Hanoverians are a type.  They are a mongrel mix of perhaps all that is best in that part of the world, but they are not a breed.  There are about 50,000 mares breeding in Germany.  I might be more <Col N="552" /> accurate if I refer to my notes on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting for next Saturday's, but it did not come in time. There are 56,000 breeding mares in Germany. We have between 4,000 and 4,500 &mdash; something under 5,000.  The figure is not &ldquo;available&rdquo; when one asks the Department.  They do not have the immediate statistics perhaps as far back as 1980.  One cannot get the up-to-date figures.  However, we will forgive that.  In Germany, when they are young colts, a year old, they are inspected, even at the foal stage, and there is a culling of all those with any apparent defect or about which there is any doubt at all.  They are again inspected as three year olds before they are accepted into that country's register and again there is an enormous cull and a very small proportion of the colts foaled end up in the register.  Their numbers are still far greater than ours by virtue of the statistics.</P>
      <P>In this country we have no breeding policy at all.  Let us be honest; we breed from the rejects and casualties of the show ring, the hunting field and everywhere else.  We breed a mare when nothing else can be done with her in general, with a very few notable exceptions. Even with no policy or an inverted breeding policy, we are having enormous success.  In 1985, according to the show jumping <i>grand prix</i> statistics, of the 140 European and American <i>grand prix</i> events, the figures based on wins per 5,000 mares read as follows: Ireland, 21; Holland, 7½; France, 5½; Germany four. We are now trying to mock and, if you like, imitate a country from which people come in their hundreds to purchase Irish horses here.  The Germans do not want to come here to buy Hanoverians &mdash; they breed those at home &mdash; similarly the French, Dutch and others.  They have their own native breeds and their own breeding policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could only get a positive breeding policy, decide what we want, sort out <Col N="553" /> the registration of our stallions properly, decide on the type of stallion with sufficient bone, etc., that we need to cover our mares, if we could protect our Irish draught mare pool which is dwindling to the point of extinction, we could triple those numbers.  We are at the head of the league when it comes to grand prix events and earnings with our Irish produce with no breeding policy at all.  Yet we now plan to import stallions that are the result of two or three culls from countries that cannot even match our existing statistics. It just does not add up and I urge the Minister to be on his guard and to watch what is going on.</P>
    <P>At the moment people are bringing young warm bloods into this country as yearlings.  They are registering them in the Irish Horse Register as breeding unknown, by the way.  The blood is getting into our small pool of mares.  If we had 20,000 mares we could afford to experiment, to see if these warm bloods would improve our progeny, what we already have in this country.  The problem is that if we do it now with such a small pool of brood mares and the experiment fails, we have eradicated the industry altogether.  If one introduces this blood to 4,500 mares, one gets about 2,000 foals a year and one could devastate the industry that has been enormously successful. If we are going to tinker with it, let us be sure of what we are going to do.  Let us be sure that those who are now mooting the bringing in of the warm bloods are not just doing it for personal avarice, that they really are looking to the long term future of the half-bred industry.  If we do not continue to produce the animal that we can market and sell, we will have no industry at all.</P>
    <P>In 1985, five of the top 20 American show jumpers were Irish bred.  I mentioned in passing the Irish draught horse. An argument has been raging for some time as to whether this is a breed or a type.  I support those who reckon it is a type.  Effectively, we closed the Irish draught book a couple of years ago and, as one man put it to me rather colourfully, we locked all the dirt inside.  I would not be quite as strong as that, but I take the <Col N="554" /> point.  It illustrates exactly the fear of those who know their breeding in this country.  People sitting in offices going through papers and pushing pens generally, with respect, do not, unless they happen to have a background in it.</P>
    <P>We have under 300 draught mares at the moment that are breeding.  If one takes the internationally recognised statistics for species threatened by extinction, the Irish draught mare could now be so classified.  That figure is taken on the number of breeding females in the species.  We could effectively say that the draught mare is now threatened with extinction and I ask the Minister if he intends to do anything about it.  One of the previous speakers referred to the fact that the draught mare is the foundation of the sport horse.  That is very true.  The draught mare crossed by the thoroughbred horse is what has made this country famous for this industry, not the other way around.  That particular way around is what it is all about.  We need the thoroughbred horses with conformation, to cross with our draught mares to continue the industry that everybody comes to our shores to see and enjoy and the result of which we export with such success.</P>
    <P>We do not need to many Irish draught stallions.  We need enough to keep the purebred, if there is such a thing, to keep the lines as pure as possible in relation to Irish draught horse breeding.  We need to keep them there to produce the draught mare that we can subsequently cross with the thoroughbred horse.</P>
    <P>King of Diamonds had two crosses of thoroughbred and those who have an interest in the business will realise that his name is synonymous with the Irish draught horse.  Then we are told that it is a breed and not a type.  I am not sure how many sons of King of Diamonds are standing in this country as Irish draught stallions.  I think the figure is near 12 but I shall not argue with anyone who thinks it is 10 or 14; it is around that number. The temptation is there to stand them as the sire was and still is such a successful sire of show jumpers.  With a pool of <Col N="555" /> mares of under 300, how long, genetically, can we tolerate 12 or 14 stallions of the same breeding covering the small pool of mares?  It cannot be done.  It has to be looked at.  We cannot continue down that line if we want to produce the draught mare which we need to keep our industry going.  Now the Minister is telling me that we do not need any more licensing and that the Irish Horse Register as we now know it can resolve that problem and all the other problems in the industry to which I have alluded.  It could not do it when Bord na gCapall were concentrating on it the whole time.  Until the Minister tells me otherwise or spells out his intentions I have no confidence that it will in the future.  We cannot abolish the licensing of stallions until it is replaced by a system which will guarantee a future for this flagship industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Initially when this Bill came out I questioned my colleague, Deputy Paddy Hegarty, and some officials from the Department of Agriculture as to who was promoting it.  We are always told that there is a queue to get legislation through the parliamentary draftsman.  If we have an interest in a certain area we are left sitting for months.  All of us have our own particular frustrations and areas in which we have an interest.</P>
    <P>I looked at the Order Paper one day a couple of years ago and saw this Bill sitting there and I asked: &ldquo;What is the urgency about this?  How did it come from the parliamentary draftsman so quickly?&rdquo; One look at what the parliamentary draftsman had to do convinced me that there were not a whole lot of cynical manoeuvres behind it because the Bill has only two lines.  From discussions I had with our spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I wondered if there would be a possibility of amending the Bill on Committee Stage.  I am still trying to work out how Deputy O'Keeffe could amend two lines. Either you repeal it or you do not repeal it because one is just a contradiction of the other.  We cannot even work on the <Col N="556" /> presumption that we could be talking about amendments.</P>
    <P>On investigating further who was the mover behind this Bill, I was told that Bord na gCapall recommended that stallion licensing be abolished.  This was the advice of their breeding sub-committee representative of the various sectors of the non-thoroughbred industry.  There were three very worthy and excellent representatives from Northern Ireland on this sub-committee.  I welcome their inclusion.  This sub-committee recommended, through I presume their chairman, Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, to the Minister of the day that we repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934.  They thought it fit, when they were setting up their breeding sub-committee, to ignore the Non-Thoroughbred Brood Mare Owner's Association who are the largest association in Ireland representing brood mare owners.  So far as I am concerned from that moment on that sub-committee did not represent the breeding interest of the sport horse or the non-thoroughbred horse in this country.</P>
    <P>I view with a slightly jaundiced eye the recommendations which have come through Bord na gCapall from that sub-committee. The sub-committee stressed that the examination for registration was more thorough and effective than the clinical examination for licensing required under the Act.  In theory that is so, but in practice &mdash; I have been through this so I will not repeat it &mdash; it never worked out like that.  People interested in a stallion to cover a half-bred mare purchased it and brought it home, they ran the risk of the board turning it down and not registering it.  I have three examples where that happened.  No one in the private sector is going to continue to take the risk of purchasing a stallion, taking it home, have the board inspect it for the register and have it turned down.</P>
    <P>In practice the register turned out to mean that only horses purchased by the board and stood around the country on a lease basis for mare owners were the ones who got into the register.  That was totally unsatisfactory.  If Bord na gCapall had <Col N="557" /> functioned as they were supposed to function, perhaps I would not be taking such a strong line against this Bill.  We might even accept it and nod it through the House, but I am afraid that that is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>At the time Bord na gCapall were mooting this Bill to repeal the Horse Breeding Act they said that on the repeal of the Act it would be proposed that only stallions registered in Bord na gCapall's register of approved stallions would be officially recognised for breeding purposes. We have been down that road already.  Bord na gCapall are operating a campaign to have all horses, mares and stallions, registered for identification purposes. To this end stallions must be presented for inspection in the Board's register of approved stallions.  Apart from the semantics, I do not see a major difference between presenting a stallion for a very through inspection and calling it an inspection of a stallion or presenting a stallion for an inspection and calling it the licensing of the stallion so long as the animal in question is inspected by people who know what they are talking about. There should be a list in some register of those who should be covering half-bred mares &mdash; nothing like the gobbledegook in Bord na gCapall's approved list, most of which is fit for the knacker's yard.</P>
    <P>Only the progieny of the registered mares of stallions would be recorded in the Irish Horse Register.  If 9 per cent of three year olds a few years ago had registers we would have a very small register.  It would be very easy to keep. It may be some consolation to the officials in the Department of Agriculture if they end up with this job that they will have very little to do if the present trend continues. My wish is that they will be snowed under with work in keeping this register, that the demand will be so great that they will not be able to keep up with it and there will be demands for increased numbers of staff to cope with it.  Tragically I think that at present one man working one hour a week might suffice to sort out the work that will have to be done.  This is the reality.</P>
    <P>A few years ago some people were <Col N="558" /> concerned about the progress of the half-bred industry and the dwindling number of half-bred mares.  Farmers or interested persons were getting rid of half-bred mares and replacing them by thoroughbred mares because they saw more profit and a bit more order in that industry. This industry is equally precarious as the half-bred industry.  These concerned people offered their services to Bord na gCapall to act as a stallion inspectorate. These were six or seven men &mdash; I think there might have been one woman involved &mdash; who had grown old in the half-bred industry and who had worn a path up and down to the RDS working as judges and producing prizewinners in the various classes.</P>

      <P>These people had been invited across the water year after year to the UK to judge shows.  Their names were synonymous with success in the half-bred industry.  These people offered their services free of charge to the last board.  They were prepared to go around the country on a 12 month of the year basis, 365 days of the year &mdash; in other words they would always be spotting for potential stallions.  They did not even want travel expenses.  The arrogant board thought they knew better and told these people that they did not need their services. Those who care about the sport horse and the half-bred industry know better.  I ask the Minister &mdash; while he has his thinking cap on in relation to the organisation of the industry now in the wake of Bord na gCapall &mdash; to please consider accepting the services of these people who are prepared to give them for the love of their horses and their country and because they want to see a future for this industry for the next generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy earlier on today referred to this Bill as helping budgetary arithmetic. I do not accept that.  When the English threw out the licensing of stallions &mdash; and they had it going back many years ago &mdash; there was an immediate knock-on effect of over £2 million.  I am not too sure what <Col N="559" /> that figure would be if it were translated into today's money terms.  This will cost money if there is not in place a structure for the Irish horse register and the approval of stallions, whether it is called licensing of stallions, inspecting stallions or registration of stallions.  There must be some system for knowing what stallions are suitable to cover our dwindling pool of half-bred mares.  These stallions must be readily available in counties where the mares are still left.  There must be a system in that register where thoroughbred horses, horses that are now considered to be national hunt sires, registered with Wetherby's &mdash; even in Wetherby's non-thoroughbred books, there are a few too &mdash; can be considered approved for covering these mares.  It is nonsense that the top of our national hunt sires cannot produce progeny that we will accept as registered in the Irish horse register.</P>
    <P>Many years ago the Department used to have a roving inspector &mdash; for want of a better term &mdash; I assume it was a gentleman who used to attend sales and various other centres where stallions were for sale.  If a purchaser was buying a horse he could immediately ask the inspector from the Department of Agriculture to decide whether this would be approved or would be included as an approved stallion.  He never ran the risk of purchasing a horse and bringing it home and having it turned down.  This system should again be returned to.  I ask the Minister to ensure in his deliberations, and I hope they are lengthy, that he recognises the importance of this industry.  There is another part of the present Horse Breeding Act, 1934, that has never been included in Bord na gCapall's terms of reference, to my knowledge, and that is that referred to in section 25.  This section deals with the provision of a referee.  If a horse is being turned down for inclusion in the approved list, the owner of the horse may apply for a referee or a panel of referee's to give an arbitration as it were on the decison.  This is extremely necessary because there is a lot in the eye of the <Col N="560" /> beholder when it comes to horses and one man's meat is another man's poison.</P>
    <P>Many mistakes have been made with the Minister's so-called experts in the last board.  I would not use that title to describe them but we assume they are experts: they should be if they are looking after this industry.  They have cast their eye over horses, they have purchased horses that had, in my view, questionable conformation.  I am not just giving my view, I am quoting the view of many experts in this industry.  With much of the a horse is turned down for inclusion in the register there must be a system of appeal or a system of referee.  I would like to ensure that the system which exists now in the Act, which the Minister is asking us to throw out, be continued.  I think this is most important.</P>
    <P>Bord na gCapall operated a most questionable scheme that compounded the natural skulduggery which unfortunately has always been associated with the horse.  It was part of the charm of the industry in many ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the charm of it in some ways, but not so charming if one is at the wrong end.  They had what I always referred to as the half price scheme or the half cost scheme for the purchasing of stallions.  If the private sector were purchasing stallions they could get half the price back from the board.  All of us who have been watching the carry on of this industry can quote stallions that were on the market at £2,500; these would be middle of the road thoroughbreds with good bone, good conformation but perhaps had not achieved much in their own racing career.  A figure of £2,500 is the going price.  The board is suddenly interested and the word gets around, the price is £5,000 but it does not matter as the board are paying £2,500 so we will work it out between us.  It was an open book for skulduggery and it went on wholesale.  How it could have been <Col N="561" /> allowed to exist even for the short time it was there I do not know.  The person who dreamt it up deserves an Oscar.  It just did not work; it only inflated the cost of horses which inflated the cost of the covering price and so on.  There was a knock-on effect all the way down.  I hope I can assume that this brainchild has died with the death of Bord na gCapall.  I have not heard it referred to specifically anywhere but I am assuming it has gone.</P>

      <P>Maybe I am too long involved with the industry.  That could be the other side of it.  I hope the Minister will accept that I am speaking from my heart when I speak fairly passionately about this industry.  I hope the situation is sufficiently polarised for all those interested in the future of the industry to sit down and to sort out which way now. We have a problem with the dwindling pool of mares.  We must give some incentive to those few farmers who still have the half-bred mare to keep her, or perhaps add one more, particularly as other farming enterprises are coming up against problems now.  Financially it has got to pay for the half-bred mare to be kept on the land, land that is eminently suitable for breeding and a climate that is suitable for breeding.  We have the raw material and there are no imports in this industry.  It is labour-intensive and the list of bonuses for looking after this industry is absolutely intense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that we have the right kind of stallions, not too many Irish draughts.  The Irish draughts we have cannot all be the sons of the same sire. We have got to ensure we have enough thoroughbreds with the bone and conformation to cross with our draught mares.  In fact we have got to decide if we want a future for this industry or if we do not.  What the Minister is asking us to do here is not the way forward at this point in time.  Before the abolition of Bord na gCapall we might have been able to make a rational and even a fairly reasonable case for taking the course of action he has proposed here today.  We <Col N="562" /> cannot do it now unless the Minister wants to sign the death certificate for this most important industry and I urge him not to proceed with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Deputy at shows on Sundays but she would not salute anyone.  My support for abolishing this Bill is conditional that the Minister does something about the industry and has a statutory body to look after it.  Bord na gCapall did a fairly useful job but never reached their potential.  There were many wrong things in the board that were not corrected by Governments over the years.  As Deputy Doyle rightly said the horse trading within any horse industry unfortunately leaves much to be desired but it is a way of life.  It is a total way of life and unfortunately is very much a part of the horse industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make representations to ensure that the horse killing factories, Dundalk and Freshford and others might reopen.  I make that request on behalf of some of the itinerants in my area who have come to me.  There might be a double deal in this in the sense that I might get rid of horses off the road; they might get a few quid in and we might all have taxed cars if the Minister would ensure that there was a more open market for the killing of horses at present. I have one poor man with 48 mares, he is plaguing the whole country, including <Col N="563" /> me, and he is very anxious to get rid of them.  The Minister should make sure that that industry would at least come up to the killing standard for European areas, because even for culled horses &mdash; this term is still used in the horse industry &mdash; you take your loss: when a horse is wrong, be it wind or whatever else it is, you take him out then, he is gone and is a loss at the first instance.  Do not bother carrying on to meet another fool to buy him.  There is no point in that.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the fact, that Bord na gCapall will cease to exist from 10 May this year.  With due respect to the Civil Service, who I am sure could keep a register of horses, and would be very good at it, they are not people on the ground who know what is happening in the industry, who know what is happening with the half-breds.  I think always of the famous horse that was bred beside me &ldquo;Dundrum&rdquo;.  Nobody knows who his sire was.  Nobody knows who his mother was, yet a little 15-hand horse could go to Amsterdam and jump 7 ft. 3 in.  There was a standard of 7 ft. 2 ins. at the time. The man riding him was 6 ft. 3 ins.  There was a combination which all the breeding in the world would not produce.  That horse &ldquo;Dundrum&rdquo; was a carthorse for many years.  He brought timber and coal into Cashel town.  But nobody knows his breeding and I disagree with Deputy Doyle in that sense: it is not absolutely necessary to have the perfect breed but it is vitally important to get the correct nature and temperament.  Apart from the drop in the number of horses that we have had over the past number of years from the breeding end, the sad thing is that the German exports in 1981 were 1,500 horses per year, approximately the same figure as we had, 1,600 horses, but the German figures for last year show exports of 3,700, while our figures are 1,500, a drop of 100 on our 1981 figure.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between the Irish event horse, the sport horse &mdash; I find it hard to get around that word, on reflection it is probably a better word &mdash; and the dull German horse that does just basically what it is trained to do.  The <Col N="564" /> Irish horse has far more intelligence, will look and decide with his rider what he will do, in the interest of the safety of the rider and of course himself.  The horse is that intelligent.  After races at Punchestown, in the bank event, you will see the horses stand off, study the height and then jump.  From that point of view our horses have a far better capability but our marketing is dead.  The Germans have brought over sires to America and they are now breeding the Hanoverian breeds in America.  Yet, the Irish horse is not even present, mainly because we do not have enough breeding stock left in the half-bred industry, because it became unfashionable to have a half-bred horse, because the thing to have was a thoroughbred horse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not pay to have a half-bred horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, where I come from the half-breds and the thoroughbreds always paid the rates for the year. In one way it was a good sense of book-keeping. It paid for Listowel or Lisdoonvarna or wherever else one wanted to go.  People were paid £300 or £400 for a half-bred.  But it became unpopular, as it was not the in-thing to have a half-bred mare.  There was status attached to the thoroughbred.  Some of the best people in this world were appointed by the Department of Agriculture, the keepers of stallions, perhaps the greatest characters that God ever made.  God knows you could never vouch for which stallion you got, but at least you got satisfaction somewhere along the line.  I would speak for one stallion, &ldquo;Indian Ruler&rdquo; that stood in Tipperary and produced many good showjumpers, particularly in the pony class, or at least it was alleged to have been Indian Ruler by the man who was in charge.</P>
      <P>I would say here to the Minister that what I am worried about is where there is going to be approval.  I know that the inspection system under the 1934 Act was ridiculous: a man went down, checked to see whether the stallion had two testicles, four legs, a head, a tail and two eyes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> He was then approved with no test whatever of his performance and no test on his impotency or otherwise.  It was a crazy system.  I am sure that somebody got travelling expenses out of it somewhere and it was kept handy in there for a couple of years.  It reflects the lack of professionalism of the Department in this area.  They had not the foresight to see where they were going and the drop from the figure of 81,000 horses in this country in 1970 down to the present figure is frightening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle mentioned the inefficiencies in the AI system of breeding. Far be it from me to take a bit of nature away from the horse, he has only that and the bit of grass left, but I would say to the Deputy that in the case of half the number of horses there is not a correct breeding procedure as they are not fed or grassed properly.  In fact if you look at half the places where stallions are standing at present there is no grass in the field winter or summer.  Mares are put in there in poor condition to be sired; naturally they will not take.  The 50 per cent foaling that we had over the last couple of years has improved.  Let me say to the Minister that ACOT have set up a programme in Kildalton College where they have produced a foal every year from the number of mares they have, because they have looked after the mares.  I am delighted to see that they have started a new course in horse management at the half-bred level in which they hope to have ten to 15 people taking part.  From that viewpoint it has come across very strongly that at least ACOT have recognised the problem and I might say that in an excellent document from the Irish farmers horse breeding executive, which has done a fantastic amount of work in regard to that, they have recognised the need for this.  When we look for diversification in farming nowadays, where wheat, beet and other crops are no longer saleable or in fact profitable, this will be part of the diversification programme.</P>
    <P>We have a reputation for a strong, intelligent horse, a good fast horse, but we are running out of the breeding time for it.  One of the disastrous mistakes that <Col N="566" /> Bord na gCapall made was to take away the £15 to £20 draught mare foal subsidy. The reason why they withdrew this subsidy was to buy stallions, as Deputy Doyle pointed out.  Only two years later when they had £100,000 in their pocket did they question what they had bought and they rushed out and bought every sort of a yoke they could find as long as it looked as if it could perform.  They were going to end up with half the screws in the country instead of preserving the good ones because the good ones will be exported if they are not protected.  Bord na gCapall did a disastrous job in that sense.</P>
    <P>I admire the work they did when they started off on registration.  Let me ask the Minister in regard to the non-availability of passports and the non-availability of points from the SJAI which is linked with the Bord na gCapall computer at present, to get everybody off our backs and to please give the SJAI money to buy their own computer and they will look after the half-bred and the lower end, the pony sector at least.  At present it is disastrous to try to get a passport for a horse.  I know somebody who sold a horse for £3,500 and he cannot get a passport.  To a foreigner the passport is the acknowledgment that the horse is OK.  I think if you buy a horse and you are happy with him the passport does not matter a damn; if he performs that is all you want.</P>
    <P>With the new event or sport horse it is important that the Minister recognises that there must be some official status given.  I do not think the Civil Service are capable of doing the job but I would like to see a statutory board set up, comprising stallion owners, people involved in the industry and two ministerial appointees.  Let the Minister appoint whomever he wants.  Perhaps he can have two people who will report to him and keep his interest on the board, but at least let us have representatives from recognised professional sections of the industry who report and are responsible to their own sectors in the industry, and who will go back to the stallion owners, the mare owners and the SJAI or whoever <Col N="567" /> else it is, be instructed by them as to the attitude to take on the board, so that it would not be a decision of an individual. Deputy Doyle referred to the services of volunteers who were prepared to do the work.  In fairness I think, I am not saying anything about the people who offer their services.  They could be quite genuine but they could be taking a look for themselves as well.  It would be a great opportunity to use official status to turn down a horse and then buy him afterwards.  That is a regular occurrence in the industry but there is nothing we can do about it.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister say that registration will be dealt with in the next couple of months.  That is not good enough.  It must be dealt with now. One or two people from Bord na gCapall who were involved in registration work should be retained to keep the register alive.</P>
      <P>Many people do not realise what a sport horse is.  It is a horse that can be used for pleasure riding.

      <P>Stay back well behind the hind legs.  It just occurred to me that the former Minister opposite was one of the unfortunate people who went missing in that period.  The Department's commitment to this alternative industry is not good enough.  My interpretation of EC regulations was that all horses would be entitled to headage payments but the previous Government allowed only the Connemara breed.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, said in the Dáil that even jennets would be included. I appreciate that was going too far but he did say it.  In the end it was not interpreted that way.  I am sure the Italians would have some large goats included if they heard that jennets were to be in the scheme.  Horses should certainly be included for headage payments because this is an alternative form of farming.  For the sake of people in those areas where farm incomes are decreasing and who have traditionally had a tremendous interest in horses, I hope the Minister will ensure that horses are included in headage payments.  Realistically horse breeding is a part of farming.  All one has to do is go to Punchestown this evening to see the tremendous support, not so much for flat racing but for any form of National Hunt racing.  Every man, whether he knows one end of a horse from the other, has an interest in the ability of horse and jockey to jump and finish a race at speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to meet a deputation from the IFA and ACOT to discuss the restoration of the half-bred industry. Recently I attended a seminar on behalf of the Minister at Kildalton in County Kilkenny.  The 500 people in attendance discussed setting up the half-bred industry properly and restoring it.  There were some grain farmers there on whose lands I thought I would never see a horse who are suddenly becoming involved in this as a real alternative.  There was a lady reporter there from California who said we were totally inefficient as regards marketing. There are those who argue that <Col N="569" /> marketing is done by people like Eddy Macken and Con Power.  However, they market their individual horses, not the Irish horse as such.  It was announced at the weekend that every Irish embassy will have a marketing person.  I believe the Department of Agriculture and Food should also have an input.</P>
    <P>About two weeks ago I was in touch with the Department of Agriculture and Food about 200 horses sold to Algeria. My understanding is that many more horses will be exported to that area. There was a reluctance on the part of the Department to become involved or to give any official recognition to the person who was dealing with the export of the horses.  I do not know how genuine this person was, but the important fact is that horses worth £7,000 or £8,000 each were being exported.  These were reasonable prices for two to three year old horses.  I should like to see a little more flexibility in the Minister's Department.  If somebody within the Department of Agriculture and Food is to deal specifically with the horse industry, that person should become involved in the industry, going around to shows and attending sales rather than being submerged in paperwork.  Perhaps some junior civil servants should be trained by sending them to stud farms, breeders and trainers to show them how the industry works.  In this way they would gradually develop an intense knowledge of the industry.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the restoration of the foal subsidy which is a mere £15 or £25 for a draught foal.  That money was taken by stallions which were bought for two years.  Deputy Doyle rightly said that the success of our show jumpers has made the national flag and the national anthem known all over the world.  While we did not win the big races at Cheltenham, Irish-bred horses won the majority of races.  They do not now belong to Irish owners but they were bred in Ireland.  Six out of every ten races in Cheltenham this year were won by Irish-bred horses.  We do not get credit for that from the English newspapers but this should reassure us about the standard of our industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> The Department, under successive Governments, have been completely lax in regard to the horse industry.  They have no interest in it.  I do not see any reason why the Department of Agriculture and Food should not sponsor a couple of shows each year or at least one prize a year at the RDS.  I was delighted to see the former Fine Gael councillor, Jimmy Murphy, recognised in the RDS a couple of years ago for breeding Boomerang. That was one of the greatest jumpers ever bred here but it took a private company to recognise the good breeding involved. Boomerang was a horse that could not take a bit in its mouth but yet it was one of our best jumpers.  The only recognition for good horse breeding comes from commercial companies who attach their name to successful jumpers.  However, the breeder of the animal seldom gets any recognition.  The little fellow with the cap and the pair of shoes who may have kept the mare for two or three years on grass does not get any recognition.  I accept that the show jumper, the expert, should receive recognition but we should commend the breeder of the animal.  I suggest to the Minister that he introduce a prize for the breeder of the year.  The Department should recognise the importance of breeders and if they do not they will not encourage them to continue.</P>
    <P>In the seventies the attitude was that it was better to have a thoroughbred than a half-bred but that has changed because of the popularity of show jumping.  Now that the Minister of State has taken up an interest in horse breeding I hope he will do something about public liability insurance for annual shows.  It is important that shows are held annually throughout the country for the showing and jumping of horses because of huge insurance premiums show committees are finding it difficult to stage the events. I understand that some shows will not be held this year because the organising committees cannot afford to pay the premiums of between £1,000 and £2,000 for public liability cover.  The last Government neglected that issue and, judging by the way things are going, the present Government will neglect it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> If something is not done about public liability insurance a way of life will be destroyed.  It will mean that if I have to I will stop people from walking over my land because I run the risk of being sued in the event of a person being stupid enough to break his or her leg.  I will have to stop the hunt going through my land if some of the participants are going to be stupid enough to fall and get injured. I cannot afford to be sued because my public liability cover will not extend to those people.  Those people are not invited on to the land but because a farmer is good enough to let them in he may be sued if they injure themselves. Unfortunately, this will make farmers very cautious of neighbours and friends. People may not be allowed to walk through the fields in the evening.  I read of a ridiculous case recently where a man walking on another person's land stuck his foor in a hollow, broke his leg and then sued the farmer.  Surely that farmer was entitled to prosecute that individual for trespassing and that would be ridiculous because there was always freedom to walk across land.  The cost of public liability insurance has escalated because of some of the ridiculous decisions handed down by the High Court and the Supreme Court, encouraged by the legal profession.  We are developing a nation of ambulance chasers.  It amounts to entitlement to money by other names.</P>
    <P>My support for the Bill is conditional. The Act dealing with the inspection of mares and stallions was stupid.  It should not have been introduced if it was not intended to implement its provisions.  My support for the Bill is conditional on the Minister introducing a proper register and supporting the industry by subsidies in the foaling unit.  I appeal to him to support those who keep stallions here. There is a little point in expressing regret when stallions are exported.  The Minister should also adopt my suggestion in regard to an annual prize for the breeder of the horse of the year.  That would encourage tremendous competition in an industry <Col N="572" /> that is dying.  The Minister has an opportunity of playing a major part in revitalising that industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Minister of State, to be conveyed to his Minister, how disappointed I am at the speech with which he introduced the Bill. It is so short as to be contemptuous of the House.  It shows a total disregard for the importance of the subject matter involved.  It is probably without precendent in regard to what it does not say because of the importance and scope of the subject under discussion.  I hoped the Minister would have taken the opportunity in his introductory speech to review the non-thoroughbred industry, to indicate his thinking on the demise of Bord na gCapall &mdash; if he agrees with the decision to terminate it &mdash; and, more importantly, to indicate his thinking on what administrative procedures and financial arrangements are to be put in place to ensure that the work allotted to Bord na gCapall will be continued and improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that in 1970 we had a long Second Stage and Committee Stage debate on the Bill that initiated Bord na gCapall, a Bill that was brought to the House following a survey of the non-thoroughbred industry.  That survey analysed the industry in some depth and made recommendations which were by and large implemented in the Bill which set up Bord na gCapall.  Now, 17 years on, the Government have taken a decision to terminate that board.  The Minister, in the course of this debate, has an appropriate medium to indicate to the House, and the industry, what is to be put in its place.  The Minister has an opportunity to indicate to the House his analysis of the problems of the industry, his review of the performance of Bord na gCapall in the last 17 years, whether that review shows defects in operating procedures, whether Bord na gCapall achieved the objectives of the survey team which initiated the setting up of the board and, if not, why not.  The Minister should <Col N="573" /> indicate how he, as the person responsible for this important sector of the agricultural industry, is going to improve and change things.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Minister's speech is nothing less than an insult to the House because he must have known that a debate of this brief Bill but fundamental in its nature was going to range over the entire non-thoroughbred breeding industry. To initiate a Bill with a perfunctory script of one-and-a-half pages of superficial comment is an insult to the House and an insult to the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is indicative of official thinking and official regard for the industry in question, then God help that industry because its future must be bleak indeed. The Minister will have an opportunity at the conclusion of Second Stage to reply to the wide ranging debate that has taken place in the unusual circumstances that we do not know his policy and we are not in a position to comment on his views of the industry.  However, I hope he will take the opportunity when replying to this debate to cure and repair the omissions of his introductory speech and that he will deal comprehensively with the industry.  It is appropriate that he do so because the vehicle for the debate, consideration of the Horse Breeding Bill, is apposite for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Minister thought that because the Bill was short all the proceedings in connection with its passage would be short.  That is a serious mistake on his part and the lack of seriousness in his approach or in the official approach to this important subject is very worrying and must be a matter of great concern for the thousands of people throughout the country whose livelihoods depend on a flourishing, viable and healthy horse breeding industry.  I appeal to the Minister to deal comprehensively in his reply with the industry, with all the consequences of what is encompassed in this Bill which have been adverted to by Deputies on all sides of the House.  This is very fundamental legislation.  It repeals the Horse Breeding Act, 1934.  When stated like that, possibly it does not sound much, but should this Bill become law <Col N="574" /> we will have for the first time for many years, possibly for the first time in this century or thereabouts, a position where the breeding of non-thoroughbred horses will be totally without licensing controls. That in itself is a change of tremendous magnitude, and the reasons that were given in the Minister's speech perfunctorily and superficially do not justify the passage of a Bill making such a fundamental and far reaching change.</P>
    <P>One has to ask why there was ever a licensing system, and the answer is obviously that licensing systems generally, and particularly in relation to the breeding of livestock, are designed to ensure that the highest standards will be achieved and then maintained in the area which is the subject of the licensing regime.  That is why licensing was introduced in this country as far back, as Deputy Abbott reminded us, as 1918. There may have been control of some sort earlier than that.  Licensing is to ensure that standards will be maintained and the very best quality will at all times be available in that sector of the industry. I am certain that it was not introduced for the sake of having bureaucratic control. There had to be a more cogent <i>raison d'être</i> than merely a neat bureaucratic arrangement.  It is quite clear, and I think nobody will disagree that the reason for having licensing arrangements is to ensure that proper standards are applied centrally and uniformly and that when those standards are met they are maintained. We need high standards because if we are breeding livestock we need the best possible class of livestock.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know that from the unfortunate experiment in relation to the deregulation &mdash; let me put it that way &mdash; of the licensing of bulls and how disastrous lack of controls in that area proved for the quality of the cattle stock. It is no answer to say that the market will ensure that standards will be maintained in relation to the non-thoroughbred industry.  Probably it is a good answer in regard to the thoroughbred industry because that industry is so highly capitalised, the amount of money involved in the value of stock is so large, that people <Col N="575" /> cannot afford to take the short cuts that might tempt them in ordinary commercial activities in the high priced area of the thoroughbred breeding industry. Furthermore, in that industry there is constant performance monitoring on the racecourse which of itself ensures that the breeding standards have to be maintained. There is not an analagous situation with regard to the non-thoroughbred industry because there you do not have, first, the tremendous financial involvement and, secondly, you do not have the constant monitoring by public performance as you have in the case of thoroughbred horses.  Therefore, for the Minister to say that thoroughbred stallions were never licensed and suggest by implication that because they do not have to be licensed there is no need to have non-thoroughbreds licensed either is evidently and obviously fallacious.  It is not a good argument but it is typical of the perfunctory, superficial and unanalytical nature of the Minister's introductory speech.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to maintain the best possible standards in the non-thoroughbred sector.  One way to ensure that is to have a system of the control of the standard of breeding stock, and a way of doing that is to have a system that would have some validity, nevertheless the existence of the system has meant that horses going to stud have had an official inspection to ensure the basic requirements of proper conformation and sound health.  It has also had the effect of ensuring, at least up to recently, that, and this was urged strongly by the survey team who produced the report which led to Bord na gCapall &mdash; that half-bred stallions should not go to stud.</P>
    <P>The non-thoroughbred Irish horse for generations has been a cross between the thoroughbred sire and an Irish draught mare.  The survey team to whom I referred set their face against half-bred stallions on the basis that to introduce them was to introduce into the area a certain amount of mongrelisation to compound the harm that had already been <Col N="576" /> done by letting too many Clydesdales get into the non-thoroughbred horse area. A system of licensing would ensure that stallions other than thoroughbred stallions could be included.</P>
    <P>I am apprehensive that if there is a free-for-all some people for commercial reasons will begin to experiment with the introduction into this country of continental warm bloods.  When one considers the lack of control that would exist in a non-licensing regime, if that happens, then the individuality of the Irish horse is doomed and we will no longer be able to market a typical Irish sports horse.  No purchaser will know whether that sports horse will have a large element of Hanoverian, Dutch, Cleveland Bay or some other such type of blood in his veins.  It would be a disastrous commercial decision and would be bound to reflect badly on the reputation that has endured for many generations.  That is a real danger in removing the licensing regime and is a very strong argument for the Minister to reconsider the proposal in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the demand nowadays for the sports horse is such that the traditional type Irish horse is becoming old-fashioned, out-of-date, no longer suitable.  That is not a good argument.  It has its basis in success which the warm bloods have achieved in the showjumping area.  I would remind the House that showjumping is an artificial equine sport. Horses do not jump obstacles by nature. They have to be trained to it, and for a horse to jump a variety of coloured obstacles of unnatural size in a small area requires a particular type of docile horse. I would not go so far as to say a circus horse, but if I were forced I would say that that description might not be altogether out of place.  It so happens that these continental horses have proved to be suitable for that type of artificial equitation exercise and that has tended to cause people to question the efficiency of the traditional Irish horse which does not seem to be able to compete at the very supreme level with its continental counterpart.  People have come to the <Col N="577" /> conclusion, erroneously, that the traditional Irish breed is old-fashioned and unsuitable for modern requirements.  The traditional Irish breed may not achieve the highest standards in showjumping as consistently as do the continental warm bloods but that is no reflection on the traditional Irish non-thoroughbred horse because it is bred for a different purpose. It is bred to endure and people at the top level of showjumping will always say that if they can get the top class Irish horse they would prefer it any day to the top class continental horse because it has endurance and it lasts.</P>
    <P>For ordinary sports activity the traditional Irish horse is handy and courageous, is a much safer mount and will give better value in terms of longevity than the continental warm bloods.  It would be disastrous if the new non-licensing regime proposed in this Bill were to permit the standing in this country of continental warm bloods so as to invade to their detriment the traditional bloodlines in this country.  It would be a disaster if the purchaser of an Irish horse could no longer know if he was getting the real thing.  One regularly sees an advertisement saying &ldquo;quality Irish horses for sale&rdquo; in the <i>Horse and Hound</i> magazine which is the major equestrian magazine in the UK and here.  That is an advertisement that would disappear because the dealer advertising those horses, having bought them in Ireland, could not be sure what he was going to buy.  That is a very cogent argument, if there were no other arguments for not doing what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech purported to give reasons why licensing was no longer necessary.  He said the reasons for licensing no longer obtained but the argument he used is no justification for the change. The reasons that were there from day one are still pertinent.  The fact that the position of the horse is different now to what it was 30 years ago does not mean that we should not have as high, if not a higher, standard of horse today.  The increasing sophistication of the market into which the horse is now to be sold means that it is more important to ensure <Col N="578" /> we have the highest standards of breeding available and that they should be constantly improved.  It does not follow that because the horse was mainly a source of draught power on farms and an important means of transport in rural Ireland and that is no longer the case, it is a reason for doing away with licensing.  I cannot see the logic in that although that is one of the arguments the Minister puts to us in his speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says that the breeding goals and objectives have altered.  I suppose they have in the sense that we do not want to breed as many horses for draught work or for the trap.  We want to breed horses for riding, although there is nothing wrong with a draught horse for riding.  A draught horse can make an excellent hunter for a heavyish man who is inclined to be dropped occasionally. The point I am making is that while the breeding goals and objectives may have altered, the need to have the highest standards has not changed.  It gets back to the fundamental <i>raison d'être</i> for having a licensing system, and that is to have controls to ensure the maintenance of the highest standards.  The fact that the horse is now used for sporting and leisure activities rather than working activities is not a justifiable reason for ending the licensing regime.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says that modern animal breeding techniques incorporating objective measures of performance have been introduced into horse breeding programmes in this country and throughout the world.  That may well be in the thoroughbred industry where there are objective measures of performance.  Those very visible objective measures of performance ensure that only the best will be bred to the best.  I do not know what the Minister means by modern animal breeding techniques, because so far as I know the technique for breeding horses has been the same since God invented horses and it will continue to be so.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, more sophisticated hygiene arrangements and the like in the thoroughbred industry but essentially in the half-bred industry the <Col N="579" /><i>modus operandi</i> practised in the small stud farms up and down the country has not changed.  I do not know to what modern animal breeding technique the Minister is referring to justify the abolition of licensing.  He is hardly referring to artificial insemination.  There have been successful experiments carried out in that regard in the non-thoroughbred industry. We may well have a future in that area. I cannot ever see it having a future in the thoroughbred horse industry and I do not think the industry itself would be keen on it.  If it is that to which the Minister is referring it still does not do anything to diminish the strength of my argument, that the sire to be used for the implementation of such techniques should be licensed and be of the best possible standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks mentioned that the licensing inspection itself was confined to clinical examination and had little real impact on breeding merit itself.  I do not know quite what that means.  I know what the clinical examination means; I presume that a horse would be seen not to be suffering from any disease and had a good conformation, something that can be established by clinical examination and by visual inspection.  But the Minister says that system of inspection had little real impact on breeding merit itself. Undoubtedly that is true because what has an impact on the question of breeding merit is the capacity of the sire to get the mares into foal.  That is the main consideration of a person going to breed his mare.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible in the half-bred industry to have, if you like, performance-testing because the uses of the half-bred horse are so varied and inconsistent that it is not possible in the same way that performance-testing can be done on a racecourse.  For example, take the question of showjumpers.  It has not been proved possible to date to breed showjumpers, as such.  Clearly it seems to be a lottery as to how good a showjumper any particular horse, thoroughbred or non-thoroughbred, will turn out to be. <Col N="580" /> Attempts have been made to identify particular stallions as being pre-potent in regard to getting showjumpers.  I do not think there is any scientific basis for any conclusion along those lines.  Some stallions became fashionable and were well sold with that reputation but I do not think it is anything more than that, as Deputy Davern said when he instanced the case of the famous pony, <i>Dundrum.</i> Obviously it is very much a lottery, a freak of nature, whether a horse will be able to perform supremely well in that particularly artificial form of equine activity, showjumping.  Likewise, the horse that is bred for hunting does not have to perform to any particular consistently measurable standard.  He has to be a safe ride, a courageous and a handy horse that can jump normal obstacles reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we do not have to have any system of performance observance there to decide on breeding policy because we know from experimental observation which has gone on for generations that that type of sport activity &mdash; the traditional cross of the licensed thoroughbred sire and the half-bred mare &mdash; has produced the best hunters to be found in these islands.  The performance of those hunters up and down this and the neighbouring country, generation after generation, is all the proof one needs of their performance capacity.  That, of course, has taken place under our system of licensing which kept out of the breeding area the half-bred, the warm-blood and any other non-traditional breeds.  I wonder, if we allowed the warm-bloods and the half-breds to go to stud, what sort of performance we would get from their progeny in the hunting fields in the years to come.  The other area of growth for the sports horse is in eventing.  All the indications are that the traditional cross, or possibly the three-quarter bred horse, is and will be the ideal horse to perform in that difficult sport to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>If we were to remove licensing and its attendant controls and standards in spite of the fact that the Minister was, to all intents and purposes, denigrating the <Col N="581" /> licensing system that has been operated here for the past 50 years &mdash; if we were to remove those controls which have worked in practice, we would do immense damage to the Irish sports horse and would not be able to take advantage of the new market emerging for the event horse.  There are all sorts of competitions taking place under the general unbrella of events, various cross-country rides.  They do not have to be in the form of threeday events with the three disciplines dressage in cross-country and showjumping. Hunter trials are now becoming a very popular form of sport, cross-country riding over made obstacles and will become an even larger sport.  In Britain it is becoming a very big sport with teams competing over manmade courses, a cross between a point-to-point and a three-day event without the formality of the latter or the competitiveness of the former, an ideal form of active leisure riding with a growing market for the traditional and typical Irish hunting horse.</P>
    <P>If we allow our traditional types to be eroded by permitting the introduction of untypical stallions we will not be able to service that market.  It may be argued: why should the introduction of untypical stallions follow the end of the licensing system?  I suppose one could argue it should not follow but, having regard to human nature, people will experiment, there will be commercial pressure from the Continent to try to get their types introduced into our horse scene.  Possibly they could be sold as an attractive commercial proposition for a breeder who would want to be first to take advantage of or to use one of these new sires.  Before we knew where we were, they would be in position, servicing mares and the harm would have been done.  As sure as day follows night we would have sires of that type coming onto the Irish non-thoroughbred scene.  That will follow if the licensing system is abolished, as proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know &mdash; because the Minister did not tell us &mdash; what are his views on the future of the non-thoroughbred industry. Bord na gCapall are being put away.  We will be anxious to hear what will happen <Col N="582" /> to the implementation of the recommendations of the survey report of, I think, 1969 designed to put in place a regime which would restore the non-thoroughbred breeding industry to a healthy state.  One of the ambitions of that survey was to improve and expand our stock of draught mares.  Certain steps were taken in that regard which have been moderately successful in that they halted the rate of decline in the availability of such mares but did not halt the actual decline.  The reason was perhaps a lack of precision in identifying true Irish draught types.</P>
    <P>I recall visiting the Horse Show in Ballsbridge where there is a class for draught mares and looking at that class of mares one could not say there is such a thing as an Irish draught type because in that class there were what we traditionally regard as Irish draught mares, slightly feathered, plainish and not very big but with plenty of substance.  On the one hand there were mares of that type and on the other hand there were clearly what were half-bred mares with a lot of thoroughbred blood in them.  Yet they were parading in a class confined to typical Irish draught mares.</P>
    <P>The identification, selection and retention of the typical Irish draught mare was not tackled as it should have been by Bord na gCapall.  I do not know whether the people in charge have thrown their hat at the possibility of restoring the predominance of that type of breeding mare. It would be a pity if they did because if that type of mare was bred out it would only be a matter of time before we would have all quasi-thoroughbreds.  At that stage the only alternative, if one wanted a non-thoroughbred horse, would be the introduction of the continental warm bloods.  It would be a great pity if we were to let that fundamental part of the horse industry disappear.  The vigour that comes from that cross of mare cannot be replaced by any other cross.  It is very important for the future of the non-thoroughbred industry that it is retained.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to hear the Minister's views on the problems facing the non-thoroughbred horse industry.  We would <Col N="583" /> also be very glad to hear more comprehensive views from him, views with more of an analysis and depth to justify the ending of the licensing of stallions for non-thoroughbred breeding.</P>
    <P>The views the Minister gave us in his perfunctory introductory remarks do not stand up to any sort of analysis.  If licensing is to be abolished what controls will there be with regard to the physical environment in which a stallion will be standing? What controls will there be over its management and so on?  If there are no such controls will the lack of them have a detrimental effect on the fertility level which is already less than we would like it to be?  There could be a poor environment, poor hygiene and poor feeding because there are no controls proposed for the future.  Will that mean that the already poor fertile rate will become even worse?</P>
    <P>The short answer is that the commercial necessity of having a sire that can get its mares in foal will ensure proper standards but unfortunately that does not necessarily follow.  Even the standards of environment of some licensed stallions leaves something to be desired.  That position will be compounded if all controls are removed.  Unfortunate owners of mares will bring them to be serviced by stallions who, because of their unhappy environment, will fail in a large number of cases to put the mares in foal.  By the time the word percolates through the district about that stallion the harm will be done.  The stallion owner will then possibly be forced to get rid of it.  Very often it may not be the fault of the stallion but because of bad management.  If we are to abolish licensing controls that danger will become a real one.  If everybody who owns a stallion managed it according to the highest standards there would be no need to worry but unfortunately human nature does not operate to the very highest standards, even where there are commercial considerations such as the stallion fee.  Where the fee is paid that is the end of the matter unless the owner offers the service on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  Having regard to the small <Col N="584" /> fee charged for the non-thoroughbred mare that requirement is very often missing.</P>
    <P>Another problem relates to the profitability to the person who breeds the sports horse.  He wants to get the best price possible for that horse.  It is unfortunate that one has to wait a number of years before the full value of the horse can be realised.  The yearling is more valuable than the foal as regards non-thoroughbred stock and the two year old is more valuable than the yearling but the three and four year olds are worth real money because the purchaser who wants to keep that horse for some specific equestrian purpose can start to work on it immediately, breaking it and preparing it for riding.  No purchaser will buy a yearling or a two year old because he will have to feed it for another two years before it is ready to break.  In those early years the animal will have to be left with the farmer.  Very often he does not get the proper value for the horse because when it is sold, it is sold, to use commercial jargon, without any value added. It is sold unbroken and raw.  Some consideration will have to be given to devise a method whereby some added value can be provided for the farmer who decides to breed a non-thoroughbred horse so that he will get the maximum value for his work, whether that system will involve instructing the farmer or whether it will involve some sort of centralised facilities where he can bring his young stock to have certain preparatory work carried out on them.  That problem must be addressed if the breeder is to get the maximum value.  Unless he gets the maximum value it is possible that his breeding operation could be uneconomic. That would be the case if the horse is not prepared to the required standard to ensure he achieves maximum growth and so will look well when put up for sale.  As regards the quality of mares, as I mentioned earlier, this will have to be looked at because it is important that the result of breeding will be horses of good conformation, good temperament, a decent size and that they would be straight movers.  All these matters can be <Col N="585" /> the subject of breeding providing care is given to the foundation of stock.</P>
    <P>This gets back to the basic objection we have, and an objection which was expressed by some Members on the other side, to this Bill.  In this important sector of the agricultural industry, the controls to ensure the best standards are being removed and no good or cogent reason has been offered to this House for removing them.  I urge the Minister to look again at what is proposed here.  If he has more convincing reasons, we would like to hear them but I doubt if he has because it would be incredible for him to come before us and keep his ideas up his sleeve. There is no point in doing that.  I am sure he would want to make the best case possible for his Bill.  I have to assume he does not have any other reason and the reasons he put forward this afternoon do not make a case for bringing in such a fundamental change in this important sector of the agricultural industry, a change to a regime we have had since the beginning of the century, a change which impacts on the entire industry.</P>
    <P>Because of the impact this change will have on the industry, it behoves the Minister to give us his views on the industry &mdash; how he sees it developing in the future, what trends he thinks will show, what market will emerge, how he thinks the Irish farmer could serve that market and how he is going to encourage the farmer to get into the budiness.  For people engaged in this industry this has to be more a labour of love rather than a venture for commercial profit, and they are entitled to know what their future is.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the non-thoroughbred industry is as strong as it is because the returns are very marginal economically speaking.  Horses are bred on many farms for reasons of family sentiment, there was always a horse around the place, and every generation is loathe to be the last to have a breeding mare. That particular sentiment more than harsh commercial reasons has kept non-thoroughbred breeding alive here for so long.</P>
    <P>I am glad that hunting is in a healthy state and that more and more farmers are <Col N="586" /> taking part in it because the more who do, the more will want to breed horses for their own use.  It is only appropriate that one should pay tribute to the landowners who permit hunts to cross their land.  Because of the changing nature of farming, there are difficulties arising in parts of the country, but in my experience these difficulties are usually overcome with a certain amount of goodwill.  As I said, this sport is in a healthy state.  It has been my experience that in areas where there are hunts farmers are glad to see them because they are part of the tradition of the area, part of the rural scene and they have the very important consequence of keeping down the fox population. For somebody who suffered from that predator, any farmer would be glad to see that under control.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to rethink on this Bill.  I impress on him the need when replying to the Second Stage debate to give better reasons than he gave when introducing the Bill.  He should give us reasons that will justify to all of us here, and more important, to all in the industry, that what he proposes is a good thing and is for the good of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go into this Bill in depth as some of the other speakers have done in their excellent contributions this evening.  The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, and thereby abolish the licensing of stallions.  Under the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, stallions aged two years and upwards must be licensed with exemptions for thoroughbred stallions kept for the service of thoroughbred mares, racing and training for racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1970 approximately 1,100 stallions were licensed but in 1984, the last year in which licensing was operated, the figure was reduced to 500 and receipts from licence fees declined from £940 to approximately £300 in the same period. Inspection for licensing, which was purely clinical, was carried out by veterinary inspectors authorised under the Act for that purpose.  Inspections were made in the case of first time applicants only. <Col N="587" /> Once licensed, a stallion was not reinspected but the licence had to be renewed each year.</P>
    <P>Since 1976 inspections for licensing were carried out in conjunction with Bord na gCapall's inspection of stallions for inclusion in the Register of Approved Stallions.  Under the board's inspection system, stallions were examined for soundness, conformation, movement, temperament, etc.  If approved, they were entered in the board's register and passports were issued giving them official status and providing recognition.</P>
    <P>On the advice of their breeding subcommittee which was representative of the various sectors of the non-thoroughbred industry, Bord na gCapall recommended that stallion licensing should be abolished.  They stressed that the examination for registration was more thorough and effective than the clincial examination for licensing required under the Act, irrespective of the merits of the board's inspection for the Register of Approved Stallions, the case for continuing a licensing system no longer exists.  The decline in the number of stallions for licensing and the small effect of the licensing inspection on breeding quality justify the abolition of licensing.</P>
    <P>Times have changed since the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, was introduced.  At that time the horse was the most important means of transport and power, especially with regard to agriculture. Over the years the numbers of horses have declined.  Mechanisation has taken over and in this area agriculture is very much to the forefront as on most farms the horse is no longer kept solely for work.  Farming is mechanised and farmers use only the most modern machinery.</P>
    <P>Breeding is most important and modern techniques must at all times maintain very high standards.  Our racing establishments have made world headlines and are worth millions of pounds to our economy as well as providing much needed employment.  In the show jumping arena we have commanded tremendous respect over the past number of years but our top show horses have been <Col N="588" /> lost to the country.  I should like to see some form of subsidy or tax concession introduced to encourage prospective groups or syndicates within the country to purchase outstanding horses.</P>
    <P>I also support the concept of a special prize, mentioned here this evening, for the top breeder.  Something in the region of £2,000 would create a lot of excitement and competition.  It is also important that arrangements are set in train for the operation of the Irish horse register until a decision is made in regard to its future. I look forward to an expansion of the bloodstock industry in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the merit in repealing the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, but in the non-thoroughbred area, where licensing played its part in the earlier years, there is a need for some form of self-regulation and orders issued by the Minister to the industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foley outlined the vast reductions in the number of stallions due for inspection.  That highlights the changes in agriculture where the non-thoroughbred horse played a vital role. We built a very solid base here which manifested itself in many facets of the show jumping and equestrian world. Because the horse is a very important part of our agricultural activity and is no longer needed because of mechanisation there are worries, doubts and concern that that sector of the industry could suffer greatly in the coming years.  While I appreciate the difficult fiscal position in regard to Bord na gCapall, the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred industry should have some form of self-regulation and contribution to ensure that their vital role in the image of Ireland as a base for sound breeding of non-thoroughbred horses is maintained and encouraged. The repeal of the Bill is understandable but something should be done in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody doubts that the horse industry has been a great earner in the past.  Like agriculture, it is an area of productive growth and investment.  Where better to look than this sector which possesses the land, grasslands, lime and all the other <Col N="589" /> ingredients but which, because of the high costs involved in operating a non-thoroughbred establishment, has probably declined?  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should recognise the need for progressive forward thinking in that sector.  The tremendous success of thoroughbreds has possibly had a negative effect on the non-thoroughbred area. Anybody interested in bloodstock is inclined to go into the blue blood line sector and is not particularly enamoured of the non-thoroughbred area.  However, we know from the Spring Show, the Horse Show, the Nations' Cup and the Aga Khan Cup how successful our horses have been.  How often have we heard commentators tell us that the winning horse is Irish bred?</P>
    <P>There is a danger to this sector of agriculture and I would not like to think that the repeal of the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, and the decision regarding Bord na gCapall would mean a downgrading of the non-thoroughbred sector of the bloodstock industry.  If anything, it needs to be encouraged.  In the suburbs, people can benefit by the proper licensing, regulation and safety standards for the non-thoroughbred riding school establishments. It also makes them feel closer to a rural setting.  There is a vacuum in that sector which needs to be filled.  I know there are many demands on finances but in the thoroughbred betting sector, perhaps the tote, a fund should be creamed off and put in the direction of the non-thoroughbred animal.  We agree that it may not be a competitive, lucrative, financially successful business but it is a very desirable sector of agricultural activity.  The farmer today does not have the same concern for grazing a horse which means that stallion numbers have reduced dramatically, thus reducing the number of horses generally except in the thoroughbred sector.  This is understandable but is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food to introduce a scheme which would encourage the farmer to turn to the non-thoroughbred sector.  It has been a tremendous success over the past ten or 15 years and Ireland has become a major <Col N="590" /> base breeding sector, probably second only to the United States, for thoroughbred stock.  That shows how investment can be encouraged and the imaginative tax incentives introduced by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance laid the foundation for growth in the thoroughbred sector.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Durkan here; he represents a county second to none in its achievements in that sector.  The industry is a very big employer and has excellent potential in that regard.  The non-thoroughbred side of the industry, unfortunately, has not had the same growth and success and the example shown by the thoroughbred sector is an indication of what can be achieved if the right pioneering attitude is adopted by the Department and if the climate is right.  Other areas of the Department of Agriculture and Food could make a contribution in this area.  An experiment has been tried out in County Cavan &mdash; I do not know if it has been successful &mdash; in endeavouring to establish a progressive breeding establishment for the non-thoroughbred animal.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee in 1977, the first company we decided to visit and investigate was the National Stud.  The chairman at the time represented the non-thoroughbred sector on the board.  The cost of operating the National Stud and the demands of the thoroughbred sector probably led to neglect in the non-thoroughbred area of the bloodstock industry.  I urge the Minister, through the National Stud, to try to set up some form of non-thoroughbred similar establishment.  In the midlands, on the west coast and in County Cork in particular there is a breeding potential in the non-thoroughbred sector of the industry which has gone untapped and has probably deteriorated.  There is a lucrative export market for the non-thoroughbred animal if confirmity, temperament and all the other attributes mentioned by Deputy Cooney are present among the non-thoroughbred stock.  I hope the Minister can give us valid reasons for this Bill dealing with the repeal of the 1934 Act and I urge him to <Col N="591" /> ensure that we do not take a retrograde step in this vital area.</P>
    <P>The Coolmore Stud which is near to your home base, a Cheann Comhairle, has been a major success.  It has played a pioneering role in the international bloodstock industry and has shown what can be achieved if the basic inputs in terms of investment, research and so on are present.</P>
    <P>During the past number of years a virus has caused many problems to the bloodstock industry, especially in the thoroughbred area, in which there is vast veterinary investment.  I hope that as a result of the repeal of the 1934 Act there will be no slackening in the area of veterinary guidance and supervision in the non-thoroughbred sector.  The virus was responsible for closing down some of the country's largest racing establishments and had very serious implications for the breeding sector.  The veterinary profession were not able to identify the virus. The Ballydoyle stable had two very lean years as a result of the virus and virtually every other stable throughout the country during the past number of years has been affected by this problem, too.  The Minister should inititiate research in order to find the reason for this virus and to determine how it might be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the resources which previously went to Bord na gCapall would in some form be directed towards the non-thoroughbred sector.  The community generally, but young people particularly, can have contact with the horse industry through the non-thoroughbred sector.  I can cite five or six riding stables in my own constituency which are run on a shoestring. They are a major facility.  One aspect of them is that boys and girls from urban areas can make contact with a rural setting. Some form of encouragement and financial support should be given to these establishments.  I sincerely urge that the Department give equal consideration and priority to the non-thoroughbred sector <Col N="592" /> of the blookstock industry.  We have competed with the best in the world in this sector be they the Argentinians, the Germans or the British.  The Irish non-thoroughbred horse has excelled and has been the foundation and the breeding stock for many of the very successful international showjumping teams during the years.  Our teams down through the years which have appeared in the international arena have played a key role in promoting the image, quality and the many other facets of Irish life.  This is very important too, from a tourism point of view.  In Europe particularly we are accepted as one of the key blookstock countries in the world.  It is important that we keep to the forefront in that respect.</P>
    <P>I can well understand that the Minister and his staff are preoccupied with the various crises with the reform of the CAP and so on, but I urge that this particular sector not be neglected.  This sector was a major money maker for the small farmer in days gone by when the breeding of a horse and having a horse on every farm was a very important part of farm life.  If there was some form of scheme which would encourage the breeding of the non-thoroughbred horse there would again be a growth in that area.  This would result in a very worthwhile export trade.</P>
    <P>I hope the new arrangements will be introduced quickly.  At present there is a vacuum which I urge the Minister to fill as quickly as possible.  Registration for the showjumping sector, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the interface between the Showjumping Association of Ireland and Bord na gCapall, is at present in a valley.  The Minister must move quickly to bridge that gap and to make sure that the non-thoroughbred sector of the horse industry is given the priority it deserves.  In conclusion, I urge the Minister to ensure that whatever steps are to be taken are announced as quickly as possible.  As the showjumping season is rapidly approaching some decisive decisions should be taken.  That vacuum cannot be left unfilled indefinitely. There is to be a transfer of staff <Col N="593" /> and the downstream organisations which depended on Bord na gCapall have to be facilitated in the new arrangements under the Department.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to take decisive action in that area and to take some progressive steps in the non-thoroughbred blookstock area.</P>
    <P>This sector has served the country well and was very much a part of the small and medium-sized farm.  The National Stud should recognise the role that that sector of the bloodstock industry has played in Irish agricultural life.  Of the taxpayers' money invested in the National Stud a fixed percentage might be directed towards the non-thoroughbred sector.  Because of the telephone number figures involved in the thoroughbred sector it is easy to neglect the non-thoroughbred sector.  I urge that whatever decisions are taken in the future, the non-thoroughbred sector should not be neglected merely because it is not the glamorous side of the horse industry.  I urge those points on the Minister and trust that he will take some decisive action, particularly in regard to Bord na gCapall.</P>

      <P>In the Statute Books for 1934 there is an extensive Act entitled The Horse Breeding Act, 1934. Before us today we have a Bill which is so short as to be frightening.  This Bill does just one thing.  Basically, it repeals the 1934 legislation.  It repeals the entire Act of 1934 and abolishes the licensing of stallions.  This is very serious.  The Bill was initially published by our Minister when in Government.  Since then Bord na gCapall has been abolished and the position has changed very drastically.  In making this proposal the Minister will do serious damage to the half-bred industry which has been a major feature of the horse industry in this country for many a long year.  It is vital that the Minister should now review the overall situation and seriously reconsider establishing some form of either registering or licensing stallions for breeding purposes.  The 1934 Act was a good Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, and that of the other Members I wish to allow Deputy McGinley three minutes of the time available to me.  Last night our spokesman in this area, Deputy Allen, outlined our position on our amendment.  The Minister for Health, who I regret is not present at the moment, and the Fianna Fáil Government have thrown our health services into chaos and confusion.  I have thought about the position and feel that I must say lives will be put at risk as a result of some of the cutbacks announced in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Another major side of what we are discussing &mdash; inpatient charges which we are seeking to have repealed tonight &mdash; heralds the beginning of the end of public medicine in this country for other than the medical card holder.  This is a major issue we have not addressed in this debate.  It is quite clearly only the beginning of a process.  Next year, as has happened with all these charges, it will be £20 or more.  We shall see the amount gradually increasing until the facilities and services which people have come to expect will no longer be available other than to those on medical cards.  This is being done unilaterally, without consensus and without any clear sense of direction.  This whole approach is totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being offered brutal cuts together with these charges which are affecting jobs and services and leaving, as Deputy Allen in particular outlined last night, the huge bureaucracy of administration untouched.  I should like to develop that point a little.  Services and jobs are suffering most as a result of the level of cutbacks announced by this <Col N="596" /> Minister, of which the charges are a further element and a further pressure, both on those already trying to administer the services and on the public at large.</P>
    <P>In Dublin alone up to 1,000 jobs in voluntary and Eastern Health Board hospitals and services are being brought to an end &mdash; some of these have already been axed.  In the Eye and Ear Hospital 29 nurses were laid off last week.  All of us know the huge problems in the Dublin area and throughout the country.  One of the hardest hit hospitals is to be St. James's Hospital.  There we are seeing total services being abolished, services such as the maternity unit.  That unit serves public patients only.  It is unique in that it offers the poorer citizens of Dublin an opportunity to have a single class hospital service when they are having children, rather than going into a two tier hospital service as offered elsewhere. The maternity services, which are traditional, have been offered to people for well over 100 years now and they are to go.  The vein clinics are offering a service to women in the city which is much needed; otherwise patients would be living in pain.</P>
    <P>Most tragically, the service for infertile couples is also affected.  It is proposed to axe entirely this service which is the only one in the country.  The only alternative for people who find themselves in this sad situation will be to go outside the country for this service in the future.  Perhaps if they are lucky enough to be able to afford it, they can get private services if these are developed here.  The bone marrow transplant unit installed only 18 months or two years ago with a great deal of private finance is no under threat.  Again, this offers the only service of this kind in this country.  That is one of the most upsetting things about the whole effect of the <i>ad hoc</i> cutting that has occurred here.</P>
    <P>The vital, unique services will go and moneys will not be made available to protect them.  Similarly, doctors are having to face impossible choices.  As one doctor put it to me, hospitals will now have to choose between spending on one expensive operation for a child with rare <Col N="597" /> leukaemia or, say, on 20 elderly patients suffering from bronchitis.  This is the kind of choice people will have to make.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that private medicine will flourish as public medicine declines and only those who can pay will be assured of service.  In St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, an eminent heart specialist due to retire this summer is not to be replaced.  This means that when patients are presented to the hospital with heart attacks, life saving skills will be present for only a minimal period of time when the single remaining heart specialist is on duty.  There can be no doubt that this is putting lives at risk and ensuring ever longer waiting lists for much needed treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a decent politician and a reasonable person, but I put it to him that he has made a hames of the health services in this the Government's first budget.  The charges are unacceptable and even more unacceptable are the further cuts he has implemented.  A better way of saving as much money was rejected by him most unwisely and, as a result, not only were these charges necessary but the extra £10 million cuts in the services led to a great deal of the most unsatisfactory consequences I mentioned earlier.  He and his party must bear full responsibility for the chaotic outcome, the beginnings of which we are now seeing in the hospital services today and which clearly will continue for months ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister had no mandate and sought none to do that.  He approached the electorate with an entirely different approach to the health services.  In that context I ask him to consider the much wiser and more publicly acceptable and humane approach of the outgoing Government.  I ask him to reconsider their measures.  If not, I ask him to approach the Minister for Finance and look for some of the funds which have come in over and above what was expected from the national lottery to ensure continuation of the vital services I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Maith go leor, a Cheann Comhairle.  I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy Flaherty, and you, Sir, for giving me a few moments to place on the record of the House the widespread concern and anxiety felt throughout the North Western Health Board area at the announcement last Thursday that they will be cut back by £2.83 million between now and the end of the year, in other words, £4.25 million in a full year.  That will have a devastating effect on the sick, elderly and handicapped in the north-western region.  I give a few facts. Already it has been decided by the health board that 300 people who have been looking after patients are to be laid off immediately.  In Letterkenny Hospital, which is one of the acute hospitals in that area, 90 people have been laid off and from 1 May they will operate on a five day a week basis &mdash; something new and revolutionary.</P>
      <P>This is in stark contrast with the policy enunciated by the Minister when he was in Opposition last year.  I have here a copy of a motion which was proposed by him as spokesman on Health on 27 May 1986 in the House.  I quote from column 189 of the Official Report a motion by Deputy O'Hanlon, now Minister for Health:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann warns the Government that the lives and the health of members of the public are now at risk in many areas because of the dismantling of the health services and calls for the immediate restoration of adequate funding to health boards and hospitals as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>That is the motion which was proposed on 27 May 1986 by the now Minister. Later on in his speech at column 190 he stated that:</P>
      <P>For example, in Letterkenny they are closing down medical, surgical, gynaecological and ear, nose and throat wards for two months in the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> The health board in my area in Donegal operate a number of training centres for the mentally handicapped.  In Gweedore there is a centre catering for Irish speakers. I met a number of patients at the weekend who are anxious and very worried about what the future holds for that centre.  I appeal to the Minister to keep this centre open.  These people have been forgotten and ignored for a long time. The services have been initiated and I ask him to continue with them.</P>

      <P>The issues arising from this motion were aired at considerable length in this House when the Minister for Health introduced the Health (Amendment) Bill providing for the imposition of outpatient charges.  They were further and comprehensively debated in Seanad Éireann when I introduced that legislation in that House.  We were in a minority in that House and the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were in a position to vote down the charges at that stage.</P>
      <P>Even the proposers of the motion must admit that the detail of the regulations now being discussed was indicated precisely during those previous debates.  The charges to be imposed both for inpatient and outpatient services and the categories of people which will be excluded from charges were also made crystal clear.  In other words, the provisions of the three sets of regulations are not now being made known for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the provision of the regulations, I would like to make a few general comments.  Despite the attitude in certain quarters, it is clear that there is a new realism among those involved in the management and provision of health services.  There is a new and clearer appreciation of the issues which face the country.  The unthinkable consequences if remedial action is not taken are widely understood and appreciated, but maybe not by the Labour Party <Col N="602" /> who puts down this motion.  The measures, however regrettable they may be, which have to be taken are recognised. Nobody is under any illusion that there will have to be a significant reassessment of what the essential components of the health services must be in the future. This will be quite traumatic given the expectations of the population and the providers of services derived from the days of unparalleled development in the late seventies and early eighties.  It will mean that for the foreseeable future a much more streamlined health service will be the order of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Within this, essential services and services to the most disadvantaged must be preserved as a priority.  As I said, the need for the present approach is by and large accepted.  The tough decisions will be taken and carried through.  The fact that there is this realisation current within the services makes it possible in the spirit of co-operation and understanding to see this crisis through.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that in the current and following years the health services will not only be decimated but that the standards and levels of care so painfully developed over the years will be lost forever.  I do not accept that this will be the case or that it has to be the case. I suggest that the health services had reached the point where there was a great deal more emphasis placed on the quantity of services provided rather than the quality of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future of the service must see a much greater emphasis on quality.  The demands of former years for more and more of everything must be replaced by a precise assessment of what is actually needed, how much is needed and how best that need can be met.  The motivation is certainly now present for taking this approach.  It may be due to the very blunt instrument of economic necessity. It nevertheless affords the opportunity of taking the much needed critical look at what must constitute an affordable, <Col N="603" /> efficient and effective service.  Rather than wallowing in a gloomy resignation to hard times, it is essential that this more positive and constructive attitude be taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In this critical evaluation, it must be recognised that the allocation of public funds brings with it a dual responsibility.  Resources should be allocated in a manner which will ensure that we get the best value for the money we spend.  In addition to getting value for money, however, we must also ensure that resources are directed towards those in greatest need.  All public services, therefore, must be administered and delivered in a manner which will allow us to approach the achievement of these objectives.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that it is only in periods of acute resource constraint that clear recognition is accorded to these essential goals.  We must accept that the national pool of resources is limited, also that the demands of the population appear to be unlimited.  There is thus inevitable tension which exists between demands and resources.</P>
      <P>The current stage in the development of our health services might best be described as one in which the tension between demands and resources has been stretched to straining point.  While the allocation from the national resource pool has been limited, the volume of demands to address health needs continues to increase.  We are therefore faced with a basic inequality.  Our resources cannot be stretched far enough and wide enough to cover the same level of demand which was previously possible.  Good will and good intentions cannot, unfortunately, balance the equation between shrinking resources and increasing demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leaves us with just one choice: to re-define the service needs which we can realistically meet from a smaller pool of public funds.  In so doing we are also <Col N="604" /> recognising the responsibilities which better off members of the community must bear if the more deprived groups are to continue to receive the health care required.  The challenge we face is to introduce measures which are both efficient and equitable.</P>
    <P>If we are to optimise the return on our resources, we must ensure that people are treated at the most appropriate level of care.  One of the factors which has contributed to the spiralling demands on the health services is the fact that people have been drawn to seek the most expensive type of care.  That type of care has been usually inpatient care, even if it is not necessarily the most appropriate type of care for their needs.</P>
    <P>To make the system more efficient, therefore, we have had to introduce incentives to ensure that the best choice will be made regarding the type of service to be received.  The provision of inpatient and outpatient services has therefore been carefully reviewed as we have worked to revise the system to enable the achievement of this objective.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of growth expenditure on health services has been the world-wide trend in recent years.  The means of coping with this situation has been the pre-occupation of virtually every country and international health organisation.  It is essential, therefore, that this country recognise that it is not dealing with a pecularily Irish problem but one which is being addressed internationally. The solutions which are being put forward by various countries arise from a consensus view of the problems they face.  The lynch pin in these solutions is that spending by the State must in overall terms be controlled and brought more directly into line with what we can afford.  It must be accepted, that while the signs of difficulty were recognised some years ago, no efforts were made to commence the remedial action necessary. The over-run of the budget by £55 million is a clear indication that with the conflicting ideological views within the former Cabinet they were unable to take the necessary action to deal with this massive over-run of public expenditure. <Col N="605" /> That is why this Government are now faced with the major task of bringing some stability into the situation at this late hour.</P>
    <P>It must be abundantly obvious that this Government are prepared to tackle this task irrespective of how difficult and how unpopular it may be.  We were elected to govern and govern we will, irrespective of the electoral consequences because we believe that what we are doing is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing is required of us because of the lack of Government during the past four and a half years by Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
      <P>Surely nobody expected that the almost unlimited demand for resource for the health services would continue.  Yet the indications are that many people were prepared to ignore the inevitable consequences and continue to demand and spend unabated.  There may have been some unrealistically optimistic hope that somehow and somewhere the day would be saved by an injection of funds from some unknown source.  There are no unknown sources for funding public expenditure except taxation.  The single major source is taxation which as everybody in this House knows is approaching its practical limits.</P>
      <P>Those who now proclaim outrage at the measures being taken to contain costs would rightly be even more outraged if it were decided to continue spending in an uncontrolled way with the inevitability of further and unbearable taxation.  The Government takes no pleasure in having to introduce these charges.  It takes no pleasure in finding itself in an inherited position where the desirable level of resources for health services cannot be made available to agencies.  It is an unfortunate and shameful price we have to pay for years of mismanagement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health services are no exception to the harsh reality of the budgetary situation which the Government are prepared to tackle and to resolve in its <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The <Col N="606" /> need for such measures is universally recognised.  The reality of implementing such measures has resulted in this debate here this evening on one aspect of the Government's programme.  The charges for inpatient and outpatient services will allow health boards and hospitals to collect much needed revenue to maintain existing services and employment.  Without such additional income the existing financial situation will deteriorate to such an extent that services will be reduced together with employment.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the detail of the provisions of the regulations.  The basic philosophy underlying the charges is that those who cannot afford to pay for inpatient and outpatient services will not be asked to do so.  Those who are in a position to pay the charges will be asked to pay.  This philosophy is fully in line with the overall budgetary strategy of this Government in protecting the disadvantaged members of the community. Additionally, the revenue raised from these charges will assist in the maintenance of services for all, including the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to consider carefully the import of these regulations.  I would ask the House to leave aside the political point scoring so that the community generally will be aware of what precisely will be involved.</P>

      <P>Fear is being generated by irresponsible and incorrect statements on what these regulations imply.  It has been suggested that people fear that they will be refused services at hospital because of these charges.  That is totally untrue.  It has been suggested that even lives would be put at risk.  That is totally untrue.  I believe it is a shameful playing on the basic concerns of people for ulterior political motives.</P>
      <P>Let me make it very clear again that only those who are in a position to pay the charges will be asked to pay.  Nobody will be refused admission to hospital because they are not in a position to pay. No lives will be put at risk because these charges are being imposed by our Government.  It is not a situation, as stated by Deputy Howlin last night, of all but the very poorest being charged.  This is a most exaggerated interpretation and indeed is untrue.</P>
      <P>Let us take the Health (Outpatient Charges) Regulations.  These regulations provide that a charge of £10 shall be made for the first visit only to an outpatient department.  I want to emphasise that. The charge is in respect of a first visit only.  All subsequent visits in respect of the medical condition which required that first visit will be free of charge.  I would like to remind Members of this House that in the Western Health Board area, they were actually imposing a charge for some years for outpatient services at hospitals, a charge of £5 for every visit by a patient, and that was actually operating during the regime of the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, a charge of £5 for outpatient services by the Western Health Board and other health boards and I presume the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, was aware that these outpatient charges were being imposed.  That is why I regard it as being totally irresponsible for a former Minister for Health &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was not aware of those charges he was not doing his job as Minister for Health.  I presume the former Minister, Deputy Desmond, was aware of what was happening in the Department.  I presume that he was aware of those charges and that he will clarify this if he has an opportunity to speak.  In fact, I personally know of a case of a person who visited an outpatient department 12 times.  He had a particular difficulty.  A boiler blew up in his home and he was charged £60 for the 12 visits. There is nothing new about these out-patient charges.  I fail to understand the former Minister.  Maybe there was a majority decision.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt.  His party made the decision and then I presume he had to go along with it irrespective of whether he agreed with it.  The point is that out-patient charges are not new and, in fact, a visit to a general medical practitioner would be more expensive than going to the outpatient department of a general hospital and paying £10 for all the services related to a particular problem.  I also feel that £10 is a very reasonable charge for X-ray and other services.  Of course medical cardholders and their dependants will not be liable for the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By definition, people who are unable without undue hardship to pay for services for themselves and their dependants are entitled to medical cards.  This covers about 40 per cent of the population.  The second category is women receiving services in respect of motherhood.  That means women who are receiving services related to their pregnancy will not be liable for these charges.  The third category is children who are receiving treatment for the listed diseases and <Col N="610" /> disabilities.  The fourth category is children being treated who have been referred from child health clinics or school examinations.  The fifth category is people receiving services in respect of the infectious diseases which have been prescribed.  These exemptions also apply in the case of the Health (Inpatient) Regulations.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is only the most obstinate or those who insist on confining themselves to ideological point scoring who could claim that great care has not been taken to protect those who should be protected.  The list of exemptions is comprehensive and keeps strictly to the principle I mentioned of only requiring those who can pay for services to do so. In speaking on the outpatient charges, I would like to refer in particular to the fact that the charges will apply in accident and emergency departments.  I believe this is justified.  It is justified not merely as a reasonable means of raising needed resources.  It is justified, I believe, as a disincentive to what has been accepted as an abuse of casualty departments.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable debate in recent years on the need to provide health services at the level that is most cost efficient and effective and appropriate to the particular condition.  The inappropriate use of high technology and expensive hospital facilities has often been cited as a particular example.  I would agree that such facilities should be used only for those conditions which require that level of expertise and specialisation. Therefore, the use of casualty departments of general hospitals for conditions which could much more appropriately be treated by general practitioners is an abuse.</P>
    <P>However, it is not the case that the charges being imposed in such circumstances are punitive.  A £10 charge is about the average charge made these days by general practitioners.  As I have said the exemptions which apply to the outpatient charges will also apply to the inpatient charges.  In addition, people who are in long terms care in geriatric, <Col N="611" /> psychiatric or mental handicap institutions will not be liable for these new in-patient charges.</P>
    <P>Again the level of charges for inpatient care &mdash; £10 per day subject to a maximum of £100 in any 12 month period &mdash; is a reasonable contributions to ask from those who can afford to pay.  It is wrong to say that the £10 charge will apply to every day spent in a hospital over one 12 month period.  In fact it applies only for a period of ten days and a maximum of £100, irrespective of how long a period a person may be required to spend in hospital.  The charges cannot be regarded as excessive when regard is had to the trend in recent years of shorter and shorter lengths of stay in hospital with the trend of an increase of outpatient services rather than inpatient services.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are two very important issues which apply to the provisions of both sets of regulations.  The first is the powers of chief executive officers of the health boards which are enshrined in the Health Act, 1970, whereby they can deem people in cases of hardship to be eligible for a particular service.  Those who have suggested major difficulties for people not eligible for medical cards should take note of this provision when making public statements.  The second is the scheme that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board will be introducing to coincide with the commencement of charges.</P>
    <P>Even though the charges which will be imposed are relatively modest, it was decided that people should have the option of insuring themselves against them.  Therefore, a scheme has been developed by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  The details will be announced shortly and will be available when the charges commence on 18 May. It is likely that the cost of the scheme will be of the order of £10 per year for a single person and £25 for a family of four.  In other words, it will be possible for single persons to insure themselves against the charges for about 20p per week and a family for about 50p per week.  Also this new VHI scheme, unlike other schemes, <Col N="612" /> will be available to all persons who wish to join, irrespective of their age or medical condition.  Existing VHI policy Holders will be covered free of charge for the current year.  Given the need for the income from charges, can even the Opposition claim that such costs are prohibitive?</P>
    <P>In the light of the limitations and exemptions which I have mentioned, I find it difficult to understand the logic of the statements made by a number of organisations representing people working in the service that, on principle, they would refuse to be involved in the collection of these charges.  Does this mean that these organisations would prefer to see even more drastic reductions in the level of services rather than collect a charge from those who can afford to make a contribution?  Is it appreciated that as approximately 70 per cent of health services expenditure is in respect of pay, further restrictions of available resource must mean a reduction in numbers employed in the services?  While I can understand that this reaction may have been an immediate response to the proposed charges, I sincerely hope that, on reflection on the dire consequences, this stance will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to appeal to those involved to review their position on the collection of these charges which are reasonable at this stage when resources are so limited.  If these extra charges are not collected the health services will be in greater difficulty than they are today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I do not believe that the indiscriminate cutbacks now being made by Fianna Fáil in Government are being fairly and equitably allocated.  It is also obvious that very little thought has gone into the proposed measures, either on their long term effects on the quality of health care for the general public or the practicality of collecting the various charges proposed.</P>
      <P>What is particularly evident is that the bureaucracy of the health service is to be totally protected, while the full brunt of the cuts is to be borne by the frontline personnel, such as nurses, social workers and those for whom the services exist, the patients.</P>
      <P>We seem to have an unhappy knack in this country of being unable to run any service without a massive bureaucracy which, in turn, eats up the vast bulk of resources allocated for the services, and thereby strangles their net value.  The health services appear to be a major case in point.  Over the years the cost of the health services has grown considerably but the greatest drain on the budget has been the doubling in the administrative cost of that service.</P>
      <P>Where, I ask, is the evidence of the improved nursing and hospital services directly relevant to the patients?  Therefore, one of the unavoidable issues of this debate has to be the future of the health boards and whether the health services could not be more efficiently delivered by a far more streamlined administrative structure.  For instance, is it really necessary to have these large representative boards, including TDs and local councillors, whose relevance to the delivery of health services is highly questionable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' amendment accepts the need for health charges <Col N="614" /> but one of our guiding principles is that the burden must be shared fairly.  Where is the evidence that the cutbacks now being applied to the frontline personnel are being shared by the senior administrative grades in the health boards and by hospital consultants?</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister one example of the crucifying effect the <i>ad hoc</i> health cuts will achieve.  The County and City Infirmary in Waterford is indeed a very good example.  Here we have a hospital which is jointly sharing the burden in many aspects of health care with Ardkeen Hospital.  These are the only two general hospitals in this location.  As I am sure the Minister is aware, the Department of Health and the health board agreed some 18 months ago that there should be a joint Department of Surgery and Anasthetics between the County and City Infirmary and Ardkeen Hospital.  This combination has made available 80 surgical beds, which I believe is the average figure, but the Department of Health have now imposed a 24 per cent cut in the County and City Infirmary's budget.  This cut is so savage that it will effectively denude this hospital of its ability to function to the required standards, thereby forcing its closure in the long term.  This would mean an immediate loss of some 38 beds in the surgical area.  On top of this, there will be 20 per cent fewer surgical beds available in Ardkeen Hospital because of the general cuts for that hospital.</P>
    <P>This will effectively mean that in a catchment area of 110,000 people the total amount of surgical beds available will be 40.  This, I put to the Minister, is a national disgrace.  No other country throughout the EC, America or indeed most of the western world would have this kind of a ratio and it makes a mockery of the health service provided in this area.</P>
    <P>When we look at the area of the acute medical service provided in Waterford, does the Minister not realise that 40 per cent of the necessary beds are located in the County and City Infirmary Hospital? It is already an established fact that Ardkeen Hospital is severely under-bedded as a county hospital and the County and <Col N="615" /> City Infirmary has always been a necessary back-up.</P>
    <P>There is also a genito-urinary service available in Waterford, 50 per cent of which is based in the County and City Infirmary.  Equipment has been bought and installed, nurses have been trained and a surgeon appointed.  The result of the Minister's cuts will effectively nullify this service and not alone will we be at the loss of the service but all of the large cost input will have been spent for nothing.</P>
    <P>The County and City Infirmary exclusively provides a cancer treatment clinic which is held in Waterford under the auspices of St. Luke's Hospital.  This is the only such service available in the whole area.  I cannot believe that the Minister was aware of all these points when the quite arbitrary and crude cuts were applied to this hospital.  This is not an area with many general hospitals but the people of Waterford and the surrounding areas depend largely on the County and City Infirmary Hospital providing a basic and very necessary service in the area of general hospital services without which people's lives would be put at risk.  I am sure this example can be applied to many constituencies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would also like at this point to highlight a very alarming dimension to the cutbacks which has received no attention. That is the vital work done by social workers in the disturbing areas of child neglect and child abuse.  The cutbacks now mean that many social workers, who are technically classed as temporary employees, have lost their jobs and this vital work they were doing has to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>Another key child-care issue falling foul of the cutbacks is the work of fosterage, also administered to a large degree by these social workers.  Are these vulnerable children now to be abandoned and the whole work of moving children out of institutions and into foster homes to be seriously disrupted?  While these are some of the elements of the casualties of the health cutbacks, the real overriding <Col N="616" /> feature of this Government's budgetary strategy where health services are concerned is a continuation of the crude, <i>ad hoc</i> cuts of the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of any coherent plan based on the fundamental requirements of the Irish health care system in the late 1980s.  That should be based on the strategic requirements of the service here.  How many acute hospital beds do we need; how many psychiatric places? What services can be delivered in daycare centres?  How is the service to be administered most efficiently?  What is the appropriate structure for operating the services?  How can a proper service be delivered, which does away with the scandalous waiting periods that GMS patients encounter for many services? How are specialists and consultants to be made accountable to the taxpayer for the fees they are paid under their contracts of employment?</P>
    <P>What I am asking for simply is a clear national health plan to decide once and for all our requirements in different health areas.  This should get us away from the present unfortunate <i>ad hoc</i> cutbcks, where some services, and some health workers, are excessively penalised.</P>
    <P>Where the specific issue of the £10 charge is concerned, the Minister's exclusion category is too narrow and fails to take account of the plight of low-paid workers.  That is why the Progressive Democrats in our amendment want the exemption category to be broadened to include family income supplement recipients. We also feel that a proposal we first put forward last October for a nominal prescription charge of 50p per prescription, with old age pensioners excluded, would be a more equitable way of reducing the cost of health services to the State.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the proposed special VHI scheme to cover people liable for the £10 charge subject to the annual ceiling of £100.  The Minister in his speech last night said with regard to this scheme:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The scheme will be moderately priced, say of the order of £10 per year for a single person and £25 for a typical family of two adults and two children, full income tax relief will, of course, apply in the usual way in respect of these premiums.</P>
    <P>I believe that very little thought has gone into this scheme by the Department of Health and I would like to know from the Minister on what basis he has arrived at the figure of £10 per single person per year and £25 for what he terms a typical family?  How does the Minister propose that this scheme is to be costed?  Who will join; who will pay?  How are the VHI to seriously deal with long-term or pre-existing illnesses?  How is the money to be collected?  What will be the cost of processing the tax relief on £10 from all of the people the Minister expects to join the scheme?</P>
    <P>If the scheme does not raise the expected £12 million as the Minister has indicated and the cost to the Revenue Commissioners of administering the tax reliefs is greater than the net gain, will the Minister scrap the tax relief from this scheme and then seize on the opportunity to do away with tax relief on the other VHI schemes?  I want unqualified assurances from the Minister that he has no intention of doing away with tax relief on any VHI scheme.</P>
    <P>The charges the Minister proposed in the House last night from the VHI, to me, seemed to be ludricrously unworkable and would appear not to have any basis in reality.  This evening we had an addendum to that by the Minister of State who is now talking in terms of 20p per week for a single person.  It may be that the intention is to make it sound more attractive.  It is quite obvious that if the new scheme premium is to be as low as the Minister has stated, the funding of this scheme will quite obviously fall on existing members of the VHI, thereby increasing subscriptions.  The alternative to this is to bring the VHI to financial ruin?  If it is the case that this scheme is to be funded by existing VHI members the Minister should state so and come clean with the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> If the Minister is really serious and wants to reduce the cost of the health service, there are many ways this can be achieved.  One glaring example of this is that GMS doctors and pharmacists should not be paid on a fee per item basis but should be paid on a <i>per capita</i> system such as now operates quite successfuly in the UK.  This, I believe, would not have a detrimental affect on the care of patients but would have a major impact in the cost of the medical service to the State.  It would, of course, also have the effect of reducing the amount of prescriptions issued here.  The cost to the State &mdash; the latest figures available are in the 31 December, 1985 report of the General Medical Services Payments Board &mdash; is £66,930,000.  This is quite a staggering figure and I would respectfully suggest to the Minister, and to the Department, that if doctors operating on the medical card scheme were to be paid <i>per capita</i> payments, rather than a fee for every visit, not alone would you have a reduction of their huge costs to the State, but indeed, a substantial in excess medicines which are obviously consumed. Surely the Minister will agree that this is a far more practical, imaginative and caring approach to a proper health service than the disgraceful butchery in the type of <i>ad hoc</i> cuts that the Minister, and his Department, are introducing.</P>
    <P>I want to point out also to the Minister that the VHI administration costs are very low by Irish standards and indeed, by international standards.  In fact the administration ratio expressed as a percentage of subscription income was 6½ per cent as at 28 February, 1984 and this also included marketing costs a commendable state of affairs.  Is it the Minister's intention to bring the VHI into line by making it another administrative bureaucracy by seriously increasing the area of required administration?  It is obvious that no real thought and planning has been applied to what appears to be an ill-thought out hairbrain scheme.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this issue, I want to highlight also the scandalous problem of arrears of health contributions from some self-employed people and some farmers <Col N="619" />&mdash; I deliberately state &ldquo;some&rdquo; because I accept that many self employed, and many farmers, do pay their health levies &mdash; resulting in millions of pounds being outstanding to the health boards around the country.  I would like the Minister to give us now the most up to date data on the total amount outstanding in health contributions, and what steps are planned to ensure that this money is paid up. Clearly a no-nonsense approach here could lead to the recovery of much of this money and that would help alleviate the immediate difficulties of funding facing the health service.</P>
    <P>To summarise our position, the Progressive Democrats do not believe that the health cutbacks are being fairly shouldered across the entire health service. Workers at the frontline are taking the full brunt.  This must change, and hospital consultants and senior health board personnel must also bear their share.  The health charges fail to take account of all categories of people who should be exempt.  In particular, we propose that families on the family income supplement should be added to the exempt category. Moreover, we want to see proper planning introduced into our health services, and an end to the crude <i>ad hoc</i> cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Without a radical rethink, Ireland's health services face a major crisis.  Today the Irish taxpayer is paying over £1 billion for a health service that is grossly inefficient, very costly and would be better described as an illness service.  It is now time for a major review of all aspects of the health service to cover its overall objectives, to bring about the delivery of an equitable and efficient service to clarify eligibility to various services, to determine how the services should be financed and to devise procedures for monitoring and controlling all health affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Health services in many areas have been pared to the bone.  The hallmark of any civilised society is its treatment of the elderly and the ill and yet it is those categories, particularly the lower income group, who will suffer as a <Col N="620" /> result of the imposition of these charges. Those who can afford private medical care, who can pay for a stay in a private nursing home, will not be affected.  It is clear from their first few weeks in office that Fianna Fáil have taken a decision to single out the health services for particular attention.  The decision to introduce charges for visits to outpatient departments of hospitals and overnight stays is an indication that we are witnessing the systematic dismantling of the limited public service that has been built up over the years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that there will be a free medical service available for familes of five, earning less than £130 per week but how can one expect a family, with an income of, say, £140 per week to pay these charges?  That family will be over the limit for a medical card and cannot afford to pay charges.  Those paying PAYE and PRSI are not assessed on net earnings for full eligibility and I contend that that amounts to a grave injustice.  It is my experience that many of those who do not have full eligibility cannot afford to go to a chemist to get medicine after a visit to a doctor.  How does the Minister expect such people to be able to afford to pay the charges he is now proposing to introduce?</P>
      <P>Whatever one may say about the dire circumstances of the unemployed it is worth mentioning that a large number of families on low income are marginally over the limit for eligibility and are being caught in the poverty trap.  Despite Government assurances that there will be a hardship clause people generally live in fear of getting into further debt.  I am well aware, as I am sure every other Deputy in this House is aware, that the parents of asthmatic sufferers very often do not have the medical treatment provided that their children require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imposition of charges for outpatient treatment and maintenance is an attack on the dignity of people some of whom at prsent have to seek supplementary welfare allowance.  I refer to the category of people on low income who have mortgages they cannot afford <Col N="621" /> to pay and who have to seek supplementary welfare allowance.  Those are the people who are now going to be asked to pay for inpatient and outpatient service in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>The failure of successive Ministers and the Department of Health to reorganise the health services is deplorable.  In the course of years the Southern Health Board, of which I am a member, have made submissions to successive Ministers, and as recently as 1986 after a great deal of deliberation a submission was made to reorganise the GMS scheme. That submission was ignored completely. If the scheme were changed as mentioned by the previous speaker, and a <i>per capita</i> grant or salary were paid there would be a massive saving to the health board and to the health services generally.  Why has no effort been made to reorganise the GMS scheme?  I suggest respectfully that it be done now rather than imposing the charges.  The fee per item system should be abolished and replaced with a <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more important to a nation than is the health of its people, and health services should never depend on the ability of any citizen to pay for them.  We in The Workers' Party believe that all health services should be free and should be paid for out of general taxation.  Those who can afford to pay more should do so through taxes while those who cannot should get the same high quality care and treatment.  That is not happening at present and it is deplorable that the charges being imposed will affect that position adversely.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is that the transfer to central taxation of almost the entire burden of funding the health services is given as justification for transferring management control of services to the Department of Health.  This is becoming more and more centralised.  It is contended that Central Government are responsible for funding.  That argument is as spurious as it is hoary as it is the people's money that is being used to pay for the services irrespective of which source it comes from.  I ask to have this charge withdrawn because there is no <Col N="622" /> doubt from what I have been hearing from the people, and I know they mean what they say, that they will not pay because to impose this on the less well off section of our society is a further grave injustice.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer this evening to a number of erroneous statements made by speakers especially from the Labour Party in connection with the regulations imposing charges for in-patient and outpatient services.  Some Members in this House are deliberately misleading the public as to the extent of the charges, the level of the charges and the circumstances in which charges will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Health explained clearly and categorically, the charges will not be imposed where they will cause undue hardship.  This is a fact and it is clearly enshrined in both sets of regulations, in paragraph 4(1)(g) of the outpatients regulations, and paragraph 4(1)(h) of the inpatient regulations.  The reality of the statutory provisions has not been accepted or taken on board by Members on the Opposition benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that if they acknowledge it they will undermine the very basis of their objections to these necessary measures.  As certain Members have failed to recognise these provisions in the regulations I will refer to the Health Act, 1970, from which these provisions have their origins.  Section 45(7) of that Act provides that, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Any person...who, in relation to a particular service which is available to persons with full eligibility,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> that is a medical card holder.</P>
    <P>is considered by the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board to be unable, without undue hardship, to provide that service for himself or his dependants shall, in relation to that service, be deemed to be a person with full eligibility.</P>
    <P>The section is quite clear.  It means that if any person is unable without undue hardship to pay the charges in respect of inpatient or outpatient services he or she will not be asked to pay.  What could be clearer or more specific?  Yet it is totally ignored by Opposition Members.</P>

The moderately priced scheme will represent excellent value for money at around £25 for a family of two adults and two children.  This scheme is a reality.  I noticed that Deputy Cullen was worried about the scheme and thought that it would not be workable; then he went on to praise the VHI Board for their great ability in administering the voluntary health scheme that is there at the moment.  He will be glad to know that the VHI Board devised this scheme and will be operating it, not the Minister.  I am sure he will be happy with that.  It is about time that a sense of realism entered into the consideration of Members on the other side in relation to the proposals put forward.

      <P>Over two months ago we had a general election and three issues dominated that election to the virtual exclusion of everything else.  The first issue was that there should be no further increase in the general rates of taxation. The second issue was that there should be no increase in Exchequer borrowing and the third was that there should be no cuts in public expenditure.  About 90 per <Col N="626" /> cent of the people who voted in that election voted in favour of those proposals and tonight they will reap the harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>About 10 per cent of the electorate did not support these three propositions.  We pointed out in the general election that we were in favour of a fair and equitable general system of taxation to support essential health services. Our policy did not find the benefit of electoral support because we had Deputy Haughey standardising taxation at 35 per cent and the PDs standardising taxation at 25 per cent admittedly on a more modest time scale of five years. Fine Gael decided that a provision for health of £1,117 million in non-capital expenditure should be provided in the Estimate.  The country supported that proposal because the country was in favour of reducing public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of the Labour Party leaving Government on that issue, we predicted in a press statement which we issued that major hospitals such as the Mater, St. Vincents, St. James's, Cork Regional, Limerick Regional, Galway Regional, Sligo and Ardkeen Hospital would be left seriously underfunded in 1987.  We were right in assessing the position at that time.  We said that all of these cuts would mean that staff throughout the health services would have to be made redundant and that this effectively would mean that the health services would suffer irreparable damage in 1987.  The media did not give it much attention because they were fastening to a prospective gargantuan debate on RTE between the outgoing Taoiseach and the prospective Taoiseach and, of course, they were captivated by the PD's.  We proposed in our analysis at that time that we should not give way on the fundamental need to preserve our basic health services, to speak honestly to the people and say we were not afraid to pay the price of funding those services even if it meant increased health contributions, even if it meant foregoing <Col N="627" /> reductions in taxation and even if it meant bringing in a more draconian regime to ensure that those who were not paying their tax would pay it.  We were not listened to at that time.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are fortunate now in having at least 12 Labour Deputies who are prepared to put that historic development in Irish politics into perspective this evening, because there was a <i>volte face</i> of monumental proportions on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I recall the leader of the Opposition at the time, Deputy Haughey, accused me of accepting the Fine Gael shilling by becoming a Coalition Minister.  I can say, with profound respect to the Taoiseach, that he has accepted a whole Fine Gael budget and another £9 million on top of it and he is implementing it now tonight in this health debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and this is the nub of the issue, that demand for health services which are provided free at the point of use is to all intents and purposes insatiable.  This is not a statement of political dogma, it is an economic fact.  I would suggest to the Minister and to the Department of Finance that this is fallacious. It is true that the demand for health services is insatiable.  However, in a fair society this demand is controllable in an equitable way by rationing a limited degree of hospital resources to citizens based on their health needs not on the money in their pocket.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the concept of health care.  Our policy is based on the <Col N="628" /> principle of an adequate level of general taxation to provide general eligibility for the health services.  Admittedly the health services, in themselves are inately limited in scope and must be rationed at the point of usage, not on the basis of paying for the service at that time.  One pays, in advance, by way of health contributions, by way of taxation.  Then one uses the services and one is not crucified by £10 a night at the point of usage.</P>
      <P>We have the new approach of the Fianna Fáil Party, an historic departure in health care.  We have the approach of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; which I very much regret to say is the approach of the former Fine Gael Minister for Finance, influenced largely by the Department of Finance rather than by political reality &mdash; who will now foster a two-tier system of public and private health care based, for the most part, on an outmoded poor law health mentality.  That is the reality of what we are introducing. Apparently these three parties now believe that the ordinary people will behave themselves in relation to the social services, will not use them if they have to pay £10 every time they visit an out-patients' department, or stay overnight in a hospital.  Therefore it is a concept of modest or nominal charges.  I reserve for the approach of the Progressive Democrats a special personal odium because they try to have it both ways.  At least the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil approaches are relatively honest.  We know where we stand with them.</P>
      <P>These charges will constitute a direct financial imposition on 1.2 million people, namely, those outside the scope of the GMS and the VHI.  What do the Progressive Democrats propose to do? They propose to grant an exemption to 5,000 families in receipt of the family income supplement, 5,000 out of 800,000 families.  What a glorious, caring concept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Five thousand families out of 800,000 families will benefit. I would suggest, with due respect to the <Col N="629" /> Taoiseach &mdash; a man who has prided himself with monumental capacity to verbalise his care which, in many respects, I accept but he does tend to overdo it &mdash; that the introduction of a £10 charge in relation to children of six weeks and over, to say the least, is petty, mean and vicious.</P>
      <P>We are today celebrating the anniversary of the inception of the 1937 Constitution which says that we will cherish all the children of the nation equally.  One might well ask: what do we do on that basis?  Take the case of the child of a man and woman with earnings of £125 a week going into, say, Crumlin, Harcourt Street or Temple Street Hospitals, the child being seven weeks old.  Does one take a measuring tape and ask: is it seven weeks old, let us weigh the child, let us bring in the birth certificate because if the child is seven weeks old they will be charged £10 to see a hospital consultant?  Of course, they will not see a hospital consultant. They will see a junior hospital doctor because on Mondays and Tuesdays the consultants are looking after their patients for the few hours they are there and, on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday mornings, they are on private practice.  So they will not see a hospital consultant.</P>
      <P>Then the Minister says that from 18 May, those people can join the VHI.  Will a person who joins the VHI and who pays £25 for himself, his wife and two children, when he turns up at an out-patients' department receive VHI treatment? Does he say: I have joined the VHI, I was never subscriber before, I want to see a consultant.  He will, in his eye, see a consultant.  The mother will wait for seven hours and will be lucky if she sees a senior charge nurse who, in due course, will mark her down for, perhaps, Tuesday next.  Then she takes the bus back to Tallaght which will have cost her £3 or £4, goes back to her GP, pays him another £12, and then goes back to the outpatient's department and pays another £10 there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In this budget, in this health situation, what have we done?  We are cutting back on the basic health services. There was no great necessity to do so because we were short, roughly speaking, £60 million to £70 million.  We could have increased health contributions from the 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent. That would have yielded the £70 million without the anger, frustration, loss of earnings and livelihood now being imposed on 2,000 people, or 2,000 jobs being abolished from the health services on a completely irrational basis through the application of a crude embargo policy on 500 separate grades in the Department of Health.  It is now quite impossible to endeavour to operate a rational application of the Estimates for 1987.  What happens?  Health contributions are going up by a quarter of 1 per cent on a ceiling of £15,000 now, amounting to an extra £37.50 a year on a family with earnings of up to £15,000 annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wants to get cover now with the VHI for in-patient and out-patient care that will be free for the remainder of this year since the VHI have not yet proposed a scheme.  A scheme is to be introduced on 18 May, it has not been advertised yet and we do not know its details except for the crude outline given by the Minister. One way or the other, on top of an additional contribution of £37.50 there would be another £25 payable to the VHI.  Then, if one is sick what happens because of the interlocking between the Departments of Health and Social Welfare? There will be no point in having 26 stamps in order to claim disability benefit. One must have 39 stamps to one's credit; one gets nothing for the first nine months <Col N="631" /> of insurable employment.  Then what happens?  One pays £10 a night in hospital and, on top of that one loses £20 a week in respect of pay-related benefit, constituting a double imposition.</P>
    <P>Health expenditure is being cut massively and social welfare is being reduced simultaneously in respect of disability benefit.  If one remains sick, the following year one is stuck for another £100 and, unless one has four years' stamps as against three, one will not go on to long duration benefit.  Here is a caring society, all for the sake of the equivalent of four months of the national lottery moneys. That is all that is involved.  We opposed that imposition on people.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, on balance, were right in their decision to rescind the proposed prescription charges.  I willingly concede that.  I spent four years trying to convince people that if one imposes a prescription charge all that happens is over-prescribing. For every £1 in terms of visits there is £3 in terms of drugs prescribed involved.  If one imposes a prescription charge it simply means that a doctor will prescribe twice the usual quantity to last two months and that medicine will be poured down the toilet at the end of four or five weeks.  It is drugs that are the issue, not prescription charges, as such. It is the cost of the drugs that matters.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister has restored the GMS Vote to £107 million. I understand we shall have the revised Book of Estimates published within the next few days when I hope a <i>per capita</i> scheme will be introduced with a proper <Col N="632" /> pension scheme, not a public service one, but one under which there would be contributions payable.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on this note.  There is a price to be paid for the health services. The Labour Party are not afraid to pay their fair share.  It is true that there is £28 million in health contributions outstanding and that the farming community do not want to pay these contributions. It is equally true that Fianna Fáil are bolstering up the farming community with the abolition of the land tax, by way of a further incentive not to pay.  On that basis we must persuade people that they have a simple, stark choice.  If they want less taxation they must accept a lower level of health services.  That is the bitter corollary to be spelled out.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that apparently this evening the Government will endorse a decision under which our health services will be diminished, affecting the basic fabric of one of the fundamental social services built up painfully over the years &mdash; right from the early forties &mdash; because our society has become mean, vicious and selfish.  Those who are sick, unemployed or aged and those with disabilities will suffer from the cuts being proposed in this exercise.  They are the people whom we were elected to protect and we have failed to do so.  We ran scared before the electorate with cheap promises, particularly orchestrated by the Progressive Democrats and I reserve special odium for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that high levels of radioactive caesium were detected by Dr. McAulay in soil sample in parts of County Louth.  I have been advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that contamination levels in lamb and beef from that area do not reflect the high contamination levels found in these soil samples.  All but one of the food samples taken by the board from the Louth area during the first six months after Chernobyl revealed total caesium concentration of less than 400 becquerels/ kilogramme in respect of lamb and less than 270 becquerels/kilogramme in respect of beef.  One sample of lamb taken in June, 1986 showed a total caesium concentration of 827 bq/kg which was the peak level found in the area for lamb and beef.  Monitoring results indicated that the health risks to the Irish people are very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have also advised me that contamination levels in recent samples of foodstuffs from County <Col N="500" /> Louth are quite low.  Levels detected in beef and lamb are much less than 100 becquerels/kilogramme in most cases, and do not represent a health hazard. Contamination levels in vegetables are barely detectable.  The results of the board's sampling and monitoring show that the radioactive contamination level in Irish foodstuffs in much lower than that found in the soil and well below the levels at which control measures might have to be considered.</P>
    <P>The soil sampling programme undertaken by Dr. McAulay was welcomed by the NEB as it enabled the board to concentrate its resources on determining contamination levels in food which is a priority consideration.  The board has commenced an extensive soil survey programme aided by EC funding in collaboration with An Foras Talúntais and Trinity College.</P>
    <P>Uptake of radioactivity in Irish foodstuffs will continue to be closely monitored by the board.  I wish to emphasise that food exports are continuously monitored in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and the food exporting industry and meet not only EC requirements but even the very low limits set by the overseas market.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the proposals, if any, he has to change the road traffic regulations so that speed obstacles can be installed in housing estates thus minimising the risk to children at play on the roads of these residential areas and if he will amend the Roads and Motorway Act, 1974, regulations accordingly as these impediments are most successful in the USA.</P>

      <P>Section 32 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, which came into force on 12 November, 1986, empowers the authority, subject to my approval, to direct a road authority, part or all of whose functional area is within the authority's functional area, to provide road ramps on a roadway in order to restrict the speed of mechanically propelled vehicles.  The section also provides for the making of regulations by me specifying the procedures for the issue of such a direction and requirements as to the installation of the ramps and these regulations are now in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given to the inclusion in a road traffic Bill of appropriate provisions governing the installation of road ramps by road authorities in areas outside the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of road ramps is to reduce vehicle speeds and in particular to minimise dangers to pedestrians and pedal cyclists, especially children, in residential areas.</P>
