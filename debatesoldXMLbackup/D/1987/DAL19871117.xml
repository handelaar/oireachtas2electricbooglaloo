      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate if the Attorney General's Office are considering any proposals to amend the Constitution that may be necessary arising out of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court on the Single European Act in the context of this country's ability to enter into Treaties at international level with other countries and also in the context of the validity, under our Constitution, of existing agreements?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of priority.  It is a matter which requires detailed and meticulous examination. Many aspects, such as domestic and international law, have to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, there is a case pending in the courts, and the other matter, the UN, is the key to the whole examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 45, 50, and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for 1988 which were published recently provide for the continued payment of child benefit on the same basis as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of introducing a degree of selectivity into the child benefit or children's allowances scheme, has been <Col N="685" /> considered over a number of years.  The previous Government had decided to introduce selectivity by making child benefit taxable.  However, the administrative difficulties which arose in trying to match the child benefit and income tax records were such that the proposal was abandoned.</P>
    <P>An alternative way of achieving selectivity would be to have an income limit for payment of child benefit.  The application of an income limit would also pose major administrative difficulties depending on the income data which are used to determine entitlement.</P>
    <P>In a situation of limited resources there are strong arguments in favour of applying a degree of selectivity in the child benefit scheme, whether through taxation or through an upper income limit. The administrative feasibility of achieving such selectivity is being examined by officials of the Departments concerned and the question will be discussed by the Government when that examination has been completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect the present inter-departmental consideration to be completed shortly? Can we expect any changes in child benefit in 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate what the Government might do in the future. The investigations have been ongoing for some time.  The Deputy will probably be aware that there are considerable administrative difficulties involved in matching the data from different sources.  At this stage I could not say how long this will take or whether it will be a success, but the Departments concerned are pursuing the matter in a fairly urgent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister, who has a preference for selectivity, to illustrate in any of the policies he has pursued to date where that selectivity has been applied?  As far as I can see he has been totally unselective in everything he has done, including the Christmas bonus. <Col N="686" /> What was the basis of his reply to me on 11 November when he said that the saving by discontinuing child benefit payment to those with an income of over £20,000 would be £26 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy at that stage had asked a statistical question on the implications of an upper income limit, if such were imposed.  An upper income limit of £20,000 for child benefit would effect a saving of £26 million in a full year.  The effect of taxing the child benefit would be of the order of £54 million. For example a £25,000 upper income limit would result in savings to the Exchequer of £12 million.  These are purely theoretical calculations at this stage on what the position might be if such a decision were taken in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the statistical base for the figures which the Minister has just given?  If he has that statistical base why can he not be more selective in paying child benefit, giving more to the poor and less to the well off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The information is based on estimates by the Revenue Commissioners of the people who would come into the different income limits.  Problems arise when one goes to match such information, as the Deputy is probably well aware, with the information in social welfare.  In the Department of Social welfare child benefit is paid for each child and we, therefore, have complete information on the numbers of children and their details.  The Revenue Commissioners' information is separate from social welfare and is collected for different purposes.  If one were to impose an upper income limit, one would obviously have to be able to match the two sets of data.  That difficulty arose when the previous Government were examining that question and is currently a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee, regardless of proposed selectivity measures, that the direct payment of child benefit, or children's allowance to the mother, usually the spouse in the <Col N="687" /> home, will continue, because this is the only direct payment to her and acknowledgement of her contribution?  Payment of child benefit cannot be recorded or decided on the basis of an income limit because a wife in the home is economically dependent and therefore, her husband's income need not necessarily reflect the fact that she is getting an adequate allowance for herself and her children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the value of the child benefit to the spouse in the home, the woman in normal circumstances. I also appreciate the difficulties that may arise in attributing income to that spouse.  That is one of the questions which would have to be considered if sufficient data were available to even begin to consider that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will ensure that those families in receipt of the transitional payment because of the effects of equal treatment in social welfare matters, will be given the free fuel allowance during this heating season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The transitional payments to which the Deputy refers were awarded to certain people in November 1986 when the equal treatment provisions came fully <Col N="688" /> into effect.  Those who qualified for the payments were people who, as a result of equal treatment, lost the adult dependant increases with their social welfare payment, because their spouse was either working or in receipt of a social welfare payment and, therefore, no longer regarded as an adult dependant.</P>
      <P>The previous Government intended that these payments would end not later than mid-November 1987 but the Government have decided to continue the payments at their present levels at least until the end of the year, with a view to phasing them out over a period.</P>
      <P>The transitional payments were paid to persons in receipt of any form of social welfare payment which included an increase for an adult dependant.  The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long term payments only who are either living alone or living with dependants.  This year for the first time the scheme has been extended to the long term unemployed where they live alone or have dependants.  People in receipt of transitional payments are living with spouses who by definition are not dependent on them.  To extend the national fuel scheme to people in this situation would have significant financial and other implications. There are no plans to further extend the free fuel scheme in the current heating season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that a transitional payment of £20 per week was introduced to alleviate the poverty of thousands of families.  I am now informed that people in receipt of the transitional payment will not be allowed to avail of the free fuel scheme.  I believe thousands of families will be affected by this decision.  The Minister said he is extending the free fuel scheme when, in fact, thousands of families will be deprived of free fuel because they are in receipt of the transitional payment of £20 per week. Is that not what the Minister is conveying to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not because they are receiving the transitional payments. <Col N="689" /> They are receiving the transitional payments because they have spouses who are not dependent on them.  They are outside the conditions for the national fuel scheme by reason of their spouses not being dependent on them.  No change whatsoever is being made.  The Deputy is suggesting that another category of person be brought into the free fuel scheme and that is not contemplated at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse:</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an inquiry with one of the health boards and I am informed that those people in receipt of the £20 transitional payment will not be given free fuel.  There are approximately 13,000 families involved and heretofore they were entitled to free fuel but now because they get the £20 transitional payment to alleviate poverty they are being deprived of free fuel.  There is no point in the Minister coming into the House and telling us he is extending the scheme when in fact he is not doing so.  He is withdrawing the free fuel service from at least 13,000 families.  Furthermore, he is also saving one month's payments on the free fuel service.  How, then, can the Minister come into the House and say he is extending the free fuel service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be quite clear and specific about that matter.  Benefit is not being withdrawn from anyone because of the alleviating payment.  By definition, in order to get the alleviating payment a person must have a non-dependent spouse, someone who is earning over £50 a week, or who is in receipt of another social welfare benefit.  In such circumstances there is no entitlement to free fuel.  If by accident some people had been receiving free fuel payments, the health board may have told them that the basic qualifying conditions did not exist previously, but it would not be because of the alleviating payments.  The national fuel scheme applies to long term social welfare recipients who live alone or with dependants only.  That is the first qualification. Consequently, so far as they are <Col N="690" /> concerned they would not have been eligible for free fuel and the alleviating payment would not change that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to his statement that it was the intention of the previous Government that the alleviating payment would terminate in the middle of November this year.  Would the Minister not agree that perhaps he is being just a little presumptuous in making that statement to the House when it may well be that the previous Government would have continued that payment for a further year or more?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information. It may be that the information <Col N="691" /> regarding the income was not available to the health board in the previous year or that they found that the income was more than they thought, but that is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister clearly stated that a person who is in receipt of another benefit would not be regarded as a dependant.  In such circumstances if those people made application for full eligibility for health services would the income of both spouses be assessed?  The Minister is now saying that a person is not entitled to free fuel if the spouse has a separate income but if the joint income of the husband and wife is over the limit for full eligibility is the Minister now saying that they can be assessed separately for the purpose of qualifying for full eligibility, in other words, if they are regarded as not being dependent on each other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy started off by talking about the health services but I do not know whether he ended up talking about them.  The conditions for the national fuel scheme are set down very clearly.  They apply to long term social welfare recipients who live alone or with dependants only, who have no other significant income and are unable to provide for their heating needs.  Those have always been the conditions and there has been no change in them in the current season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational opportunities scheme is a pilot scheme which gives long term unemployed persons over 25 years of age the opportunity to attend a leaving certificate course run by their local VEC while at the same time being paid a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.  I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that I have made arrangements for the scheme to continue in the pilot locations of Limerick and Tallaght for the current academic year.  I understand that two classes are already under way in Limerick and that the Tallaght class expects to get off the ground this week.  It would also be my intention to extend the scheme to a number of other locations, as far as resources permit.  The scope for extending the scheme is currently being examined and I will be bringing forward proposals in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <P>Yes, I agree that in certain <Col N="693" /> locations it has been very successful.  In one location it was not successful but notwithstanding that fact it has been quite successful in Limerick and Tallaght.  In my view, it has been very worthwhile and for that reason I proposed to the Government that it should be extended in the coming year and should apply on a wider basis throughout the country.  At present we are working on the basis on which that extension should take place. The money allocated for the scheme in 1987 was £100,000.  I have succeeded in getting £450,000 for this purpose in 1988. The Deputy will appreciate that a considerable extension is envisaged.

    <P>I have already made arrangements to have two visual display units installed in the Mungret Street office.  It is expected that they will be operational before Christmas.  These VDUs will be in addition to four already installed in the employment exchange in Cecil Street and <Col N="695" /> ten others being used by social welfare officers and community welfare officers at other locations in the city.</P>
    <P>The present facilities are mainly used for inquiry purposes and the VDUs are linked to the computers in Dublin. Additional computer functions will be provided at Limerick in due course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of locating a separate computer in Limerick, my Department are developing a telecommunications network to provide a speedy, efficient and consistent service at all their offices.  The one-stop shop project is based on the use of computer systems.  The main computers are located in Dublin and it is not envisaged that this arrangement will change in any major way.</P>
    <P>At a number of locations outside Dublin, local or regional computers will be installed on the network.  The locations will be dictated by technical requirements.  Limerick could, eventually, have a local computer on the network. However, as the ultimate shape of the network has not yet been finalised no decision has been taken on this matter.</P>
    <P>The new purpose-built employment exchange will have the necessary accommodation for the computer facilities required for the full range of services. Work on a major project to computerise unemployment claims has already resulted in facilities being installed in all Dublin Employment exchanges.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the Minister's predecessors had been working on the national pension plan and the Minister is saying it will be implemented in 1988. Could he be more specific? I understood the Minister's predecessor had the matter practically finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been practically finalised for God knows how many years.  In 1976 a Green Paper entitled <i>A National Income Related Pensions Scheme</i> was published.  A second Green Paper on Social Insurance for the Self-Employed was published in 1978.  In May <Col N="697" /> 1984 a draft White Paper on a national income related pension plan was submitted to the previous Government arising from the commitment in their Joint Programme for Government.  The draft proposed the compulsory extension of contributory pensions to the self-employed and a three-tier pension structure for employees.  It was also proposed to establish a pensions board.  In November 1985 it was decided to establish the National Pensions Board.  This has been going on for quite some time and there are a number of major steps being taken at the moment.  They are very complex issues and, consequently, what I have done is to take out the question of the self-employed on its own; that was one of the categories to be dealt with in all the recommendations on the way along. The regulation that Deputy Mitchell is pointing to in the report which came out earlier this year had to be put to the various bodies involved and I think that is the subject of another question.  Those people have recently come back with their views so the legislation to regulate in accordance with those recommendations is currently being prepared. The latest date will be mid-1988.</P>

The Minister is now saying 1988.  It is of vital importance that a national pension plan be introduced.  Will it be in July 1988, January 1988 or December 1988?  Are we just going to postpone it again?</P>

The matter has been before Government, the decision has been taken by Government and the implementation date is April 1988.  The other question is one involving further measures to be taken and a report on this is to be available in mid-1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 15, 24 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first report of the National Pensions Board was published in April last. Following the publication of the report, I asked all the major interests involved, namely employers, trade unions and the pensions industry, for their views on the various proposals in the report.  I have now received the views of all the organisations consulted and these are being examined.  I hope to be in a position <Col N="699" /> shortly to put definitive proposals before the Government.</P>
    <P>The board have made wide-ranging proposals for the future regulation of occupational pension schemes under a number of key headings.  The views of the majority of those organisations who made submissions following the publication of the board's report were in support of the board's proposals.  There were differences in regard to the appropriate timescale for implementing the proposals.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the board's recommendations will involve complex and detailed legislation.  In preparing proposals for legislation my priority will be to ensure that the security of workers' pension rights is adequately safeguarded while, at the same time, ensuring the continued development of occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The security and long term viability of occupational pension schemes is extremely important, not only for the members of those schemes but also because of the important role which pension funds have in the economy.  Short term fluctuations in the financial markets can obviously affect the investment performances of funds in the short term. Pension funds, however, are long term in nature and the important thing from their point of view is that they achieve adequate long term returns on their investments.  It would be my intention that the measures which are brought into operation arising from the National Pensions Board's report will sustain and improve the situation of pension funds in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged in setting up the board that there will be a full time chief executive officer?  Also, will there be provision for the disclosure of certain information to scheme members?  I think the Minister mentioned that point in his answer but I did not get it clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Pensions Board are at present in existence and are working.  The arrangements which will follow their final report will be a matter <Col N="700" /> for the Government at that time; in other words, the long term system of regulation. Whether such a board will continue, or another variation of it, is something which will arise from the long term report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that require legislation to be placed before the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on whether they were a statutory or non-statutory board.  Obviously, if they are to have statutory powers, that would require legislation.  In any event, the Pensions Bill will be coming in in the near future to regulate occupational pensions schemes and a whole series of measures in relation to the regulation and control of these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this subject is one of the most urgent issues facing him and his Department because of the possible lack of security in some occupational pensions schemes and the lack of regulation governing them?  If he shares my view on the urgency of the matter, would he agree to give top priority to this legislation, with the assurance from this side of the House that any legislation will be fully facilitated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for that offer of co-operation.  Certainly, it is my intention to treat the issue as particularly urgent.  As the Deputy will be aware at present we are doing a number of things which involve major changes in social welfare.  This is one of them.  I had hoped to have the complete views of all the bodies earlier so that the legislation could be prepared very early in this session. I now expect it to be available very shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the security and the importance of the funds, I agree with the Deputy that funds are very important in the economy.  The total value of funds invested on behalf of pension schemes is currently estimated to be of the order of £5 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest, a recent report was published by Davy Kelleher McCarthy Limited on the taxation of pensions.  This tentatively estimated the breakdown of investment as follows: overseas investment, 20 per cent to 25 per cent; Irish Government stocks, 45 per cent to 50 per cent; company equities, 20 per cent to 25 per cent; and property, 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  These are global estimates, but they give some idea. There is certain security built into them. For instance, almost 50 per cent are in Government stocks and pension funds really are a long term business.  It is also worth bearing in mind that they earned impressive returns in the eighties.</P>

      <P>If the Minister takes account of what happened with regard to Irish Shipping, he will be aware from that case that just because schemes have gone on for a long time that does not mean they will go well in the future.  I suggest this is a most serious and urgent matter and I hope no pensioners will blame him for his delay in enacting legislation.</P>

      <P>In the realisation that the pensions area is very complex, would the Minister consider introducing legislation quickly, both to protect the security of existing pensions schemes and their value and in regard to vital changes in the 1984 legislation dealing with insolvencies and the 1980 regulations dealing with take-overs?  These are matters which require to be dealt with now rather than in a year's time.</P>

      <P>The prescribed relative allowance is an increase of the pension payable to an incapacitated pensioner who is receiving full time care and attention from a prescribed relative.  One of the conditions for receipt of the allowance is that the relative must not be a married person who is being wholly or mainly maintained by his or her spouse.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the scheme along the lines proposed would have serious cost implications and is a matter for consideration in the context of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the cost implications of allowing a married person to qualify to receive the prescribed relative allowance which, as Deputy Mitchell has said, is at present paid direct to the elderly relative.  Can the Minister tell us whether a cost study has been undertaken to see whether it is proving more costly in both human and economic terms to institutionalise elderly relatives rather than paying the prescribed relative's allowance to married people?  Would the Minister not agree that it would make greater sense to care for the elderly and the incapacitated within their own communities?  I put it to the Minister that it would be cheaper in the long term to do so.  Has any such cost study been carried out within the Minister's Department?  I am aware of <Col N="704" /> the Minister's commitment to community health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures which are helpful to elderly people in the home will be considered in the context of the budget. These include home helps, public health nurses, social workers and meals on wheels as well as possible taxation benefits and off sets in the case of persons minding elderly relatives at home.  The purpose of the prescribed relative allowance is to provide a measure of additional income maintenance to a pensioner towards the support of the relative who is looking after him or her in this way.  It is in that sense akin to an increase in pension for an adult dependant except that the rate of the allowance is lower than the adult dependant allowance.  Payment of this allowance is based on need and that is the basis for not paying the allowance to a married daughter where a pensioner is living with the family.  The social welfare schemes are based on the criterion of providing income maintenance in situations of need.</P>
      <P>I accept the point the Deputy has made.  That is a matter for consideration in the context of the budget and of what further improvements can be made.  I mention as an aside that the Commission on Social Welfare suggested that the whole area should be turned on its head and approached in a different way.  Obviously, that is a matter which will have to be considered in any future consideration of this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The prescribed relative allowance at £26.40 per week is the lowest allowance paid to any social welfare beneficiary.  The reason the Minister is dragging his feet on this question is because if the recipients qualify for unemployment assistance they will receive at least £9 per week more.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be better to give those people who are doing such essential work £35 per week rather than pay children's allowances to those earning over £25,000 a year?</P>

I am sure she does not mind doing this work but it is work that should be recognised by the State.  Would the Minister agree that it is now becoming more difficult to place elderly people in State care due to the massive cutbacks and due to the fact that the number of beds available in State homes has been reduced?  Elderly parents have to be cared for by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions recipients of widows pension, deserted wife's payments, unmarried mother's allowance or prisoners wife's allowance may receive half rate disability benefit when absent from work due to illness in addition to their full pension.  From January 1988 new claimants to disability benefit who are receiving a widow's pension, deserted wife's payments, unmarried mother's allowance or prisoners wife's allowance will not be entitled to claim disability benefit in addition.  Women who are already in receipt of both payments, however, will retain their entitlement for the duration of their current claims to disability benefit.  There is no information available on the average income of those affected.</P>
      <P>There are a number of areas under the social welfare code where overlaps occur and give rise to anomalies and these are currently under examination within my Department.  Any measures which may be taken on foot of this examination will apply only to future claimants and existing recipients will not be affected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 16, 17, 44 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of social insurance coverage to the self-employed including farmers will be a major development in <Col N="710" /> the social welfare system in this country. For the first time self-employed people will have an entitlement to a non-means tested pension and will no longer have to rely entirely on social assistance pensions. Furthermore, the extension will end the present unsatisfactory situation where a large block of the working population make no direct contribution towards the costs of pensions even though many are in a position to do so.  In future self-employed people will be liable for contributions in the same way as other contributions and the overall costs of social insurance will be shared in a more equitable way across the working population. Finally, the extension will bring this country more into line with other EC countries in regard to social insurance coverage.</P>
    <P>I have asked the National Pensions Board to examine all aspects of this issue as a matter of urgency and I expect to receive the board's report within the next few weeks.  This report will include recommendations as to the level and range of pensions to be provided, the conditions for entitlement, the method of financing and the rates of contribution based on actuarial projections of emerging costs over a number of years.</P>
    <P>When I have received the board's report I will be putting detailed proposals to Government for the introduction of the new system.  Pending consideration of the matter by the Government it is not possible to provide any further details in relation to the new system at this stage.</P>

In the light of that experience, can he tell us how he proposes to collect PRSI contributions from farmers?  At what level?  Is it to be a fixed rate?  Is it to be a percentage of their income?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The transfer to employers of responsibility for payments to employees for the first 13 weeks of illness will be a major development in the social welfare system.  It will end the unnecessary duplication between the disability benefit scheme and occupational sick pay scheme and enable employers to have greater control over the factors underlying absenteeism.  It will also enable sickness benefit payments to be made subject to taxation.</P>
      <P>An inter-departmental committee are considering all aspects of this question at the moment.  Discussions have taken place with employer and trade union organisations to consider their views and concerns.  The committee's report will be submitted to the Government shortly.  It will be necessary at that stage for the Government to decide on the details of the scheme in order that the new arrangement can be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.</P>
      <P>A proposal to transfer responsibility for short term sickness payments to employers was also put forward by the previous Government and was discussed at that time by the interests concerned, both in the framework of NESC and otherwise.  I do not consider that the issue of a White Paper at this stage to raise all of these issues again would be either necessary or desirable.</P>

The purpose of this national programme is to help the unemployed, especially the long term <Col N="716" /> unemployed, in their search for work and training.

Of these 158 were subsequently reinstated on benefit following appeal.  Accordingly, the net number of persons disallowed up to 6 November 1987 as a result of the programme was 1,282.  Comprehensive statistics are not yet available from the health boards concerning the number of these persons who have applied for supplementary welfare allowance as a result of having their unemployment benefit/ assistance withdrawn.  Information available, however, indicates that the number of persons transferring to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is <Col N="717" /> insignificant and has had little or no effect on the day to day operation of that scheme.</P>

      <P>I find it extraordinary that we can interview 118,000 people under the Jobsearch programme and we cannot interview a couple of hundred applicants for unemployment assistance.  The policy in regard to Jobsearch must be reviewed. During the week I was given details of the case of a woman who graduated with a B.A., H. Dip. in Ed. and had spent five years as a personnel officer being sent to AnCO to learn how to prepare a CV, how to answer a phone and prepare an application for a job.  Is that an incentive to anybody?  That person had all the qualifications necessary but she was sent to AnCO, and paid to learn something she was in complete control of.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Jobsearch programme is to assist people seeking employment.  They are provided with facilities and tutors to help them seek employment.  I have come across a number of very well qualified people embarking on the Jobsearch programme. We must remember that those who qualify to go on that programme are the long term unemployed.  Initially some of these people found that the course was not what they had in mind but subsequently they admitted that the course helped them in getting jobs.  Such people will be in a better position to get employment as a result of the contacts and facilities made available to them at the Jobsearch centres. For example, people who have been out of employment for a long time may decide to change their line of work.  It is <Col N="718" /> common to find people who are technically qualified for many jobs considering other opportunities after discussions with AnCO officials.</P>

    <P>The question as to whether the people concerned should be covered for all the benefits of the social insurance system and pay full PRSI contributions has been raised in many reports and discussions in recent years including the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which recommended this course of action.  This <Col N="719" /> question, however, raises major issues and would have serious widespread implications.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in view of the widespread public concern and the potential damage to the licensed trade, the investigations which are being carried out into the sale of animal medicine which contains strychnine described as vodka which came to light in the Cork area over the weekend, the measures, if any, which are being taken to ensure that vodka on sale to the public is authentic and does not pose a threat, the number of outlets in which the bogus vodka was found to be on sale; if it is intended to take any measures against those involved in this fraud; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to give particulars of the ongoing investigation by the Revenue Commissioners which uncovered the illicit trade in so called vodka last week.  I wish to assure the House that everything possible is being done to find the bogus vodka and any suspect spirits are at present being seized for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Revenue Commissioners have the full co-operation of the trade, including Irish Distillers, in this task.  Moreover, the environmental health officers of the relevant health authorities have been alerted to carry out checks for the bogus vodka at selected outlets.  So far samples of the illicit spirit have been found at about 40 locations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is one of the most serious cases of abuse of consumer rights to emerge in recent years and that this emphasises the need for strengthening consumer legislation?  One recalls that five or six years ago in Spain hundreds of people were killed or suffered illness by drinking contaminated olive oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that having regard to the reported quantity of alcohol involved it is unlikely that this enterprise could have been planned without access to the product on a wholesale basis?  Will he indicate clearly whether inquiries in the trade will take this aspect into consideration?  Is he prepared to tell us exactly where the 40 outlets he mentioned are?  Is he of the opinion that the Garda should be involved at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and second parts of the Deputy's question is, yes.  The answer to the third part of her question is that the 40 locations are in different parts of the country, mainly Dublin and Cork.  The answer to the fourth part of the question is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was obviously to the Minister for Health.  Would the Minister for Finance not agree that it is very necessary that the public should <Col N="722" /> know where these 40 outlets are if we are to protect their health?</P>

This was sent to me and the Ceann Comhairle then sent the Deputy's question.  I replied to that part of the Deputy's question when I said that the environmental health officers of the relevant health authorities had been alerted to carry out checks for the bogus vodka at selected outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the bogus vodka was discovered by accident, would the Minister tell the House how often spot checks in pubs or off-licences are carried out to ensure that people are getting what they pay for? Would he tell us if he is having discussions with the organisations representing publicans to ensure that this abuse is not repeated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>This was not found out by accident.  The Revenue Commissioners were aware of some illicit activities and it was due to their investigations that this operation was discovered, and they will continue to work in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, as a matter of urgency, put in train the necessary steps to ensure that the product involved is adulterated with a chemical which can be leached out by simple filtration and that an indelible dye will be used as part of the necessary safeguard to ensure that when people buy vodka in future they will not be drinking this poisonous substance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to give effect to the 1981 Council of Europe Data Protection Convention or &mdash; to give it its full title &mdash; the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.  For that reason, it will be useful, by way of introduction, to describe briefly the developments which gave rise to the need for such a convention and also to refer to the legislative provision made in some other European countries to protect the privacy of individuals in respect of automated personal data kept about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early seventies large information systems had become computerised to such an extent that fears began to be expressed on an increasing scale about the threat to privacy that they could pose. The fears were not based primarily on the amount of the information stored in the systems.  The real basis for the concern was the ease and speed with which computerised information could be collected, re-arranged, transferred and retrieved, and the fact that this information could include sensitive personal information and could be used for all kinds of purposes without the knowledge of the individuals to whom it related. Moreover, the ability to link computerised information systems gave rise to apprehension that the State would be in a position to have virtually instant access to all the information it held separately on each individual and, through file matching, to build up a comprehensive profile on every member of society.  There were fears, too, that computerised personal information could <Col N="836" /> more easily be stolen or copied or otherwise obtained improperly by those to whom it should not be disclosed.</P>
    <P>The recognition that automated personal data was a potential threat led to the introduction of data protection legislation in a number of European countries. Sweden was the pioneer in 1973, followed since then by Austria, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway and the UK.</P>
    <P>On the international plane, the OECD in 1980 published guidelines on the protection of privacy and transborder flows of personal data.  The Council of Europe Data Protection Convention was opened for signature in 1981.  Unlike the OECD guidelines, the Convention is a legally binding instrument.  So far most member states of the Council of Europe have signed the Convention.  Six have ratified it: Norway, Sweden, France, Spain, the Federal Republic of Germany and the UK.  The guidelines were accepted, and the Convention signed, on behalf of this country in December 1986.  We shall be in a position to ratify the Convention as soon as the Bill has been enacted and is in full operation.  A number of other countries are also proceeding with legislation to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>As might be expected, all the legislative measures enacted by the countries which have ratified the Convention have certain features in common.  They all give effect to the basic data protection principles set out in Chapter II of the Convention. These principles require that personal data shall be collected fairly and lawfully, be accurate, up to date and so on; that appropriate safeguards be provided for particularly sensitive personal data concerning racial origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, health or sexual life and criminal convictions; that appropriate security measures be taken for protecting the data; that the individual concerned should be able to establish the existence of personal data systems, to find out what data are kept about him or her, and to have the data rectified or erased if they have been processed in contravention of the principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> However, the Convention allows exceptions to be included in the domestic law if they constitute a necessary measure in a democratic society in the interests of protecting State security, public safety, the monetary interests of the State or the supression of criminal offences; or of protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others.  It allows restrictions on the rights of access, rectification and erasure with respect to personal data used for statistics or for scientific research purposes when there is obviously no risk of an infringement of the privacy of the data subjects concerned.  It also provides that national laws must provide a remedy and appropriate sanctions if there is any contravention of the data protection provisions.</P>
    <P>The provisions to give effect to the Convention can take different forms, depending on the legal and constitutional system of the country concerned; and the laws or regulations adopted may be supplemented by voluntary codes of practice or codes of conduct.  By and large there is a substantial correspondence between the main provisions of the legislation in force in each of the countries which have so far ratified the Convention.</P>
    <P>In the present Bill, the &ldquo;common core&rdquo; or basic principles of data protection of the Convention are given effect to in sections 2 to 8 under the general heading of &ldquo;Protection of Privacy of Individuals with regard to Personal Data.&rdquo;  They include provisions relating to collection, processing, storage, access and dissemination of personal data.</P>
    <P>Side-by-side with the basic principles, which guarantee to data subjects in all countries where the Convention is in force a certain minimum protection, the Convention contains special rules on transborder data flows.  Particular importance is attached by the Convention to the free flow of information because the right to impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers is already guaranteed by article 10 of the Convention on Human Rights.  Indeed, in those cases where the Data Protection Convention provides for the possibility <Col N="838" /> of imposing restrictions on transborder data flows, it does so only to the minimum extent required for the protection of the rights of others, in particular, the right to respect for individual privacy.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of unrestricted data flows is particularly important for our economy, especially in view of the establishment of the international financial services centre on the Custom House Docks site.  This is because several European countries have legislation restricting the export of data for processing to countries which have less strict data protection laws or perhaps none at all.  The absence of data protection legislation here could thus be a factor that international companies would take into account when deciding whether or not to establish a business here, particularly in the area of data processing.  For this reason it is desirable that the Bill should be enacted and the Convention ratified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>All data protection legislation to date provides for a person or body to supervise the operation of the legislation and to enforce its provisions.  The Convention does not specifically require the establishment of such an authority but, as a practical matter, it is difficult to see how any legislation can be fully effective unless there is some form of supervisory authority with power to see that its provisions are complied with and, where they are not, to take remedial action.  In most of the countries concerned the supervising authority is independent of both the public and the private sector.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides for appointment of a Data Protection Commissioner. He will be appointed by the Government and will be independent in the exercise of his functions.  He will have power to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Act, either on his own initiative or on receipt of complaints from data subjects.  To achieve this, he can issue &ldquo;information notices&rdquo;, requiring persons to furnish him with information to enable him to perform his functions; &ldquo;enforcement notices&rdquo;, requiring data controllers or processors to comply with specified provisions of the Act, and &ldquo;prohibition <Col N="839" /> notices&rdquo;, prohibiting the transfer of personal data abroad in certain circumstances. These notices, of course, are measures of last resort to be employed only if the persons concerned either refuse to behave properly or genuinely believe that the commissioner is wrong and that the matter should be determined by the Circuit Court on appeal.  I see the commissioner more as a mediator and as someone who can play a useful role in helping those who keep personal data to bring their operating procedures into line with the Act.  Because it is not possible to legislate for the specific data protection requirements of all the different areas concerned, he will also have the duty of encouraging the preparation and dissemination of codes of practice in those areas.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the international dimension of the Bill and its importance in relation to transborder flows of personal data.  The commissioner will have an important role in this area.  Section 11 contains special provisions regarding transborder flows and for mutual assistance between contracting States.  The commissioner, when considering whether to prohibit a proposed transfer to a place bound by the Convention, must have regard to article 12, which severely limits the powers of a contracting State to prohibit or restrict data flows to the territory of another contracting State.  So far as a transfer to a non-contracting State is concerned, he must allow it unless he is of opinion that the transfer would be likely to lead to a contravention of the data protection principles set out in the Convention.  In either case he must also consider whether the transfer would cause damage or distress to any person and have regard to the desirability of facilitating international transfers of data.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will be the designated authority for the purposes of Chapter IV of the Convention which provides that contracting States will render each other mutual assistance in implementing the Convention.  That chapter also sets out the obligations undertaken <Col N="840" /> by parties towards one another, such as the rendering of assistance to data subjects abroad and the safeguards necessary as regards confidentiality in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Data protection laws differ in the type of the control exercised over those who keep automated personal data.  In the earliest of these, for example, in Sweden and Norway, a licence from the controlling authority was necessary before anyone could establish a personal data register or file.  That imposed a heavy burden on the data protection authority. In other countries universal registration was the norm and the problem of undue &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo; was met by having simplified forms of registration for small businesses or other activities which did not constitute any serious danger to individual privacy.</P>
    <P>More recently, a less rigid approach has emerged.  The trend is now towards a two-tier system, characterised by a requirement of registration for the large-scale controllers and processors &mdash; those whose activities are more likely to give rise to concern &mdash; and a simpler system of a self-regulatory kind for those whose keeping and use of personal data is limited in scope and poses no threat.  We have sought to learn from the experience of other countries and to provide a system which would avoid unnecessary burdens on industry and small businesses and ensure that the commissioner would have adequate powers to see to it that the provisions of the law are complied with fully.  Accordingly, the Bill proposes that, initially, only certain categories of data controllers will be required to register. These will be persons or organisations keeping the specially sensitive data I have referred to &mdash;data about racial origin, political opinion, health, sexual life, and so on &mdash; as well as organisations operating in the public sector and financial institutions and agencies concerned with credit references, debt collecting, direct mailing and direct marketing.  All data processors, that is, those who provide computer bureau services, must also be registered.  The requirement to register will therefore cover a wide area of <Col N="841" /> activity, an area in relation to which the public can expect to have particular concerns in the matter of the protection of their privacy.</P>
    <P>All other persons and bodies who keep automated personal data, while not required to register, will be equally bound by the general data protection provisions of the Bill.  Complaints about contraventions by them of these provisions can be investigated by the commissioner in the same way as he can investigate smaller complaints about data controllers who have to register.  His powers to enforce compliance with these provisions will also apply in the same way.  The heavy administrative burdens involved in universal registration will thus be avoided and resources can be devoted to supervision and enforcement of data protection.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Bill does not exclude the possibility of extending substantially the categories of data controllers who are required to register or, indeed, even the possibility of having universal registration if in some future situation it should appear to be desirable to do so.  For the present and for the foreseeable future, however, it seems to me that the resources involved in universal registration would be more effectively employed in seeing that the data protection provisions are properly implemented.  In particular, I see no reason for the registration of all those small businesses that to an ever increasing extent are making use of microcomputers for payroll and customer applications and that constitute no danger to individual privacy.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will have power to refuse applications for registration, for example, where he is of opinion that the person applying for registration is likely to contravene any of the provisions of the Act.  Where data controllers keep the specially sensitive kind of data I have mentioned, he must refuse registration unless he considers that they are providing, and will continue to provide, appropriate safeguards for protecting the privacy of the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 19 spells out the effects of <Col N="842" /> registration.  First, it will be an offence for data processors and registrable data controllers to keep or process personal data without being registered.  It will also be an offence for such data controllers to act contrary to the intentions expressed by them when applying for registration. For example, they may not keep personal data of a description other than that specified in the entry in the register, or keep or use such data for a purpose other than the purpose or purposes described in the entry.  If the source from which the data is obtained is described in the entry, they may not obtain the data from any other source.  Finally, they may not transfer data to a place outside the State, other than a place named or described in the entry.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to some of the other provisions of the Bill, starting with the definitions in section 1.  Some of the definitions, particularly of such key expressions as &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; and &ldquo;processing&rdquo; are of critical importance because it is essential to try to express them in terms which will still be valid even if technological change continues at its present rate.  Otherwise the scope of the Bill would be broadened or restricted by the continuous developments in the field of data equipment.  For this reason it has not been possible to avoid a fair degree of technicality in the definitions.</P>
    <P>An example will indicate why.  I think we all appreciate that the kind of automated personal data the Convention contemplates are data that are machine-readable and not readable in the ordinary sense.  In other words, we are talking here of information that is recorded in a computer memory or floppy disc or magnetic tape and that can be made intelligible only by displaying it on the computer screen or on a printout.  On this view, a definition of personal data as information in machine-readable form would seem to be adequate.  But nowadays data equipment can record typed pages so that all typewritten information is now potentially machine-readable and under such a definition would come within the scope of the Bill.  The Bill should apply only if and when typewritten <Col N="843" /> information has been inputted into an automated system and that is the effect of the definitions of &ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;processing&rdquo; in section 1.</P>
    <P>There is also an express exclusion in the definition of &ldquo;processing&rdquo; for an operation performed solely for the purpose of preparing the text of documents. The intention is to exclude the operation of word processors when being used simply for that purpose.  A common example would be the despatch of a standard letter to many people where the names and addresses are kept on a word processor.  Word processors are not excluded as such.  Much word processing the is done on personal computers which are capable of automatically processing the personal data concerned.  Once they are used for purposes other than the preparation of documents, their operation comes within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the definitions of &ldquo;data&rdquo; and &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; that the Bill's provisions do not extend to manual files or to companies or partnerships.</P>
    <P>The main reason for excluding manual files is that automated personal information systems present problems of a particular kind for the protection of individual privacy.  There is also the major administrative problem that including manual files in this legislation would involve, not least of which would be the substantial additional costs.  As against this, it is sometimes argued that the easiest way to circumvent the Convention is to delete the automated data concerned and put it on a manual file.  However, the Convention is concerned with the potential misuse of computerised data and the computer's inherent power to transmit and correlate huge quantities of informtion at very high speeds.  Such considerations do not arise where data are collected or stored manually.  Also, more and more data are being transferred to computers and it would not be an economic proposition for a business to reverse the trend towards automated information systems.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of extending possible protection to legal persons or <Col N="844" /> non-personal data, it seems to me that there is an essential difference between the privacy interests of natural persons and those of an artificial entity such as a corporations, though I appreciate that corporations too have trade secrecy and confidentiality interests that can be damaged. The exclusion of companies or other bodies is not to be taken as exempting them from the provisions relating to data controllers or processors if they qualify as such.</P>
    <P>Section 1, apart from containing the definitions, also authorises Ministers to delegate responsibility for compliance with the provisions of the Bill to those civil servants in the various Departments who are primarily concerned with the personal data covered by the Bill. Additionally, the Minister for Defence can designate an officer of the Permanent Defence Force to be responsible for automated personal data relating to members of the Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 1 provides for the exclusion of certain personal data from the scope of the Bill.  As allowed for by article 9 of the Convention, this exclusion covers personal data that in the opinion of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence are, or at any time were, kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State.  The section also excludes personal data concerned only with the management of an individual's personal, family or household affairs or kept by him or her only for recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 6 of the Bill are devoted specifically to the protection of the privacy of individuals with regard to personal data.  Section 2 imposes on data controllers obligations relating to the collection, accuracy, adequacy, relevance, storage and security of personal data kept by them and prohibits the use or disclosure of the data in any manner incompatible with the purposes for which they are kept.  The obligation relating to security is the only one applicable to data processors.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 6 entitle individuals to establish the existence of automated personal data concerning them, to have <Col N="845" /> access to such data and to have the data rectified or erased, where appropriate. These provisions correspond to the principles contained in article 8 of the convention and give individuals new rights in relation to personal data kept about them.  The right of access is one of the most important safeguards of the rights of the individual data subject that is provided for in the Bill.  It will prevail over any enactment or rule of law prohibiting or restricting disclosure of information or authorising the withholding of it, but power is given to the Minister for Justice to make regulations continuing any such prohibition, restriction or authorisation if he thinks that that should be done in the interests of the individuals concerned or any other individuals.  An example that comes to mind is the provision in the Adoption Acts prohibiting the disclosure of information from the index kept for tracing the connection between the entries in the Adopted Children's Register and the corresponding entries in the register of births.</P>
    <P>The right of access is restricted in the kind of circumstances that are envisaged by article 9 of the Convention.  For example, the right of access may not be exercised in relation to personal data kept for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating crime if that purpose would thereby be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is an important provision. It imposes on data controllers and data processors a duty of care to individuals in respect of whom they collect, process, keep, use or disclose personal data, that is, to the extent that the law of torts does not already impose such a duty.  Under the present law, any damage resulting from a breach of the relevant provisions of the Bill could make the controller or processor liable in negligence, breach of confidence, defamation or breach of contract. This section provides a specific right to compensation to the extent that the law of torts does not already do so, for example, where it may not be possible to establish a sufficient relationship between a data processor and the individual <Col N="846" /> concerned so as to give rise to a duty of care.</P>
    <P>The final group of sections, entitled &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo;, includes a provision&mdash; section 21 &mdash; making it an offence for &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; and other persons to obtain personal data without authority and then to disclose the data.  &ldquo;Hacking&rdquo;&mdash; the unauthorised accessing of a system &mdash; is not being made an offence <i>per se</i>.  That would be outside the scope of this Bill and if the creation of such a specific offence were necessary it would be appropriate to a Bill dealing with computer crime.</P>
    <P>The offence under section 21 will arise only where two conditions are satisfied &mdash; obtaining personal data without authority and its subsequent disclosure.  The inclusion of such an offence in the present Bill is appropriate because of the other provisions it contains which are directed against unauthorised disclosure of personal information.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with personal data kept or processed outside the State.  Normally the Bill will have no application to such data but it will apply if the data, although processed abroad, are used or intended for use in the State.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 23 for officers authorised by the commissioner to visit premises of data controllers and processors in certain circumstances and obtain any information necessary for the performance of the commissioner's functions.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against decisions of the commissioner.  An appeal may be brought to the High Court against a decision of the Circuit Court only on a point of law.</P>
    <P>The commissioner is being given power by section 30 to prosecute offences under the Bill summarily.  Here I should say that, in general, a failure or refusal by a data controller or data processor to comply with the data protection provisions will not be an offence.  However, if the commissioner requests a data controller or a data processor to comply with an obligation under the Bill and he issues a notice requiring compliance, then any <Col N="847" /> failure or refusal, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the requirement will be an offence.  Of course, if an appeal is taken to the Circuit Court against such a requirement, the requirement need not be complied with while the appeal is being determined unless in circumstances of urgency for which special provision is made.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides that different provisions of the Bill may commence at different times.  The idea is to bring into operation those provisions necessary to enable the Convention to be ratified as soon as possible after the Bill's enactment, while allowing sufficient time for persons and organisations to adapt to the data protection requirements and, if required to do so, to register.  Some of the provisions need not be brought into operation until the people affected have had an opportunity to accommodate fully to the legislation.  An example would be subsection (2) of section 6, which requires a person who rectifies or erases personal data pursuant to the Act to notify the rectification or erasure to anyone to whom the data were disclosed in the 12 months prior to the request for rectification. It would be unreasonable to expect this provision to apply until some time had elapsed after the commencement of the main provisions of the Act, so as to give controllers who do not keep records of disclosures an opportunity to arrange to do so.</P>
    <P>As regards commencement, it is anticipated that a period of six months at least would be required between the passing of the legislation into law and the date when its main provisions would become operative.  During that period, steps can be taken to ratify the Convention since it will not come into force for the State until three months after the instrument of ratification has been deposited on our behalf.  The intention is that that date and the date of the commencement of the main provisions of the Bill should be the same.</P>
    <P>To sum up then: the Bill is designed to provide adequate safeguards to individuals against any abuse of their privacy <Col N="848" /> arising from the automatic processing of personal data concerning them.  It does this without imposing any indue burdens on industry or the taxpayer and without unnecessarily restricting transborder flows of data, including flows of data to this country for processing from countries which have ratified the Convention.</P>
    <P>There are other positive benefits.  The Bill will encourage Government Departments and agencies and private sector companies to adopt better practices in the handling of personal data, such as keeping data up to date and not keeping data for longer than necessary.  That should lead to greater efficiency in the use of information technology in both the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>The general principles of the Bill will commend themselves to all sides of the House but it is a technical Bill and there may be aspects which Deputies may wish to have clarified.  If so, I shall endeavour to do so when replying or during Committee Stage.  In any event, I shall give careful consideration before that Stage to any suggestions for amendment that may be made in the course of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the provisions of this Bill are designed to protect the privacy of individuals with regard to automated personal data and to give effect in the State to the 1981 Council of Europe Data Protection Convention.  Within the last decade or so technology has advanced in ways which are bewildering to the average layman.  Yet, increasingly, it is having a direct effect on us all.  Developments which until recently were in the realm of remote scientific theory are now of clear practical application.  Every day that passes sees more and more business offices throughout the country replace people with new pieces of electronic equipment.  It is common now for more and more office workers to operate what is known as the electronic office.  Governments are performing an ever-increasing number of tasks with the use of information technology of some kind or another.  Wherever we look its impact can be seen.  Clearly it is here to stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> It cannot be denied that the advances made in technology have brought our society many benefits and I am sure that further advances in the future will bring many more benefits.  However, along with those benefits come also disadvantages and dangers.  Above all, developments in information technology have revealed how easily and rapidly information can be manipulated, collated, transferred and retrieved.  That information may include sensitive personal information.  Therefore, it is understandable that all of this has led to a certain unease among the public.  There is some anxiety that personal information is collected about all of us, unknown to us, stored in data banks by unknown sources and used for all sorts of purposes of which we are unaware.  The level of concern as to the extent of abuse in this area may be unfounded.  Therefore, the important thing is for those of us charged with responsibility of legislating to eliminate this concern which otherwise might grow into a real impediment to the future use of technology.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the Bill now before us deals with an intrinsically difficult subject, one with which not too many Members of this House will be familiar.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that fact.  I sincerely hope that when replying to the Second Stage debate he will endeavour to answer the many questions which will arise from Members' contributions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if he will allow adequate time between completion of Second Stage and Committee Stage for those of us on this side of the House to consider amendments if we feel they are necessary to improve the provisions of the Bill from the point of view of protecting both the individual and the business community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might also consider referring the Bill to a Select Committee for Committee Stage consideration.  I have always felt that to be the correct procedure for dealing <Col N="850" /> with this type of legislation.</P>
      <P>The joint aim of protecting the citizen while actively encouraging use of the computer has been shared by many Governments throughout Europe.  Ultimately this aim led to the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention which was open for signature in 1981 and which I understand cannot be ratified by us until we have passed the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out also that the OECD have been active in this area, producing a set of guidelines governing the protection of privacy and transborder flows of personal data.  It should be remembered that business depends more and more on the free flow of data, often personal data, between countries.  This free flow of information must continue if business is to flourish.  At the same time, however, the threat to the individual becomes potentially greater when data are used not only at home but in other countries and in circumstances over which the subject, and often the person passing on the information, has little control.</P>
      <P>In recognition of this, the European Convention on Data Protection confirms the right of countries which have produced data protection safeguards to restrict the flow of personal data to other countries which do not offer comparable protection.  I sincerely hope that the ratification of the European Convention will reassure people in this country that, when computers are used for the storage and use of personal data, there are special safeguards for individual privacy which are well up to the international standard.</P>
      <P>For all of the reasons I have outlined I accept in principle the need for this type of legislation and can state that the Fine Gael Party will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage.  There are, however, a number of points that need to be clarified in relation to the Bill and I would like to deal with some of these now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my reading of it, the Bill does not apply to those people who keep personal information in manual form only.  The Minister in his contribution stated that as a fact.  This is so despite the fact that <Col N="851" /> personal information stored in manual files may pose a threat to the privacy of the individual.  The European Convention requires signatories to apply the provisions to personal data only which are processed automatically, although it leaves open the possibility of extending its provisions to manually processed data in any State which so wishes.</P>
    <P>A great deal of personal information is not computerised and individuals will have no right of access to it even though Article 3 of the Convention enables any subscribing country to enforce access to such manually compiled information. Surely this provision was not put into the Convention idly but to enable any willing Government to do so if they so wished. As a result, many important files will be withheld from people who would like to learn what is in them.  Organisations could even be impelled, in order to escape the legislation, to withhold or remove from their computers information they would rather not disclose.</P>
    <P>I would be afraid &mdash; and similar fears were expressed in Great Britain when their legislation was being passed &mdash; that we might have some movement away from computerisation back to the manually held file.  There is a possibility that in certain circumstances people who do not want to be put into the position that they have to register or disclose information will move away from computerisation and back to the manually controlled file. I do not think that would be a very good thing.  For that reason I ask the Minister to reconsider whether he should include information on manually controlled files and perhaps he could tell us exactly why he and the Government decided not to include it in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is supposed to entitle individuals to establish the existence of automated personal data kept in relation to them, to have access to the data, with some exceptions, and to have inaccurate data rectified or erased.  While these are very worthwhile objectives, I fail to see how they can be achieved when only certain categories of persons and bodies who keep personal data will be required to <Col N="852" /> register with the Commissioner.  For example, people who keep particularly sensitive data on political opinions, health, criminal convictions, etc., the public sector and financial institutions are all referred to in section 16 and the Third Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>How will a data subject, as he is referred to in section 16 of the Bill, become aware of people outside those specified in section 16 of the Bill who keep automated personal data?  How am I to know who keeps information on me if there is no insistence that a person, individual or company must register? While section 2 of the Bill imposes various obligations on persons who keep automated personal data, for example, the data must be accurate, be kept for lawful purposes, not be disclosed in any manner incompatible with those purposes and be protected by adequate security measures, it will be practically impossible to enforce the legislation when registration is not required for everybody.  Are we not putting unreasonable obligations, which are not readily enforceable, on small traders and businessmen who are data controllers if the policing of these obligations is not possible? I read the Bill a few times and I cannot see how a commissioner can enforce the provisions contained in section 2 of the Bill if a person is not registered and nobody knows about him. Are they going to do it on a voluntary basis?</P>
    <P>Section 1 (4) states that the Bill does not apply to personal data kept for State security purposes, or kept by an individual for recreational purposes etc.  Can the Minister say what exactly is meant by &ldquo;recreational purposes&rdquo;?  Does it mean a sporting club which has a list of members on a small computer?  I am concerned that &ldquo;personal data that in the opinion of the Minister or the Minister for Defence are, or at any time were, kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State&rdquo; is not included in the Bill.  I do not question the Minister's integrity but this gives the Ministers referred to very wide powers when they alone can decide <Col N="853" /> the meaning of &ldquo;the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State&rdquo;. Should there not be some court of appeal?  One Minister may decide that the release of some information could come within the definition I have just stated and others may differ.  I understand the reasons for it but it strikes me that it gives Ministers excessive power in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to section 4 of the Bill which deals with the right of access of a data subject to personal data about him or her, save in certain circumstances. I could not find any reference in this section to the position of minors.  What happens, for argument's sake, if a person wishes to ascertain information from, say, a doctor or a hospital concerning the health of his two year old child?  It would appear that a doctor is not entitled to give this information as the Bill stands at present.  If a minor or somebody who is mentally handicapped cannot seek the data, who can get that information on that person's behalf?  Perhaps the Minister could touch on this point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to expand on section 4 (8) (a).  What happens when somebody applies to a doctor for information relating to his physical or mental health and the doctor feels that it is not to his benefit that he should receive the information?  Must the doctor then apply to the Minister to make a regulation so as to protect him for non-disclosure of the personal data?  This would appear to be a very cumbersome way of dealing with such a problem and I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum covering section 4 of the Bill state: &ldquo;A data controller need not comply with a request for access if he is not satisfied about the identity of the individual making the request or has not been given enough information to enable the data to be traced.&rdquo;  That gives a data controller discretion but who is to decide whether the data controller is not satisfied about the identity of the individual making the request?  Can he just say: &ldquo;No, I am not <Col N="854" /> satisfied&rdquo;?  I would like the Minister to clarify this.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the appointment of the data protection commissioner.  I note from the Second Schedule the conditions relating to the appointment of the commissioner and that the Minister may appoint to be members of the staff of the commissioner such number of persons that may be determined from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I am quite fearful that because of the scope of this Bill, a very large bureaucracy could be built up at enormous expense to the taxpayer. Every effort should be made to ensure that the exercise is self financing. The fees paid by those data subjects requiring information on themselves together with the fees to be paid by data controllers, who benefit from the use of this technology, should meet as far as possible the cost of the commissioner and his staff and indeed the running costs of his office.  It is reasonable to expect that the industry itself together with those seeking information should carry the cost.  The experience in the United Kingdom since the introduction of similar legislation in 1984 would suggest that the commissioner referred to in this Bill will be faced with considerable problems in trying to operate under the conditions laid down in the Bill.  There is a real fear that this legislation could become a non event.  All in all, we could be involved in considerable expenditure of time and effort which would briefly give rise to seminars, with consultants cashing in and then fading away.</P>
    <P>Section 11 empowers the data protection commissioner, subject to the provisions of the section to prohibit the transfer of personal data from the State to a place outside the State.  The Minister will forgive me if I am displaying a total lack of knowledge of technology when I say I cannot for the life of me understand how it is proposed to police the transfer of information from this State to a place outside the State.  Surely the daily advances in technology suggest that the commissioner will have no possible way of ever discovering what information &mdash;<Col N="855" /> personal data &mdash; is being passed from this State to some other part of the world. This adds to my fears that the legislation, despite all its good intentions, will be seen within a very short period to be incapable of implementation because of the looseness of many of its provisions.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 13 requires the Commissioner to encourage the preparation of codes of practice by bodies representing data controllers or data processors and the dissemination of any such codes that he may approve of.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be a very worthwhile aspiration but I fail to see why something that is only an aspiration is included in the Bill.  In the explanatory memorandum, too, we find the following:</P>
    <P>Section 16 (1) lists those persons &mdash; every data processor and certain data controllers &mdash; who are required to register.  The data controllers concerned are: (a) those keeping personal data relating to racial origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, health, sexual life or criminal convictions; (b) those in the public sector, as listed in the Third Schedule; (c) financial institutions and agencies dealing with credit references, debt collecting, direct marketing and direct mailing; and (d) such other categories as may be prescribed by the Commissioner with the consent of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I wish to address some questions to the Minister on this section.  What exactly is meant by, &ldquo;data controllers who keep personal data relating to political opinions&rdquo;?  Does it mean, for argument sake, that political parties who keep a register of their members will be required to register?  In relation to religious or other beliefs would it entail that churches who keep a register for the purpose, perhaps, of collecting funds would have to register?  As it is stated in the Bill it is not exactly clear what is meant.  I am taking <Col N="856" /> the Minister up on his generous offer to answer the various questions when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to personal data on mental or physical health and sexual life does this mean that doctors who have their records on computer must register?</P>
      <P>Section 19 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A data controller to whom section 16 of this Act applies shall not keep personal data unless there is for the time being an entry in the register in respect of him.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand why this group of data controllers cannot keep any other information and comply with section 2 of the Bill, unless they are registered. It would appear that a data controller who keeps information as set out in section 16, and for this very reason must register, cannot, under section 19, keep any other information.  I may be wrong but that is my interpretation of the section.  I am at a loss to understand why this group of data controllers have been singled out.</P>
      <P>Section 19 (2) states:</P>
      <P>A data controller in respect of whom there is an entry in the register shall not&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  keep personal data of any description other than that specified in the entry,</P>
      <P>This would appear to be rather severe because as I understand it, even though the data controller complies with section 16, he cannot do as any other data controller can do who is not covered by section 16, provided he complies with the provisions of section 2.  Perhaps I am misreading the situation, but I would welcome the Minister's observations on that point.</P>
      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 makes it an offence for a person to obtain personal data without <Col N="857" /> the prior authority of the data controller or processor concerned (by &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; or otherwise) and disclose it to another person.  To constitute the offence there must not only be unauthorised access to the data but a subsequent disclosure.</P>
    <P>Surely it should be an offence to have unauthorised access?  Why should it be an offence only if you subsequently disclose the unauthorised data?  The Explanatory Memorandum continues:</P>
    <P>The section does not apply to an employee or agent of the data controller or data processor concerned: unauthorised disclosure by an employee or agent of a data processor or of a data controller who is registered is an offence under section 19.  Disclosures by unregistered data controllers or their employees or agents in breach of section 2 (1) (c) (ii) do not constitute an offence but may be made the subject of an enforcement notice.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to know why it is not an offence in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wish to raise on Second Stage.  I believe that the Houses of the Oireachtas should not pass legislation which it feels cannot be enforced after the enactment of the legislation.  I feel that the Bill as it stands at present has many provisions which cannot be policed adequately to ensure they are implemented.  For that reason I request the Minister to seriously reconsider some aspects of this legislation before proceeding with the Bill on Committee Stage.  Data protection legislation was put in place in the UK nearly four years ago.  We should take time to see how this Bill has worked, if it has worked, and learn from mistakes if there are any.  I look forward to the Minister's reply and I hope we will have adequate time to deal with this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to give effect to the terms of the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention of <Col N="858" /> 1981.  The Progressive Democrats were among the first to call for such legislation. We were, I believe, the only party in the last general election to call for such proposals in the manifesto we put forward in that election.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the background to this legislation.  Under Article 12 of the Convention countries who are party to the Convention can prevent the free flow of data to countries which are not party to it.  We, in particular, cannot afford the consequential trading disadvantages of being excluded from this free market of data.  As the Minister said, the international services centre proposed for the Custom House Docks site would not be successful if it were in any way hindered by the lack of this kind of legislation.  Many companies, particularly financial companies, would not be prepared to locate in a country that did not have access to the free flow of data that can be available as a result of ratifying this Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention was prompted by growing concerns about the threat to personal privacy posed by the increasing use of computers.  The computer user may have stored incorrect data or may have amassed more data than is necessary or data of a kind that should not be stored and might indeed have exchanged such information with other computer users. These concerns were linked to the absence of any right on the part of individuals to know what was stored about them.  This could intrude on personal privacy in all sorts of ways.  Individuals might be refused credit or denied a job interview on the basis of information which was stored about them and which very often they might not have even known about.  We have been very slow to protect the privacy of our citizens. The Constitution does not include, in the fundamental rights section, any right to privacy.  Although the courts have been to the foreground in ensuring that our citizens have privacy and have their privacy protected, the Constitution should give citizens that protection.  Many of our citizens have had to take cases to court <Col N="859" /> in order to ensure that their right to privacy is protected.</P>
    <P>On a more trivial level people have found themselves on mailing lists getting junk mail that they do not wish to receive. We are not as frequent users of this junk mail as are people in other parts of the world.  For example, in the United States when somebody has a baby they immediately get a letter congratulating them. When the child is two years old they are told that the child should have a cardigan and when he is four and is about to go to school they are told it would be a good idea if he had X, Y or Z.  While there are business and trade advantages to having that information so freely available it infringes on the rights of citizens.  People should have the right to know who stores information about them and to have that information removed if they do not wish to be included in these kinds of marketing or mailing lists.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give people some redress by ensuring that persons holding data are required to register with the data protection commissioner.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that all computer users should be required to so register.  How is any citizen expected to establish, firstly, who is storing information and, secondly, whether they are storing information about the person in question?</P>
    <P>It is important in the context of this legislation &mdash; in this regard I would differ to some degree with Deputy Barrett &mdash; that the commissioner have sufficient funds available to him.  I accept that if the system can be worked on a self-financing basis that is all the better but if not public servants from the existing Departments of State should be deployed to his office to make sure that this is not just another Office holder without the resources to carry out his job.  In the next few months we will see that the Ombudsman will be such an officer &mdash; he will hold the Office but unfortunately will not have the resources to allow him to do his job properly. If we are to get the balance right in this legislation between helping trade and business, particularly in the financial services area, and protecting the rights of <Col N="860" /> our citizens, in particular the right to privacy, that commissioner will have to have adequate resources available to him or her.  Obviously the Government will appoint such a commissioner.  How long will he be appointed for, what kind of resources will be available to him and what kind of cost will be involved for companies who will have to register?</P>
    <P>In this Bill data is defined as information undergoing automatic processing. Thus, as others have said, information stored in manual files is excluded.  If we were really concerned about protecting the privacy of individuals rather than the trade advantages in this legislation, obviously we would not exclude information that is stored in manual form.  I realise that would pose difficulties, that would be bureaucratic, cumbersome and expensive but to ignore the principle of moving in that direction is dangerous and would be allowing the rights of citizens to take second place to the technological or financial rewards of having this kind of legislation.  It may be the case that certain information on individuals which is currently in computer form may be transferred to manual records simply to avoid having to give out the information.</P>
    <P>It is not clear why word processing is exempted in the definition of processing. While it is desirable that computer users should not be subject to unnecessary regulation any process which has as its end result the production of a document should not be exempt from the Act, otherwise the Act would not have much impact.  The definition section needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>We also need some explanation in relation to data controllers.  It may be the case that although somebody is referred to as the data controller, he or she may not have any control over the data that is held in computer form.  I would like the Minister to elaborate a little more on that matter.  In relation to companies in particular will one person be the data controller even though that person might not have any control over what is held in <Col N="861" /> computer form in relation to individuals?</P>
    <P>The definition section will cause difficulties for partnerships.  Under the Partnership Act, 1890, partnerships are not legal persons.  Therefore, must each partner register if the firm uses data?  This raises the prospect of large registration costs for solicitors and accountants' firms and so on.  This Act should be amended to allow single registration for partnerships.</P>
    <P>I am sure universities and institutions involved in examinations will intensely dislike these provisions but I welcome the fact that students will be able to have access to their exact marks as opposed to the grades they have been getting for the last few years.  However, I recognise that it will cause difficulties and probably long delays.  In relation to intermediate and leaving certificate results, for example, the exact results need not be given for up to two months after their publication. That is an undue delay and results from the fact that we are archaic in the way we organise matters within the Departments and in the methods of holding data.  If we had a much more improved marking and filing system within Government Departments that would not arise.</P>
    <P>The exemption provision in section 1 (4) does not appear to be sufficiently wide.  For example, there should be an exemption in favour of members' clubs and other unincorporated bodies.  As matters stand, golf clubs and political parties will have to register if they keep data of members on computer lists.  That is probably an unnecessary inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been examples of Ministers doing extraordinary things in the interest of State security and I do not refer to the present Minister in that regard.  To leave such a decision in the hands of two members of Government is not desirable and I would like to see greater safeguards in that area, perhaps the involvement of a member of the Judiciary.  In recent years certain matters that had nothing whatever to do with State security were justified in the interest of State security.  The exemptions in this area are too wide and are too open to political interference.</P>
    <P>Section 7 imposes a duty of care on <Col N="862" /> data controllers and data processors but there is no mention of the extent of that duty of care.  If the data controller, for example, negligently discloses information about an individual to an unauthorised user, can the information or the individual in question take an action to recover for physical loss, for economic loss or for any particular shock or upset that has been caused?  That is not made clear by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to other exemptions, State security and tax matters, there are many of us who would like to have access not only to our own tax affairs but also the tax affairs of others to see why it is that some people pay so little.  I wonder is it really necessary to go to the lengths we have gone to in this Bill to exempt so many people from having access to affairs about themselves?  Is that really necessary? I would suggest that in relation to some individuals it would not at all be necessary to go to such lengths to exclude them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the fact that all bodies are not obliged to register and I agree with what he said about that. It would be impossible to enforce the provisions of this Bill if all computer users are not at least obliged to register.  It is not that I want to impose heavy costs particularly on small companies but I believe it will not be possible for the commissioner to enforce many of the provisions of this Bill if all computer users are not registered on an annual basis giving details of what precise details they have collected in this form and for what use they are held.</P>
    <P>Also, in relation to the passing on of information, the Bill does not make it clear as to the use for which this may be done.  While it may be collected and stored by one body for one reason, passed on to another body or group, it can be used for very different reasons indeed. We all know that sometimes when one signs on for a particular product one ends up signing on for all kinds of things and getting information and letters about <Col N="863" /> things which one has not sought information about and would not wish to subscribe to.  There is a lot of exchange of data base between companies in very different fields.  What worries me is that the passing on of information which is held or registered for a particular use may have a different use when passed on and this is not covered under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will end by saying that this Bill will be supported by the Progressive Democrats. We will be putting down some amendments on Committee Stage.  I would have preferred the balance to be a little bit more in favour of the individual.  We have gone a long way down the road to helping the development of trade and commerce by bringing forward this legislation but we have not gone as far as we might have to protect the legitimate rights of individuals.  It should be easier for people to establish whether data are held by somebody about them without having to pay the fee.  We all become data subjects and it is up to the subject to pay the fee.  That is not reasonable.  It would be preferable if people were entitled to get some basic information themselves without having to pay a fee to find out what information is being held by somebody else about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I commend the Minister for bringing it forward.  It is very technical but it is long overdue because we have had the use of computers for quite a number of years and this is the first legislation to regulate their use here.</P>
      <P>The legislation has been prompted by the Data Protection Convention in 1981. Ireland has signed this convention but has not ratified it.  I understand that a number of other countries, Spain, France and West Germany so far have ratified it.  The UK, Denmark and Luxembourg have national legislation put forward but have not yet ratified the Convention as far as I am aware.  This Bill purports to give effect to the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attempt was made previously in the <Col N="864" /> Seanad by Senator Brendan Ryan when he brought forward the Freedom of information Bill in 1985.  Part of that Bill had relevance to this legislation and to the Convention.  This Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation but no report was ever forthcoming which brings to mind what Deputy Barrett had to say about putting this before a joint committee.  If we did that, would a report come forward or would that just delay the passing of a Bill which, as the Minister rightly pointed out, will be very relevant to the happenings down on the docks in Dublin?</P>
    <P>I come back to the Freedom of Information Bill brought forward by Senator Ryan in 1985, it had two flaws.  It had no provision for a system, of regulation or registration whereas this Bill does.  Also, there were no security measures against third party access or alteration to files. The 1981 Convention is to prevent the misuse of information and the use of misinformation on computers.  It goes right to the heart of an individual's right to privacy.  The individual's right to privacy was discussed at great length in two famous cases in the Republic, McGee <i>v.</i> Attorney General and Norris <i>v.</i> Attorney General.  The definition of privacy is sometimes defined as the intrusion upon a person's seclusion or solitude or into his private affairs.  Indeed I think Mr. Justice Henchy in the Norris case referred to the right to privacy as the right to be left alone.</P>
    <P>This Bill is yet another attempt to protect against the intrusion of the computers on the person's right to privacy.  I was looking at a programme on television recently which illustrated that information is quite readily available to the general public.  In fact, the interviewer on the programme took a number of people into the studio, put up a computer and showed them very personal details; they were astounded to find that the computer contained quite personal details about them.  This Bill will, hopefully, help to change that.  To come back to the individual's right to privacy, sometimes this is absolute but on other occasions it <Col N="865" /> should be contravened in the interests of the public good and there are safeguards in this Bill to take care of that.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also important for foreign trade.  We have the Customs House Docks site and all that goes with it, and some foreign companies might be reluctant to come into that if we did not have this legislation in being.  So the sooner it gets on the Statute Book the better.</P>
    <P>The Convention laid down principles which are basically that personal data must be accurate, it must be kept up-to-date, it must be relevant, it must be obtained lawfully and it must be capable of rectification or change and secure against unauthorised access and distribution. However, Article 9 of the Convention allows States to enter derogations on the basis of protection of State security, public safety, etc.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned that manual data are not included.  I was reading the report of the debate in the House of Commons on the UK legislation and this matter was discussed at length and there was quite a strong lobby to have the manual aspect included in the legislation. I appreciate the Convention refers only to automatic processing but I would ask the Minister to have a look at some data protection legislation in relation to manual files at a future date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney mentioned direct mailing and it is very important.  It is contained in section 2 (6) which is in line with the recommendation of the committee of Ministers on this subject.  We all get direct mail to our houses every day of the week.  It is becoming all too frequent.  In America it has gone beyond the beyonds. It is important to have safeguards to prevent us being bombarded in our homes by this type of hard sell.  The Bill provides safeguards in this regard and goes even further than the recommendations of the committee of European Ministers who discussed this matter.  In their recommendation, there was no right of erasure, whereas in our Bill there is.  I compliment the Minister on putting that in.  There are a number of matters in the UK legislation to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> In section 7 of the Bill before us there are very specific points in relation to the duty of care and to compensation provisions. Perhaps there should be a better look at this section and a broader section inserted to include all aspects of compensation in relation to inaccurate information. Section 8 (f) states: &ldquo;....made to the data subject concerned or to a person acting on his behalf.&rdquo;  Could that lead to a legal minefield?  Perhaps that should be elaborated on a little more to show how there is a connection between the data subject and the person acting on his behalf.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 10 I am not very clear about one matter.  I find slight difficulty in the fact that the Commissioner may have grave difficulty in policing all that is going on, particularly in relation to the trans-border transfer of data.  If a complaint is made by a person, has the Commissioner a statutory right to intervene? If he has, perhaps he will get bogged down in many complaints, some frivolous &mdash; although I know that there is a subsection in relation to frivolous complaints.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (1) (c) includes data controllers and debt collecting agencies.  I am wondering if that would include the legal profession who do quite a deal of debt collection.  Would they have to register under this legislation?  I am glad that registration would appear not to include small businesses.  The very fact that somebody goes on to a computer shows that he is trying to be efficient in his business; yet if he gets a computer he may have to register and may be subject to regulations, as against somebody whose business remains manual and who does not have to register and go through all the red tape.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney, in response to the Minister, mentioned that there are quite a number of activities which should be exempt, such as the amendment of text and of documents and the drafting of letters to different recipients.  I understood the Minister to say these are exempt and if that is the case, it is to be welcomed.  In my own experience word <Col N="867" /> processors, in particular, are used as glorified typewriters and not for the purpose for which they were intended.  I am glad on that basis that word processors are exempt.  I wonder, if this Bill conforms to the Convention, who is the overseer? Who will make the decision with regard to whether or not matters are in conformity with the Convention?</P>
    <P>I do not see any provision for people to be told when information on them is being held back.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with that point.  Basically, I welcome the Bill and am glad there appears to be all-party support for it.  I suggest that on Committee Stage an effort should be made to amend a number of aspects about which Deputies are not happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to comment at this stage on this very important legislation, important primarily because it hinges in a very real sense on an aspect of personal liberty, the right to be protected from the collection of information, its wrongful use and dissemination and the right to know what information is being retained. Nonetheless, it is regrettable that the agenda of this House, legislatively, seems to be dictated almost entirely by events which occur outside our jurisdiction.  It is, within a week, the second piece of legislation the origins of which are to be found directly in outside events and motivations.  Last week we discussed the Bill relating to the enforcement before our courts of judgments made in European countries.  At other times we had legislation, particularly related to industrial labour laws.  Such legislation always seems to have been promoted and, indeed, pushed upon us by events abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem here is perhaps not as accentuated in respect of this Bill as in respect of the Bill which we discussed earlier on the enforcement of European court judgments because at least while we are heavily relying upon a Convention &mdash; in this instance a Convention of 1981 &mdash; we are still at a stage where as a <Col N="868" /> Government we have not ratified that Convention and there are many opportunities in the context of the Convention itself available to us as a party to it to extend, to make reservations, to derogate, or to seek to negotiate exceptions for us.  That is exceptionally important.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last Bill discussed, we were in a position where the Convention was already ratified and on the stocks and not available for comment in this House because it was already passed and not open to our review.  Therefore I am suggesting at this stage that the Minister should move with caution with this Bill as he seeks to advance it further through the Houses.  In particular, it is important that its provisions and their implications are made known as widely as possible through the community, to consumers, members of the public generally, social reformers &mdash; because there are contained in the Bill, very important restrictions on the right of access in the whole area of prisons, for example &mdash; and to industry generally so that they are all made aware of what is contemplated in the legislation and that we shall have as wide as possible a contribution from the public at large in regard to the legislation.</P>
    <P>Because of the short time the Bill has been on the stocks, being contemplated in December of last year, there has not been an opportunity for people to respond generally to it.  I hope that, before we have finished with this Bill, there will have been a fairly reasoned and wide-ranging discussion within the community as to its importance, its implications and its impact.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that, for example, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have for a long number of years now contemplated legislation in this area and have campaigned for it.  In 1978, they promoted a report entitled &ldquo;An Act Requiring Open Meetings of Public Bodies and Freedom of Information Bill&rdquo; but that is not directly on all fours with the Bill which is currently being promoted through the House by the Minister.  A corollary to the question of storage of information and access to it is the right to freedom of information by private individuals and <Col N="869" /> this was contemplated and promoted as far back as 1978 by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  I would like to see that body and other bodies concentrating on this Bill for the moment.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that the primary motivation in introducing this Bill, which was highlighted in the Minister's opening statement, is to facilitate the development of industry.  I hope that all of us are aware that there are many other interests and motivations behind the introduction of this legislation.  It is regrettable that we are singularly responding to a Convention and are not meeting our obligations internationally by introducing comprehensive legislation, to deal with the freedom of information, access to it and the right of privacy.  It is a shame for our Governments over the years that there is not on the Statute Book comprehensive legislation to deal with these intrinsically related areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that as far back as 1973 Sweden dealt fully with this matter and that countries such as Luxembourg and Iceland have managed in the intervening period to bring their legislation up to date in order to deal comprehensively with these issues. Unfortunately, this country lags very far behind in the development of law and seems to be prompted, as I have said, by forces exterior to our own Parliament and by the narrow interests of bringing our legislation up to date so that we do not run foul of legislative requirements in the area of business development.  That seems to be the primary motivator.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, it is appropriate to say that The Workers' Party welcome in a guarded way the publication of this Bill and its promotion by the Minister in this House today.  In a limited way it will advance the law in this area and, therefore, it must be supported in this House.  We will be doing so even though we will be casting a very critical eye on it on Committee Stage.  This Bill must be recognised as a singular achievement and advancement in this area.  It is the first small step into the body of law dealing with the area of freedom of information, <Col N="870" /> access to it and the protection of the individual in regard to the assembly of information.  This area should have been looked at long before now and it was overlooked entirely in the drafting of our Constitution in 1937.  It is an area which should have been dealt with under Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have called for the widest possible discussion on the implications of this Bill and I would like the Minister to tell us in reply to this debate to what extent the Government intend to highlight the provisions and implications of this Bill.  Last week I watched a programme on television which was sponsored by a consumer rights body which dealt with the comparative legislation in the United Kingdom.  Members of the public were invited to write in for an information booklet.  This I have already done but, as yet, I have not received a reply.  I hope it will be as comprehensive as the Minister's introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, Deputy Barrett was ahead of me.  However, the most important thing is that the British Government have acted to make sure that the members of the public are aware of the implications of the legislation for them.  Very important protections have been introduced for the first time in a society which is rapidly running ahead of itself in terms of computerisation and it is essential that the members of the public are made fully aware of the implications of that legislation.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether he has any plans or proposals in regard to either copying or advancing on what has been done in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that the Data Protection Commissioner to be appointed under this Bill will, unfortunately, and some would say sadly, play a role similar or parallel to that of the Ombudsman.  He will act as an overseer of operations which are very closely aligned to bureaucracy.  Limited penal powers will be available to him to police his area of activity.  He or she will sit in an office somewhere in this city <Col N="871" /> and will try to grapple with this very cumbersome legislation.  We on this side of the House are disappointed with the way in which the Office of the Ombudsman has been treated in the recent past and we seek assurances from the Minister that when the office of the Data Protection Commissioner is established he or she will not be subjected to the same treatment which the Office of the Ombudsman has been subjected to over the past few months, as a result of which Mr. Mills after a short period in office is so inundated with work and so bereft of resources that he cannot carry out his duties effectively and I can see the same situation arising very quickly in the parallel Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I seek assurances from the Minister that the Government will ensure that once the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has been established adequate resources will be made available to it which will be reviewed upwards irrespective of what other decisions may be taken by the Department of Finance in regard to manning.  As in the case of the Ombudsman, the role of the Data Protection Commissioner will be critical to the working of this legislation.  If he or she is not given the resources to carry out their role this Bill will be unworkable.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the Government and the drafters of the Convention are seeking to draw a balance between the development of computer assembled information on the one hand and the protection of the individual against abuse of that information on the other.  The main function of the Bill is to establish the Office of Data Protection Commissioner and that person will be charged with maintaining a register, to ensure that that register is adhered to and that those who seek registration on it will comply with the law.  What is disappointing is that this legislation does not seek to introduce into our corpus of law declarations of positive right.  The main intention of this Bill is to set up bureaucratic structures which seek to impose upon the data controller or processor <Col N="872" /> duties and obligations which will be mostly policed by the civil law of tort, and under section 16 of the Bill penalties are outlined for the non-compliance with directives issued by the commissioner.</P>
    <P>That is far short of what would have been more desirable in an what area of law that is for the first time being broached by this House.  I would like to have seen a declaration of a positive right available to every citizen of this country to protection and privacy from abuse of the use of information.  A right to access and not simply a bureaucratic structure secondary in benefit to a declaration of right similar to what we have in the Constitution in respect of personal rights should have been contemplated in the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the way the drafters of the legislation have gone about their job the register to be maintained by the commissioner is of crucial importance.  It is essential that when the regulations are drafted, either by the commissioner or by the commissioner on direction of the Minister, very careful consideration be given to the content of the registration of the information.  Again, that is not provided for in the Bill.  It is left to the commissioner in his office to draft in time the regulations to be complied with by those persons seeking registration.  I hope the Minister will counsel the commissioner in his or her functions in this regard to ensure that the widest possible amount of information is contained in the register so that when a member of the public seeks access to it he or she will have all the types of information which are essential to the proper appreciation of the scope and extent of the information retained by the data processor or controller. I would like to itemise some of the pieces of information that must be contained in the register.</P>
    <P>Any proper registration should contain all of the data personal to the individual or subject who seeks information on it, such as name, address, date of birth, PRSI number or any other such information personally directly concerned with the subject and retained by the data <Col N="873" /> processor or controller.  That must be immediately available and evident to the subject on making an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the register should deal with the data base upon which the data is assembled and it should refer to the other data stores to which that data base has a correlation or interrelationship.  Computers attain their brilliance when one gets into the whole area of cross-relations, cross-references and cross-referrals. It must be made clear that one data store or piece of information could be a member of or involved in any number of data stores at any one time.  It is important for a person looking to a register to be able to ask while this data processor or data controller holds that piece of information about him or her on that data base, into how many more data bases that piece of information is linked and in what way they are interchanged and correlated to give a different sum relating to the person or subject.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the register should indicate the data source.  In other words, if, for example, I go to a business who hold a credit reading in relation to me and I find it is wrong, then I am concerned to know about it.  I have used the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; which is probably not appropriate to the area of the retention of the register, but if I look to any piece of information I should be able to be told at that point the source from which that information was drawn and how many of the processes along the way retain that piece of information so that if there is an error to be addressed, corrected or clarified the person seeking the information will have no difficulty in pursuing it.  One of the worst fears any member of the public would have in this regard is that he or she would be subjected to the cat and mouse game of having to pursue endlessly the enlightened or slick computer operator.</P>
    <P>In this context it is fair to say that the computer is a machine that frightens most members of the public.  It seems to control so much of our life at this time that many people are not too sure how to approach it.  They are intimidated by it for a great part.  It must be ensured that <Col N="874" /> a register is comprehensive and intelligible to the person coming off the street so that he or she will have all the information necessary in turn to challenge the data sources or to bring that information to an expert who can advise him on how to address it.</P>
    <P>In this context there is a small provision in the Bill in regard to the levying of charges.  I would like the Minister to consider in time that the charge must be paid, in the wording of the Bill, &ldquo;in advance&rdquo;. It is to be a charge fixed by the person to whom the request for the information is addressed.  It is essential that if people who are not very well off are not to be inhibited from availing of their rights under this Bill they have some appreciation of the extent of the information retained before they are asked to hand over money.  In reading the Bill it seems to me that it is money up front and that is not a very good approach to take where the person is not too sure what is going to be delivered at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The fourth area that the register must deal with comprehensively and make available to the subject on inquiry to the commissioner's office is the data use to which the information is put.  There can be no doubt the Minister envisages under the wording of the Bill that that will be included.  Nonetheless it is important that the register indicates clearly why a piece of information is being retained, to what purpose it will be put and its uses as licensed by the commissioner under the workings of the register.  In this regard there are two areas I ask the Minister to respond to in due course.  It is important that we clarify the uses of all data collection of a general nature, particularly those pieces of information or collection of data that are essential to the proper ordering of our society and which require the co-operation of the public at large.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of two in particular, the census of population carried out by the Government and the assembly of the register of electors which is done by local authorities.  They are essential for the proper working of our society and require the co-operation of the public in their assembly.  It is vital that the public be <Col N="875" /> assured that this type of information will be for a limited and State use only.  It is clear that some local authorities, particularly in the Dublin urban area, use the register of electors as a source of information for the collection of overdue water charges.  For example, in Britain the poll tax will be levied on all persons whose names appear on the register of electors.  It is vital that confidence is restored to the census of population and the assembly of the register of electors and the Minister should use the Bill to do that.  He should ensure that the information is collected for a specific purpose and is not abused.</P>
    <P>In drafting regulations under the Bill the Minister should insist that documents emanating from a source covered by the register or covered by the other data protection provisions in the Bill carry a warning notice indicating that the information is subject to restriction under the Bill.  He should highlight in detail the restrictions on use imposed by the commissioner. That important point is not covered in the Bill and it could conveniently be included by the Minister in a regulation.</P>
    <P>I note that the text of the Convention is conveniently contained in the Bill and I should like to raise a number of questions in regard to it.  We are at the happy stage that we have not ratified that Convention and so to some degree it is open to us to discuss it now.  I should like to put a number of questions about that Convention to the Minister and I appeal to him to respond to them at some stage during the progress of the Bill through the House.  Will the Minister tell the House the derogations the Government have in mind under Article 3.2a?  Deputy Barrett pointed out that there is a facility under Article 3.2 (b) and (c) to extend the operation of the Convention to areas not mentioned in the Convention and he was concerned about the important matter of manual files.  That is a dangerous area particularly in a State with a bureaucracy that seems to rely so heavily on manual files &mdash; I do not mean any disrespect to the fine gentlemen on the Minister's right who are busily preparing <Col N="876" /> notes for the Minister.  A vast area of our bureaucracy relies on the operation of the manual file and we should be concerned about that in connection with this Bill. As Deputy Barrett pointed out, there is a neat opportunity for a data processor, or the person who assembles the information, to take out information from the data base and convert it through the use of a print-out into a manual file and away from immediate public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Have the Government contemplated any derogations from Article 9 which relates to the provisions of Articles 5, 6 and 8 of the Convention?  Article 5 deals with the quality of data to be retained and I should like to know if the Minister, or his officials will consider amending the definition under which it is intended to impose obligations on a data processor or a researcher.  Article 6 deals with personal data relating to race, religion or political opinion and I should like to know if the Minister does not consider it necessary to include the trade union affiliation of an individual.  In this day and age of industrial strife and conflict and under-supply of job opportunities there is a greater reliance on information relating to the affiliation of people to trade unions.  There are many workers who feel aggrieved that their past union history was held against them.  The Minister should tell us whether he considers it appropriate to extend the areas covered under Article 6.  Will he say if we intend derogating from the provisions of Article 8 in relation to access to personal data?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if the Government intend seeking a derogation from the provisions in Article 12 relating to the transborder movement of information? Article 12.3 envisages enabling contracting parties to opt out of the clear and concise condition contained in Article 12.2 which states:</P>
    <P>A Party shall not, for the sole purpose of the protection of privacy, prohibit or subject to special authorisation transborder flows of personal data going to the territory of another Party.</P>
    <P>I am leaving aside the technical worries raised by Deputy Barrett.  I do not know <Col N="877" /> how one can stop a radio message or the computer transmission of information from one State to another but I am sure there is some intention behind that part of the Convention.  However, I am concerned that the Convention only imposes one restriction of the transmission of such information, for the sole purpose of the protection of privacy.  I understood that was the whole purpose of the legislation. That is an important consideration for us, a country that has so many multinational concerns.  We must know whether we will be asked to apply such a sweeping provision to our dealings with multinationals. It is serious if we are to invoke that Article in the way it is drafted.  Will the Minister say if he has any intention of seeking a derogation from it?  I hope the Minister will give me a response to my questions at a later stage.  I accept that he does not have the information to hand.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister in a position to tell us to what extent the other countries who are in a party to the Convention have sought a derogation from Article 12? How many of them have sought exceptions or extensions of this Convention to their national legislation, legislation that would affect information coming to this country?  I would like that information if it is available, at a convenient time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could advise us as to who, under Article 18, he has in mind to appoint to the consultative committee, what expertise he or she has, what is the status of that person within our jurisdiction and what talents or attributes the Minister thinks would be important to a person sitting on behalf of this country on the consultative committee.  With regard to Article 21, do the Government have any active plans for promoting or suggesting amendments to the convention as it stands?  In short, I am asking the Minister what have this or previous Governments done to adopt, apply or develop the Convention since it was first put on the books in 1981.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with specific areas of the Bill which cause me concern and which I hope the Minister will bear in <Col N="878" /> mind before we deal with them in Committee. My first concern deals with section 1 (2).  The Minister might consider an addition to the definition of data that are inaccurate.  The Bill says that data will be considered inaccurate &ldquo;if they are incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact&rdquo;.  It is important that that might be amended further to include &ldquo;any omission of fact&rdquo;.  It is all too evident that a person can be misled and given inaccurate information not simply by what is there in print but by what is omitted.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 1 (3) (a) and the designation of authority, could the Minister advise whether there will be an end to that process?  What I am worried about is this.  As I understand it, the intention behind that provision is that a person within the Civil Service can be designated as the data processor.  That person, for the purposes of that section, in turn becomes a person entitled to designate. I wonder if the Minister is concerned whether there is an end to the process of designation.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (4) (a) deals with the definition of not imparting information because of this time honoured expression &ldquo;safeguarding the security of the State&rdquo;.  Any of us who engage with the Minister for Defence at Question Time will know the extent to which that expression can be used for the purpose of not imparting information.  It is known that most of the information daily refused to Members of this House is available in publications and the manuals of international arms dealings which are available in this city and elsewhere.  I am very concerned about finding the same definition in this legislation that is available to the Minister for Justice and to the Minister for Defence to keep information from persons on the grounds of safeguarding the security of the State.  It happens on numerous occasions with the Minister for Justice but as regards the Minister for Defence anything and everything can be withheld on the grounds of safeguarding the security of the State.  It is important that there should be a reference elsewhere to a higher authority, above and <Col N="879" /> beyond the Minister concerned, for the purposes of reviewing that definitional exception.</P>
    <P>Another particular area of concern is covered in section 5 (1) (c) which deals with the restriction of right of access. As a person who has been concerned for many years with prison reform, I am very alarmed to see that it is the intention to restrict the right of persons to access to information relating to the prison service generally and to prisons on the grounds not only of the prejudice to security but also in the maintenance of good order and discipline.</P>
    <P>Everyone can appreciate the need to be sensitive with regard to security in our prisons, but I do not believe the Minister can make a serious case that a member of the public coming off the streets or any concerned person who seeks information regarding the administration of our prisons would be someone likely to interfere with the maintenance of good order and discipline of life in our prisons.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider having that section amended so as to delete the grounds on which that information can be refused because, in the view of someone in the Department, the maintenance of good order and discipline in a prison could be affected.  I do not believe that is a serious concern. I do not quibble with the restriction as it affects security but I have some reservations so far as the prison service is concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards section 16, I would ask the Minister to consider including a person's union affiliation or membership.  I want also to refer to the section which allows for a person to appeal against a determination direction from the commissioner where he directs a data controller or processor to do something under his power and the person concerned appeals.  The provision that enables the person appealing not to have to comply with that direction in the interim period, is something that will lead to more abuse of the purpose of the Bill than to anything else.  I am contemplating the situation where a person has information <Col N="880" /> that is wrong or is being wrongly used and where the commissioner intervenes to direct compliance with the purposes indicated on the register.  The person concerned can appeal but, while the appeal is pending, he is not obliged to comply with the direction of the commissioner. That seems to be an immediate &ldquo;out&rdquo; available to any dishonest person seeking to wrongly use the information retained by him.  I ask the Minister to tidy that up before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Those are the matters I wish to raise in respect of the Bill.  I indicated previously &mdash; and I will briefly repeat &mdash; The Workers' Party will support this Bill but some of its aspects are of primary concern to us upon which we may have to do battle with the Minister at a later stage unless he hears us as favourably as he has done in the past.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcome this overdue Bill.  It makes a very welcome contribution to our legislative body.  It is interesting to note that the measure resulted as an initiative from the Council of Europe.  All too often one hears criticisms of the travels abroad by Members of this House to do legislative work in the Council of Europe and other bodies.  The people who criticise overlook the fact that the Council of Europe perform very valuable work in bringing forward agreed measures of this nature which find their way into legislation.  I am proud to have been a member of the Council of Europe on and off for the past few years and, with Deputies from other political parties, to have participated in the day to day work of the committees in all sorts of fields which produce measures such as the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been abuses in this regard over the years.  I recall hapless individuals complaining to me that, for some reason they could not understand, they were unable to get a loan from a hire purchase company.  The research that was possible indicated that blacklisting was carried out by all these organisations, financial companies and so on who, quite clearly, had been working hand in glove on these <Col N="881" /> issues, very often without a justifiable base.  Their actions affected many people, including families, and I hope this Bill will remedy that.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point about the limitation of the Bill to individuals.  I am puzzled as to why the Bill is confined to individuals and seems to exclude partnerships and companies from having any rights to apply for information on the computer records of the financial institutions. Many people operate in a partnership. Small companies can be adversely affected by wrong information in the computer data bases.  I know of one such case, a one man company who was brought to the brink of ruin for reasons he could not fathom.  He eventually found out that erroneous information had been lodged with the financial institution with which he was dealing.  Why can the limitation only concern a single individual?  A partnership could mean two or more individuals and the fact that they operate in tandem should not exclude them from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to be effective it will have to operate in the area of Government Departments, semi-State institutions like the Eastern Health Board, the Department of Social Welfare and so on.  The Minister for Justice is taking power in the Bill, in consultation with other Ministers, to exclude some of these Departments or the Eastern Health Board from the operation of the Bill.  One must sound a warning note in this regard.  Governments and their institutions have a tremendous need to keep themselves as secretive as possible and we all know how difficult it can be to extract information about our constituents or indeed &mdash; as a lawyer &mdash; about one's clients from Government Departments, semi-State bodies and so on.  They guard that information with remarkable jealousy.  Indeed on occasion, Government Departments have attempted to avoid court orders. Those kind of ideas ought to be swept away and in this Bill we should make our position clear that, except in recognised special circumstances dealing with State security and limited matters of that <Col N="882" /> nature, the preserve of the State for its own secrecy should not be acceptable. We should seek whatever amendments may be necessary on Committee Stage to ensure that the State will not cop out when it comes to disclosure of information any more than it should be possible for any other institution to do so.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy McCartan referred to the question of derogation being possible under the Convention because if this measure is to be effective, the question of the transborder exchange of information is crucial.  The whole objective of the Bill can be avoided if the data bases are kept in another country. If multinationals are operating in this country and if they feel any embarrassment at maintaining their information data banks here, they may seek to set them up in another country.  Will these multinationals set up in tax havens and avail of the derogation provisions provided?  It would mean that the material could be stored there freed of the obligations imposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The information stored concerning people must indeed be sacrosanct.  Financial firms will maintain data bases which contain information about their customers and so on.  The question then arises as to the transfer of that information to another firm.  A building society may have information about a customer but if the customer seeks a loan from a different building society, there may be an exchange of information.  I want to see it incorporated in the Bill that information may not be given lawfully about a person by any one firm to another unless there is the written consent of the person concerned.  Written consent is essential.  We must copperfasten in this Bill that information about a person may not be passed to another company without the written consent of the person whose information is on file.  It may be in this Bill but I do not see it there.  I would ask the Minister to consider incorporating on Committee Stage the necessity for written permission.</P>
    <P>It seems that responsibility for administering this legislation is devolved onto a single person, the commissioner.  Is that <Col N="883" /> a good idea?  In some of the other countries where the equivalent legislation is operated, responsibility is devolved onto a small board rather than onto a single person.  I do not know if the Minister has considered that but it is something that should be thought about.  It should be up to a small board of perhaps three or five people to operate and to oversee the very serious measures that are provided here. There will be a staff, of course, but it might be too important a function to devolve to one single person, even though there is an appeal procedure provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are probably very few Deputies in the House more at sea in the world of technology to which this Bill introduces us, than I.  At this stage I just wish to ask a few questions which in themselves adequately demonstrate the depth of my lack of knowledge of electronic data processing.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to compare this Bill with the corresponding British Act of 1984 and I am glad to be able to tell the House that, unlike so often in the past, where our legislation tends to be copied word for word from that enacted in Britain, sometimes up to 20 years previously, our Bill on this occasion appears to have been drafted on independent criteria and without more than an occasional glance over our shoulder at the English Act.  If I knew more about data processing, storage and retrieval perhaps I would see more of a resemblance between the two measures, but they appear to be structurally different and in some respects different in detail.  Because I have complained about the opposite so often in this House I am expressing my appreciation of the fact that on this occasion we appear to have done something for ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the achievement of the Minister's Department in producing a Bill of this kind, seeing that, although perhaps they ought to be, they are not a very high technology Department.  I am genuinely interested to know about the <Col N="884" /> mechanism by which this draft came into existence.  Did the Minister's Department retain consultants for the drafting of the Bill from the world of data processors and the world of electronic information? If so, I have no special objection.  I recognise that it may often be cheaper and simpler for a Department to get private sector advice than to retain experts on a full time pensionable basis.  Will the Minister tell us the genetic process by which this Bill arrived before us?  I do not wish the Minister to name consultants but I would like to be assured that they have no, even concealed, axe to grind.  I know the Minister's Department are not so naive as not to spot an obvious interest on the part of consultants that they might entrust with so important a job as drafting legislation, but even such consultants, with the best will and the clearest conscience in the world, may still be injecting some admixture of their own interest and perspective into the draft.  While I have no suspicions in the matter and have no objection to the Department employing consultants in a proper way, the subject matter of the Bill is so far away from the Minister's usual bailiwick that I feel entitled to inquire about it.  The Minister and his Department usually move in the world of handcuffs, bail applications, the slam of prison doors and industrial problems arising from their relations with the various employees under the Department's umbrella.  Visual display units and other high technology are not normally part of the scene at 72-76 St. Stephen's Green.  I am genuinely interested in whether consultants were employed and whether the Minister can be perfectly satisfied that the angle which any individual or firm must have is not reflected in the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>This may be a humble question, but would the Minister tell the House whether the data protection included here relates only to sensitive material or whether it is possible to avoid being in breach of this Bill by disclosing information which is not necessarily sensitive but which may lead to a serious nuisance for a number of people?  I have in mind the possibility of compiling specialised <Col N="885" /> lists of the kind which might arise if one were trying to collate a list of people between the ages of 18 and 20 or of people who were recorded as having some interest in some recreation or sport or people in a certain socio-economic group, and selling that information to an advertising agency or a company with material to sell for which that group is an obvious target.  I do not suffer a lot from this type of thing as I am very careful never to fill up a form which offers me a free holiday in Bulgaria, and puts me therefore on a par with a member of Dublin Corporation. I always turn down offers of that sort because even though the holiday will arrive or the machine or the box of sweetmeats or whatever it is, I am going to be pestered for the rest of my life by unwanted advertising arriving through my letter box as a result of my name having been put on a &ldquo;sucker&rdquo; list and sold to an advertising agency or a firm who believe in marketing products through postal approaches.  I appreciate that there is a limit to the amount of policing the Minister can employ here but I would like the Minister to reassure us that the protection this Bill is designed to provide will not stop merely at the disclosure of material which he or I would recognise as sensitive, but will also prohibit the abstraction from data bases or data banks of specialised lists of that kind. That will simply multiply a nuisance, multiply the waste of paper, multiply the ecological burden, all for the sake of facilitating access to the market for the sort of firms who depend on a postal approach.</P>
    <P>Another small point which perhaps would be more appropriate on Committee Stage &mdash; I do not except the Minister to answer it on his feet but I think it is no harm, therefore, to mention it now &mdash; arises from the definition section. There are special rules regarding the kind of information which the Defence Forces may find necessary to collate in a particular form and which would be made available to an officer in certain conditions. There are similar provisions in regard to the Civil Service.  I presume &mdash; and I would like the Minister to assure me I am right &mdash; that an officer of the <Col N="886" /> Defence Forces, or a public servant who comes through the operation of one of these processing mechanisms into possession of certain kinds of information, so far as an individual is concerned whose data may be reflected in this data bank, will be covered by the Official Secrets Act.  If he afterwards retires, resigns from the service or for whatever reason finds himself outside the service, there will be a sanction preventing him from divulging information which he may have reached by such a means.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am wasting the time of the House by raising a point to which the answer is perfectly clear.  It would be no harm for the Minister to devote a few words showing the correlation which ought to exist in public offices between data collected about individuals and its possible subsequent disclosure.  That kind of information ought to be an official secret for the purpose of the Official Secrets Act and its publication or passing on in any shape or form after the departure of the official or officer concerned from the service ought to be regarded as a breach of the Official Secrets Act just as much as if it was a piece of official information in the more ordinarily understood sense of that term.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I should like to raise and I am sorry if I am wasting anybody's time in doing so.  Is there any suggestion in the operation of the Convention to which this Bill is the Irish response of its cross-Border operation in the sense of the creation of extraterritorial offences?  The Bill does envisage the creation of an indictable offence. Section 30 envisages an indictment for an offence, and it obviously envisages an offence serious enough to warrant putting someone on trial before a jury and exposing him to a possible fine of £50,000. Can the Minister tell the House whether offences of that kind, or that degree of seriousness, ought to be mutually extraditable between the States which are party to the Convention and if they are not whether there is any provision for a network or system of mutual extraterritorial jurisdiction in such a way that we could prosecute here somebody <Col N="887" /> whose action represents a breach of the data protection legislation in Italy or the Swedes could prosecute somebody whose activities there represented a breach of our data protection legislation?  Deputy Taylor referred briefly to this matter, or to something like this matter, if I understood him correctly.  Probably he knows more about it than I do.  I am sorry if I misunderstood him but I thought he raised an interesting point in that connection.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to raise relates to a more strictly legal point and that is the question of the further out consequences of a breach of the Act.  There is what looks like, at first blush, a reasonably adequate apparatus of penalties, but what about further out consequences for the individual?  Suppose an individual feels aggrieved by disclosure of information about himself, which is simultaneously a breach of the Act and which perhaps entitles him to compensation and which exposes the person who has done wrong in disclosing information about this to prosecution.  That is all very fine but what would be the position if at a later point some information about that individual which has become public, or which if it has not become public has become available to somebody, even if it be a State authority to which it otherwise would not have been available?  Would the Minister consider including a provision which would automaticaly invalidate any process taken by a public authority or in which an individual might afterwards be involved <i>vis-à-vis</i> a public authority, in the sense that it would be regarded as a prejudicial situation in which the individual had arrived in consequence of a breach of his rights?</P>
    <P>There is a fairly close analogy &mdash; at least I hope it is close enough for anyone to see &mdash; between the point I am making and the situation where somebody has been arrested on wrong grounds.  During the time when he is under arrest, as a consequence of his arrest a more prejudicial situation arises.  There was, for example, a case involving a person &mdash; I <Col N="888" /> do not want to mention the name of the case although I think the person concerned is dead &mdash; which received much attention here a few years ago in which a person was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  This enabled him to be held for 48 hours but in fact, or so it appeared from the Law Report, merely to enable extradition arrangements to be put in place which facilitated his being exported from the country altogether.  The courts took the line there that since his arrest and holding had been not for the ostensible purpose of operating the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act &mdash; not that he was genuinely under any suspicion of an offence under that Act or related to that Act &mdash; but merely in order to put him on ice for long enough to enable the extradition arrangements to fall into place so that he could then be handed over, the State must be denied the fruits of its misbehaviour.  While I agree in this instance that the State or organs of the State were themselves the authors of the wrongful operation of State law and that there was a clearer reason why the State should be, as the court said, denied the fruits of that unlawful interference with the man's rights, when we are dealing with legislation like this there is a case for saying that where information gets out &mdash; whether it becomes totally public or becomes known to somebody or other in consequence of an invasion of rights here &mdash; no State body, whether it be the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Public Prosecutions or anybody else, is to be allowed rely on information or on something to which they would not have had access but for that information in any proceedings in which that individual might afterwards be prejudicially involved.  I hope the point I am trying to make is not obscure or will not seem impossibly liberal.  If the Minister were to consider amending the Bill by including a clause to that effect he would be doing something very much in the spirit of the decisions in the constitutional area which the courts have given in recent years.</P>
    <P>I want to apologise if anything I have <Col N="889" /> said not only demonstrates my ignorance of the electronic world but also has held up the business of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party and the spokespersons for the other parties for the generous but cautious welcome they gave the Bill.  I thank them very sincerely for their contributions. They have raised a number of points with which I will endeavour to deal.  I hope Deputy Barrett will not take me to task if I deal with one or two points raised by Deputy Kelly first because, let us remember, the last is often first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy did not make any mistakes.  I am not implying anything like that.  In reply to Deputy Kelly's query as to how the Bill came into being &mdash; bearing in mind that in the past there have been accusations on the part of many Members that we normally slavishly follow legislative proposals in another place &mdash; I should say that, in this instance, we did this ourselves within the Department of Justice.  We did not pay any consultants or engage consultants from anywhere to help or advise us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment the Minister's Department in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for that as I am sure are the people who have been involved in its preparation.  In an effort to explain to Deputy Kelly why we felt sufficiently confident that we had the ability to do this the Deputy will appreciate that we had representatives on the Council of Europe committee of experts dealing with this.  It is quite obvious that they gained considerable experience from their participation at that level.  I might say to Deputy Kelly also that I hate being included on anybody's mailing list.  I have as much aversion as he to junk mail.  I do not like being bombarded with unwanted <Col N="890" /> gifts or offers.  I am glad that the provisions of this Bill give the right to have one's name deleted from such lists.  That is the purpose of section 2(6).</P>
      <P>I can confirm for Deputy Kelly that the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1963 cover also disclosures of official information by the holder of a public office after he or she retires.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett hoped that a massive bureaucracy would not be built up and that the office's operating costs would not be borne by the taxpayer.  I mentioned this aspect in my introductory remarks.  It is because we want to avoid bureaucracy that we have partial registration.  Certainly that will cut down on the amount of office work to be done.  In addition, the staff of the commissioner's office will be found through redeployment.  The other office expenses will be met from the registration fees.  I cannot say yet what the registration fee is likely to be. Its amount will depend on a number of factors, including the extent to which it will be possible to staff the office of the Data Protection Commissioner by redeployment of existing staff.  I should say that any shortfall in the operating costs of the office will have to be met from registration fees.  The amount of the fee will be dependent on the number of those who register.  My intention is that, initially, the fee should be prescribed for the first year of registration, to be reviewed at the end of that period in the light of the considerations I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also asked why was a provision about codes of practice included in the Bill.  The Deputy was right in saying that, to a large extent, the provision is aspirational.  But it has a practical significance in so far as it affords an opportunity to the commissioner to approve formally of the provisions in the codes of practice so that they will be given an element of official recognition.  In other words, any data controller who complies with the particular code of conduct governing his industry will know that he is complying fully with the provisions of the Bill.  Codes of conduct or of practice are recognised as being an essential <Col N="891" /> complement to general legislation which can never hope to cover all the detailed requirements of particular areas.</P>
    <P>I will consider the Deputy's suggestion that, in the interests of the Bill being processed and enacted as speedily as possible the Bill be referred to a select committee.  All of us agree that this is a very complex and technical Bill.  If I find I can accept the Deputy's suggestion then perhaps the Whips can deal with the matter from there.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and others were concerned about disclosure of information on health matters.  The Bill provides that there is a clear right of access to data about a person's health.  But it recognises that there must be some safeguards in the interests of data subjects themselves. Clearly in some circumstances the disclosure of such information could cause harm to a patient.  Therefore there is provision for the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the Minister for Health, to make regulations restricting the right of access.  The Council of Europe have issued recommendations on the kinds of circumstances in which disclosure should be restricted.  While no decision has been made with regard to the form of the regulations it is clear that they may confine the disclosure of health data to, say, a patient's doctor and might also restrict disclosure if it would cause harm to the data subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked also who is to decide whether the person seeking access has been given sufficient information. The answer is: ultimately the Data Protection Commissioner.  There is no question of the data controller deciding that an individual has not given sufficient information to locate data.  Such individual has only to complain to the commissioner who must investigate that complaint and who has adequate powers to get whatever information he requires.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett inquired also as to how transfers outside the State are to be monitored by the commissioner.  In the case of registered data controllers &mdash; who will comprise the bulk of those transferring data abroad &mdash; the commissioner must <Col N="892" /> be told at the time of registration what they are doing in this regard.  He will then consider whether they can be allowed to do so and, if he considers that they should not, he can refuse to register that controller. I might add that, through his authorised officers, the commissioner can check on the activities of controllers who transfer data.</P>
    <P>On the question of manual files mentioned by a number of Deputies, I should say that these are excluded for a number of reasons.  First, they do not pose any threat comparable to that caused by computers. Second, the administrative problems and the cost involved in extending the provisions of the Bill to manual files would be colossal and, third, most data protection laws do not extend to manual files.</P>
    <P>Again Deputy Barrett asked how an individual can ascertain whether a person keeps personal data if everyone is not obliged to register.  The answer is that everyone is given the right, under the provisions of section 3, to ask anyone whether he or she has personal data and, if so, what are the main purposes for which they are kept.  I might add that no fee is payable.  This achieves exactly the same result as consulting a register, especially since experience suggests that, where universal registration is the law, a large number of small businesses simply do not register.  If a person refuses to give information about the data he keeps there can be a complaint lodged to the commissioner who must deal with it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies advocated the registration of all data controllers.  The provisions of the Bill have endeavoured to avoid universal registration because it is more likely to create an over-bureaucratic system.  Therefore, registration is limited to the large-scale controllers and controllers who hold sensitive data, so that small businesses will not be burdened by it.  The controllers of the sensitive data, under the provisions of section 16, regarding health matters and so on are included in order to comply with Article 8 of the Convention which requires that special safeguards be provided in respect <Col N="893" /> of such data.  It is for that reason that that category of data controllers must register.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and others suggested that the provisions of the Bill afford the Minister for Justice too much power to determine what personal data should be kept for State security purposes.  We must accept that this type of data must, in no circumstances, be disclosed to persons other than those responsible for maintaining State security and that ultimately the Minister for Justice is responsible to the Dáil in this respect.  In fact what is involved here is that information kept on any computerised files relating to subversives or suspected subversives will not be accessible to such subjects.  It would apply also to security checks made in relation to persons employed, or about to be employed, in military installations and the like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have plenty of opportunity to raise points in the course of Committee Stage.  I said at the outset that, because of the very nature of the Bill, I will more than gladly give as much time as any Member requires to debate any amendment they propose.</P>
      <P>A criticism was made that we have been very slow in bringing this legislation before the Parliament.  As a result of a spot check with regard to the situation in other countries, I understand that a number of other European countries are behind us at this stage, for example, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, to mention a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney made a number of very interesting points, including many of a technical nature.  I hope she will forgive me if I leave some of the technical points until Committee Stage when we can deal with them more fully.  She asked about the commissioner.  It is envisaged that the commissioner and his office will be financed through redeployment and registration fees.  She asked about word processors.  Word processors are not <Col N="894" /> caught by the Bill if they are used to prepare the text of documents only.  If they are used to process personal information they will be caught.  The Deputy asked who will control the data.  The Bill defines a data controller as a person who controls the contents and use of the data. In the case of a partnership, each partner has a say in the contents and use of the data and, therefore, each partner is a data controller.</P>
    <P>She also asked about the possibility of abuse of the national security provision. I mentioned this already in my reply to Deputy Barrett.  It would be a greater abuse if security information about an individual could be disclosed either to him or to persons other than those entrusted by the Dáil to defend national security.  This House has accepted, and I understand still accepts, that the Minister for Justice, who is answerable to the House, has ultimate responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided it relates to subversives or those involved in crime but not to any average citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  There have been some suggestions that the restrictions on the right of access may be excessive. Of course, this is a question of balance.  It is right and proper that a data subject should know what information is kept about him on computer.  However, there are conflicting public and private interests and these are recognised in the Data Protection Convention which we will ratify.  The public interest requires that the right of access should not prejudice the prevention or detection of crime or the monetary interests of the State; neither should the rights and freedoms of other data subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, personal data relating to another individual should not be disclosed without the consent of that individual. Section 4 (4) provides for this, with the qualification that the information must be disclosed if it can be edited without revealing the identity of the other individual.  In other words, the <Col N="895" /> Bill sets out the minimum legal entitlement of a data subject to any information kept about him on computer that can be disclosed without damage to the public and private interests to which I have referred.  Data controllers are free, however, to go further than this if they wish to do so.  For example, employers may negotiate with unions' representatives the extent to which personal information originating from third parties may be disclosed.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy McCartan's party welcome the Bill, even in a guarded fashion.  Obviously he will have a number of amendments for consideration on Committee Stage.  These amendments will be considered in detail when we come to that stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the derogations that we will make to the Convention, these will be as limited as possible and may not go beyond the data mentioned in section 1 (4), namely, archival and other material that is already available by law to the general public.  The derogations under Article 9 are reflected in the restrictions on the right of access as regards the prevention of crime, taxation and so on in Article 5.  These are allowed by the Convention and are related to Articles 5, 6 and 8.  With regard to Article 12, we are already represented on the consultative committee by an observer.  The Deputy asked for information about derogations by other countries which have ratified the Convention.  I do not have this information but I will get it for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>No amendments have been made to the Convention since 1981 and, so far as I am aware, none is contemplated. Deputy McCartan mentioned some other points in his speech that are very much in the technical area.  I am glad he has given us notice of what he proposes to have dealt with by way of amendments on Committee Stage and I will have them examined.</P>
    <P>The Deputy criticised the provision that a person was not obliged to comply with a requirement of the commissioner once he had appealed and that that exemption lasted throughout the period <Col N="896" /> the appeal was being determined.  This is not the full picture.  If the commissioner wants a requirement complied with urgently, all he has to do is include a statement to that effect in, say, the enforcement notice.  When he does that, the data controller concerned must comply with the requirement in the time specified by the commissioner unless, first, he appeals within that time and, secondly, the court allows him a little more time for compliance.  If he does not get a special court order, he commits an offence of non-compliance.  That is provided for in section 25 (4) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the welcome given to the Bill by Deputy Taylor on behalf of his party.  I will consider the points raised by him and I want to mention one of two of them.  I appreciate that there could be an advantage in having the data commissioner backed by a board or an authority, but I must disagree if only on the point of expense and the possible increase in paper work.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to Members for the constructive way in which, on behalf of their parties, they have approached the Bill.  There is general agreement on the objects of the Bill.  These are, first, to protect the privacy of individuals in relation to personal data kept about them on computers and secondly, to facilitate transborder flows of data to the greatest possible extent consistent with the protection of privacy.  The Bill seeks to do that by striking a balance between the requirements of privacy and of maintaining the free flow of data internationally and also with due regard to the need to avoid over-regulation and to minimise the burden on industry.  I am satisfied that we have achieved a proper balance but this is a matter about which there will always be a difference of opinion.  I assure Deputies that I will have a close look at the points made by them between now and Committee Stage and I will not hesitate to bring in any amendments I think will improve the measure. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of Stage at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental aim of this Bill is to <Col N="898" /> meet the need for a comprehensive and uniform set of national quality standards for meat for the home market.  Changed trading practices and increased consumer awareness in recent years have shown that many of the existing controls in this area need to be updated.  The Bill also provides for a new system of controls on meat disposals for non-human use.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad, where the Bill was introduced, Senators on all sides acknowledged the need for fresh legislation in this area and welcomed the overall thrust of the proposed measures.  The Bill was extensively debated in that House and some amendments were made during its passage.</P>
    <P>For many years concern has been expressed about conditions at abattoirs providing meat for the home market.  The main criticism has been that these abattoirs operate under much lower standards than the export plants.  A survey of abattoirs and knackeries conducted in 1982 by the Department of Agriculture indicated that there were 854 local abattoirs in operation.  While high standards prevailed in many, some premises were found to be old and insanitary, difficult to keep clean and far short of the standards considered necessary for any food premises. Together, these premises handle an annual slaughtering throughput of 230,000 cattle, 790,000 sheep and 320,000 pigs, representing the vast bulk of this country's home meat requirements.</P>
    <P>Today's consumers, whether here at home or abroad, are consistent in their demands for the highest standards of hygiene, wholesomeness and excellence in the food that is offered to them for sale.  It is imperative, therefore, that our production and processing standards for meat for home consumption must be consistent with and at the same top level as those at our meat export plants.</P>
    <P>Since taking on responsibility for food, I have repeatedly stressed the need to build on our reputation as a country which produces, processes and markets top quality food products in a wholesome environment.</P>

      <Col N="899" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate a number of the criticisms I made of Mrs. Hussey's Bill last week.  The first point I made then and on which I was being heckled was that the Bill is quite unnecessary, that it is opportunistic in that the Minister for Education has already established the Curriculum Council, whose terms of reference are extremely comprehensive.  That council should be applauded.  I would remind the House that the terms of reference of the Curriculum Council are, to review and make recommendations on the primary and secondary curricula, to give priority to advising the Minister on particular areas of curriculum reform, to advise the Minister on the co-ordination and rationalisation of the work of all the agencies involved in curriculum reform, to advise the Minister on methods of assessing the educational progress of students, to report annually to the Minister, and through the Minister to this House, on the standards attained in the junior and senior level cycle certificate examinations, to carry out such other tasks on curriculum reform as the Minister may direct and to state the financial implication of each recommendation.  In other words, the board have a clear mandate. Consequently, the changes proposed in this Bill appear to be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second objection to the Bill is that there is no inbuilt accountability in the proposals put forward by Deputy Hussey.  What she is proposing could become another statutory Frankenstein, responsible to no one.  It would not be answerable to this House and could in time become another Bord Pleanála.  The board as proposed in this Bill is potentially inflexible.  The terms of a body, once determined by statute have a tendency to solidify with the passage of time. <Col N="900" /> They become more than a guideline. They become a rigid track with rules inevitably carved in granite.  The non-statutory arrangements proposed by the Minister are in my view far less rigid and conversely far more flexible.  The non-statutory Curriculum Council need not, as Deputy Michael Higgins suggested in the House last week, lie down under the dead hand of the Department of Education. I would go along to some degree with Deputy Higgins's viewpoint in that in the past the operations of the Department of Education have been conservative, cautious and excessively centralised.</P>
    <P>My third point and I think, the most important criticism of the Bill is that the legislation is fundamentally flavoured in the provisions dealing with appointments. Under section 5 of the Bill the chairperson would be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Education.  It further states that the chairperson could also be sacked by the Government.  There is nothing very unusual about this. However on examination of the composition of the other 22 members of the board one finds something quite extraordinary and worthy of comment.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 (1) (a) seven of the Minister's friends would be appointed and the Minister for the Gaeltacht could advise the Minister for Education in the event of the Minister not having seven friends.  Under section 6 (1) (b), seven of the Minister's friends who are teachers in either first or second level schools would be appointed.  Under section 6 (1) (c) we would have five of the Minister's friends who are involved in the management of either first or second level schools.  Under section 6 (1) (d), we would have two representatives from the National Parents Council who pass the ministerial friendship test.  Finally, having exhausted all the friends of the Minister for Education, under section 6 (1) (e) we would have the appointment of a friend of the Minister for Labour.  Evidently that Minister is a less gregarious personage than the Minister for Education.  In fact the Minister for Education would have to <Col N="901" /> approve the appointment of perhaps future Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a charter for ministerial cronyism.  If this is not enough, under section 7, in the advent of the Minister falling out with any of his or her friends, he or she can appoint three persons, presumable friends or possibly officials of the Department, to act as advisers to the board.  This is not serious legislation.  It is nothing more or nothing less than a cronys' charter.  In the past one of the criticisms that have been hurled in the direction of Ministers and politicians generally is that there has been too much of what is envisaged in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Last week somebody from the benches opposite suggested I had not read the Bill.  It was because I had read it all too carefully that I ventured to criticise it on this specific point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth problem with the Private Members' Bill is that it involves committing money to a non democratically answerable body.  Far too much taxpayers' money is channelled into bodies that are neither answerable to this House or ultimately to the nation.  In the past we have created a number of quangos, of non-commercial bodies, for a variety of good reasons.  I submit it is time to stop and consider whether we should be creating statutory bodies of this nature.  We should look at the fundamental flaws in the institutional arrangements whereby we establish State organisations.  However, that is outside the immediate ambit of the legislation and is merely an aside.  Far too much money goes to quangos whose results are <Col N="902" /> ephemeral and cannot be measured in quantifiable terms.  I suggest that the provisions in the proposed Bill would create yet another such quango.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this Bill is unnecessary. The Minister for Education has appointed a Curriculum Council who are flexible and have comprehensive terms of reference.  It does not do us any credit to reinvent the wheel continuously.  When something is done well it should be recognised as such and should be allowed to progress without opportunistic attempts to go one better.</P>
      <P>Thirteen of the members appointed to the Curriculum Council are appointed on a representative basis, three of them are appointed by the Minister.  The council will have the expertise of Dr. Walsh, in the chair, and Sr. Eileen Doyle who served the interim board well.  The council also have the support of the secretariat of the interim board.  While the Private Members' Bill may be well meaning, it is quite unnecessary and I see no reason for the proposals put before us to be supported by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill and the unanimous support of all the Opposition parties for it.  It is a very significant measure in more ways than one, particularly in that it is the first definite, trenchant step taken collectively by the Opposition to stem the onslaught and the butchery of the education system that is sadly so much in evidence at present.  It is the first shot to be fired in a very definite war in relation to preserving the education standards which have been so tediously, laboriously, meticulously and caringly built up over the generations since we proudly gained our independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that this measure should come from this party and particularly from Deputy Hussey.  The arrival of Deputy Hussey to the Ministry of Education heralded a new era of adventure, excitement, eagerness and anticipation. As Minister for Education she showed her characteristic courage, a spirit of adventure and innovation and a dynamism that was very badly needed in this <Col N="903" /> Department.  In her four years as Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey did much for education.  She drew back the curtains, opened the windows, ventilated the place and blew away many of the cobwebs in the corridors of the Department of Education for a very long time, the cobwebs and the strictures which had prevented much needed change which is so obvious in the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey has every right to bring this measure before the House.  One of the most significant measures introduced by her was the statutory and independent Curriculum and Examinations Board. The air of expectation, euphoria and optimism which was so prevalent during Deputy Hussey's Minister in Education has changed very much and I am sorry that is the case.  We expected a lot from the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, when she acceded to the chair of education. During the period of Deputy O'Rourke's spokesmanship on education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;everybody was given the impression, parents, children, students, educationists, teachers, journalists and the media, that as soon as Deputy O'Rourke would become Minister for Education there would be fundamental re-thinking, there would be a new input and there would be the type of dynamism that she had showed in her office as spokesperson on Education when she gave the impression that the no-problems syndrome would be very much in vogue when she became Minister. Certainly there is a doom, a gloom and a pervading pessimism in education that never before has been witnessed in the history of this State.  All has changed utterly.  A terrible beauty is born.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of being the innovative Minister for Education that we expected, Deputy O'Rourke now seems to allow herself to be managed and manipulated not alone by the bureaucrats in the Department of Education &mdash; as Deputy <Col N="904" /> Michael D. Higgins has said, the inspectors have won again &mdash; but by the bureaucrats in the Department of Finance.  We now find that we are not running an education system but an economy.</P>

      <P>The problem facing this House tonight is whether or not curriculum reform is required and if so what is the best mechanism, the best operation or the best <i>modus operandi</i> to achieve that reform or, more succinctly, what level of curriculum reform is called for? A quick analysis of the curriculum will provide those answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the state of the Irish language which was referred to by Deputy Quill in her contribution.  It is a language that is very much one of the badges of our nationalism, a language which was trotted out at every Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis since 1927 as being one of the tests of nationalism.  As Deputy Deenihan has said, after 2,200 hours of instruction in the classrooms the school children have a devastatingly, pitifully <Col N="905" /> low level of linguistic confidence in their native tongue.  Why is that the case?  The reason is that it has been beaten to death by over-emphasis on grammar.  It has been cudgelled to death by spending hours on end with children who are struggling and grappling with grammatical construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>In much the same way as this House is cudgelled to death with hollow rhetoric.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purists and the people who regarded themselves as being the aristocrats in the language have very much preserved it as their own particular bailiwick.  They have derided and sneered at the faltering attempts of would-be Gaelgeoirí and people who have a genuine interest in learning the language, in many cases to preserve their own selfish bailiwick and for monetary gain.  In many cases idealism went out the window when it came to treating our national language as the primary language.</P>
      <P>We should look at the position in relation to the English course.  If we look back at the introduction of the intermediate certificate, the leaving certificate or the group certificate, with the introduction of the Vocational Education Act, we will see that by and large, apart from the deletion of some short stories or novels, the fundamental structure has remained largely unchanged.  No matter what the theorists say, with the best will in the world in relation to curriculum, curriculum development and the devising of the English curriculum it is still possible by parrot learning or rote learning to get an exceptionally good grade or good points in English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we examine the position in relation to modern languages we find that approximately 12 years ago most post-primary schools dropped the classics, Latin and Greek, and introduced modern languages.  One of the main problems, especially in the early days of modern language teaching, was that we killed modern languages by treating them as dead languages.  We taught them very <Col N="906" /> much in the same vein, and adopted the same methodology as with Latin and Greek.  There has not been a significant change in this regard.  While we have introduced oral and aural examinations nevertheless I would say with the best will in the world and despite the best efforts of teachers the methodology has not changed.  Many people have not had an opportunity to immerse themselves in the milieu of France, Germany, Spain, Portugal or wherever might be the base or the homeland of the particular language they are teaching.</P>
    <P>Whatever learning and desire is there on the part of these teachers to give their students the necessary knowledge of the oral tongue this again is being stunted and negatived by virtue of the fact that we have not provided them with the technology, the audio-visual and the audiolingual methods to get across to their students the all important flavour that is so vital in the spoken tongue.  One of the main problems is that we place far too much emphasis on the writing and reading of a particular language, and this applies to Irish, English, Latin, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian.  When will people see that language is essentially a spoken medium and that, until such time as we give people the necessary verbal and linguistic competence, we cannot open the door to the literature, the grammar and the other aspects of the language which seem to be of primary importance now in language teaching?</P>
    <P>Subjects, such as history and geography which have had a long and dignified and cherished place on the curriculum, because of the subject choice necessary at a subsequent stage, are relegated to the Cinderella role.  Home economics which is so essential, so dynamic and enlightened in its content, and so pragmatically useful is at the bottom of the deck of cards because university is the barometer of what is taught.  It is sad that in this modern age when the phenomenon is crime, lawlessness and vandalism and there seems to be a wholehearted attempt to curb the growth of vandalism and social disruption, civics which should be <Col N="907" /> so central to the development of good citizens and good young Irish people is again relegated to a secondary role in the curriculum.  I find it difficult to understand that, despite the obvious and alarming statistics in relation to crime, where choices have to be made in relation to what stays and what goes and there is pressure on the timetable, civics is one of the first subjects to go out the window.</P>
    <P>Another phenomenon of the modern age is that, either through unemployment or a shorter working week, people have far more leisure time than ever before. Yet subjects which will stand people in good stead for the rest of their lives in terms of absorbing and passing their time usefully, in terms of genuine aesthetic value and cultural significance such as music, art and physical education are again relegated to the second and third division.  This is very obvious particularly at primary level.  If one looks at the structure of the timetable one generally finds that art, and music in particular, are time-tabled from 2 p.m. to 3.15 p.m. on Friday afternoon because the students are too tired for anything mentally demanding at that time.  Surely if we were serious about curriculum development it would be one of the major roles of the curriculum board to elevate those subjects and give them the status, dignity and position on the curriculum they richly deserve.</P>
    <P>One of the lauded achievements of all Governments over the years has been the development of the concept of community and comprehensive schools, the provision of integrated timetables, the development of an ideal mix by providing up to 30 subjects and giving students the choice between technical, scientific and academic subjects.  Now, as a result of the pressures being brought to bear on teacher numbers in community schools, we have to restrict subject choices.  We are witnessing, in community schools not 1,000 miles removed from where I am, the removal of four teachers which in some cases means the removal of four subjects.  We have gone the full circle. Instead of developing, amplifying and providing further subjects, further areas <Col N="908" /> of growth, further dimensions, further satellite areas that can be developed and enhanced, we are now scaling down the number of subjects and choices.  It is sad that practical subjects, because of points ratings or qualifications for university and other third level colleges and the much vaunted higher education institutions, again do not receive the rating that they deserve.</P>
    <P>We are at a crossroads educationally. The distinct impression given by the Minister when she was spokesperson on Education was that if there was an area crying out for immediate attention and urgent redress it was the area of remedial education.  Teachers and teacher unions were under the impression that as soon as Deputy O'Rourke entered the portals of Marlborough House we would have the provision of a major influx of remedial teachers to cope with the problem. The Minister is aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting at a school last night where there are 190 students and it is crying out for a remedial teacher.  I asked the principal what in his opinion was the number of students who could benefit substantially from remedial teaching and he said between 25 and 30.  That is higher than the 10 per cent I estimated was the across-the-board average in relation to remedial students.  It is sad that on this day, 17 November, of the students who entered the schools at 9.30 this morning and left at 3.15 this evening, one out of every ten derived no benefit, good, bad or indifferent from the curriculum in front of them because they simply had not got the mental capacity to cope.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where not alone do people not benefit from the curriculum but they left school today embittered and thwarted and bewildered and more set back socially and in terms of morale than when they entered.  We have a collective responsibility to do something about this. If it means devising new and imaginative courses, then let us run to it.  If it means having a nail driving competition because that is all somebody is able to do then, in the name of heaven, let us have nail driving competitions because these children are constitutionally entitled to get educational fulfilment from the curriculum which we provide.  It is time we left aside our divisions and our differences in this regard and, once and for all, cherished all our children equally.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest indictments of our educational system has been our failure to do anything in relation to the examination structure.  How wrong it is that after spending eight years in primary school and another five years in post-primary school a 20 hour examination is the final arbiter of whether somebody has achieved a level of educational competence. Surely it is wrong that ten days in June should decide the road a person will go and whether or not he will be classified as an educational reject for the rest of his life.  If ever there was an area crying out for fundamental change it is this area of the examinations structure because it takes no cognisance of personality development, character development or any of the other facets of a person's persona that may perchance develop over the period of a person's educational career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, quite obvious that what we are talking about is not a minor rejigging of the educational structure.  We are not talking about minor tinkering with what is there already.  What we are talking about is major restructuring, and what we need, if we are going to carry this out, is much courage, independence, foresight, expertise and vision.  What we need is not an advisory council which is there simply and solely to advise and report, as the Minister has said, directly to the Minister herself.  What we need is a <Col N="910" /> body which is independent and perceives itself to be so, has a statutory foundation and statutory powers and knows that it cannot at any stage be clobbered by the heavy hand of the Minister.  We do not need a body created in order to provide a sop to people on the pretext that major revision is on the way.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that the pique which quite obviously developed in relation to the Minister and the antipathy that the Minister seems to have towards her predecessor has spilled over into this area and has allowed her an uncharacteristic display of what I regard as smallmindedness in this all important but unfortunate area.  I appeal now to the Minister to have a rethink in this regard. By doing this, she will win the regard and admiration of people rather than their disfavour and that of her colleagues on the Fianna Fáil backbenches.  She and I know the words of the nursery rhyme: &ldquo;Mary had a little lamb&rdquo;.  One thing that we do not want to happen in relation to this all-important area is that everywhere that Mary wants to go, the lamb would be sure to go.  The body must be given its independence, its teeth, its statutory function, thus providing a mature attitude in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I was amused by Deputy Roche's defence of the line that the body should not be independent.  I think he used the word &ldquo;Frankenstein&rdquo;.  It was another example of Fianna Fáil licence and exaggeration. That word was also used by Deputy Woods at another stage when he referred to a &ldquo;Frankenstein stalking the land&rdquo;.  He said we have created many semi-State bodies which have grown up to be monsters.  The mention of An Bord Pleanála was an unfortunate choice because I believe that was the creation of the Minister's own party.  He did not mention the marvellous work done, on the basis of their independence, by the successful ones, such as Bord na Móna, the ESB, Aer Lingus.  Bord Fáilte, to mention but a few.</P>
    <P>Again, I noticed the rather puerile comments of Deputy Wright in relation to his defence of the Minister's stand and that of his party in relation to education, <Col N="911" /> when his only criticism was &mdash; a prime example of nit-picking &mdash; that the terminology used in the Bill was all in the masculine.  Those are weak arguments.  I do not think any strong argument has come from the other side of the House. If the personnel, the functions and the purpose are the same, why change the concept, the idea, the thrust and the whole status of this body in the first place? The body should be independent and there is enough goodwill and work out there to gel the whole lot together into a really dynamic movement which will change the whole face of education at this point.  If the Minister backs down she will be seen as and written into the history books as somebody who took a courageous stand for the benefit of the children, the educationists, the whole education system and future generations of our people.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about now is creating an educational system which will lead Ireland into the nineties and into the 21st century.  I want to laud, in particular, the magnificent work done by voluntary bodies.  I am talking about the combination of Dublin VEC and the Trinity College experiment, about the Humanities and ISCIP movement.  I am talking about the North Mayo Curriculum and Development Board and about the work done by the Intermediate History Body, which is a joint movement where people give voluntarily of their time, efforts and energy and are not paid, a joint movement of teachers and inspectors.</P>
    <P>When it came to making choices about who went and who stayed &mdash; and this happened with agriculture &mdash; it was the people on the ground, the people in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais who went, the practitioners in the field.  They were the ones who were expected to accept redundancies, cuts and staff diminution. Again, in education who are the people who are expected to bear the brunt?  It is the teachers, the hands-on people, the people in the field who know the problems and are wrestling with them and will continue to wrestle with them more helplessly if the Minister goes ahead <Col N="912" /> with increasing the pupil-teacher ratio.  If the Minister looks within the ambit of her Department, she will find there are areas that could be pruned, that there are civil servants who could go.  I am sure there are bureaucrats who could be dispensed with.  Let her leave the practitioners, the teachers, in place.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is a whole layer of duplication and triplication in relation to management.  I am thinking in particular of the illusion that is created that a local management board is a management board, that it has autonomous powers, real powers and teeth.  That is not the situation.  Every single management board and vocational education committee, by and large, must look for ministerial or departmental approval before they do anything of significance.  It is high time we devolved powers to these bodies. These are responsible people taken from the various segments and elements and with the key component of the interest of the particular scheme being managed at heart.  They have expertise and are responsible.  If there was greater devolution of power through the schools, the school management and the vocational education committees, the Minister could safely shed a couple of hundred civil servants in her own Department without any fundamental loss to the efficiency thereof.</P>
    <P>The statement allegedly made by the Minister and reported on the back page of one of the Sunday papers that she is not for turning in this matter should be reconsidered.  She may very well be for turning when this vote is taken tonight. This is the first signal of a collective show of determination by the Opposition parties that in certain areas, at certain stages, and in relation to certain issues the attitude is, thus far and no further.  We have a duty to ensure that our educational standards are maintained and that the momentum of the changes that were underway under the previous Administration is not in any way diminished but gains greater momentum and is carried to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>I can think of other areas where the Minister, without any cost, could bring <Col N="913" /> about certain changes of attitude which would be for the betterment of the education system and for all of us in the long run.  For example, it is unfortunate that nowadays, if a student does the intermediate certificate and passes on to what is normally fourth year in a secondary, comprehensive or community school, and discovers that he or she has made the wrong subject choices because the intermediate certificate results came out a month later than they should have or than the previous year, or if for some reason it is decided by the student or the student's parents that he or she is not of a sufficiently high level of maturity to make a decision in relation to choice of career, or if on the educational advice of the teachers there is a general collective decision that the wise thing to be done in that case is that the student should repeat fourth year, there is no mechanism, no <i>modus operandi</i> for that child to repeat fourth year.  How far removed from the vision, idealism and aim that every school would have the luxury of a transition year in the not too distant future.  I am sad the Minister has not relented in relation to her decision.  It would show a singlemindedness, open-mindedness and receptiveness to logic.  We have a collective determination on this matter and I am glad to hear that Deputy De Rossa will back this Bill.</P>

      <P>In opposing the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment Bill I wish to state that I welcome this debate and thank Deputy Higgins for his comments which I listened to with interest.  I acknowledge the valuable contribution made by Gemma Hussey in her former role as Minister for Education. On balance the proposal to establish a council for curriculum assessment as announced by the Minister is more worthy of the support of this House.  The Minister has rightly pointed out that if the terms of reference of a body such as the curriculum council are statutory they become more inflexible.  The Minister is proposing to establish a non-statutory body with responsibility for advising on the school curriculum and pupil assessment <Col N="914" /> and acknowledges the fact that we are living in changing and challenging times.</P>
      <P>The changing nature of educational needs in particular require a flexible response from the Minister and this is a main reason for opposing Mrs. Hussey's Bill which will, in effect, create a board with very strict terms of reference and which could not respond immediately to whatever aspects of the curriculum which were in need of reform at a particular time.  As the curriculum council would be an advisory non-statutory body their terms of reference could be simply revised from time to time as the need required.  I also welcome the fact that it is the Minister's intention that the council would co-ordinate the work of the various bodies involved in curriculum development, which was referred to by earlier speakers, such as the local curriculum development units, the education research centre at St. Patrick's Training College, the City of Dublin VEC, Trinity College and others.  Mrs. Hussey's Bill does not address&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but the Chair has an obligation to ensure that Members are referred to by their appropriate titles in this House.  It is contained in the Standing Orders.  Deputy Gemma Hussey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and accept the correction.  One of their terms of reference is that various research units throughout the country would be monitored and directed by the council.  I wish to repeat the fact tonight that they do have money for research.  This body overseeing the various submissions will be very cost effective and positive.  They will streamline the curriculum research area and there will be no overlapping of personnel.  The end product will be the most effective use of research with maximum benefit to all of us connected with education.  Deputy Hussey's Bill does not address this important matter. There is no group assimilating these <Col N="915" /> works and ensuring that they are rationalised.</P>
      <P>Another of their terms of reference is interesting and noteworthy and it is something that has not been done before on a consistent basis.  It is proposed that the curriculum council report annually to the Minister on standards attained in State examinations, in other words, on the grades achieved by students at intermediate and leaving certificate levels. This will ensure that teachers involved directly in the classroom, parents of students and the wider public will be in a position to see exactly the way students perform each year in any given subject. What is more important is that it will eliminate the misleading comments and speculation in the newspapers each year around examination time.  We are all used to comments such as the English paper was marked harder than last year and that the mathematics paper was tougher and more difficult than last year but this in effect will mean a greater stability and reassurance for all concerned with the examination system.</P>
      <P>It has been said that if you want to do nothing, you set up sub-committees.  I looked at the intricate sub-committees which were set up by the <i>ad hoc</i> board. These sub-committees will report to co-ordinating committees who in turn will report to the board.  Frankly, it would make one dizzy just to read about it.  It is a very cumbersome system and the Minister's proposal would lead to the establishing of a simpler committee structure which would be easily adaptable and which would address the priorities of the day and they will advise the Minister directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in her speech rightly asked the question as to what items of reform have been carried out in the classrooms as a result of the <i>ad hoc</i> board's deliberations.  Indeed, they did make many recommendations but perhaps they were not specific enough or too costly to implement.  They were not based on reality and they did not identify items of reform which were capable of being put into effect immediately.  The curriculum <Col N="916" /> council will be constituted from various educational interests, teachers, managers, parents and others chosen because of their expertise.  This will be a very effective advisory body and they will have direct access to the Minister of the day. One of the tasks of the curriculum council will be to oversee the completion of the primary school curriculum.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Higgins refer to the teaching of languages and continental languages in particular.  I believe the council will address the urgent need to ensure that modern languages other than French are offered as a second continental language to our students as part of their subject options.  The Department must positively pursue a policy of ensuring that students have a good oral grasp of languages such as German, Spanish, Italian and others which were referred to by the previous speaker.  One has to admire our European colleagues and their ability to speak the English language so fluently.  As a nation becoming more progressively immersed in the European scene, both economically and socially, we owe it to our European partners to make a real effort to master these languages.</P>
    <P>A particular remit of the primary review body which was established recently by the Minister is to pay specific attention to the last two years of primary school and their alignment to post primary education.  The question of the teaching of modern languages in the last two years of primary school should be considered in the light of co-ordinating curriculum development between primary and post primary schools.  Most developed countries have advisory groups similar to the curriculum council which concentrate on curriculum and related matters.  There is no reason why we should not follow suit.  We should not under-estimate the challenge facing the council and this has been referred to already by the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and others.  One of the previous speakers referred to the figures of post primary level and they are quite staggering.  Let me just repeat them.  In 1960, 8,000 pupils sat for their <Col N="917" /> leaving certificate and, in 1987, 55,000 pupils sat for the leaving certificate.  As one of the previous speakers has said this amounts to a 700 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in that context our policies must be flexible.  Flexible policies which would encompass language development, the needs of industry and technology, computer studies, the Arts and the handicapped should have specific emphasis and specific emphasis should also be placed on the social dimension. This has also been referred to by other speakers in this debate.</P>
    <P>The question of educational opportunities must be looked at and, unfortunately, the figures still show that pupils from the lower socio-economic groupings as they are unfortunately described show a tremendous failure rate, much less than pupils from other groupings at all levels of the educational system.  We should intensify our efforts to address this issue and rectify the imbalance.  The problem must be addressed specifically at primary level and into the early years of post primary level.  We should ensure that as many young people as possible from the so-called lower socio-economic groupings advance to third level education if they so wish.  I blame successive Governments for this problem.  We still have not tackled this specific problem.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I would like to reaffirm that once a statutory board is established, that is that.  It requires further amendments in this House to introduce change. If there are any perceived flaws the Minister has to have recourse to this cumbersome procedure which is to have to come back to this Chamber and, no matter how necessary it might be, cannot direct the board on a change that might be desirable.  The interim board on occasion went off at a tangent in some of their deliberations and came up with some unrealistic proposals which were not supported by those involved in the educational process.  It is vital that any curriculum body should be immediately flexible to change with the needs of educational services as they develop.</P>
    <P>Linked with that is the question of accountability.  The buck stops with the <Col N="918" /> Minister and the Department, as Deputy Hussey realises.  Therefore anybody involved in devising new programmes and syllabuses in schools must surely be accountable to the individual and the body responsible for that system.  If experience is anything to go by, it is evident from some of the works of the interim board that they went one way with ideas and proposals that could under no circumstances be delivered on by the Minister of the day.  If the education system is to work at all, all the various parts must work in harness.  From previous experience the former Minister's proposal would not ensure this because there is no direct accountability.  Deputy Hussey in proposing this Bill has indicated in her request for finance, I believe as recently as today, that the proposal will cost money but nowhere has she costed it, as far as I am aware.  It is totally unrealistic to propose a Bill on these grounds and it would be unrealistic of this House to pass it bearing in mind the financial situation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the non-political nature of the Minister's proposal.  She decided in establishing a curriculum council, with the exception of one nominee to represent those directly involved with the Irish language, to allow those directly involved in the education process to appoint individuals whom they regarded as best representing their needs and requirements.  There are no appointments by the Minister with the exception of the person I have mentioned.  There is no political interference at either council level or the level of the course committees, unlike in the interim board which Deputy Hussey established and this proposed statutory board.  Also in this proposal there is no formal representative of the teachers' unions who, after all, are the formal representative bodies of the teaching force.  The curriculum council were established last Monday week and will be launched in a fortnight's time with the retention of the chairman, the vice-chairman and the secretariat of the interim board, ensuring the smoothest possible transition in the work of curriculum reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> The Minister's commitment to this work is clearly evident, not just in the terms of reference set out for the council but in the tasks she has given to the council the most important of which is the combining of the group certificate and the intermediate certificate.  To ensure that this new certificate comes in in time &mdash; the date specified is September 1989 &mdash; the Minister has requested the council to have the major subjects completely revised by May of next year.  Therefore, the very necessary and vital work of curriculum change and development is well under way and underlines the wisdom of the Minister's decision in establishing such a flexible and vibrant entity as the curriculum council as opposed to the inflexible, unaccountable and rather unwieldly proposal envisaged in this Bill. I call on the House to defeat the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will not go over ground already covered by many speakers in this debate.  Just as we are all for good weather and against killer whales, we are all for good education.  The depressing factor about this debate is that we had an opportunity if a statutory board had been set up to do more than just have messages of goodwill about our education system. Time is running out on us, we need a statutory basis and powers that will drag this outdated, nightmarishly slow, totally redundant method of education into the challenge of giving learning and survival skills to our young people in the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here let me pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Hussey, who took on board what I said when she was Minister and brought about radical thinking and change.  She surrounded herself with people who were not alone involved in education but were aware of the urgency of bringing about that change and to produce the development and skills necessary for us to survive not just in <Col N="920" /> the world of tomorrow but of the next century which is almost on us.  Young children going to school today will barely have finished their orthodox education when we enter the year 2000.  That is an awesome thought.</P>
    <P>In the fifties and sixties the technological change we know now seemed unattainable and we thought that at least a century would pass before we would reach the moon or have laser or communications that would make this world a global village, but with a speed which has exceeded that of light this has all come about.  What happened to education at the same time?  Sluggishly, slowly, suffocatingly and smotheringly our children have been kept in a conformist position and so were no more prepared for the world of today than the dinosaurs.  What are we asking from education? What do we need for education? We need emphasis on learning, not a body of information delivered on the right day at the right time within three hours: &ldquo;Lift your pens; now lay them down.&rdquo;  We need learning as a process, not a product that was packaged and you live or die by how you fared in your examination over a few days after five years of grinding knowledge into little compartments in our heads.</P>
    <P>We need an education that gives us autonomy, questioning, challenge, independence, in particular, when so many of our young people have to go abroad to seek employment.  What have we got? We have an authoritarian system which quashes all such signs of independence and questioning.  Above all else we need a flexible structure that is not a prescribed curriculum.  How could such a radical revolution come about without the powers of a statutory board to approve it?  There are people many in education, who still believe that in some way we have a great education system and that if people conform to the productivity conveyor belt we are turning out good citizens. We need radical thinking backed up with the statutory powers of a board to bring about the kind of education system we need.  I do not believe that we can do it without a statutory board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Let me refer to the need we had for a statutory board to be set up with regard to the introduction of equality legislation in the whole area of employment and vocational training.  I and everybody else would like to believe that attitudes could change and practices could be reformed without statutory powers, or a board committed totally within the terms of reference given to them, but it was not so. I was most grateful that we had statutory agencies such as the Employment Equality Agency when in November 1987 a trade union official made remarks about not allowing women equal opportunity in work and training with men and when questioned on that as a case of discrimination the immortal words emerged: &ldquo;In God's name, how can women be equal with men?  After all, they are but the rib of man&rdquo;.  If we did not have an agency with statutory powers to take on that type of bone-headed attitude &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; and that discrimination, we would still be suffering under it.  That is why we need the curriculum board with the powers as set out by Deputy Hussey.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is not here to listen to what I have to say.  She sat on a Women's Rights Committee with me and worked with me and other members of that committee in preparing and bringing forward our report on education.  We realised that no reforms, no change and no real justice or equality could come about without reforming the education system.  Much of our report is concerned with reform of the curriculum.  The recommendations of the committee were fully endorsed by Deputy O'Rourke as a member of that committee and supported by everybody in education, including all the teaching unions.  I will mention four principal recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>One recommendation was for reform of the school curriculum to allow subject and career choices to be widened, with appropriate and necessary adjustment to timetabling arrangements.  Another recommendation was that a programme to teach basic skills for living, embracing <Col N="922" /> social and political science, should be introduced in all post-primary schools. Another proposal was that a fully comprehensive sex education programme embracing the whole area of responsible personal relationships should be introduced in primary and secondary schools. The fourth recommendation I will mention was that colleges of education and universities should include all aspects of equality and the elimination of sexism in the preparation of students for the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that unless we have a statutory curriculum board with the structures suggested and defined by Deputy Hussey in this Bill, there is no way that type of reform and long sought for justice will become part of the school curriculum.  Failure to accept this Bill will be to the detriment of everybody, particularly the young people who are coming through the same slow, smothering system we barely survived.</P>
    <P>This is not a party political issue for me but a matter of great concern.  Here we have a chance to set up an independent autonomous agency with the powers to push through decisions.  This Fianna Fáil Government have dismantled every independent agency, to the extent that we are centralised to the point of being swallowed up.  The council will be toothless. It will deal in wishy-washy messages of goodwill towards education, of a type we have had for the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to remember the fine expressions of support she gave inside and outside this House and on various committees and to deliver a statutory board with the teeth to bring about the radical changes which are long overdue.</P>

      <P>Everyone has been loud in praise for the work of the interim board.  That praise is richly deserved and serves as a practical demonstration of gratitude.  It is reflected in the fact that the Minister has reappointed the chairman, the vice-chairperson, the chief executive and the secretariat.  The reappointments suggest to me that the issue is not the political football which Deputy <Col N="923" /> Hussey suggests but rather an enlightened move which recognises the value of recommendations which have emanated from this august body and the desire of the Minister to entertain enterprising suggestions relating to curriculum development and assessment.</P>
      <P>Almost every Deputy who has contributed to this debate has outlined the need for curriculum reform.  Focus has been placed on the necessity of developing the scope of language teaching.  There is a need to rationalise, for instance, the discrepancy which exists in the curriculum for national schools <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Gael scoileanna.  In the latter schools the teaching of French forms part and parcel of the curriculum while in national schools teachers are prevented from having French as part of their curriculum. Why should there be this difference?</P>
      <P>In second level schools last year we expended £160 million on the teaching of Irish and £150 million on English, while we spent a meagre £10 million on the teaching of German.  Are we, in fact, getting value for money in the teaching of Irish and English at primary and second level?  Could we not rationalise the teaching syllabus in each of these subjects to bring about greater fluency and literacy? Deputy Higgins impressed by the passionate nature of his speech but I was rather surprised he thought there was an over-emphasis on literacy in the curriculum. My experience would seem to suggest otherwise.  If we are spending £160 million and £150 million on both these subjects we have to ask if we have been getting value for money.  There is a general consensus in the House that this has not been the case.  It is rather strange that in every subject taught in the second level sector there is an oral test but there is no oral test in English.  It has been suggested that if one is to be socially adequate one has to have developed real oral capabilities.  We certainly are not stressing adequately that aspect of our English programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also question the width and the scope of the syllabus for Irish and <Col N="924" /> English.  Are we trying to achieve too much in imparting a wide range of subjects like poetry, fiction and short stories to the detriment of written and oral capabilities? As a person who has had teaching experience at third level, I am well aware that the embellishments in oral capacity and literacy are sadly lacking in students who have achieved honours in these subjects in the leaving certificate. Indeed, many lecturers at third level find they have to concentrate a lot of their time on doing remedial Irish and English with students.  I should like to suggest that we consider including business English in our curriculum.  There must be scope for development in that area because, sadly, many students at third level do not have any knowledge of report writing or business letter writing.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, my time to respond to this interesting debate is very short.  At the outset I should like to deal briefly with the main points raised in the debate.  I should like to thank Deputies on this side of the House for their fine support for the Bill but I was extremely disappointed at the totally inadequate and confused, not to say confusing, response from the Fianna Fáil side.  The main question put to the Minister was totally ignored.  Why, after four years of calling for a statutory board to bring the world of education into policy making and after the most explicit undertaking in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto to &ldquo;establish the curriculum board on a statutory basis&rdquo;, has there been a complete reversal and the hasty abolition of the board?</P>

      <P>The Minister, and her disciples&mdash;I include the Minister of State in that description &mdash; came in one after another and read irrelevant passages into the record and added to the destruction of any remaining reputation which the Minister, or Fianna Fáil, had left on the whole education area.  The only conclusion one can come to is that the undertaking to establish the Curriculum Board on a statutory basis, like the many other undertakings in regard to education, was not worth the paper it was written on.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the only arguments put forward by the Government side and to dismiss them.  The first related to a strange obsession with the question of money.  An allegation was made that the board would cost £500,000 in the year of their establishment.  That was not true in 1986 when the Bill was published and it is not true today and the Minister, and the Minister of State, are well aware of that.  The extra cost will arise only when the board have taken over the running of the examinations, not before the third year at the earliest after the board are established.  That cost, caused by the employment of assessment professionals to release the inspectorate to do the work which desperately needs to be done for the good of education &mdash; I am referring to the work of inspecting and advising schools which cannot be done now &mdash; will be more than covered by the introduction of computerisation of the examinations which were so short-sightedly abandoned by Fianna Fáil immediately on taking office in March.  No costs will arise in 1987 or 1988 since there is already money in the 1988 Estimates for the work of the board.  It was a nonsense to put forward that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ignorance about the workings of the board revealed by the remark that none of this work had been carried <Col N="926" /> through to the classrooms amounts to nothing less than an insult to this House and to the board.  Apart from the invaluable assistance to schools given by the guidelines published for the transition year &mdash; another educational reform which is in the process of being eliminated by the Minister &mdash; the Minister knows full well that her Department specifically reserves to itself the role of implementing the board's recommendations.  How can she justify that amazing allegation when she has already accepted the recommendations of the board for the new junior cycle assessment and certification system which means widescale changes in schools?  I regret that that slur was cast on the board and I hope it will be honourably withdrawn at the first appropriate occasion.</P>
    <P>A signpost to the real reasons for the Minister's abolition of the board and her refusal to fulfil her own undertakings to them, and to the world of education, can be found in her statement to the House that the terms of the Bill would permit the board to concentrate on their own perceived priorities rather than those of the Minister.  That was a very revealing statement.  The Minister is obviously afraid that a statutory board, even though their role is to advise, might actually dare to think for themselves, as the interim board have done so admirably.  The Minister obviously sees her own new council as a body who will only do what she tells them to do and who will only think what she wants them to think.  The Minister, apparently, is to be the repository of all wisdom and no board or council are to be allowed rock the boat in any way. It is another sign that in every area of education the Minister, and the Government, are going back as fast as they can to the old days of fear and central control.</P>

      <P>We had further desperate casting around by the Minister in search of arguments to defend the indefensible. She produced the gem that the interim board &ldquo;did not show any interest in running examinations&rdquo;.  How could <Col N="927" /> they show that interest when it was not in their terms of reference?  It was at this stage, the Minister is aware of this &mdash; the setting up of the statutory board &mdash; that they would proceed to the essential task of taking over the examinations in order to marry both parts of their brief.  Any member taking appointment to the statutory board would, therefore, be fully aware that the examinations and assessment areas would form part of their new brief.  To be as kind as possible to the Minister, and that is difficult, it was disingenuous of her to allow that sentence to be put into her speech.</P>
      <P>We have had other Government speakers alleging, among other things, that the Bill proposed to set up a complicated system.  That allegation was repeated this evening.  Anyone who had taken the least trouble to read the Bill would see that section 9, dealing with committees, is an enabling section.  It enables the Minister, and only the Minister, to set up committees of the board to deal with any matter upon which she, and the board, felt they needed the advice of a committee.  That section has been repeatedly distorted in the House by those who are searching for an argument to defend the indefensible.  Apart from the implied repeated slur on the work of the excellent committee of the interim board who gave such heart and hope to schools and teachers all over Ireland in their widespread consultations, the fact of the matter is that section 9 is purely an enabling section so that no complications or committees arise without the expressed wish of the Minister of the day.  To send unfortunate Deputies into the Chamber with scripts containing those allegations was less than fair to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wright referred to the previous Government's restriction on ex-quota guidance posts in schools.  I was astonished that any member of a party which has used such a sledge hammer on every aspect of primary, second level and third level education would dare to ever mention it, considering that in the face <Col N="928" /> of massive electoral promises they half restored the guidance teachers and proceeded to destroy every other area they could find.  Taking £86 million out of education in one fell swoop amounts to the biggest demolition job ever visited on any education system in any modern western country.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins in the course of his contribution summed it all up adequately when he described the Minister as the Minister for destruction in education.</P>
    <P>These are some of the main points which were dwelt upon again and again by Deputies on the Government side. They dealt with them somewhat incoherently. That was understandable because they were asked to defend the betrayal of yet another solemn undertaking to teachers, parents and students. The undertaking was made in the four years that Fianna Fáil were in Opposition and in the recent election campaign.  I should like to thank the Deputies from my party, and the other Opposition parties, who spoke so eloquently in support of education reform and curriculum and assessment development in Ireland.  I found the degree of expertise and commitment from Opposition speakers to be in extraordinary contrast with the inadequacies which emanated from the Government side.  Opposition Deputies have made many valid educational points and there is no need for me to repeat them.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the debate it is important that I should announce that in the absence of any certificate from the Government to enable the Bill to proceed beyond Second Stage &mdash; I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business today to send that certificate but I got a blank silence in response &mdash; we will be voting on the principle of the Bill, that is the bringing into the body of law here for the first time the principle of parliamentary responsibility for educational democracy through the involvement of legitimate educational interests in the State's educational policy making.</P>
    <P>We will be showing the interest of the House in reaching out to the wider world of education and asking them to assist <Col N="929" /> and advise on the all-important work of changing the face of Irish education as we approach the 21st century.  If we were allowed we would be able to proceed to a full and thorough Committee Stage where the many amendments mentioned by different groups, inside and outside the House, could be discussed and no doubt agreed as far as possible, a procedure which would have been an improving process for us all and for the Bill.  Unfortunately, we are denied that privilege.  We are denied it by a Government who have shown they detest and fear any initiative which comes from any source other than themselves, irrespective of its merits.  We are denied it by a Minister who must be now fully aware that her failure to protect education at Cabinet has jeopardised any hope of curriculum reform either at primary or post-primary level.</P>
    <P>There is one quote in the debate which stands out in my mind.  It was by the Minister of State who, on the first evening said &mdash; and at the time the House was shocked into laughter &mdash;&ldquo;the people are tired of being hoodwinked.&rdquo;  Over the past number of weeks we have seen in this debate the latest exercise in hoodwinking added to the crude and almost unbelievable attack on all our educational facilities.  Between them, the Minister and the Government have made 1987 the blackest year ever in Irish education. Fianna Fáil who once had credibility in education have destroyed that credibility forever.  More seriously, the tragedy is that 1987 also marks the year when a bodyblow was struck at a generation of young Irish people whose proudest possession until now was a first-class education equal to the best in any country in the world.  That is a very sad reflection of what is happening in this House this evening.  The morale of professional educators is at a new low.  They see their work and their commitment reduced to nothing by an uncaring beleaguered Government and a Minister who seemingly does not know and does not care.</P>
    <P>It takes courage to act in a spirit of openness.  It takes courage for a Minister to put herself in the firing line rather <Col N="930" /> than in a secret, closed decision-making environment.  The actions of this Minister in this area of curriculum reform demonstrate her fear, and her Government's fear, of openness.  What have they to hide?  After listening to this debate we have to conclude they are hiding the fact that, in terms of ideas, of genuine outward looking commitment to young people's education, the Fianna Fáil cupboard is bare.  For example, will the Minister publish now, immediately, the interim board's new syllabus on civic and political studies?  It is on her desk.  It is a response to a specific request made to them by me to give us the long needed initiative in the study of our democracy which is so important in young Ireland. That is a test case for the Minister and I await with interest the response from Marlborough Street.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's contribution and in other contributions great play was made of the fact that the chairperson and vice-chairperson of the interim board had agreed to serve on the advisory council &mdash; a council who now face their work without the input of major teaching interests who feel it impossible to work in the face of such massive attacks on their areas.  I pay tribute to those two excellent people who, in the interests of continuity and the good of our young people, have swallowed what must be great hurt in order to retrieve something from the debacle all round them.  It is a measure of their dedication, not a reflection of any merit on the Minister's action, that they do so.  I wish them well, and I wish them forebearance as they set out on these rough uncharted waters at the whim of the Minister whose word is worth nothing and whose weakness in the face of the Government's obvious dislike to education must give rise to great foreboding. I renew my thanks and appreciation for the interim board's work over four years, work which was so summarily and so rudely dismissed on 9 October.</P>
    <P>I hope today that the votes of so many Deputies in this House who have indicated their support of the principle I am putting forward today will be a message to the dedicated educationists across <Col N="931" /> Ireland that parliamentarians want to see their work highly valued, that there is a deep and genuine interest in education on all sides of the House because I do not believe there is nobody at all in Fianna Fáil who cares about education.  There was a time when Fianna Fáil showed a real flair for education.  Unfortunately that is sadly gone.  I hope that by our votes we will put down a marker for this <Col N="932" /> Government that they must turn away from the destructive path they have taken on education and restore some hope and trust to the young people of Ireland who depend entirely on this generation in Dáil Éireann for their future chances in a new and difficult world.</P>
    <P>I commend Second Stage Reading of this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  On a number of previous occasions I raised the issue of the £120 million which will be necessary to fund the lump sum element of the redundancy package announced by the Government last July.  I raised it on the Estimates and during the course of the debate on the Bill which made modifications on how the local loans fund will be accounted in the national debt.  I raised it on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.  I sought to raise it by means of Private Notice Question and this morning I sought to raise it under Standing Order 30 so as to have a three hour debate here on the issue.  I am grateful that the Chair has allowed me to raise it on the Adjournment.  Though I regard this as a most unsatisfactory way of raising such a serious issue, at least the matter is before the House and I hope I can get answers from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answers to date have been unsatisfactory. When Finance questions were taken on Thursday, 5 November, the Minister outlined in great detail the elements of the redundancy package.  He said he was not really in a position to cost the redundancy package and that <Col N="935" /> the costs of these payments would be influenced by the volume, the nature and the timing of the redundancies.  The implication of that was that he could not put a figure on the cost of the redundancies. The Department of Finance and the Minister did not seem to have any difficulty in putting a cost on the extra pensions which would be necessary to be paid to those who become redundant. The Department of Finance and the Minister did not seem to have any difficulty in deciding the total payroll in the public service next year, and to arrive at that figure they had to allow for a certain number of people taking redundancies and calculate the net figure.  To calculate the cost of pensions in the public service in 1988 it is necessary to know the grade of those retiring, the length of service and the numbers involved.  That is exactly the information which the Minister requires to calculate the size of the lump sum payment also.  The Minister should not come back and tell me that because he does not know the volume, the nature and the timing of the redundancies that he cannot say how much it costs.  The Minister has already in the Book of Estimates clearly implied that he knows the grade, the length of service and the numbers of people involved.</P>
    <P>The cost of the public service pay deal negotiated by the Government for next year is £70 million.  Curiously enough, the Minister said to Deputy Boland in reply to a Written Question that he intends to save £70 million by means of the redundancy package and by not filling vacancies in the public service.  It seems to me that the calculations of the cost of the pay came first and then the Minister decided that since that would come to £70 million he would have to get £70 million through the redundancy package and through not filling vacancies.  As long ago as last July the Minister intimated that some mechanism which involved the Central Bank would be used to fund the redundancy element.  In the Book of Estimates there is reference to the fact that it does not contain any figure which would go <Col N="936" /> towards payment of redundancies, but that the Minister would make an announcement later.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what is delaying the Minister.  What are the Minister and the Government hiding on this occasion? If it is as simple as we are let to believe why has it taken from last July until the middle of November to get a satisfactory answer to this question?  I am reliably informed that the Central Bank have now sanctioned £120 million over a certain period of time to fund the lump sum element in the redundancy package being put in place by the Government.  I want to know over what period this sum of money will be drawn down.  I want to know if this is being offered interest free. Does it have to be repaid by the Government and, if so, over what period?</P>
    <P>I understand that the redundancy package is destined to run for three years. Does that mean that £40 million a year will be drawn down and that that £40 million will have to be repaid each year for the succeeding three years?  If that is so, we are involved in trick-o' the-loop financing, off balance sheet financing, and we are drawing revenue from the future into the present which will have to be paid for by taxation starting in three years' time and running for the three consecutive years.  If that is the position I would like the Minister to state it.  It is totally inappropriate that this kind of off balance sheet financing should be involved in a current expense by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is also totally inappropriate that the Minister should make references to the mechanism which was put in place to rescue ICI by the previous Government. If the Central Bank should do anything with their profits they should fulfil their primary role.  One of their primary roles is certainly to act as a rescue agency for any bank as the need might arise.  If the money is now being taken into current spending by the Government does that mean there will be less reserves in the Central Bank to fulfil their role as a banker's bank with responsibility for rescuing banks which are in trouble?  It certainly does not inspire confidence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> With the Book of Estimates published and debated and with Private Notice Questions going through the House every week, which are contingent on this redundancy package, we do not know yet the total extent of the amount for which the Minister is in the process of raiding the Central Bank.  We do not know how he will show that in the Government accounts.  In the final analysis we do not know whether it will be paid for out of income tax in three, four or five years time.  It is most unsatisfactory and the only explanation we can come up with at present is that the Central Bank are a very unwilling partner in this arrangement. The Central Bank are being squeezed to put up money which the Government should provide out of their resources and the Central Bank are putting up a fairly strong resistance.  The Minister is not prepared to announce the mechanism because he is not yet sure of what the mechanism is.  The arrangement is not in place even though the constituent elements are all there.  The volume, the nature and the timing of the redundancies are available to the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I know there is also a discrepancy in answers to Written Questions which are coming from different Departments.  The Minister should monitor the questions which are coming from Departments concerning the cost of the pay agreement &mdash; the redundancy pay element &mdash; because we are ranging now from people getting information to people saying they have not got the information to give us.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say in five minutes.  If I do not get satisfactory answers I will be raising the matter again and again until we get the cards on the table and until we know where and how the money is arising.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to see why Deputy Noonan persists in trying to make political capital out of the Government's efforts to tackle the problems of the public finances and implying that there is something wrong with seeking the assistance of the Central Bank in the financing of the voluntary <Col N="938" /> redundancy package.  Of course, I should not be at a loss because I know what is really troubling Deputy Noonan is the success we are having in tackling those public finances which were left in such a state after his four and a half years in Government when we had nothing but trick-o'the-loop type financing which has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;totally forgotten about over the past nine months.  I am glad to say that the voluntary redundancy package represents a major effort to reduce the numbers employed in the public service and to make a lasting contribution to cutting public expenditure.  I have already explained to the House on a number of occasions&mdash;during my closing speech in the debate on the 1988 Estimates on 25 October and, more recently, in my reply to a number of parliamentary questions on 5 November and subsequently &mdash; the approach which the Government are taking.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that the cost of the lump sum redundancy payments was not taken into account in the recently published Estimates volume and that the cost of these payments would, of course, be influenced by the volume, nature and timing of the redundancies.  I also informed the House that the Government were discussing with the Central Bank arrangements for meeting these exceptional costs and that when the total cost had been determined and the financing arrangements had been finalised, I would present the full details to the House.  As far back as last July I made that position quite clear and that is the reason Deputy Noonan continues to raise the point.  When he suggests anything other than openness in this regard and talks about trick-o'the loop, it is nonsensical because it has been raised by me as far back as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is worked out and the details are known the Deputy will be told.  Given the exceptional nature of the costs involved, it was quite appropriate that the Government should make an approach to the Central Bank in the matter.  The bank for their part have adopted a constructive attitude, unlike what the Deputy is saying, consistent with their statutory functions and responsibilities and bearing in mind the resolute measures which the Government are taking to deal with the imbalances in the public finances.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that, contrary to what Deputy Noonan suggests, there is nothing unprecedented in this approach by the Government to the bank for assistance.  The bank provided funds to finance the Exchequer borrowing requirement on a number of occasions in the past when they considered that the circumstances warranted this.  These funds were provided by way of the purchase of Government securities by the bank.  The bank advanced £20 million in this way in 1965 which was repaid in 1969, £28 million in 1974, £50 million in 1975 and £100 million in 1979, in all a net total of £178 million.  Also since 1974 the bank provided normal overdraft facilities to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance also borrows from the Central Bank in the normal course to meet Ireland's subscription payment to the capital of the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. As at 19 August 1987 the total amount borrowed under these headings was £22 million.  Furthermore, as late as 1985 the bank make available to the Minister for Finance a loan of £100 million for a period of 15 years for on lending to the insurance compensation fund in connection with the funding of the administration of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  This loan involves no net payment for the Exchequer.  There is, therefore, ample precedent for the provision of assistance by the Central Bank to the Government in special circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions with the Central Bank are <Col N="940" /> continuing and I can assure the House again that when the cost and financing arrangements have been finalised I will report the details to the House.  Further to other questions raised by the Deputy I will give him the reply to a question put down on 10 November by Deputy John Boland:</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland asked the Minister for Finance the criteria employed, such as, age profile, length of service, grade in order to assess the additional ongoing pensions costs arising from redundancies which will be a consequence of the expenditure reduction measures referred to in page V of the Estimates for the Public Service 1988.</P>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry): The allocations for additional superannuation costs arising from the reduction in public service numbers next year were determined globally on the basis of expected trends for each of the major public service groupings taking into consideration that the reduction in numbers will be achieved to a significant extent by natural wastage, retirements, career breaks, as well as through acceptances for the Government's voluntary redundancy package. The redundancy package, the details of which I circulated in the House last week, is being offered (i) in those areas of the public sector where staff surplus to requirement has been identified and (ii) to all other personnel aged 50 or over in the Civil Service, health and non-commercial State bodies.</P>
    <P>All of the information that was available in relation to this question has been made known to this House by myself on numerous occasions.  Whether or not Deputy Noonan or others like it, because we are making great progress and because we are in control of the public finances generally and seeking the co-operation of all concerned, including the Deputy on occasions, we are having success.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will make a statement regarding unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit paid to an employee who is out of work for a period, due to dismissal which is found to be unfair where an employee is (a) paid compensation or (b) reinstated or re-engaged in his employment; the effect on his insurance record and credits; if the employee concerned refunds to the Department the amount of social welfare benefit received in those circumstances; and if it is the practice of his Department to facilitate the re-payment of unemployment insurance benefit in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative provisions governing unfair dismissals are set out in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  The regulations made under that Act, together with the administrative procedures for the manner of calculation of compensation, are a matter for the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the Department of Labour that the vast majority of awards made by rights commissioners or by the employment appeal tribunal are by way of compensation.  Where compensation is payable, the amount of any unemployment benefit received in the <Col N="724" /> interim by the employee is taken into account in calculating the amount payable. Where the award made by the rights commissioner or by the tribunal takes the form of reinstatement or re-engagement in the former employment, the employer in such cases is required to restore wages to the person concerned from the date of reinstatement or re-engagement.  It is understood that the employer may deduct any unemployment benefit paid from the arrears of wages due.  The arrears payable are subject to deduction of income tax and Pay-related Social Insurance contributions and the employee, therfore, is awarded a &ldquo;paid&rdquo; contribution for each week for which arrears of wages are paid.</P>
    <P>Persons who have been dismissed from their employments are entitled to unemployment benefit, if otherwise qualified, from the date of their claim unless it is decided by a deciding officer of the Department that they lost their employment through their own misconduct.  In this event they may be disqualified from receiving benefit for up to six weeks. Credited social insurance contributions are awarded in respect of each week of proved unemployment, whether or not the claimant is subject to a disqualification of the kind mentioned.</P>
    <P>Title to benefit properly payable in respect of a period of unemployment is not affected by subsequent events and there are no specific provisions in the social welfare legislation dealing with cases of unfair dismissals.  Accordingly the question of a refund of unemployment benefit in respect of a period for which compensation or reinstatement is subsequently granted on foot of an unfair dismissal award does not arise.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, in calculating the amount of compensation to be paid by them on foot of an unfair dismissals award, the terms of the unfair dismissals legislation apparently allow employers to deduct the amount of any unemployment benefit paid to the employee. This situation is anomalous in that an employer who has been found guilty of dismissing an employee unfairly can have his financial liability reduced where the <Col N="725" /> employee is entitled to unemployment benefit.  This matter is under consideration. Any change in the present arrangement would in the first instance be a matter for the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>The total number of medical referees personnel serving in my Department is 25 including the medical adviser and the deputy medical adviser.</P>
      <P>The medical referee system is the major arm of a range of controls exercised in the administration of disability benefit.  This year, up to October, there have been some 80,000 claimants called before medical referees of whom some 16,700 or 21 per cent have been found capable of work and thus no longer entitled to benefit.</P>
      <P>Computerised facilities have been introduced to allow a more scientific approach in selecting cases for examination and there is also a significant degree of checking with employers to detect concurrent working and claiming. In this connection, the special investigation unit of the Department's inspection branch are now working in close liaison with the disability benefits branch and it is expected that this type of activity will increase.</P>
      <P>As a result of the various control measures the number of disability benefit claims in payment has fallen from 80,448 at the beginning of November 1986 to 77,552 at the beginning of November 1987 and we are on target to achieve savings of some £2 million on the original disability benefit expenditure figures in 1987.</P>

      <P>This case was publicised on radio and in the newspapers in the course of the last week in September 1987.</P>
      <P>I take a very serious view of any instance in which a pension or allowance payment book is taken as security for any debt owed by a payee and I will not hesitate to prosecute any organisation or person for such an offence if the circumstances warrant it.  Following a statement by me to this effect on 26 September 1987, the headquarters of the bank concerned, Allied Irish Banks, stated that the action taken by the Clondalkin branch was in no way in conformity with AIB's policy in relation to lending money to any individual and that branches were periodically reminded that the holding of books against loans was not lawful.  The bank indicated that the event in Clondalkin was the result of an individual indiscretion in their Clondalkin branch. They also issued an unreserved apology to their customer, the social welfare claimant, for what took place.  I should say also that, apart from a telephone call a day or two before the radio programme in which the event was first made public, no complaint has been made to my Department.  The telephone caller did not identify the claimant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a wide range of payment systems and has a policy of developing more modern facilities using the most up-to-date computer systems.  At present, disability benefits are paid by cheque, unemployment payments are made mainly in cash while longer-term payments such as pensions and child benefit are paid mainly <i>via</i> books of vouchers cashable at nominated post offices.</P>
      <P>My Department is actively considering ways of reducing the amount of cash used at employment exchanges.  Cheques and electronic fund transfer (EFT) are being considered but these cannot of course be introduced without first installing computerised systems.  Unemployment payments are the last area of the Department to be computerised and the computerised systems now in use in the Dublin area, which will be extended nationwide over the next few years, give much greater flexibility in regard to the method of payment at the local offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of providing pensioners with the option of having their pensions paid directly into Post Office or bank accounts has been under active consideration for some time.  The results of surveys carried out by the Department <Col N="731" /> suggest, however, that only a small percentage of pensioners are interested in having their pensions paid directly into a post office or bank account.  Accordingly, for the foreseable future, the vast bulk of payments to pensioners will continue to be made by means of books of orders cashable at post offices.  As a first priority, therefore, it has been decided to concentrate the Department's computer resources on developing a computerised pension and allowance book-printing system.  This system is being introduced on a phased basis from July 1987 and will provide greatly improved security features for pension order and other books. It will also make the administrative system for handling these books much more cost-effective.</P>
    <P>In general EFT is seen as a medium to long term solution in view of the fact that many of the persons receiving social welfare payments do not have active bank accounts.  There are ongoing discussions with the banks and with An Post in this area.</P>
    <P>The issue of pension books and cheques using computer systems is a very efficient and cost-effective operation and the benefits of utilising the most up-to-date technology is already being realised in the disability benefit, child benefit and pension areas.  However, in the Employment Exchanges, where the handling of large amounts of cash every week is labour intensive, it can be expected that the introduction of new payment systems will enable staff to be diverted to do other necessary work, for example, in the area of controls.  The replacement of cash by other payment methods would also open up the possibility of having a more flexible policy in relation to the frequency of signing-on at local offices.  Less frequent attendance at local offices would result in a more dignified service for the clients with the elimination of long queues and it would enable my Department to operate a more selective and intensive range of anti-abuse measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The State contributes to the Social Insurance Fund the amount by which the income of the fund from employer and employee contributions falls short of expenditure from the fund each year.  The full extent of the State's contribution for 1988 will not be known until after the budget.  The published Estimates do not include the cost of budget increases for 1988.</P>
      <P>The figure in the Estimates for the State subvention to the Social Insurance Fund for 1988 is £388,843,000.  This represents a decrease of £20,877,000 over the corresponding figure of £409,720,000 in the 1987 published Estimates.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors which in any year give rise to such variations, the most important of which in the current year are as follows.  There will be one pay day less in 1988 as compared with the exceptional situation which arose in 1987 when there are 53 pay days.</P>
      <P>On the income side allowance has been made for an increase in PRSI contribution income in 1988 over the 1987 published figure due largely to projected increases in earnings and the higher earnings ceiling for contributions.  These additional receipts would of themselves result in a significant decrease in the level of State subvention to the fund.  Furthermore, the fund will benefit from the full year effect of savings arising from measures taken in the context of the last budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional income will be partly offset by increased net expenditure arising from the carry-over effects of the 1987 budgetary increases in rates of payments. However, the fund will benefit from the full year effect of savings arising from measures taken in the last budget and <Col N="733" /> allowance has also been made for the savings arising from further measures recently announced by the Government which will come into effect in 1988.  The continued operation of the Jobsearch programme and the application of improved control procedures will also yield savings.  The remaining factor on the expenditure side is the effect of trends in the numbers applying for benefit.</P>
    <P>As stated already, the Estimates make no provision for increases in social welfare payments during 1988 and any increases in rates arising from the budget will increase the overall expenditure of the fund and the level of the State contribution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason there is no personal allowance deducted from income, before calculation of social insurance contributions as in the case with income tax; his views on whether social insurance in Ireland is a genuine actuarially-sound insurance scheme relating risk to premium; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social insurance contributions for employers and employees are based on gross earnings less superannuation contributions.  This has been the situation since earnings-related contributions were first introduced in 1974.  The deduction of personal tax allowances from these earnings would significantly reduce the PRSI income base and it would be necessary to substantially increase the rates of contribution in order to maintain the same level of contribution income.</P>
      <P>The social insurance system is not an actuarially based insurance scheme as is the case with most private insurance arrangements in that the premium is not based on the risk but instead involves a pooling of risks between those covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If social insurance were to be similar to private insurance arrangements the contributions payable by those less able to pay would in most cases be significantly <Col N="734" /> higher than those payable by the better off.  Alternatively the benefits which the former would qualify to receive would be much lower.  Either alternative would be unacceptable.  Social insurance contributions in Ireland are based on ability to pay while the level and range of benefits provided are related to need.  As such, the system is designed to effect a redistribution of income from those employed who are fortunate enough to be able to earn an income to those who are unable to earn such an income because they are sick, unemployed, widowed or retired.  I consider the present system to be a reasonable and equitable one in our circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will allow community welfare officers to issue temporary qualification certificates for unemployment assistance in an effort to speed up the whole process of means testing and thus reduce the delays that claimants are experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of unemployment assistance payable is dependent on the means of the claimant and individual investigation of means must be made in each case.  The means in each case are determined by a statutorily appointed deciding officer.  The time taken to carry out a means investigation and reach a decision in any particular case depends to a large extent on the individual circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>In cases where significant delays occur, this is usually because it is necessary in those cases to obtain documentary evidence of items which are assessed as means, for example a bank statement, or it is necessary for the social welfare officer to visit the claimant's home to accurately investigate his means.  In cases where there are &ldquo;nil&rdquo; means involved the claims are generally processed within two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are making every effort to reduce delays in putting unemployment <Col N="735" /> assistance claims into payment. In this context a number of very important changes have been made which have helped to reduce delays.</P>
    <P>First, the policy of awarding qualification certificates at head office entailed an element of delay and in order to eliminate this it was decided to devolve the task of awarding qualification certificates to deciding officers at employment exchanges.  This process involved training of officers at local office level and rapid progress has been made.  In fact the majority of exchanges are now making all decisions on means assessment and by the end of this year I envisage all exchanges to be making such decisions.</P>
    <P>A further measure, which we call Interim UA, has also been introduced to provide a better and quicker service to the claimant.  This scheme applies to single persons living with their parents whose sole source of income is from social welfare payments or health board payments, and also to married persons coming off unemployment benefit where their spouses are not working.  In eligible cases a qualification certificate is awarded immediately and only a random sample of cases is sent to the social welfare officer for investigation.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a most important development which has occurred recently as part of the concept of the one stop shop.  This is a measure under which social welfare officers, where possible, attend at the local office two or three times weekly to interview new unemployment assistance claimants and thereby avoid to the greatest extent possible the need for visits to the claimants' homes.  In many cases this enables payment to be made in these cases in the week following the claim.  This arrangement, which is now in operation at many of the local offices throughout the country, significantly reduces the role of supplementary welfare allowance as an interim payment and saves the claimant from undergoing two separate means tests.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures outlined, when fully implemented at all <Col N="736" /> offices, will result in a considerable reduction in the amount of time taken to award qualification certificates and to put unemployment assistance into payment. Therefore, I do not consider it appropriate at this stage to extend to community welfare officers the power to award qualification certificates. However, I can assure the Deputy that I am closely monitoring the arrangements for the investigation of means and will make any further amendments considered necessary to ensure that delays are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the National Jobsearch Programme provided that by the end of the year 150,000 of those on the live register would be interviewed by the National Manpower Service, that 40,000 Manpower scheme opportunities would be made available as a priority to the long term unemployed together with 12,000 Jobsearch course placements.  The purpose of this national programme is to help the unemployed, especially the long term unemployed, in their search for work and training.  An <Col N="737" /> effect of the operation of this programme is, that it can bring to attention people who are not available for or genuinely seeking work.  Thus, a number of those who should not be on the live register either leave the register voluntarily or are disallowed as a result of information which comes to light during the interviews.</P>
      <P>The figures available to week-ending 6 November 1987 show that up to that date 9,270 left the register when offered an opportunity to participate in a scheme or programme or to accept an offer of a job. In addition 1,440 of those who have not availed of an invitation to participate in the programme have had their cases reviewed resulting in disallowances under the Social Welfare Acts.  Of those who have appealed up to that date 555 have had their cases decided with 158 appeals being allowed and 397 being disallowed. The figure of 7,200 stated by the Deputy for those who left the live register voluntarily arising from the programme presumably relates to an earlier period.</P>
      <P>As the concentration in the programme is on the long term unemployed it is reasonable to assume that, in the main, the figures for disallowances and for those who have left the live register voluntarily, which are derived from employment exchange records, represent persons who had not been affected by other methods of detection.  For this reason, I am generally satisfied that both these figures are independent of other outflows from the live register and should be credited to the National Jobsearch Programme.  Thus, I am not convinced of the need for an adjustment of the type mentioned by the Deputy.  Even if such an adjustment were necessary, it would be difficult to achieve with a satisfactory degree of precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The savings in my Department's Vote arising from the programme are basically derived from those who are disallowed and who leave the live register voluntarily. Also, it is reasonable to assume that, with the priority which the programme accords to those on the live register, it results in a greater number of persons on the register securing employment <Col N="738" /> and manpower scheme opportunities. To the extent that this is so there is a further saving in my Department's Vote as, apart from those who obtain employment, those availing of these opportunities are not on the live register during their participation in a scheme or training course.  Those on Jobsearch courses remain on the live register during their course.  The final point raised by the Deputy in relation to the European Social Fund is not appropriate to me.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 32, 35, 114, 119 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>A Christmas bonus will be paid to long term social welfare recipients this year. The categories of recipients which will be included in the measures are persons in receipt of old-age pensions (contributory and non-contributory), retirement pension, blind pensions, widow's and orphan's pensions (contributory and non-contributory), invalidity pension, long term unemployment assistance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, social assistance allowances for unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women, and occupational injuries benefits by way of pensions from the Department of Social Welfare.  Persons in receipt of long term health payments, namely, disabled persons maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domicilliary care allowance for handicapped children will also be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bonus, which will be paid during the first week of December, will be at the same rate as last year; that is, 65 per cent of the recipient's weekly payment.  The <Col N="740" /> measures will benefit over 571,000 recipients, with an estimated 350,000 dependants, giving a total of over 921,000 beneficiaries.  The total cost of the bonus is £19.8 million, as compared with £18 million last year.  Examples of the effects of the bonus are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  an elderly couple in receipt of an old age contributory pension will receive a bonus of £58.60, bringing their total payment in the first week in December to £148.80;</P>
    <P>(b)  a couple with three children on long term unemployment assistance will receive a bonus of £59.90, bringing their total payment to £152;</P>

    <P>(d)  an invalidity pensioner with a dependant spouse and three children will receive a bonus of £73.10 bringing their total payment to £185.50.</P>
    <P>The decision to pay the bonus, despite the difficult financial position, is in keeping with the Government's commitment to protect those dependent on social welfare payments.  It is in recognition of the extra financial commitments which people have to face coming up to Christmas.</P>

      <P>I am examining all aspects of the administration of social welfare services to identify ways in which the service given to the Department's clients can be improved.  In particular I am examining ways in which all of the Department's services can be localised at the point of delivery.  I see the implementation of a local service as the key towards a better and more effective system and one which at the same time will facilitate improved controls on the system generally.  The further development of computerisation throughout the Department's system of local offices will facilitate the achievement of the goal of a more integrated system at local level giving people quicker access to a comprehensive range of services.</P>

      <P>The 1988 figure is based on forecasts made by the Department of Finance in relation to the level of employment and the size of the labour force and involves assumptions about key economic variables such as the level of emigration and participation rates.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 42 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare schemes available to cater for the needs of women in single parent family situations are widow's contributory pension, deserted wife's benefit, widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance, unmarried mother's allowance and prisoners wife's allowance.  Widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit are insurance based schemes and a woman may qualify for them on either her own or her husband's insurance record.  The other schemes are assistance based and are subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The provision of specific payments for men who are single parents on the same lines as the existing schemes for women would have very significant financial and social implications.  This matter is, however, being reviewed in the context of the examination of the whole area of financial support for single parent families generally in the light of the recommendations made by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the proposals, if any, he has to amend the inherent inequity governing the averaging of social welfare contributions for the determination of entitlement to the old age contributory pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to old age contributory pension requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions from 1953 or from the year of entry into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts, whichever is the later, up to the end of the last contribution year before reaching 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension is paid to pensioners out of the social insurance fund to which insured persons and their employers contribute through the PRSI system.  The social welfare insurance schemes are operated on a pay-as-you-go basis and it is considered a reasonable requirement that a person should have a minimum average number of contributions over his working life in order to qualify for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases people may not enter insurance until later in life and, because their average is calculated from their date of entry, they may qualify for pension on the basis of a relatively short number of years of contributions.  On the other hand some persons who entered insurance earlier but who have gaps in their record which are not filled by voluntary contributions may fail to qualify for pension because of the averaging condition.  In some cases such gaps may have arisen <Col N="748" /> because of the operation of the remuneration limit for social insurance which operated up to 1974.  The provision of special arrangements for people in this situation would have significant financial implications.</P>
    <P>The general question of the averaging of contributions for pension purposes is being addressed by the National Pensions Board which will be reporting to me on the question of a national pension plan in due course.  Any proposals which the board may make for changes in the present contribution conditions will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the guidelines under which social welfare officers make their assessments on applicants for social welfare; if all expenses are taken into account in the cases of small farmers and business people; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare officers investigate the means and circumstances of applicants for a range of social welfare schemes such as unemployment assistance, family income supplement, rent allowance and the various non-contributory pension schemes and social assistance allowances.</P>
      <P>The rules governing the calculation of means are contained in the Social Welfare Acts and in regulations made under those Acts.  In general, these rules provide that in assessing means the main items taken into account are cash income, the value of property personally used, such as a farm but not the applicant's own home, the value of property not personally used, such as a second house, and the value of investments and capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed, such as board and lodgings, is also assessable in the case of applicants for unemployment assistance or single women's allowance.  Circular instructions and guidelines on the application and <Col N="749" /> interpretation of the law, as they relate to means assessment, are issued to social welfare officers from time to time as the need arises.</P>
    <P>As regards the assessment of means of the self-employed, for instance small farmers, the position is that means are assessed under the legislation as the yearly value of the advantage accruing from their farm or businesses.  The calculation is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the net income from the farm or business.  In assessing that income all expenses actually and necessarily incurred are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The means test is designed to ensure that all applicants for payments under schemes involving a means test are treated in an equitable manner having regard to the resources available to them. I am satisfied that the present system of means assessment, as applied to all applicants, including small farmers and business people, ensures that payments are made only to those who are in genuine need and is directly related to the financial circumstances in each particular case.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed, it is open to him or her to appeal and have the case determined by an appeals officer.  A person can, in addition, ask at any time to have the means assessment reviewed to take account of any change of circumstances which may have occurred in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The value in Irish terms of US pensions fluctuates in accordance with changes in <Col N="750" /> the rates of exchange as between the dollar and the punt.  The value of the dollar increased each year from 1980 to 1985 but since then has decreased sharply. This reduced the value of US pensions in Irish terms and eroded the benefits previously gained by recipients of US pensions living in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are no statistics available as to the number of pensioners affected by the change in currency values and there are no arrangements where by those concerned can be compensated.  However, persons over 66 in this situation could, depending on their means, qualify for a non-contributory old age pension which would take account of the value of their US pension in Irish terms.</P>

      <P>There is one professional accountant employed by my Department with the rank of Professional Accountant Grade 1.  In addition many of the staff employed in the clerical, executive and administrative grades have received training and have qualifications in this and in other relevant areas.  I am satisfied with the standards of experience, training and qualifications of the staff of my Department in the area of financial control.</P>
      <P>There are systems of internal control, including financial control, in all areas of the Department.  Furthermore, there is a Section within the Department&mdash;with a staff complement of 13 &mdash; with specific responsibility for internal control, including financial control, in relation to the administration of the unemployment benefit and assistance schemes at local exchanges and offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has an internal audit unit whose task is to review on a continuing basis administration of the <Col N="751" /> Department's payment systems.  The unit has been directing a comprehensive programme of audit of the Department's systems, both in headquarter's areas and in employment exchanges.  Where weaknesses in financial controls have been identified in these audits they are being given attention by management.  The unit has been strengthened during the past year &mdash; 11 staff including a Principal and two assistant Principals are now employed on this work &mdash; with the result that the range and quality of auditing activity is being continually advanced.</P>
    <P>The administration of the social security system involving the pay-out of approximately £2.6 billion to almost 750,000 weekly recipients is a huge operation with staff under continuous pressure to maintain the service.  Of its nature it imposes the need for continual examination to enable the most modern methods to be applied in improving delivery of services to clients and in ensuring that scope for abuse of the service is eliminated.  These changes bring with them the need for the development of new and different types of financial control. I am satisfied that structures exist within my Department which ensure both adequate application and monitoring of financial controls and that where the need for change arises effective remedial action is taken.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to certain persons who move to employment in the public sector which is not insurable at the full rate and, as a result, do not qualify for a contributory <Col N="752" /> pension under the social insurance system.  At the same time they may have insufficient service in that employment to qualify for a full occupational pension.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare examined this matter and recommended that special arrangements be made for people in this situation.  I am reviewing this recommendation in the context of my ongoing examination and formulation of social welfare policy.</P>
      <P>There are a number of particular situations where people have insufficient contributions to qualify for old age contributory pension arising from the fact that certain employments were not covered by full compulsory social insurance.  The provision of special arrangements for people in these situations would, however, have significant financial implications and will depend on the availability of the necessary financial resources.</P>

      <P>Most recently on 9 November 1987 at the UN General Assembly, Ireland was associated with the Twelve in urging the Soviet Union to agree to a rapid and complete withdrawal of their troops according to an irrevocable timetable, which is an essential precondition if this conflict is to end.  The Twelve strongly condemned the attacks on the civilian population which are irreconcilable with the norms of international behaviour and violate fundamental human rights.  They reaffirmed their continued suport for the efforts of the UN Secretary General and his personal representative Mr. Diego Cordovez and expressed the hope that their untiring endeavours will result in early agreement on outstanding issues. The Twelve hope that the Soviet Union and Kabul will reassess their positions and work for genuine reconciliation in Afghanistan, including arrangements leading to an act of self-determination enabling the Afghan people to decide their own future.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit up to 29 April 1987, when she had drawn her maximum entitlement of 390 days benefit. To requalify for unemployment benefit she requires at least a further 13 weeks contributions paid at the appropriate class providing cover against unemployment.  Weeks of employment since the date on which she received 156 days of unemployment benefit may count for this purpose.</P>

    <P>The person concerned applied for invalidity pension on 9 October 1986.

    <P>The person concerned appealed this decision and was examined on 14 May 1987 by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was not permanently incapable of work.

      <P>The Declined Cases Agreement is an agreement between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce for dealing with cases of inability to obtain third party motor insurance.  The Declined Cases Committee, established under the agreement, examine cases referred to them by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominate a company to quote for the risk involved. Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary for my Department to have copies of written refusals from five insurance companies together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.  These details are important because the insurer first approached or the insurer with whom motor cover existed within the previous three years is normally obliged to quote for the risk.</P>
      <P>The individual concerned in this case was asked in January 1987 to submit five written refusals.  The fifth refusal was received in July 1987 and was then submitted to the Declined Cases Committee. A particular company were nominated to provide a quote but they pointed out that, according to the information provided by the proposer, he already had motor insurance with another motor insurer. The proposer to date has been unable to clarify what motor insurance he holds or has held in Ireland and with what insurer. Until this matter has been resolved no quote can be obtained by the Declined Cases Committee.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>An International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea was held, on the invitation of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, in Bremen on 31 October and 1 November 1984.  The North Sea coastal states were invited to attend the Conference at Ministerial level, together with the Member of the European Commission responsible for environmental protection.  For this purpose, coastal states were taken to be Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  Other member states of the European Communities and other contracting parties to the Oslo and Paris Conventions were invited to attend as observers.  Ireland accepted the invitation to attend as an observer and was represented by an officer of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coastal states represented at the Bremen Conference adopted a declaration relating to the protective measures required for the North Sea.  They agreed to hold a second International Conference in the United Kingdom to review the implementation and effectiveness of the decisions taken in Bremen and to consider the further measures necessary for the maintenance of the <Col N="787" /> quality of the North Sea.  It is this Conference which is to be held in London on 24 and 25 November 1987.</P>
    <P>I understand that arrangements for the London Conference will be generally similar to those which applied at Bremen with the same coastal states having the status of full participants, and other countries, including Ireland, being entitled to attend as observers.  I have declined an invitation from the UK Secretary of State to attend the Conference myself but I am arranging for senior officials of the Departments primarily concerned to attend.</P>
    <P>Since 1984, the countries bordering the North Sea have been involved in extensive scientific studies and preparatory work for the London Conference.  Like other countries with no North Sea coastline, Ireland has not been invited to participate in these projects.  In the circumstances, the question of Irish input to the Conference has not arisen.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Irish interests do not require our participation as full members at the North Sea Conference or an extension of the scope of the Conference to all North West European Waters.  International conventions on marine pollution such as the Oslo, London and Paris Conventions and other international agencies in which Ireland fully participates (including the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas and the International Maritime Organisation), together with our participation in the European Communities' Environment Action Programme, provide appropriate opportunities for international co-operation and action to protect the Irish marine environment.</P>
    <P>The North Sea Conference was created to deal with problems which are peculiar to the North Sea and is similar, in this respect, to other international conferences/conventions which deal with regional problems in areas such as the Baltic and the Meditterranean.  The extension of the scope of such conferences would tend to create further overlapping responsibilities among international organisations and deprive States <Col N="788" /> directly concerned of the specialised fora in which they can deal with problems which relate to particular regions.  Any additional arrangements which may be required in relation to waters that particularly concern this country would best be pursued through co-operation with the UK authorities.  Already, Irish and UK officials are co-operating, under the aegis of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, in preparing a regional assessment of the Irish Sea which I understand will be published early next year.  I will consider what further measures may be appropriate in relation to the Irish Sea, including the need for an Irish Sea Conference, in the light of this assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the monitoring of water quality which is carried out (a) in the Dublin area, (b) elsewhere in the country; when and where the results are published; if there has been a change in the practice of publishing raw data; and if he will make a statement on present water quality standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn):</NameTxt>
      <P>Water quality monitoring is carried out on an extensive scale by local authorities in the Dublin area and in the rest of the country as a normal part of their statutory water pollution control functions and publication of results is a matter for local authorities.  In addition An Foras Forbartha has an ongoing programme of biological water quality monitoring and publishes overall reviews of national water quality, including data obtained from local authorities' monitoring programmes.  The most recent review, published in July of this year, contains and analyses data for the years 1982-1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only change of significance in the practice of publishing raw data of which I am aware has been the inclusion by An Foras Forbartha for the first time of physico-chemical data supplied by local authorities in the most recent review of national water quality.  This allows for a <Col N="798" /> more comprehensive assessment of water quality.</P>
    <P>Among the many encouraging findings in the review is the fact that of the rivers surveyed in 1971 and found to be seriously polluted, the percentage now seriously polluted is less than half what it was at that time.  Encouraging too is the generally unpolluted state of the lakes in the country as well as the high quality of estuarine and coastal waters.  There has been a decline, however, in the percentage of river channel length found to be in the unpolluted category (74 per cent for the period 1982-1986 compared with 84 per cent for the period 1979-1981) and a corresponding increase (from 14 per cent to 24 per cent) in the length of channel subject to slight or moderate pollution. In spite of this the percentage of river channel length found to be unpolluted is among the highest in Europe. Each local authority has recently been asked to consider the An Foras Forbartha report in the context of its own area and, within a standardised report and questionnaire format devised by my Department, to assess and comment on the findings and to outline the steps it intends to take in relation to polluted waters.</P>
    <P>The large numbers of pollution incidents this summer have been noted with the gravest concern and the Government have approved a comprehensive package of measures to tackle the problem.  This package, which includes the strengthening of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, the carrying out of surveys of farms by local authority, fishery board and farm advisory personnel and increased attention to educational and awareness aspects, is expected to result in a significant improvement in the nation's water quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree fully with the Deputy about the contribution the rights commissioner concerned has made to industrial relations in this country.  In the light of this contribution, it was with sincere regret that I accepted his resignation.</P>
      <P>The rights commissioner service operates under section 13 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.  In general, the idea is to have a fast and flexible services for disputes involving one or two workers on rights issues, that is issues other than pay and conditions of employment.  Such disputes need not, therefore, go to the Labour Court, so that the court is relieved of these less onerous cases and as a consequence can concentrate on cases of wider importance.  In general, the service has worked well, which in itself is a tribute to the people who have been appointed over the years.</P>
      <P>Before the resignation in question, there were five rights commissioners, four located in Departmental accommodation at 4 Burlington Road, with secretarial facilities provided by the Department.</P>
      <P>The rights commissioner in question has been located for historical reasons in premises owned by the Irish Sugar Company and the cost to the Department is in excess of £50,000 annually for office and secretarial facilities.  The average annual cost in the years 1982 to 1986 was £53,000 and in one year exceeded £60,000.  In addition, this rights commissioner was paid fees, together with travelling expenses and subsistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of budgetary constraints, a review was instituted in the last year of the cost and efficiency of all of the Department's services.  This review has led to the curtailment of many of the Department's services as set out in the Estimates for 1988, including some of those in respect of schemes and training for the unemployed.  Deputies will also be aware of the tough decisions that have had to be taken by the Government in relation to the Estimates of other Departments. It is in this light that the transfer of the rights commissioner concerned to 4 Burlington Road where the other four <Col N="805" /> rights commissioners are located at a saving of some £40,000 per annum to the Department must be considered.  The commissioner was informed of the proposal to move his offices last March.  In fact, an office was completely refurbished for his use and existing secretarial services in respect of rights commissioners expanded in anticipation of his moving.</P>
    <P>The rights commissioner wrote to me informing me that he was unable to continue as rights commissioner after 31 October 1987, stating that he could not accept the alternative arrangements that had been offered.  I replied to him on 30 October accepting his resignation with sincere regret.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the only change which was being proposed in respect of the rights commissioner's relationship with the Department was one of office location and this was being effected solely in the interest of curtailing expenditure at a time when every area of State expenditure must be examined with a view to achieving savings.  The reality is that a substantial saving (£40,000 per annum) would have been achieved here without any hardship.  As Deputies will realise, this is in sharp contrast to other measures which the Government have had to take in other areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the way in which the figure for salaries, wages and allowances in his Department set out in the 1988 Estimates has increased by 12 per cent over the 1987 figure and in particular (a) the number of additional staff from whom the Estimate is made; (b) the duties which those persons will carry out; (c) the number of staff which will be required to carry out the functions heretofore carried out by the Health Education Bureau and the total amount of salaries, wages and allowances to be paid to such persons; (d) the number of anticipated redundancies among departmental staff in the year 1988; and (e) the total increase in staff anticipated in the Department for 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for salaries, wages and allowances for my Department set out in the 1988 Estimates was based on both the actual number serving and the anticipated transfer of some additional staff into my Department.  The additional sum was determined in such a way as to enable certain additional functions to be undertaken by my Department.  The present staffing of the Department is subject to the general embargo on filling of posts in the public service and has reduced by 14 per cent since 21 July 1981.  Any increase in staffing will be confined to the transfer of additional functions to the Department. The transfer of such functions has yet to be finalised and it is not therefore possible to state the likely increase in numbers involved.  In addition to carrying out the duties currently undertaken by the Health Education Bureau, the new health promotion unit within my Department will also undertake work relating to the broader concept of health promotion. As the structure of the unit is still under discussion it is not possible at this stage to give the details relating to numbers <Col N="815" /> and costs in 1988 which the Deputy has requested.</P>
      <P>With reference to possible redundancies which may occur in 1988, as a result of the recent extension of the early retirement scheme to officers aged 50 years and over, information is being sought from those eligible in order to establish the level of interest in the scheme amongst serving officers.  Prior to this announcement the terms of the redundancy/early retirement package did not apply to officers in my Department.</P>
      <P>Having regard to all of the factors which I have outlined, it is not possible at this point to state the likely staffing level in the Department in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Clause 2 (c) of the higher education grants scheme sets out the means provisions under which a candidate's eligibility for a grant is determined. In calculating the reckonable income which may be taken into account, positive income from one source may not be reduced by losses or running expenses from another source.  While this limitation is not explicitly stated in the published provisions of the higher education grants scheme, it is in conformity with clause 2 (c) (iii) of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining reckonable income, statements from the inspector of taxes are not explicitly excluded.  In fact, in the case of persons assessed for income tax under the PAYE system, the evidence of income required is normally a P60 or P21 <Col N="824" /> which is issued by the Revenue Commissioners. In the case of self-employed persons, the evidence of income normally required is a notice of assessment or a statement of amended liability which is issued by the Revenue Commissioners. However, in accordance with the provisions of the higher education grants scheme, in making a declaration of reckonable income, the applicant or the applicant's parents or guardians are required to submit to the local authority such information and make such declaration as may be required by it to determine the amount of the reckonable income and the number of dependent children.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, where there is reasonable doubt as to the financial standing of the applicant's parents or guardians, a local authority may, at its discretion, seek such supporting documentation as may be required to confirm the correctness of financial information supplied by the applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The award of pensions and other superannuation benefits in respect of national teachers is governed by statutory superannuation schemes made under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928.  Various amending schemes have been made over the years and a number of approved changes are currently being implemented administratively pending their incorporation into further amending scheme for approval by the Oireachtas. These superannuation provisions are of general application and departure from their terms in individual cases is not permissible. Teaching service in Northern Ireland is not pensionable service for the purposes of the national school teachers' superannuation schemes and there are no proposals for changing this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> There are no reciprocal arrangements at present for transferring service between this country and the UK for superannuation purposes.  Any such arrangements proposed would have to be considered in the context of the public service generally.</P>
    <P>The national school teachers' superannuation schemes are contributory schemes and teachers pay contributions of 5 per cent of their annual remuneration in respect of membership of the basic scheme and an additional 1.5 per cent in respect of membership of the spouses' and children's pension scheme.  Arrangements exist under which teachers may, in certain circumstances, purchase added years of notional service which can be aggregated with their pensionable service for the purpose of calculating superannuation benefits and additional information on these arrangements is available from my Department.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of recognition being accorded to the teaching qualifications of Irish-trained primary teachers in any of the countries mentioned, except in the special European Schools of the European Community where exceptional arrangements apply.  However, the EC is at present considering a draft directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, with the possible inclusion of teacher qualifications, which may lead in time to greater recognition for Irish primary teacher qualification in other member states.  In the case of Great Britain, there are on&mdash;going discussions between my Department and the Department of Education and Science in London regarding the recognition of our qualifications for employment there.  The position with regard to the recognition in this country of primary teachers trained outside the State is that applications are assessed on an individual basis.  Recognition may be granted to persons who have completed satisfactorily a recognised primary teacher training course acceptable to my Department and who have passed An Scrúdú le haghaidh Cáilíocht sa Ghaeilge, both written and oral.</P>
