      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £24,207,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose that the Vote for Foreign Affairs and the Vote for International Co-operation be debated together, as is customary.</P>
      <P>This debate on the Estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs affords an opportunity to the Dáil to review our nation's foreign policy which is timely in two senses: in the first place it enables the Government to set out our views at an early stage in our term of office and to have, from the beginning, the benefit of the views of the Dáil on this crucial area of policy.  Secondly, we have recently seen issues of foreign policy move to a central place on the Irish political agenda, notably in relation to the Single European Act.  It has been brought home to us, as perhaps never before, that foreign policy issues cannot be regarded as remote abstractions.  They can impinge, sometimes in very major and unexpected ways, on our most fundamental political and economic concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a widespread consensus in Ireland, transcending most political divisions in our society, on the general principles we should try to assert in the conduct of our foreign policy.  These look to a world at peace, and a world justly ordered, governed by law rather than force.  They reflect a preference for responsive democratic systems, such as we enjoy in our own country, over those which resort to despotism or coercion. They set a high value on personal and religious freedoms, in contrast to those <Col N="5" /> who regard such freedoms as secondary to other values.  They are coloured by our own experience as a people, striving for a recognised and worthy place for our country among the nations of the earth and sensitive to the plight of victims and the vulnerability of small nations the world over.</P>
    <P>In addition to a firm commitment to issues of principle, we require also an accurate sense of our environment and of Ireland's proper role in the areas where we are engaged.  The debate on the Single European Act, which is still fresh in our memories, showed how difficult it can be to maintain a perspective on all of these dimensions.  Because we cannot always change the world to the extent we would wish we sometimes leap to the conclusion that we cannot influence it at all.  Taken to its extreme &mdash; and the extreme was occasionally evident during the referendum campaign &mdash; this leads to outright isolationism.  This mentality emphasises concepts such as sovereignty and independence, which are important to us all, but it views them more as limitations than as assets in our dealings with the world.  It assumes we are too weak to assert our principles in association with friendly states and, at the same time, strong enough to make them prevail in the much more difficult circumstances of isolation.  These attitudes, as the referendum results showed, are very much minority sentiments and they are ones which I believe greatly underrate the resourcefulness of our people.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of a degree of consensus on many of the underlying principles of our policy.  I believe this consensus reaches into many areas of practical policy also.  Once outside the domestic environment, all Irish people perceive how much the things which bind us together outweigh the things which divide us.  We know that the more our basic principles and interests are maintained as consistent national objectives the more likely we are to see them prevail.  We know that the more domestic differences are carried into the external arena the greater the possibility of damage to our <Col N="6" /> interests as a whole.  Successive Governments become the custodians of Ireland's international reputation and, in the general interest, they will seek to safeguard the foreign policy gains made by others as well as those achieved by themselves. There are points of agreement and shared objectives which transcend party political divisions and are a source of strength to us collectively.  In the conduct of our foreign policy we will give due value to these areas of consensus.  We hope Opposition Deputies will reach in the same spirit and give the same emphasis to national over party political considerations in dealing with this special domain of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to individual aspects which are of particular concern to us.  It will not surprise the Dáil that I should deal first with Northern Ireland. Some of the features of this very difficult problem have been with us for a long time, including sadly, an unremitting campaign of violence which continues to take a heavy toll.  Each passing year adds its own witness to the futility of the campaign of violence.  Its appalling effects are clear to all except to those who have the power to stop it but choose instead to kill and destroy, wilfully visiting untold suffering on their fellow-citizens and adding immeasurably to the barriers of mutual hatred and suspicion which must be overcome in the search for peace and agreement</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been growing acceptance that a framework for a solution involving all the parties had to be created.  The December 1980 summit in Dublin Castle between the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the British Prime Minister was a decisive step.  In our two months in office the Government have continued to be active in promoting the Anglo-Irish process.  I myself have had meetings with the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. King.  I co-chaired the meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference with Mr. King in Belfast on 22 April.</P>
    <P>In our relations with the British Government on Northern Ireland, we are <Col N="7" /> using the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference fully so as to improve the position of all the people living in Northern Ireland and especially the Nationalist community.  The Conference and the Joint Secretariat in Belfast provide a mutually accepted institutional framework for dealing with Northern matters and matters relating to North-South co-operation. We have commited ourselves to use this framework to make progress and we look forward to meeting an equal spirit of commitment on the other side of the table.</P>
    <P>The Government's immediate priorities in the Intergovernmental Conference include in particular: progress in the area of fair employment; substantial reforms in the administration of justice; improved North-South economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with each of these headings.</P>
    <P>First, it is regrettable that after 15 years of direct rule the unemployment rate among the Catholic population is more than twice the rate among Protestants. The Fair Employment Act, introduced in 1976, has not succeeded in redressing this imbalance.  At the meeting of the Conference on 22 April both sides agreed to the need for progress in legislation and practice in this area.  The Government will continue to stress the need for effective legislation and for effective action on the ground.  We want to see the introduction of sanctions applied to those employers and bodies who fail to meet their responsibilities to ensure equitable patterns of employment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the courts and the law in the North should be such as to merit the full confidence of both sections of the community.  Our Government are committed to seek substantial reform both in the court system and in the emergency legislation in the North.  Parallel with the administration of justice through the courts and the law is the relationship between the security forces and the Nationalist community.  We want to see <Col N="8" /> introduced a programme of special measures to improve that relationship, including the introduction of a code of conduct for the police.  We want to see action as quickly as possible on the Stalker/ Sampson report.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Government will pay special attention to encouraging North-South economic co-operation, in particular in areas likely to increase employment possibilities in both parts of Ireland. The International Fund has established a range of programmes that will, I believe, bring substantial economic and social benefits on both sides of the Border.  I want to express our appreciation here to those Governments who have so far contributed to the fund &mdash; the United States, Canada and New Zealand.  These have given practical expression to their goodwill and the desire to see the political process in this island succeed.</P>
    <P>Above and beyond this necessary programme of reform lies the vital task of maintaining the political process.  We will continue to seek to build conditions for peace, stability and justice so as to overcome the causes that produce violence on this island.  We will work closely with the Nationalist community and we will be attentive to all constructive views which may be expressed to us by members of the Unionist community.  To all who desire a solution through constitutional democratic means, we hold out the hand of friendship.</P>
    <P>I turn next to the question of our relations with the European Community, which the recent debate on the Single European Act has brought into sharp public focus.  The Government put the question of the Single European Act to the people in the clearest and most straightforward terms, and the people have pronounced upon it.  In saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; decisively to the Single European Act, the Irish people have reaffirmed their commitment to the European Community and to Ireland's positive role in its future development.  In this context, I wish to say that the policy of neutrality in particular reflects a long standing and widespread consensus among Irish people that our interests are best served <Col N="9" /> by remaining outside military alliances. Our neutrality, that is to say our choice not to join any military alliance, is respected by our European partners. Ireland's presence in the Community is in itself an important political and procedural guarantee that the Community can never be seen as a mere subgroup of a military alliance.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act however is not some kind of blank cheque in the foreign policy area.  It is rather a codification of what we have engaged in for many years now.  Such co-operation has already enabled the Twelve to contribute positively to the searches for just and lasting settlements in many crises around the world: the Middle East, Central America and South Africa are prominent examples of situations where the Twelve have been to the fore in advocating peaceful settlements.  It is my intention to ensure that Ireland will continue to play its full and constructive part in the elaboration of joint positions on foreign policy with our European partners. We have a distinctive input in this process and it has given Ireland an enhanced voice in the world.</P>
    <P>In relation to the economic aspects of our Community membership, the Government are determined to ensure that the Single European Act will provide a basis for the development of the Community along lines that will address our particular needs and safeguard and promote our economic interests.</P>
    <P>The immediate context in which the Government will pursue this approach is provided by the negotiations which commenced recently on the set of proposals for the period up to 1992.  These were brought forward by the Commission with a view to making a success of the Single European Act and are informally known as the &ldquo;Delors plan&rdquo;.  They envisage an increase in the Community's resources, the development of policies designed to further cohesion and the completion of the process of reform of the CAP.</P>
    <P>In their broad lines these proposals address the issues of major concern to Ireland.  The challenge of international competition in the world market means <Col N="10" /> that action along the lines advocated by the Commission is needed to give the Community adequate and assured resources, to ensure the Community budget is managed prudently and efficiently and to allow for effective measures to be taken to reduce regional disparties in the Community.  We support the objectives of a medium term solution which would enable the Community to plan ahead.</P>
    <P>We also support the opening of the internal market which we consider should significantly enhance our export opportunities and add to the attractions of Ireland as an investment location to service this wider market.</P>
    <P>We welcome the general thrust of the proposals on future financing.  We support the Commission's proposal that the ceiling on the resources available to the Community budget should be 1.4 per cent of the Community's GNP.  This would represent an increase of 45 per cent by 1992 in the resources available compared with the resources available under the existing 1.4 per cent VAT ceiling.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the considerable benefits which Ireland has received from the Community's Structural Funds.  Between 1973 and 1986, Ireland received £1,563 million in total receipts &mdash; the highest level of benefit of any member state.  In the enlarged Community of Twelve, moving towards completion of the internal market, we simply cannot afford to take this level of benefit for granted.  Nevertheless, there is a clear commitment in the Single European Act to work towards economic and social cohesion.  It is our task to ensure that as the Community's internal market is opened up, parallel action takes place to lessen the disparities which exist between the regions.  The need to narrow the existing gap in living standards must be taken into account in the implementation of all Community policies.  The Structural Funds &mdash; Regional, Social, Agricultural Guidance &mdash; are important instruments in this effort.  The Community is committed to reviewing and improving the way they work and to ensuring that the assistance from the <Col N="11" /> funds has the maximum economic impact in the neediest areas.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Commission's acknowledgement of the importance of concentrating structural assistance on the least developed regions.  We consider that the proposal to double the Structural Funds and to devote 80 per cent of the Regional Fund to the promotion of these areas should have real economic impact. We shall also seek to ensure that our particular budgetary capacity is taken into account and shall continue our efforts to ensure that the Community's intervention rates are modulated accordingly.</P>
    <P>In order to bring about restructuring and to alleviate hardship, the Commission is proposing a system of direct income aids for farmers.  We accept that a system of Community aids may be necessary in some areas.  We are opposed, however, to the introduction of a national aids system which can lead to a distortion of competition and to a re-nationalisation of the CAP, the Community's most successful common policy. Our approach is that the major underpinning of farmers' incomes should be by market support through guaranteed prices and intervention.  In this situation, Irish agriculture can exploit its natural advantages and compete successfully in the European and world markets.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the question of our foreign relations with the world at large, and, in particular, their economic and political aspects.  The present economic climate has brought home to all the urgency of a national commitment to a programme of growth.  The emphasis on export-led growth in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will have implications for many areas of my Department's activity.  The vital task of enhancing our foreign earnings will be pursued vigorously as a primary objective by our diplomatic missions.  The methods of carrying out this objective will naturally vary to meet the particular circumstances of individual countries.  Our representatives will be called upon to monitor changes of legislation or practice <Col N="12" /> which would affect our trade adversely and to lobby on our behalf so that export opportunities or investments are not impaired.  In state trading countries missions have a particular role as the channel of contact with central trading organisations, either directly or through the operation of co-operation agreements and joint commissions, for which my Department have specific responsibility. Our diplomatic personnel will work in close liaison with CTT and other promotional bodies in areas where they are both represented or on their behalf in areas where they are not.  Apart from direct exports of goods they will also be instructed to pay particular attention to supporting the service sector and to contracts funded by international bodies such as the United Nations or the World Bank.</P>
    <P>My Department will be intensifying their efforts in the areas I have referred to with a view to enhancing the contribution they can make to the promotion of our exports.  Familiarisation meetings are being arranged with semi-State bodies active in the export area for officers going on postings and it is hoped to expand these arrangements.  Increased attention will be given to the tourism area.  My Department are already represented on a high-level committee under the Minister of State for Tourism and our missions abroad will be active in this area directly or in liaison with local Bord Fáilte offices.  The cultural dimension of tourism is one in which Ireland has much to offer and one which our missions should be well placed to promote.</P>
    <P>A second major dimension in our relations with other countries is, of course, the political one.  I would like now to review some political issues which I feel are important for the conduct of our foreign relations.</P>
    <P>Among these issues there are a few with such awesome implications for us as the relations between the Superpowers and the question of disarmament.  We believe it is of vital importance that the two Superpowers continue their dialogue aimed at advancing international peace and security.</P>
    <P>While this country is neither directly <Col N="13" /> nor indirectly involved in these bilateral discussions, we welcome their comprehensive character and the prospects of achieving, for the first time, a genuine reduction in the number of nuclear weapons held by the Superpowers.  The Government believe that the elimination of intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe, which is the area of the Superpower dialogue in which agreement seems closest, would be a positive step towards the goal of nuclear disarmament and towards halting and reversing the arms race generally.  We hope that progress can soon be made in other areas also and that all sides will agree on maintaining existing agreements, which are the basic foundation of the arms control process.</P>
    <P>In 1987 Ireland will take part in the UN Conference on Disarmament and Development, which will begin in New York in August.  We are determined to play an active and positive role in the disarmament process, especially in the fields of nuclear disarmament.  We will continue to urge strict implementation and the widest possible acceptance of the non-proliferation regime.  We regard agreement on a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing as more necessary, and more feasible, than ever.</P>
    <P>In the broader East-West framework, we continue to attach special importance to our involvement in the CSCE process. This provides an East-West network of contacts and co-operation which has endured despite periods of tension between the Superpowers.  It is also a forum in which smaller countries in Europe, such as Ireland, can contribute to the development of more stable, humane and co-operative relations in the region.  We are, therefore, participating actively, along with our partners in the Twelve, in the third CSCE follow-up meeting which is currently taking place in Vienna.  We are working to achieve a substantive, balanced outcome at Vienna, which will include new measures in all areas covered by the Helsinki Final Act, but most particularly in the fields of human rights and human contacts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> This Government attach great importance to maintaining, and indeed strengthening, Ireland's role within the United Nations.  We have a distinctive contribution to make on many areas of concern to the UN and it is the Government's intention to ensure that our voice continues to be given full expression.  In addition to our participation in the work of the General Assembly, our current membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights provides an opportunity to highlight our particular concerns in the human rights area, an aspect of the work of the UN to which we attach particular significance.</P>
    <P>For all its shortcomings, the United Nations provides a unique and valuable world forum.  We accordingly welcome the efforts being made under the direction of the Secretary General to improve and up-date the operation of the organisation. An essential pre-condition of progress in this regard is a willingness by all member states to discharge their charter obligations by making their obligatory financial contributions.  The present unsatisfactory situation both militates against the completion of the reform process and distracts the UN from the broader issues with which it should be preoccupied.</P>
    <P>An aspect of United Nations activity with which Ireland has a long an honourable association is, of course, United Nations peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should on this occasion pay tribute to the members of the Defence Forces serving with the United Nations &mdash; Truce Supervision Organisation at various centres in the Middle East, the UN Force in Cyprus and, of course, UNIFIL, our major commitment at present in the peacekeeping area.</P>
    <P>The tragic deaths of three members of the UNIFIL contingent over the past year have highlighted our commitment in this respect.  I should like here to offer consolation to the families of the three men concerned and say that they died in the cause of peace in the finest traditions of the peace-keeping role of Ireland in troubled spots throughout the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> The Government have made clear to all of the parties to the conflict, and in particular to the Israeli authorities, our insistence on the need for maximum co-operation with the forces and the unacceptability of any actions which might threaten the security and our personnel. The Government will continue to monitor carefully the situation on the ground in southern Lebanon to ensure that the assurances which they have been offered in this regard, will be fully implemented. I saw the Israeli Ambassador only last week in this respect.  In this, we will maintain close contact with the UN Secretary General.  We will also continue to impress on the Security Council, under the mandate of which the force operates, the importance we attach to facilitating the full implementation of this mandate.</P>
    <P>Historic ties, geographic proximity, patterns of trade and economic interdependence ensure that the tragic divisions and instabilities of the Middle East remain a matter of consistent concern and priority for Ireland and its partners in Europe.  We can be proud of our active and constructive role in the formulation of a European policy on this issue, for example, in the evolution of the keynote Venice Declaration of June 1980 which remains the basic expression of the policy of the Twelve member states of the European Community.</P>
    <P>In February of this year the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, in a new and important departure, adopted a declaration endorsing an international peace conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of the parties concerned and of any party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The war between Iran and Iraq is now in its seventh year.  The loss of human life as well as the damage to the economic infrastructure bears heavily on the two peoples involved.  This futile and deplorable conflict poses an increasing threat to <Col N="16" /> the security of the Gulf region and has serious implications for international peace and security generally.  We have called on the parties concerned for an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal to internationally recognised frontiers. Together with our partners in the Twelve we have urged both parties to comply with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and have supported the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary-General.</P>
    <P>The situation in South Africa has shown no improvement during the last year.  Indeed violence and repression have reached new heights.  South Africa has now had a countrywide state of emergency for almost a year.  Many thousands of people, nearly all black, have been imprisoned without trial under its provisions, often for many months; their numbers have included many hundreds of young school children.  Hundreds more have been killed either in fighting between blacks or at the hands of the security forces.</P>
    <P>Against this background an election was conducted among the white minority in May.  The results were predictable and sad.  The election, confined as it was to a small minority of the population, did not address the true problems facing South Africa but showed a rise in support for those demanding more repression of the black majority.  Nothing in the results has prompted the South African Government to take the steps necessary to open a genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the black community.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, the year has seen an increase in international pressure against South Africa.  Further steps have been taken over this period by the Twelve member states of the European Community, by the Nordic countries, the Commonwealth and the USA.  The Twelve decided in September last to ban imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins as well as deciding to ban new investment in South Africa.  Ireland welcomed this decision and fully supported community action in this respect.</P>
    <P>South Africa continues its open defiance of the United Nations and world <Col N="17" /> opinion by its illegal occupation of Namibia and its refusal to allow a negotiated settlement in accordance with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 435.  We shall continue to oppose these trends in South African policy.  We urge full adherence to the Security Council resolution and effective support of the front line states in their resistance to South African destabilisation.</P>
    <P>We are very conscious of the acute economic and social problems which afflict the countries of the Latin American region and threaten their political stability.  Along with the rest of the Twelve, we will continue to aim at a relationship between Europe and Latin America which will help to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights and promote badly needed economic development.  In this respect we will follow the Contadora formula.  We support the States in South America that are pushing for that type of agreed peaceful formula to settle affairs in Central America.</P>
    <P>The plight of what has been called the Third World is one which occupies a very special place in the foreign policy preoccupations of the Irish people.  The marked disparities between rich and poor nations and the problem of the debt overhang of the developing countries are matters which must now enter into any assessment of the collective future of our world.  For us in Ireland there is the added dimension that images of hunger and deprivation and the spectacle of victim peoples touch a deep chord in our collective memory.</P>
    <P>Next July the seventh UNCTAD Conference will take place in Geneva.  We hope to play a positive role at that conference. Apart from our diplomatic effort we have financial commitments to the Official Development Assistance programme which is channelled multilaterally through the European Community and the United Nations-World Bank system and through our bilateral assistance programme.</P>
    <P>This year the provision for our aid through the European Community is <Col N="18" /> IR£16.32 million.  This aid is spent principally in the Lomé Convention countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, in countries of Asia and Latin America and on the Community's food aid programme. The allocation for the bilateral assistance programme this year is IR£17.175 million.  About 60 per cent of our bilateral aid programme is directed to four priority countries in Africa, namely, Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia. Technical assistance constitutes a major component of our aid.  In this respect 95 experts were employed at the end of last year.  In addition, many Irish public and private sector organisations act as technical consultants for bilaterial aid projects.</P>
    <P>A further dimension of our involvement with other states is the consular protection of our citizens abroad.  A special aspect of this has been our concern in regard to the numbers of young Irish people who have emigrated to the United States in recent years and whose future is uncertain or illegal by reason of their status in that country.  Our determination to improve their position was set out clearly in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and formed the basis for a number of talks which the Taoiseach and I had with Congressional leaders, Irish-American politicians and the United States administration during our visit to Washington in March.  I would like to thank in particular Congressman Donnelly who has since then introduced a draft Bill dealing with this problem and which, if enacted, will increase the number of immigrant visas available to Irish citizens.  We thank Congressman Donnelly for his initiative and we also thank the other Congressmen who supported him in pursuing this matter.</P>
    <P>I might mention also the important question of our relations with the Irish community in Britain.  My predecessor played a very strong role in this respect. I was glad to attend the annual congress of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain which was held recently.  I was able to learn at first hand about their problems and the emphasis they place on the Dion Committee to which we have <Col N="19" /> given funds of £250,000 this year under the Vote of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>I talked to them about their concern in regard to the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Annie Maguire cases where it is quite clear that injustices occurred.  We welcome the fact that in regard to the Birmingham Six, the Court of Criminal Appeal will be looking at the matter in November.</P>
    <P>These are the main lines of our foreign policy which the Government intend to pursue.  I have tried to do my best in the context of the 30 minutes constraint.  We are confident that our foreign policy is based on the principles the Irish people wish to see asserted and the role they wish to see us play in our international relations.  I can assure the Dáil that our foreign policy will be implemented in a way which will serve the national interest and play its part in the <i>Programme of National Recovery</i> to which we are committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept this Estimate because it is one we prepared.  There is one noticeable exception which makes the Minister's speech in relation to development assistance appear very hollow because it has been reduced from our Estimate by £1.3 million.  This has happened only twice in 15 years, where the allocation, as a percentage of GNP, has been reduced.  In both cases the money for international co-operation has been reduced by Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Brendan Griffin will deal with that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are constant pleas made in this House for more time to debate foreign affairs.  When I was Minister I was very receptive to suggestions that we should have much fuller debates in this House on foreign policy extending to one or two days.  I would like a commitment from the Government, who control the time of this House, that they will allocate two days for a debate on all aspects of foreign policy in the autumn when we resume. That would receive the support of the House.  It is ridiculous to try to debate such important things as the European <Col N="20" /> Community, international affairs, disarmament, the Middle East and Northern Ireland in a 20-minute contribution. It is just not possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>We know that the more our basic principles and interests are maintained as consistent national objectives the more likely we are to see them prevail. We know that the more our domestic differences are carried into the external arena the greater the possibility of damage to our interests as a whole. Successive Governments become the custodians of Ireland's international reputation and, in the general interest, they will seek to safeguard the foreign policy gains made by others as well as those achieved by themselves... In the conduct of our foreign policy we will give due value to these areas of consensus.  We would hope that Opposition Deputies will react in the same spirit and give the same emphasis to national over party political considerations in dealing with this special domain of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  It is essential that externally we should support Government policies.  I regret that this is another late conversion by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The only occasion on which Opposition Deputies attacked the Government while out of the country was when the present leader of Fianna Fáil went twice to America and attacked the Government.  That is something unheard of in any democracy and it was certainly something new in the conduct of affairs of this country. Likewise, the present Tánaiste went on a surreptitious visit to Washington at the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and did his best to persuade Irish-American politicians not to give any support to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I am glad that he was totally unsuccessful in that and that it was rejected by those politicians as an unpatriotic act.  I hope the sentiments that the Minister expresses in the speech this morning will not be just for the convenience of his role as Minister, but that when he is back in Opposition he will <Col N="21" /> follow through and support the Government in their foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in relation to the Single European Act which Fianna Fáil knew from the time it was signed in February was in the national interest. Deputy Collins as Opposition spokesman for Foreign Affairs at the time did not make one reference in his Estimate speech last May or June against the Single European Act but just re-emphasised our commitment to Europe and the necessity for us to play a full part in Europe.  Yet, for political reasons, because they sensed they might be able to drive a wedge between the Government parties last December they decided to take up a position which they did not believe in.  Those chickens came home to roost as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned in the last few days.  Documents issued by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign outside the polling stations &mdash; and I will have something to say about their dishonest campaign &mdash; ran as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is dishonest and misleading to attempt to put the ratification of the Single European Act across as something of great benefit to the people of this country, because this is not, in fact, the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Charles J. Haughey, Dáil Éireann, December 9, 1986.</P>
    <P>The fact that Fianna Fáil supporters were confused about the Single European Act relates directly to Fianna Fáil's dishonest opposition to the Single European Act which they were careful to cloak over by the euphemism &ldquo;we did not vote against it in the Dáil'.  This was part of their political broadcast.  It is true they abstained, but every word they said was against the Single European Act.  Professor Mary McAleese was clearly one of the ones duped by what they said.  She believed they meant what they said and she went out pushing a &ldquo;No&rdquo; attitude in the campaign, quoting extensively the words of the leader of Fianna Fáil and saying every time &ldquo;but I am saying no more than Mr. Haughey said last December&rdquo;. Unfortunately Professor McAleese is not as familiar with the ability of Fianna <Col N="22" /> Fáil to make U-turns on virtually any subject, as perhaps other people are, and she thought they meant what they said. Professor McAleese quoted extensively from Deputy Haughey and then found herself being disowned by the party for saying things which her party leader said six months ago.  It was a ridiculous position in which to be.</P>
    <P>This was reflected in the electorate. When I was campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote people came up to me and said &ldquo;we are voting no, we are members of Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  That was fairly general among Fianna Fáil supporters.  This was also reflected in their thoroughly lazy campaign on the issue.  In the early hours of polling day when nobody was around they put up posters and then disappeared back into their houses.  They were not outside the polling stations, they did not canvas or distribute literature.  I speak from my experience in my constituency and in other constituencies where I spoke to the people during the campaign.  I am glad that the people, despite the great temptation to rap Fianna Fáil for their change in stance over the Single European Act, the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the health cuts and other Government cuts, resisted doing that in sufficient numbers to allow the Single European Act to get the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote yesterday.  I am very pleased about that, despite the recent opposition of Fianna Fáil and the dishonest campaign conducted by some elements in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; lobby.  Some of them were very honest, though not all.  I was sorry to note that Cork Council Trade Unions issued a circular which was handed out outside of polling stations on Tuesday which said:</P>
    <P>Title II means:</P>
    <P>An overall reduced standard of living for most Irish people.</P>
    <P>More job losses.</P>
    <P>Abolition of custom and excise duties and harmonisation of VAT will mean the loss of an estimated £1,000 million yearly in revenue.  This can only mean more hospital closures and further cutbacks in health, education and social welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> The prices of basic necessities will go up:</P>
    <P>Butter by a minimum of 11p a pound.</P>
    <P>Bread by a minimum of 7p a loaf.</P>
    <P>Milk by a minimum of 3p a pint.</P>
    <P>Tea by a minimum of 20p a pound.</P>
    <P>This document was issued in the name of the Cork Council of Trade Unions and it clearly misrepresented what the Single European Act was about, they said that voting:</P>
    <P>NO to the Single European Act means:</P>
    <P>NO to Health, Education and Social Welfare cuts.</P>
    <P>NO to more job losses.</P>
    <P>NO to price increases.</P>
    <P>NO to Thatcherite monetarist policies.</P>
    <P>This organisation which is responsible for the trade union movement in the city of Cork issued that dishonest reprehensible attempt to mislead people about the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>Also in relation to the Single European Act in a television broadcast last Tuesday week in a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme a journalist asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to comment on a statement which he said had been made by the Danish Foreign Minister in Copenhagen that for the first time at their discussion on European political co-operation in April they were able to discuss matters of armaments, disarmament, strategies, treaties and so on and the Irish Minister present did not object.  Perhaps the Minister was taken by surprise but he did not deny that position on the television programme. The Minister talked around it and said that it is normal that they would talk about these things, that there were 11 members of NATO and so on, and that he would shut up.  Perhaps the Minister will have an explanation for not denying this on the television programme and perhaps the Danish Minister did not say it at all as we had another example in the last few days of the Danish Minister being misrepresented by some over-enthusiastic fellow countryman of his in relation <Col N="24" /> to his attitude to the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>When political co-operation is discussed, the Irish Minister cannot allow that discussion to go ahead if it is dealing with armaments, strategies, manoeuvres theories about the line-up of forces or anything that is more correctly dealt with in the NATO or in the WEU context.  It is not enough just to stay quiet and let the discussion flow over his head.  It is not a suitable subject to discuss in political co-operation and the Minister present from Ireland must always object to it and draw the attention of his fellow members to the fact that it is more correctly discussed in one of the other fora.  Therefore, I would like the Minister to comment on the fact that he did not deny last Tuesday week that he had just sat there and to assure the House that in future if such discussions take place he will object and will ensure that they take place where correctly they should take place.  Political co-operation in the European sense deals with the economic measures of security.  It does not deal with arms and so forth.  I am sorry to say that the political aspects of security have been misrepresented.  Of course we have an interest in the political and economic aspects of security.  For instance, the one we can all think of very quickly is in regard to the supply of oil.</P>
    <P>I want to move on to the North-South relations and the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Mrs. Thatcher gave a phone-in interview on radio during the weekend when various questions were put to her. The heading in one of the newspapers was: &ldquo;Thatcher Prepared To Concede on Accord&rdquo;, the accord being the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  What she said on the programme in answer to questions is not quite clear.  She gave the impression, in fairness I believe unwittingly, that it was possible to renegotiate the Anglo-Irish Agreement and that she would be willing to see that happen if they sat down with a devolved Government.  She said that a clause in the agreement allows renegotiation of the agreement.  She was referring to Article 11 which provides that: &ldquo;At the end of three years from signature <Col N="25" /> of this Agreement, or earlier if requested by either Government, the working of the Conference shall be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any changes in the scope and nature of its activities are desirable&rdquo;.  I suggest, only on the basis of the outside chance that there may be not full recognition of what that clause means by one of the parties to the agreement, that it does not mean that the Ango-Irish Agreement can be renegotiated.  The workings of the conference can be reviewed but the agreement cannot be renegotiated.  I say this, conscious of the danger of an over truculent approach by either Government to the working of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's newspapers reported that the Minister had raised, correctly, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat the matter of the shooting of the van driver and the attitude of the RUC in that incident. Bishop Daly referred to this at the removal service the other day.  The conference and the secretariat can and should be used in matters such as this which are of concern to Nationalists in the North.  I raised here on the Adjournment a fortnight ago the matter of the Ballygall shooting and I asked the Minister to make sure that that would be raised through the Anglo-Irish Conference. It is not clear from newspaper reports &mdash; although that does not necessarily mean anything &mdash; whether the Minister has responded.  I want to draw his attention to the yellow card which is issued to members of the security forces in the North.  It provides that in all circumstances they are to use the minimum force necessary, that firearms must be used only as a last resort and that the members may open fire against a person only if he is committing or about to commit an act likely to endanger life and there is no other way to prevent the danger.  If they have to open fire they should (a) fire only aimed shots, (b) fire no more rounds than are necessary and (c) take all reasonable precautions not to injure anyone other than their target.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister understands what I am saying.  This must be taken up.  A <Col N="26" /> good relationship between Nationalists and the security forces is an important part of the ability of constitutional Nationalists in the North to get their fellow Nationalists to withdraw support from the men of violence who have done so much damage and who feed on the hate they can generate between Nationalists and Unionists.  The security forces should not be seen as the security force of one side or another.  They are there to defend all the people irrespective of political beliefs or religion.  That is an essential key to bringing about peace in the North, to having Nationalist confidence in the administration of justice and in the security forces in the North.  If that can be achieved we can achieve the other objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, of bringing about peace and stability in the North.  The Minister should consider seriously what has been happening in the North in the last few months and should on every occasion an incident occurs raise the matter through the secretariat.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that in the general election campaign in Britain the constitutional Nationalists in the North, the SDLP in particular, are standing firmly by the agreement as the main plank in their platform for winning seats from Unionists and from the enemies of the people, the Provisional IRA and their hollow political wing, Sinn Féin.  I wish them every success in that regard and that SDLP seats will be at least doubled when the votes are counted in the North in the middle of June.  If the Government here can give them or any constitutional Nationalists in the North any help, it should be given.  Any party whose aim is to bring about reconciliation between the two traditions there without the use of violence deserve that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney has asked for a debate on the Anglo-Irish Agreement in this House and I hope that the Minister will get the Government to agree to give him the two day's debate in the autumn.  It could be included in the Foreign Affairs debate.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the United Nations forces in <Col N="27" /> Lebanon.  The contribution Ireland has made to peacekeeping is in stark contrast with the activities of the Provisional IRA who claim to speak for the Irish people in the North of Ireland and has been underlined by me.  Our peacekeeping forces have been going out now for 25 years.  Any time we were asked by the United Nations to contribute to peace keeping &mdash; no matter in what part of the world &mdash; every Government here was glad to accede to that request.  In doing so I believe they had the full backing of our people.  We can all be justly proud of the role they play at present in a most difficult situation in South Lebanon, with different factions among the Lebanese people themselves, with the unnecessary presence of the Israeli defence forces and the South Lebanese army in South Lebanon, indeed the inability of the United Nations to fulfil the mandate given them almost ten years ago to establish a Government in South Lebanon and to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops.  To my mind, neither of those things has happened even though the Israelis might dispute the second.  That is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>The role the United Nations forces have played in South Lebanon has brought some measure of peace, stability and an ordinary form of life to the people of that unfortunate region.  Of course every Government will have grave doubts about whether they should continue that role because of the fact that the United Nations have been unable to fulfil their mandate.  However, on balance on every occasion most Governments will come down &mdash; as did my Government &mdash; in favour of its continuance, on the basis that even though the United Nations forces are not fulfilling their mandate they are performing a role in the region that is helpful in bringing some element of stability to some part of Lebanon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one further <Col N="28" /> point I want to make.  I saw in the papers the other day that the Government had decided to allow South Korea to open an embassy in Dublin.  I have no objection to South Korea opening an embassy here. However, we had been operating for a number of years on the basis of reciprocity, that we would allow embassies to open here when we were allowed open an embassy in the corresponding capital. Of course, there are exceptions to that. One is Turkey, another is Kenya, yet another, Luxembourg.  There was an effort made to establish that reciprocity principle, that we would only allow embassies to open here when we opened a corresponding one abroad in the corresponding capital.  Because of financial restrictions here we will be unable to open embassies abroad.  This Government appear to have moved away from that principle and a South Korean embassy is to be opened here.  As I have said, I have no objection to that.  We established diplomatic relations with South Korea last year.  I think that was a good thing to do and I welcome them here.  I do not know whether we are to open an embassy in Seoul.  I do not know what is the position.  If we are to move away from that principle of reciprocity I should have thought that number one on that list would be Israel because of our relations with them.  We have frequently had to see the ambassador over incidents in South Lebanon.  Indeed another reason would be the growing amount of trade with them.</P>
      <P>I apologise for having exceeded my time.  I fear that had I four times as much the Chair would still be telling me I had exceeded the limit.  I hope the Minister will agree to the two-day debate I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the Revised Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs takes place at a most interesting time given that the House and the country have just passed a referendum on the Single European Act. That referendum brought the issue of foreign affairs to the centre of the political stage.  In my first contribution to a <Col N="29" /> foreign affairs debate I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Government and to wish him well during his term of office.</P>
      <P>The most important issue highlighted by the debate in the past few weeks on our membership of the EC is the absolute ignorance of most people, including some Deputies, on Ireland's foreign policy.  It was not until the Supreme Court gave its judgment on the Single European Act that the importance of our membership of the EC was brought home to most of our people.  Though the judgment caused much distress to many Deputies &mdash; understandably, in the case of the last Coalition Government, and seemed to have a nuisance value for members of the present Government &mdash; it has hammered home one very important point.  We have never properly examined Ireland's foreign policy in the Dáil or indeed in the Seanad either, even though, as a nation, we are obsessed with our sovereignty and the part we are supposed to be playing in the world.</P>
      <P>For that reason, if no other, the referendum on the Single European Act has awakened a new interest in foreign policy which did not exist before.  It has made people examine our membership of the EC, our neutrality, our attitude to Sellafield, and examine what are our vital national interests and other issues arising within the EC.  I believe that was a good development.  It highlights the hames the Government made of the whole introduction of the Bill relating to the Single European Act last year and the inadequate debate thereon.  We must remember that this issue was of more fundamental importance to the future of this country than the last general election or indeed any of the other recent referenda. I hope that such an important Bill, such as that relating to the Single European Act, will never be rushed through this House in such a manner again, or that an Opposition party will never oppose, as did Fianna Fáil last December, just for opposition sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great interest taken by many of our people in our foreign policy.  It is for that reason I appeal to the Minister <Col N="30" /> for Foreign Affairs to set up a foreign policy committee when the new committees are being established under the 25th Dáil.  We have had a Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC sitting for a number of years.  I believe this should now be broadened into a foreign affairs committee generally. I should also like to support the call by the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Barry, for a full two-day debate on the issue of foreign affairs in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the shadow of the Single European Act referendum I should like to highlight the totally inadequate job done by the EC offices in Dublin, the Commission and Parliament offices here, over the past 15 years to educate and integrate the Irish people as full EC members.  I am sure I am not alone in stating it was not until the Single European Act referendum was upon us that I learned of the enormous contribution of the EC to our economy.  I am not speaking in terms of the £900 million a year figure bandied about during the campaign which makes Ireland the biggest net beneficiary of the EC.  Rather I am talking about how our health budget will receive £30 million this year from the EC whereas the health cutbacks proposed this year add up to almost £60 million.  For example, most of the roads being built in this country these days are funded by the EC.  Most of the third level regional technical colleges are assisted and funded to a huge extent by the Community, with parents and students receiving grants for these colleges.  We could not afford to do a lot of these things for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Similarly, practically all of our environment legislation &mdash; and there is great interest these days in matters dealing with the natural environment &mdash; has come about directly as a result of EC directives, for example, the Air Pollution Bill debated in the House in the past few days.  The same applied to the Water Pollution Bill and the dealing with pollution of the sea by oil in the late seventies. All the motions in the world passed by the Dáil could do nothing by way of closing down Sellafield nuclear plant in comparison with the power of a <Col N="31" /> monitoring committee being set up by the EC.  I would fault the EC Commission and European Parliament offices in Dublin for not educating, first, the Oireachtas, second, the media and, third, TDs generally on the importance of Europe these days to the Irish economy. As a former political correspondent, I know that the Commission and Parliament offices rarely, if ever, invited my former colleagues to Brussels or Strasbourg to observe matters of Irish interest. It is a great pity that much of this information is not made public.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that when we introduce legislation, such as the Status of Children Bill which will be before the House in the near future dealing with illegitimacy, the EC office in Dublin, simultaneously, should make information available to Deputies and Senators about the legal status of illegitimate children in the other eleven member states of the EC.  For example, it would have been very interesting at the time of the divorce referendum last year had the EC offices in Dublin given information about divorce in other EC countries.</P>
    <P>I have listed two pieces of social legislation but the same rule of thumb could apply, for example, to taxation policy. There was a fear, quite understandably, during the Single European Act campaign that the harmonisation of taxes could mean higher tax rates.  Yet the EC offices had at their immediate disposal valuable statistical information about the direct and indirect taxes in all the other economies of the EC.  Since we are now committed through the referendum to a future in Europe we should look more towards Europe for comparative purposes. The tendency in Ireland is always to look towards the United States or to look over our shoulders, with a big inferiority complex, at Britain.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of the recent referendum there are two other issues I would like to raise.  The first arises from a question put by the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, to the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday asking him when the Government will <Col N="32" /> hold talks with the leaders of the other political parties on the constitutional implications of the Crotty judgment for other international treaties.  The Taoiseach did not seem to treat the matter with great urgency.  As the Government's power to ratify the Anglo-Irish Agreement could be involved and as a case on the Agreement is pending in the High Court, I appeal to the Taoiseach, on behalf of the party, to conclude his examination with some urgency.  I hope we might be in a position to come back to the House before the summer recess to clear up this matter as it is vital to the Government's ability to conduct foreign policy.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in the debate in the Dáil a few weeks ago, raised the matter of our membership of the United Nations.  I would also like the Taoiseach to treat this matter with some urgency.</P>
    <P>The second issue I would like to raise is our traditional policy of neutrality about which we heard so much during the campaign on the Single European Act.  I would like to call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to allow Government time for a full Dáil debate on the issue of neutrality.  This issue has never been properly debated in the Dáil. The older political parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, have adopted semi-false positions as if we really were a politically neutral country but we are not and any responsible party will tell the people that we have not been politically neutral for a long time.  What we are is militarily neutral.</P>
    <P>Young people are very interested in our policy of neutrality but many of them have not fully thought it out.  It would be very interesting if a new foreign policy committee, for example, were to debate our neutrality and, for the first time in this country's history, came to an all-party agreement on what neutrality actually means in the eighties.  The historical fact is that neutrality was a tactic very wisely adopted by Mr. de Valera during the last war.  The people have a fondness for it but, as we saw during the debate on the Single European Act, they have not been led by their political leaders to <Col N="33" /> fully understand the implications of it.  In my personal view, and this has not been discussed by my party, our neutrality should allow us to lead and take part in disarmament talks within the EC but as the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, pointed out in a most interesting contribution to the House some weeks ago, an Irish head of Government cannot participate in such talks because of our policy of military neutrality.  I was delighted to see that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, referred to the disarmament issue during his speech.  It is wrong that we should not be able to take part in disarmament talks.  It would not infringe on our concept of military neutrality. Most Irish people would like to see us play a leading role in Europe and the world on the issue of disarmament.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a few pet subjects of my own which come under the Estimate for Foreign Affairs.  Firstly, the Progressive Democrats propose that the different Irish trade, industry, tourism and diplomatic agencies should be integrated overseas on a single site providing an Ireland House focus for foreign interests and contacts.  Under this strategy the locations of the IDA, CTT, SFADCo, Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte and the Department of Foreign Affairs would be amalgamated with the obvious saving in overheads.  It would also minimise the obvious duplication that currently occurs.</P>
    <P>For many years the Department of Foreign Affairs have concerned themselves mainly with the diplomatic or high politics side of foreign relations to the detriment of trade and industry which this country has to rely on for exports and ultimately for the provision of jobs at home.  The former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Seán Donlon, did much work in co-ordinating the politics and the economics of foreign relations.  The Government who are now supposed to be looking at expenditure cuts in all areas should consider this idea. An Ireland House concept would present a co-ordinated and composite picture of Ireland in foreign countries.  All too often people in the know say that the various organisations like Córas Tráchtála and <Col N="34" /> Bord Fáilte are competing for business and duplicating their efforts whereas they should be working in their separate areas for the one purpose.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to my favourite subject going back to my old school days.  We do not put enough effort into the teaching of foreign languages.  All too often &mdash; I have heard this from parents since I was elected as a TD &mdash; pupils leave secondary schools with a proficiency in the written language but without a functional use of the language for the business world. There are a number of opportunities for young people in Europe but because of the language barrier which poses itself as a problem, we are all too inclined to export our graduates to the United States or to Britain.  By doing so we are cutting off a big labour market.  Any European city today, with the introduction of cheaper air fares, is no more than two hours away.  I want to make it clear that I am not for a moment advocating that young people should emigrate but I would be running away from reality if I did not accept that we will not be providing full employment for the foreseeable future and that young people are going to work abroad.  If young people are to emigrate we should educate them more in order to open up the best opportunities for them.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the situation in our secondary schools today it has hardly progressed since I did my leaving certificate. French is still the common foreign language. Taking the leaving certificate results of 1984, the last year for which I could get figures, 27,762 students studied French, only 3,544 studied German, 1,953 studied Spanish, 154 studied Italian and 37 studied Greek.  These figures are out of a total of 45,000 students who sat for their leaving certificate in that year. These are the major languages of the EC and there is not enough emphasis placed on them in the schools.  I bet that the State's investment in the Irish language by comparison is far ahead of the total of the State's investment in all other foreign languages put together.  The Irish language should be retained as a living language and I am not advocating cutbacks in that area but we should place more <Col N="35" /> emphasis on the teaching of foreign languages in schools.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the matter of Irish troops in the Middle East serving with UNIFIL.  My colleague, Deputy Martin Cullen, from Waterford asked me to raise the question of a certain battalion serving in Lebanon on the weekend of 16 May last when Irish soldiers had to run for cover.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether there is ongoing trouble for our soldiers in Lebanon.  I remember the former Minister for Defence, Mr. O'Toole, promised a major review of our membership of UNIFIL and the United Nations in the last days of the previous Government.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to tell the House the outcome of that review.  Is there a constant danger for Irish soldiers in Lebanon and was there another outbreak of incidents which went unreported around 16 May? I notice the Minister of State is shaking his head but I would like him to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to raise is probably the most important in the whole area of foreign affairs and that is the issue of Northern Ireland.  I welcome the commitment of the new Government to the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. We are now coming to a most interesting time when we will have a newly elected Government in Britain, we have a new Government in Ireland and there is a time span when a further commitment can be given to the workings of the agreement. It is not enough, after 18 months, that the agreement is in existence.  We should now be pressing harder for the implementation of the commitments made when it was introduced in Hillsborough in November 1985.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to clarify the position of the international fund and whether moneys are being committed from the EC.  My understanding is that the British Government are still refusing to apply jointly with Ireland for a contribution to the fund.  The British Government, I understand from a recent meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Union in London, have asked <Col N="36" /> the Irish Government to make an application in their own name and that the British Government will later support the Irish case.  It would be a great pity if that were so and I would ask the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Government to spell out in greater detail what their priorities will be on Northern policy in the next year or so after the British general election. We have not seen the reform in the security area promised under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and there were definite commitments given on that in the statement published with the Hillsborough Agreement in November 1985.  I hope the Government will be working towards the implementation of that reform.  Likewise reform of the courts was promised but I understand the British Government are holding back on this issue.  With the general election behind them in Britain, I would like to see a new thrust being given to the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement by this Government. It must be remembered that the Agreement was not to be an end in itself but a means of bringing the Nationalist community in particular away from the feeling of alienation they had with the political system and process in the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must begin by agreeing very strongly with the Fine Gael spokesman on Foreign Affairs and former Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, in saying how inadequate it is that we have 20 minutes to discuss foreign policy.  I appreciate the constraints on time but I ask the Minister of State to ensure that in his reply the Minister will give an answer to our specific request for a two day debate in the autumn on all aspects of Irish foreign policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign policy in my party has always occupied, some people have felt, an inordinate amount of time.  During my period as spokesperson on foreign affairs for the Labour Party we published no fewer than 11 position papers including Ireland, A Neutral Nation, Disarmament, Human Rights, International Development Co-operation in the European Community, <Col N="37" /> European Political Co-operation, Eastern Europe, The Middle East, Southern Africa, Latin America and World Peace. I list these not for some form of self-congratulation but to reject the suggestion made in the Minister's speech of us who took a particular position in relation to Title III of the Single European Act were in some way isolationist.  I reject that rather nasty and mean suggestion.  It is a miserable view and I would contrast the record of my party in international affairs with the record of the larger parties who could genuinely be accused of being isolationists.</P>
    <P>I want to take up a number of fundamental principles.  Because I am so constrained by time, what I have to say will almost generate into a list of specific questions.  Let me begin straightforwardly. Can I have a straight answer on whether we will have a foreign affairs committee?  I do not want a fudge on this issue.  There is no point, as happened yesterday, in the Taoiseach standing up and saying he proposes to reinstitute the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  Anybody who goes to the trouble, as I do, of reading those reports, even the latest, No. 34 published in December 1986, will see that the committee, before they opened an adequate discussion on EPC, had to tease out whether they were within their terms of reference, if they were to examine many matters that were within EPC.  This goes right through the history of the committee. When we debated this matter last November we had a responsible reply and I could agree with the care taken in the reply of those who opposed the concept.  They looked at all the foreign affairs committees in Europe and concluded that what I was proposing &mdash; I believe they constructed it wrongly &mdash; was close to the Danish model and therefore would be an encumbrance of a diplomatic kind.</P>
    <P>In putting forward the proposal &mdash; and I have today submitted a motion in this regard &mdash; I hope for all party support that we would have parliamentary accountability in the area of foreign policy. <Col N="38" /> Twenty minutes on the Estimates is not my view of parliamentary accountability in this area.  As I said, I agree with those who have asked for a full two days debate on all aspects of foreign policy in the autumn.  If a foreign affairs committee were merely consultative, it would be of little value.  Much of the debate we have just heard would have been unnecessary if we had such a committee.</P>
    <P>May I give an example from the contributions we have just heard?  I listened to Deputy Barry explain what took place at ministerial meetings when issues of security and defence came up.  He drew a distinction between being silent and affirming a principle and drew attention to the manner in which this had been fudged on a television programme.  This is precisely the educative function of a foreign policy committee.  People who act in our name must be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and it is very important that we take steps away from what is at present one of the most secretive processes of diplomatic unaccountability towards parliamentary accountability.  I have heard all these internationalists who want to have diplomatic relations all over the world and who would accuse me of being an isolationist. Let us be like the rest of Europe.  We are out of step with the rest of Europe because we do not have such a committee. This cannot be justified.  I do not have time to go into the historic, cultural and philosophical reasons behind this, but it has a lot to do with the professional practice of diplomacy, the influences on it, the difference between the British tradition and the European tradition and our over-dependence on models, historically, of British style diplomacy and so forth.  I could spend the day on that but I have no intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>What I have said in relation to accountability of foreign policy is more urgent than ever now that the people have democratically decided on the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution which enables the Single European Act to impinge on our lives.  Surely the process of European political co-operation must be made more open and more accountable.  This <Col N="39" /> is necessary now more than ever particularly in the discussions which surround Title III.  I accept the people's decision but we now need to be informed, we have the right to be informed.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects through which I want to go quickly and I have to list them because of constraints of time.  Would the Minister tell the House, under the revised Overseas Development Aid allocation, if Ireland will achieve the United Nations target?  I have got more letters on one topic of foreign policy than any other in recent months, since the budget was announced, and that was about the further cut in Overseas Development Aid. Somebody pointed out that this was the second time it had been effectively cut back in the last 15 years.  This means that the State is cutting back by exactly the same amount as the Irish people gave voluntarily through Live Aid and other activities.  In other words, the people gave and the State is cutting back.  We could go into all these figures if we had the time.  Within the question of the allocations, there is the disaster fund.  I want to raise here the urgency which attaches to this.  The Minister referred to the situation in Mozambique.  However, I am afraid the ghost that haunts the chamber that formulates our foreign policy was active in the preparation of the Minister's speech.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>This famine is unique; for while it is true that there has been some drought, this natural tragedy has come on top of a man-made one caused by civil strife arising out of activities of the anti-government guerrilla movement RENAMO which has wreaked havoc in every province in Mozambique.</P>
    <P>What is going on in Mozambique is not civil strife; it is the price that Mozambique has been forced to pay because of its opposition to apartheid.  I suggest that the Minister withdraws the phrase &ldquo;civil strife&rdquo; from his speech.  It has given credence and credibility to something that is anything but civil strife.  The fact of the matter is that 50 per cent of the gross domestic product of Mozambique this <Col N="40" /> year, and last year, went on restoring railway lines, ports and roads that were destroyed by forces, assisted by South Africa, who are supporting apartheid.</P>
    <P>In addition, 80,000 children died in the fighting last year.  News coming from Mozambique this week is that famine will be greater in scale than the famine in Ethiopia.  I am afraid that out of a population of 13.4 million some 4.4 million are at risk.  The drought the Minister has referred to has occurred.  An airlift is in progress to bring seed and agricultural implements to the country by September for planting but there will not be any food in the country until next April.  The international community have been alerted and asked to try to avert another Ethiopia in scale in Mozambique.  We are not assisted by people talking about civil strife in Mozanbique and we should come off the fence in regard to that.  Mozambique is under siege by people who support the apartheid system.  Our foreign policy is unequivocal in that regard.  That country has been destabilised by forces that are being assisted by what we have called a hateful regime.  We have a responsibility to those people.  Will the Minister inform the House of the allocation being made?  Will he tell the House if it is his intention to double or treble it in view of the fact that we have expresed the view that we would seek support from the European Community to try to divert the famine?</P>
    <P>The biggest problem facing us is trying to make the world safe from nuclear destruction, the deflection of the great resources spent on war and destruction into the area of development.  Nearer home we have to try to build on a basis of consensus that will remove the tragedy of what is happening in Northern Ireland. We should be able to effectively and positively use our membership of the EC. Those matters were touched on by the Minister in his speech but, with the greatest will in the world towards the Minister and his Minister of State, I find myself curiously unable to discover the principles of foreign policy they speak about. For example, I suggest that one of the <Col N="41" /> paragraphs in the Minister's speech is offensive.  In my view it amounts to the greatest piece of codswallop I have ever read.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There is a widespread consensus in Ireland, transcending most political divisions in our society, on the general principles we should try to assert in the conduct of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I would love to know where they are, and where they go on, other than one which excludes people from knowledge of our foreign policy.  That is very comprehensive here.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>These look to a world at peace, and a world justly ordered, governed by law rather than force.  They reflect a preference for responsive democratic systems, such as we enjoy in our own country, over those which resort to despotism or coercion.</P>
    <P>With respect, and I hope this is carried back to where that statement originated, that is more a prayer than a statement of foreign policy principles.  I do not know what it means.  Does it mean we congratulate ourselves on some kind of purity and that we find everything around us less democratic?  It is time we had a little bit of education of what the word &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; means.  It means more than voting 13 times in one's lifetime.  It means ordering society in a democratic way. There is a lesson we could learn on our own doorstep in Northern Ireland.  The whole history of the Northern Ireland problem is about the relationship of majorities to minorities.  Can anybody talk about how majorities treat minorities even in this country?  The reference to minorities in the Minister's speech is quite insulting.</P>
    <P>I object to the rather shrill notes that were issued after the referendum on the Single European Act.  I justified the opinion I held within my own party and publicly.  I did not go around the country telling people that the trucks would not roll from Recess on Wednesday morning unless the people voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or that the fish would rot at Rossaveal.  I heard all that rubbish during the campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> With regard to the general principles of foreign policy, I should like the Minister to tell us his view on the initiatives being taken by some of the Nordic nations, and other countries, with regard to the flow of nuclear submarines in areas like the Irish Sea.  Do we intend to participate in the talks that have been convened by outside countries towards eliminating the nuclear danger from the sea?  Is the Minister aware that the Irish sea has become a nuclear corridor and is being used by both super powers?  Do we intend to assist in setting up, through a combination of foreign policy positions and initiatives from the Department of the Marine, a monitoring and information system so that we will know what nuclear danger exists in the waters that are effectively ours?  Do we intend to stand back, say nothing and not participate at meetings and conventions called by other countries who aspire towards those aims?  If we do not intend to participate, what will be the basis for that decision?</P>
    <P>It has become a fashionable thing to say that Irish neutrality is somehow or other a vague word.  It reminds me of the heady days of the sixties when people used to speak about virginity as if it were going out of fashion.  Those of us in the Labour Party who speak about neutrality have always dealt with positive neutrality. Positive neutrality means that we build the mind of peace, of universal inter-dependence, that we teach people the basics of economic and political independence and of cultural pluralism in our schools.  That amounts to positive neutrality at home.  Externally we should use it as an informing principle of our relationships in the Community, the UN, the Council of Europe and in our talks with Latin America.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of Latin America and ask what will be the Minister's philosophy in the coming year in regard to the whole question of the renegotiation of the Latin American debt.  What position will we be taking in relation to the construction of aid, trade and debt relationships of Latin America as they open up next year?  Is there a <Col N="43" /> convergence between the Irish position under those three headings?  I do not want any vague answers.  I will do all the praying myself but I want answers on aid, trade and debt as they affect the Central and Latin American continent.  How does our position fit with that of our Community partners?</P>
    <P>What is the present position about Irish people abroad?  I should like the Minister to tell me if he finds it appropriate &mdash; he need not reply to this question in the House if he does not consider it appropriate &mdash; the position of Brian Keenan in Lebanon.  I am anxious to assist in this case but I do not wish to put any pressure on the Minister if he considers it would not be helpful to give information.</P>
    <P>With regard to Northern Ireland, it is very important that while use is made of such new institutional mechanisms that have been put in place through and following the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and the process which preceded it, we take cognisance of the developments that have taken place since the signing of the agreement. If we are to refer to Northern Ireland we must deal with specific measures to bring the two communities together.  Everybody knows that one of the consequences of the agreement's formal progress has been the polarisation within the Unionist community.  This is reflected almost every day in news reports from Northern Ireland.  What further measures are planned in regard to foreign policy?  What aspirations are in place towards addressing the understructure of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in terms of relations between the two communities?</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to increase our diplomatic presence in Central and Latin America?  Do we intend to have any representation in Central or Latin America? Do we intend to totally ignore the Latin American continent as a potential trading area in which the independence of our foreign policy has brought us a great deal of respect?  Following the San José meeting of the Council of Ministers during the Irish presidency there was an enormous <Col N="44" /> reverberation in Latin and Central American countries of respect for the automomy of Ireland's foreign policy.  I clearly remember a spillover from the term of office of former Senator Dooge as people were very anxious to trade with us.  What initiatives are we taking in regard to a whole continent that has, in the last ten years moved significantly towards a democratic transformation from dictatorship?</P>
    <P>From time to time there is a change in the climate of our foreign policy.  Sometimes we seem to be developing a competence and an enthusiasm for participation in the resolution of regional conflicts such as those in Central America. However, at other times, our enthusiasm wanes and these enthusiasms affect each other.  I remember well during the Anglo-Irish Agreement process that there seemed to be a certain limitation in our enthusiasm for making a more vigorous contribution towards the resolution of difficulties in Central America. The time has come for us to be forthright about what is taking place in Central America.  Hearings are taking place at present in the United States which show how people, including nuns, were murdered and raped on the borders of Nicaragua by armies who were illegally funded by hard mercenaries.  We know that people will now be charged in relation to all these things.  Has the time not come to call a spade a spade in relation to what is happening in Nicaragua? Can we not lend our voice unconditionally to say that we deplore the attempts to destabilise the elected Government of Nicaragua?  Members from all parties in the House participated in the electoral process in Nicaragua and printed their report which has not been denied by anyone in the House.  The time has come for us to speak out unequivocally in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have a little crib about the Single European Act.  I thought that the Supreme Court enjoyed the normal tolerance of the separation of powers.  I also thought that different aspects of foreign policy contained within the EPC were somehow affected by outside economic <Col N="45" /> considerations.  People got irritated about foreign policy aspects and they wanted to concentrate on the economic benefits. However, if you go down that road you will have no independent foreign policy. How could you?  I condemn the behaviour of either of the super-powers.  I do not want anyone standing up on their hind legs &mdash; as they do every now and again &mdash; asking if I protested about Afghanistan. I protest about the violation of human rights in any part of the world and about the invasions of freedoms.</P>

      <P>I will conclude shortly.  In all these issues, on which I have so inadequately touched, I made the case for the necessity of having a thorough debate in the autumn over two days on foreign policy.  I appeal to all parties in the House to support my proposals for the setting up of a foreign affairs committee.  I will accept any reasonable amendment from any party which will enable such a committee to be set up so that parliamentary accountability of a proper kind will be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to re-echo the points already made by a number of speakers that the time for debate on foreign affairs in this House is extremely limited.  I support Deputy Barry's call for a two-day debate on the issue in the autumn.  I recall that as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, indicated that he would try to provide an extended period of debate on this matter but that did not materialise for some reason.  However, I recognise his goodwill in that regard.  I urge the Minister to facilitate the House in Government time to debate all these issues in much more depth as 20 minutes does not allow anybody to deal to any extent with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the call made by Deputy Higgins for a foreign affairs committee of this House to be set up.  It seems extraordinary that an island of this size with <Col N="46" /> involvement in the United Nations, CSCE and the EC does not have a Dáil committee which would examine in detail the various aspects of the Government's policy in relation to our contacts with other countries and assisting in developing a coherent approach for this country internationally.</P>
    <P>I hope that the position of The Workers' Party in relation to international affairs has been made clear over the past number of weeks in the debate on the Single European Act.  In the debate and referendum, we sought a renegotiation of the Single European Act, not withdrawal from the EC, as some people indicated.  We were concerned that certain sections of the Single European Act, including Titles II and III, would have a serious effect on the economic and foreign affairs aspects of Irish life.  Those who voted overwhelmingly for the ratification of the Act accepted the assurances of the Government, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats that those fears were ill-founded. It must be made very clear that the decision was made on the basis of assurances that neutrality &mdash; in whatever way one cares to define it and I do not necessarily define it in the narrow terms the major parties in the House have done &mdash; is not at risk because of the ratification of the Single European Act, that every possible effort will be made to ensure that our economy will be in a position to compete by the year 1992 on the completion of the internal market of the 12 members of the EC.</P>
    <P>It has been made quite clear that that is the basis on which the people have accepted the Single European Act.  I accept that it is my obligation, and I hope every other Member in the House accepts that it is their obligation, to ensure that the people have not been misled and that those assurances are valid and kept to.  A detailed debate on foreign affairs on a regular basis and also the establishment of a committee on foreign affairs would enable Deputies of this House to monitor what is happening in the EC and other international fora, to monitor what is being said on our behalf and to be able <Col N="47" /> to have an input into what is being said on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening remarks outlined what he regarded as the consensus of opinion in relation to foreign affairs.  He outlined the general principles we should try to assert in the conduct of our foreign policy.  In reading through his speech I can find nothing in that regard with which I would disagree.  I do not think there is a Deputy in the House who would disagree with the principles he outlined which were as follows:</P>
    <P>Those look to a world at peace, and a world justly ordered, governed by law rather than force.  They reflect a preference for responsive democratic systems, such as we enjoy in our own country, over those which resort to despotism or coercion.  They set a high value on personal and religious freedoms, in contrast to those who regard such freedoms as secondary to other values.  They are coloured by our own experience as a people, striving for a recognised and worthy place for our country &ldquo;among the nations of the earth&rdquo; and sensitive to the plight of victims and the vulnerability of small nations the world over.</P>
    <P>No one could quibble with that as a general statement of what the views of the Irish people are.  They have demonstrated time and again through their generous response to appeals for support for people who are suffering as a result of either oppression or starvation that there is widespread support for those general principles.  However, it would be unreasonable to assume that there would be general acceptance of the position taken by the Government on every specific issue.  It is easy to agree on general principles but it is not so easy to agree on how those general principles ought to be implemented nor is it so easy to agree, for instance, on the points raised by Deputy Higgins in relation to Nicaragua.  I find it extraordinary that the Government do not demonstrate publicly their total horror &mdash; which I think is a view they <Col N="48" /> have &mdash; at what is happening to the democratically elected government of Nicaragua and at the way in which perhaps the most powerful state in the world, which prides itself on defending the free world, but which actively, through all kinds of devices, assists the Contras in their attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government of Nicaragua. In that respect that powerful state is acting illegally even within the terms of their own national law.</P>
    <P>I accept that the present Minister and the previous Minister, too, indicated in the House that they had made clear to the American Government their total abhorrence at that kind of activity but the people would be much more assured if that abhorrence was much more real and was demonstrated practically by the Government establishing diplomatic relations with the Government of Nicaragua. That would be a practical demonstration of one small country standing with another at its time of need.  Apart from the political consequences of what is going on in Nicaragua there are also the human consequences.  Starvation has resulted from the destruction of crops. The Contra rebels have destroyed villages and have carried out assaults and killings of local small farmers and other citizens of Nicaragua.  The Government should seek out ways in which we could assist Nicaragua in that regard also.</P>
    <P>Starvation in Mozambique has been referred to.  This starvation has resulted not from some natural catastrophy but from the interference of South Africa which has used groups either within or on the border of Mozambique to destabilise it.  There is an urgent need for the Government to be much more vociferous and open in their condemnation of these acts.  That would be a genuine demonstration of neutrality.  I would never agree with an interpretation of neutrality which obliged us to sit on the fence and to close our eyes to oppression, starvation or interference with small nations.  In the past we, too, have suffered from both interference and oppression.  We cannot be neutral in regard to injustices or <Col N="49" /> attacks on human rights or on the destabilisation of democratic states.</P>
    <P>Neutrality must mean the active pursuit of justice and principles such as those outlined in the Minister's speech.  In relation to neutrality I have argued that we should seek an association with the non-aligned movement.  The response I have received on numerous occasions was that the non-aligned movement is largely a non-European one and is comprised mostly of underdeveloped countries. That is true to a large extent.  But one factor which is significant is that the members of the non-aligned movement are all non-members of any military alliance.  Many speakers in this House and the spokesmen for the different parties have defined our neutrality as nonmembership of military alliances.  There are socialist countries, capitalist countries, progressive and reactionary governments and a wide range of types of societies involved in the non-aligned movement but what they are basically seeking to ensure is that they exert some pressure on the superpowers who are part of military alliances, on the Warsaw Pact and NATO countries to disarm and that they respect the sovereignty and independence of all nations.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; but I have <Col N="50" /> only a few minutes left in which to deal with many other matters.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  When that agreement was brought forward in this House it was supported by The Workers' Party but we made it clear at that time that we supported it with reservations, that we recognised that it was the only political initiative which was on the table at that time, that it contained hopeful signs that there would be moves towards a democratically devolved government in Northern Ireland, that perhaps there would be moves towards development of its economy and that a Bill of rights would be introduced.</P>
      <P>Any serious person looking at the development of the situation since the introduction of the Anglo-Irish Agreement cannot genuinely say that there has been progress on those fronts.  There has been discussion on the Flags and Emblems Act; it will be admitted that there was a failure to reform the Diplock Courts, and there has been discussion about the provison of street names in Irish and so forth.  They may well be important in their own way and probably are but I would argue very strongly &mdash; and I am sorry that the Minister made no reference at all to this fact &mdash; that there is an urgent need for a democratic, devolved government in Northern Ireland where the democratic, or, as some parties are described, constitutional parties would have an opportunity to run the affairs of Northern Ireland in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that there is an emphasis from the Government side and, indeed, from the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party here this morning, on using the Anglo-Irish Agreement solely in the interests of the Nationalist community.  The Minister stated that they would work closely with the Nationalist community but, of course, that they would listen to the Unionist community.  Deputy Barry urged that the Government should support all constitutional Nationalist parties who were seeking a reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  It is certainly odd for a Government and parties in this House <Col N="51" /> whose declared aim is reconciliation and unity, not only of the community in Northern Ireland but of the communities on the whole island of Ireland, to emphasise, almost to the exclusion of others, assisting and aiding solely the Nationalist community.  In saying that, I am not denying that there has been a long history of discrimination against the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland. However, it would be folly in the extreme to replace that with discrimination or the ignoring of the genuine fears and concerns of the Unionist section of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the Irish Government and the new Minister will take every opportunity to try to bring the democratic parties in Northern Ireland together, through the Anglo-Irish Agreement or any other means, for discussions on how devolved government can be established there.  It is only through that process and through the rule of law, implemented in an impartial way, that the paramilitaries can be made irrelevant and run out of business. The evidence over the years has shown that it is not possible to apply purely security solutions to the Northern Ireland situation.</P>
    <P>In the brief time available to me, I had many other points with which I wanted to deal, such as disarmament, peace-keeping and Lebanon, but I would particularly like to raise the question of the Irish soldiers who have died in Lebanon as a result of attacks from Israeli forces and the allies of the Israeli forces.  A special means should be found to honour those men.  I have raised the matter in the Dáil on Question Time but did not get a very satisfactory answer.  In view of the sacrifices that these men and their families have made a special means should be found to honour them and acknowledge the great service which Irish soldiers are giving to the Irish nation, enhancing its reputation as a peace-keeping and peace loving nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not specifically intend to deal with some of <Col N="52" /> the remarks that were made in that it is a matter for the Minister and I am sure that he will deal with these as comprehensively as the ten minutes he is allowed will permit him.</P>
      <P>The Government consider development co-operation to be an extremely important part of Irish foreign policy. The Government's commitment to developing countries reflects the traditional concern of the Irish people to cooperate with the people of developing countries who are much less well off than themselves.  Funds provided as Irish Official Development Assistance &mdash; whether channelled through international organisations such as the EC, the UN agencies and the World Bank Group, or spent directly through the Bilateral Aid Programme &mdash; are the main form of expressing the Irish public's concern for the interests of developing countries. This concern is also given direct practical expression through the very generous level of public contribution to voluntary agencies working in developing countries.</P>
      <P>Throughout the developed world there is a growing realisation that the problems faced in particular, by the least developed countries are extremely complex.  They require not only aid, whether through official or non-governmental channels, important though that is, but a coherently linked set of policies implemented at both national and international level to encourage development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland, with our close links with some of the least developed countries of Sub-Saharan Africa &mdash; three of our four priority countries fall into this category &mdash; have a keen appreciation of the importance of correct policies if development is to take off in these countries. Development aid by itself is not enough without a better environment for the exports of developing countries.  Depressed commodity markets mean that developing country commodity producers cannot earn enough to service their debts.  This is where the international community must adopt innovative and flexible approaches on the financing side, both private and official, <Col N="53" /> towards making debt burdens more manageable and towards restoring growth.</P>
    <P>National policies in these countries, of course, have a role to play also.  For example, Sub-Saharan Africa, with its high concentration of low-income countries, faces a particular challenge in the area of agricultural development.  To arrive at a situation in these countries where temporary drought conditions do not inevitably lead to famine and starvation will involve action by their governments to encourage food production and the provision of storage facilities.  The particular development problems of sub-Saharan Africa also call for a reassessment by the donor community.  In the course of 1986, attention was focused &mdash; in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee and elsewhere &mdash; on measures to co-ordinate and improve donor assistance in support of the difficult and painful economic restructuring programmes to which many African countries have committed themselves.  This reassessment has had implications for the pattern of aid provided by some major donors.  It has, for example, resulted in increased emphasis on participation in co-financing arrangements in support of large-scale sectoral adjustment programmes and increased willingness to finance, on a temporary basis, the recurrent and local cost elements of projects, in recognition of the particularly heavy adjustment burdens at present being borne by these countries.</P>
    <P>These issues, resources for development &mdash; both domestic and external &mdash; international trade and commodities, will be discussed at the Seventh Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development &mdash; UNCTAD &mdash; in July of this year.  This will provide an opportunity to developing and developed countries to examine together the global issues of interdependence which must be addressed if a more secure economic future is to be assured to people in every country, including our own.  Ireland is particularly concerned that UNCTAD should be successful and to this end we are working, with the other member <Col N="54" /> states of the European Community, to ensure a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>As we in Ireland face the very difficult decisions required to deal with our economic and financial problems, it is perhaps easy for us to forget that we are relatively well off and that most Third World countries would be glad to swap our economic problems for their own.  Figures do not adequately convey the differences in standard of living and wellbeing because it is very hard for us who had a <i>per capita</i> income of nearly $5,000 in 1984 to visualise what life must be like on an income of $250 which was the average <i>per capita</i> income in the less developed countries in the same year.  We have a basic obligation to help those who are so very much less fortunate than ourselves.</P>
    <P>In framing the 1987 budget &mdash; and this was referred to by Deputy Higgins and Deputy Barry &mdash; every effort was made to maintain progress towards the target of 0.7 of GNP for Overseas Development Aid fund.  However, this was not possible in view of the current budgetary and economic difficulties which have required the Government to seriously cut back public expenditure.  As indicated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House recently we maintain our commitment to reaching the target as soon as economic circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of development aid is humanitarian and it is vitally important that aid projects genuinely and effectively contribute to the development of the peoples of the Third World.  It is not enough to set up a factory or a school and to take over a farm and run it with expatriates; real development involves developing the people, their self-reliance and their capacity to take up the challenge of maintaining progress made with expatriate help, and of sustaining further development.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland can make a very distinctive contribution since we have so recently come through the development process and have long established links with developing countries, in particular in Africa.  Our bilateral aid programme provides a focus for our efforts.  I am very conscious of the high level of competence <Col N="55" /> and dedication of many of the Irish agencies and individuals who have engaged in development work.  I am proud of what such Irish people have achieved for the people they work with.  However, the process of development co-operation is a two way process.  Not only is the work of benefit to developing countries but it is also of benefit to the organisations and individuals involved who engage in challenging employment, developing their knowledge of a new environment and their capacities to resolve problems within it.  It is of benefit to Ireland generally in terms of economic activity generated and in expanding our perspectives and understanding of developing countries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the quality of Irish development work is recognised abroad, in particular, by the multilateral aid organisations who have engaged Irish organisations and individuals for their development projects.  In this connection I note, for example, that to end 1986 contracts valued at nearly IR£16 million obtained by Irish firms had been financed by the Fifth European Development Fund.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific allocation for bilateral aid, the Minister has already given an indication of the geographical distribution of the bilateral aid fund, for which IR£14 million has been allocated in 1987.  I wish to note some aspects of the sectoral distribution of expenditure. In the four priority countries &mdash; Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia &mdash; 31 per cent was spent on rural development, 24 per cent on education and training, 23 per cent on agriculture, 8 per cent on industrial projects, 7 per cent on infrastructure and 6 per cent on health.  This breakdown indicates a concentration on the sectors where Ireland has traditional strengths and where we have most to offer to developing countries.  The sectoral distribution also indicates that much of Ireland's aid is getting to the poorer populations in the countries we are assisting.</P>
    <P>The range of projects financed or cofinanced with other agencies under the <Col N="56" /> BAP is very wide and I will mention just a few of them.  A major element in our 1987 programme in Sudan is the expanded programme of immunisation project in the central region which is part of a major health programme funded mainly by UNICEF and other large donors.  It aims to reduce the high mortality rate among young children by immunising them against the common diseases &mdash; measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria.  Immunisation is to be extended from less than 10 per cent of children under five in 1985 to 90 per cent by 1989.</P>
    <P>In Zambia, our 1987 projects include continuing technical assistance to several important organisations, for example, to Chilanga Cement, the sole cement producer in Zambia.  With the assistance of a team from Irish Cement, Chilanga Cement have become exporters to neighbouring African countries as well as meeting Zambia's requirements; to ZADL, a major State farm enterprise which is just returning to profitability and which has sought continued Irish technical assistance; to the export board of Zambia to which CTT are providing assistance and to Zambia public administration where the Institute of Public Administration is involved in a major training project set up under the auspices of the World Bank &mdash; International Development Association.</P>
    <P>We have a significant involvement in the development of accountancy skills in several countries, in particular, in Lesotho and Zambia.  These are important skills in terms of fostering self-reliance, for a capacity to manage money is a vital element in managing any economic, and indeed any social, undertaking.</P>
    <P>Bilateral aid projects such as those I have outlined above account for 72 per cent of the 1987 allocation for the bilateral aid fund.  Another major element is the scheme of co-financing with non-governmental organisations under which assistance is provided towards the cost of development work carried out by such bodies.  A sum of IR£1.75 million has been allocated for the purpose in 1987.</P>
    <P>Irish non-governmental organisations <Col N="57" /> have a network of personnel which gives them an impressive capacity to implement projects at village level in the health, education and agriculture sectors. They are backed up by a high level of commitment among the public in Ireland. The close co-operation that exists between the official aid programme and that of non-governmental organisations interested greatly the OECD Development Assistance Committee in their review of Irish aid last year.  The committee noted that the contributions to development aid as a whole of Irish non-governmental organisations, expressed as a proportion of GNP, are the highest among Development Assistance Committee member countries.  I should, therefore, like to take this opportunity to express my own, and the Government's, appreciation of their tremendous efforts. I am sure the House will join with me in this tribute.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to another subhead, that of disaster relief; for which an allocation of IR£0.50 million has been made this year.  To date in 1987, the tragedy in Mozambique &mdash; and this was specifically mentioned by many Deputies, including Deputy Higgins and Deputy De Rossa &mdash; where man-made problems of war and displacement have combined with poor weather to cause famine and misery, has drawn a substantial allocation &mdash; IR£90,000, of which 44 per cent has been channelled through NGOs and 56 per cent through UN agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to increase this figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be kept under review.  Two allocations have been made already this year.  I want to refer to Deputy Higgins' contribution.  He may not have turned over to the page of the Minister's speech where he said that South Africa in its 1984 agreement with Mozambique committed itself to end its support for this group and where he said there must be grave doubts whether it is abiding by this undertaking.  In reply to questions raised by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Griffin in May, the Minister <Col N="58" /> outlined the Government's concern in relation to what is happening in Mozambique. I share fully the Deputy's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My quibble was with the phrase &ldquo;civil strife&rdquo;.  It is not a civil strife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  A further £20,000 was allocated to the victims of the earthquake in Equador.  I cannot indicate the pattern of future allocations from the disaster relief fund in 1987, but the House may be interested to know that over 80 per cent of the 1986 disaster relief fund was allocated to Africa and that of that amount over 70 per cent was allocated to the Sudan and Ethiopia.  The organisations receiving the largest amounts of the assistance were GOAL, Trocaire and Concern.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas provides funding for development workers, those sent abroad by its partner agencies and those managed directly by itself.  It also provides training for intending development workers and has created an extensive resource centre on developing countries and development work.  It maintains a register of persons willing to go abroad to work on the development projects which it sponsors.  The 1987 allocation is IR£2.4 million.</P>
      <P>Allocations are also being made to ACDC the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation of IR£110,000, to Gorta of IR£60,000 and to the Refuge Resettlement Committtee of IR£75,000 in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development work can be difficult and necessarily takes place a long way from home: yet individuals and organisations who have been willing to take up these challenges have found their work exciting and rewarding.  I would like to encourage more people to consider becoming involved.  For some, this involvement may take the form of volunteer work, particularly for those who have skills to impart but relatively little relevant work experience: for others already well established on a professional career it may take the form of a semi-professional or professional assignment.  For firms in the <Col N="59" /> private, as well as in the public sector, there is a development market of which Irish Aid funds only a very small part, a market for high quality and specially tailored services and goods which contribute effectively to development in the fields of education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, industry, etc.</P>
    <P>The problems of developing countries are major, complex and diverse and we try to provide a balanced response within the funds available along the spectrum from immediate disaster relief to the long term commercial and social development projects which are vital to developing countries' efforts to overcome their vulnerability to famine, disease and the displacement of peoples.  Specific questions raised by various Deputies will be dealt with by the Minister when he replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy Peter Barry and other Members on this side of the House in urging that we have a two day debate on foreign policy, perhaps in the autumn.  It is totally impossible to encapsulate in 20 minutes the views and statements of Members who wish to contribute.  The contributions of Members, especially the contribution of Deputy Peter Barry a former Minister for Foreign Affairs who successfully negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Single European Act, the Dublin Plan and many other fine achievements for Ireland, will be of value to the present Minister.  The Minister would be enriched from having listened to our views and would be able to produce a fuller foreign policy which would be acceptable to all Members of the House.</P>
      <P>In the limited time I have I will concentrate on development assistance.  As junior spokesman for Foreign Affairs in the Fine Gael Party I have a responsibility in that area.  The Minister in his statement said in relation to development assistance:</P>
      <P>The plight of what has been called the Third World is one which occupies a very special place in the foreign policy preoccupations of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I agree with that statement but regrettably their plight does not have a special place in the foreign policy preoccupations of the present Fianna Fáil Government.  If it had they would not have cut back the ODA in this year's allocation.  I am making this point on behalf of the people who made complaints and who were disillusioned and disappointed at the cutbacks in what the Government felt was already a very meagre contribution.  The cutbacks are in direct conflict with the previous Government's programme, <i>Building on Reality,</i> of November 1984.  In a period of four years they intended in an orderly and committed fashion to raise the Irish ODA contribution to the target set out by the UN, 0.7 per cent of GNP.  In 1986 £43.3 million was allocated in our budget and this year that was increased to £44.4 million or 0.26 per cent of GNP but in the Fianna Fáil budget the figure has been reduced by £1.1 million back to 0.25 per cent of GNP.  That is the second time in the last 15 years under a Fianna Fáil Government that in real terms as a percentage of GNP there has been a severe cutback.  I would have thought that despite the cutbacks which affect the country, including my native town of Tipperary where the local District Hospital has been closed, at least the projects in the Third World would have escaped the Scrooge-like tentacles of the present Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs. Unfortunately that is not the case. Nothing is sacrosanct.  Indeed the most vulernable people, the helpless people of the Third World, have to suffer as a consequence of the cutbacks.  I hope that the very fine projects will not suffer as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Only four countries have reached the UN percentage optimum figure.  Norway leads with 1.03 per cent, the Netherlands second with 0.91 per cent, Sweden third with 0.86 per cent and Denmark fourth with 0.80 per cent of gross national product. Other countries have indicated that in time they hope to attain the figure of 0.75 per cent of GNP.  There is a public <Col N="61" /> commitment in Ireland to give this assistance, so the Government have the support of all right thinking people, as was very much in evidence two years ago in the Band Aid and Live Aid contributions the people made when it was brought home forcibly to them on TV night after night by Bob Geldof and others that the Ethiopian people in particular were in need.  I am glad to note what has been remarked here often, that the Irish people contributed more <i>per capita</i> to the relief of the Ethiopian famine, drought and disaster than any other people.</P>
    <P>We should not let go unnoticed or unheralded the great contribution our priests, nuns, brothers and lay people of all denominations make to the Third World.  It is not for them just an afternoon's or one day's contribution.  They have devoted their lives to the welfare of the least well off sections especially in sub-Saharan Africa.  I suppose it is a throwback to our famine days here.  We have an empathy with these people, having ourselves suffered over 100 years ago in the great famine.  We have a subconscious sympathy for others who suffer in the same way and doubtless that is one reason for the very generous public response in giving towards the relief of the Ethopian crisis on that occasion. Recently in America a poll was taken to find who was the most admired lady in that land.  Mother Teresa of Calcutta topped the poll.  Ahead of all the others in the world of Hollywood, &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dynasty&rdquo; and so on Mother Teresa was selected by the American people as the woman they admired most.  It is reassuring that deep down people have an admiration for those who have a commitment to the underprivileged, the deprived and the less well off.  On that basis the Irish Government, and all governments, could give maximum support for this type of aid.</P>
    <P>I have here the ODA report for 1985. I understand the 1986 report is in print and will be available very shortly.  It is regrettable it is not available for this Estimate discussion today.  As the Minister informed the House, the ODA programme is made up of two elements, <Col N="62" /> multilateral and bilateral.  I am pleased to learn that the administrative costs take up only a tiny proportion of total costs; in 1985 they were 1.4 per cent of the total.  Multilateral contributions are by way of mandatory contributions to the EC, the UN, the World Bank and the OECD.  I am not convinced that any of these organisations have a commitment to resolve the problems of the less developed countries.  If they had we would not have the scandal of surplus food.  While the world produces more food than it can consume today, 700 million people suffer from malnutrition because they have not enough food.  Coupled with that, vast amounts of money are spent on armaments, Star Wars and nuclear deterrents.</P>
    <P>In America land is deliberately taken out of production in order to keep down stockpiles and, I suppose, to keep up the cost of food.  The surpluses in EC stocks include 1.4 million tonnes of butter, 1.3 million tonnes of skimmed milk powder, about 0.5 million tonnes of beef, 16 million tonnes of cereals and 33 million hectolitres of wine, not to mention other products like sugar and tobacco.  Those figures refer only to the EC.  The figures for America are equally staggering and scandalising.  Here we have on the one hand stockpiling of foods and on the other hand millions of people dying in Ethopia, Mozambique and other nations.</P>
    <P>The second element of the ODA is bilateral aid.  Again we have a commitment to four priority countries, Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and the Sudan, and other countries not on the priority list get contributions.  I am thinking of Burundi, China, Ethopia, Gambia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Zimbabwe.  In that 1985 report on assistance to developing countries I am pleased to note the very practical type of assistance being given to each of these countries.  As the Minister of State said, they are areas where Irish people are most experienced.  The Hololo Valley project is the principal agricultural project in the Lesotho programme.  In the area of health a laboratory training programme has been set up; in industry <Col N="63" /> there is a hand knitting project, and there are educational projects.  In Tanzania there is the Kilosa dairy farm, water supply, electrical installations and rural projects.</P>
    <P>Our country was under-developed in the last century and working on that raw experience we can bring the peoples of these countries along step-by-step because we as a nation trod the road they travel now.  I could not but be impressed by the variety and choice of projects that assistance to developing countries embraces.  I hope all these projects, which are based on the indigenous workers and on the facilities available to them, will leave behind them a skilled workforce who will be able to take over and to provide a ready supply of food and so on.  Let me paraphrase a proverb: if you give a man a fish you feed him for one day but if you teach him how to fish you feed him for life.  That should be the spirit behind these projects.  It will get the people themselves, the indigenous workers, to undertake these projects so that after a while they will be able to fend for themselves.  Then the expert volunteers can move on to other areas rather than remain there thus preventing the locals from taking complete charge and being responsible for their own destiny.</P>
    <P>I was not aware of the magnificent work being done by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  In 1985 they assigned 569 people to various projects throughout the developing world.  The report I have referred to contains a wealth of information.  It breaks down the various services under the headings of countries and it refers to agencies like Concern, UN volunteers, the Holy Ghost Fathers and the Mill Hill Missionaries, item by item, and every £1 spent is accounted for.  It tells how the payments are made sector by sector and gives details of all assignments and of the various groups.  Like the Minister of State, I would like to encourage graduates and young people who at present find themselves unemployed &mdash; not for that reason alone but for a loftier motive &mdash; to consider giving perhaps two years of their <Col N="64" /> lives to work in underdeveloped countries. I could not think of anything better for a young man or woman on the threshold of life to do than to give two years to the less privileged and less well off people and to share their skills and experience with them.  I would hope that young graduates and others would be encouraged to join APSO, giving the benefit of their education, experience and strength in the building up of these countries in less-well-off areas.</P>
    <P>I regret that there is a cut-back in the Disaster Relief Fund this year.  Last year £1.275 million was provided for this fund but this year the figure has been reduced to £0.5 million.  Like other Members I would bring to the Minister's attention the matter of famine relief in Mozambique. I am not concerned whether it has risen as a consequence of civil or other strife.  If a Mozambique person is dying he or she is not concerned whether that has been brought about by way of civil strife or other disaster.  We are told that at present there are 4.5 million people in danger of dying there through malnutrition, which situation I believe has been compounded by the destruction of their roads and rail network.  I would plead with the Minister to increase his allocation this year.  I understand that already he has given approximately £90,000 to the relief of famine in Mozambique. Hopefully there will be no other disaster between now and the end of the year.  I do appreciate that the Minister must keep some funds in reserve in the event of another calamity or disaster. The call has rung out from the United Nations, urging the establishment of a relief fund of £209 million.  I would urge our Minister and the Minister of State who is present to think of increasing their allocation.  This is one obvious area where relief is urgently needed.  It will be pointless if such relief is given too late &mdash; for example, if the Minister were to find at the end of the year that there is a surplus in that fund which could have been allocated. Now is the moment to give it to Mozambique where it is so pitifully needed.</P>
    <P>In passing I should like to pay tribute <Col N="65" /> to the splendid Irish organisations working on behalf of the Third World, organisations such as Trocaire, Concern, GOAL, Viatores Christi, Gorta, Christian Aid, the Irish Missionary union, the Methodist Mission, the Church of Ireland Bishops Appeal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am conscious that, at this stage, I am eroding the Minister's time for reply but, as he has such a limited time in any event, I suppose it does not make a great difference.  Indeed the House will have to look at this form of truncated Estimates debate because it is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intervene to touch on one point in the Minister's speech, that is when he spoke of the problems of the Middle East, by which we understand, the problems of Palestine, Israel and the unresolved difficulties there.  There is no doubt but that is the single greatest source and <Col N="66" /> cause of unrest in the world today.  It is the direct contributor to the greatest part of international terrorism.  It has been a festering sore on the international scene now for too long.  Happily there are indications that significant political developments might take place in the near future.</P>
    <P>The position of the Community is well known having been established by the Venice Declaration of 1980 which recognised that the integrity of Israel has to be protected but, at the same time, the resolution of the question of a homeland for the Palestinian people also has to be solved.  The principles of that declaration were reiterated as recently as February last by a joint declaration from Brussels. We are aware that in Israel itself there are moves which indicate a considerable amount of internal support for a new initiative to be taken under the auspices of the United Nations, in particular under the auspices of the Security Council, for an international conference of all the parties involved in that problem.  Of course all the parties must include the Palestine Liberation Organisation.  Whether we like it or not they are the only people representing the dispossed Palestinians. Some formula to permit their presence at the peace conference will have to be devised because a conference without a real presence of that element would not be a real conference.</P>
    <P>I intervene to ask the Minister to use his seat in the Council of Twelve Ministers, particularly now in the context of Title III of the Single European Act with the advancement towards greater political co-operation, to take advantage of that new position within the Community to push the Community to re-establish the initiative it took with the Venice Declaration of 1980.  The Minister might use his good offices to push the Community to play its part.  It can play a very significant part because of its historic links and close geographic relationship with the Middle East and its independence from the two superpower interests in the Middle East, the Soviet and American presence which, of course, compounds the difficulty in the area.  I would suggest to the Minister that he use his position <Col N="67" /> now to ensure that the Community do what it can to increase the momentum which has been established towards this international peace conference.  As I have said, it is the single greatest source of unrest in the world today on a global scale.  The Middle East problem is the root and cause of the greater part of international terrorism.  There is no more urgent problem today.  We are now in a position to play a significant part, through the Community, in ensuring that the tentative moves which have begun to emerge for an international conference are brought to fruition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for a very good debate within the constraints of the time available.  In that context I intend to have discussions initiated between the Whips with a a view to having a fuller debate, as was suggested by Deputy Barry, on the resumption of the Dáil in the autumn.  Deputy Barry suggested a two day debate on foreign affairs.  I agree with the general tenor of his remarks, that we should have fuller and more informed debate on foreign affairs generally.  That struck me very much during the recent referendum campaign. Greater information should be made available to the public on our involvement within the EC and in regard to foreign affairs generally.  Deputy Higgins' suggestion in regard to a foreign affairs committee will be considered by the Whips in the context of the general structuring of the committee system for the new Dáil session.  I understand it is one of the matters under discussion between them.  I have absolutely no objection to the establishment of such a committee.  It is a matter for the Whips to discuss and decide how best we can organise our business to meet the exigencies of such a committee.  Certainly, I will be recommending strongly that we have a full debate on foreign affairs in the autumn session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point I might take up was raised also by Deputy Higgins, that is the question of our general approach to <Col N="68" /> foreign affairs.  Deputy Cooney referred to it in regard to the Middle East and Deputy Higgins referred to it to a greater degree in regard to Latin America.  I find that we can exercise the greatest possible influence in these areas through the political co-operation system now written into Title III of the Single European Act, in conjunction with the other member states of the European Communities. When we seek to achieve what I believe is a consensus view in this House on areas such as the Middle East and Latin America, through the European Communities, we carry far greater strength.  When the Communities as a whole adopt a progressive and open democratic attitude that counts for real strength.  It is in that way you can exercise your shared sovereignty to the fullest extent possible. The European Communities as a whole are induced or persuaded by Irish influence to take a stance on the Middle East, Latin America or South Africa.  In regard to those three areas the Communities' stance is the same as the Irish stance and that means something real.  There is no point in talking to ourselves.  When a large percentage of the people agree with our point of view and when it is accepted in a community of nations like the European Communities, that is a positive step as far as Ireland and other countries, be they Central America, South America, the Middle East or South Africa, are concerned.  Those areas are among the contentious areas of the world in which the Communities have taken an advanced position that approximates to Ireland's position.  We should always remember that aspect and think very clearly on it.  It is realistic in regard to an assessment of what sort of role we can play in regard to foreign policy through the political co-operation aspects now to be formalised and codified in Title III of the Single European Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be led down that road.  Deputy Kennedy talked about the priorities in regard to the <Col N="69" /> Anglo-Irish Conference.  I set out those priorities in my initial speech.  We want progress on the social aspects in regard to fair employment in particular.  We want a fair employment Act that has real teeth. The British promised a White Paper before the end of the year on that aspect, to be followed by legislation that will extend and strengthen the present innocuous provisions of the Fair Employment Act in all aspects of employment in Northern Ireland, not just to the Civil Service but to local authorities, State agencies and private employers to ensure that there will be substantial sanctions for non-observance of fair employment practices.  We should consider that area at present.</P>
      <P>The second aspect relates to law and order and the administration of justice. A code of conduct as far as the RUC are concerned is very important to ensure that there is a basic code observed by them.  That would give some reassurance to the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland in particular.  The third aspect relates to economic co-operation for which there is obvious scope.  The international fund can be helpful in that regard.  I agree with Deputy Barry in that the cycle of violence is such that it behoves the security forces in Northern Ireland to observe an attitude that commands respect in regard to their behaviour in the enforcement of law and order. We debated this matter recently on Deputy Barry's Private Notice Question. If we are going to advocate a more just, equitable and fair society in Northern Ireland, which is the kernel of our argument, then the forces of the State must be seen to act in practical terms in a fair and equitable manner that shows respect for the law on their part as well as that which is required from citizens generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry also mentioned the point about the South Korean Embassy here. While there is not reciprocity &mdash; he is right in that regard &mdash; it is important to have that embassy here because South Korea is an expanding country with investment interests in the European Communities and with a very positive investment interest in establishing <Col N="70" /> locations for industrial expansion within Ireland so as to obtain entry to the European Communities.  The amount of third country interest in Ireland as a location base for investment will rapidly increase now that we have agreed to ratify the Single European Act.  It is countries such as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the United States, to mention four outside the Communities with surplus funds available, who will be anxious to join the Communities to expand their export industries and we can benefit substantially in that respect.  It is an area in which we should move quickly from the investment point of view.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL have been mentioned and as far as they and other peace-keeping operations are concerned the Irish Army have played a very honourable role which is highly regarded.  We can be proud of their motivation and the standing in which they are held.  I raised the recent incidents mentioned by Deputy Kennedy with the Israeli Ambassador as recently as last week.</P>
    <P>Mozambique and the development aid to that country were also mentioned. Recently we gave £40,000 from the disaster relief fund to Mozambique.  The situation in that country is very serious. We will not be found wanting in regard to further contributions to Mozambique from the disaster fund.  I agree, and Deputy Griffin was critical in this regard, that as far as the overall development aid aspect is concerned &mdash; and I will be frank &mdash; we are not giving as much aid in that area as I would like to see given.  I can assure the Deputy that that is due entirely to the budgetary constraints of which we are all aware.  We will try through the agencies and through our participation within the Community to enhance our contribution to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a tribute to APSO who are doing a tremendous job.  The degree of commitment and the personal contribution by the people involved in providing services through this organisation are in the best tradition of Ireland's contribution to Third World activity.  While our financial contribution might not be as <Col N="71" /> high as we would wish, our expenditure in terms of manpower is substantial and in the best traditions of Ireland's contribution particularly to Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £260,270,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the <Col N="72" /> 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1987 is for a net sum of £260,270,000.  This a reduction of £2.6 million or 1 per cent on the corresponding outturn figure of £262,870,000 for 1986. The gross provision in the 1987 Estimate is £269,140,000.</P>
    <P>The major part of the 1987 Estimate &mdash; 78 per cent or £203,182,000 &mdash; provides for pay and allowances and this represents an increase of £7,655,000 on the outturn for 1986.  The non-pay items amount to £65,958,000; the comparable 1986 figure was £76,785,000 but it included exceptional expenditure amounting to £13,850,000 on helicopter purchases.  The 1987 provision of £8,870,000 for Appropriation-in-Aid shows a decrease of £572,000 on the 1986 outturn.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is based on an average strength of 1,610 officers, 60 cadets and 11,900 other ranks &mdash; a total of 13,570 in the Permanent Defence Force.  The average strengths for 1986 were 1,565 officers, 53 cadets and 12,362 other ranks.</P>
    <P>Before I make any detailed comment in relation to the Estimate I should perhaps put on record again the fact that the Defence Forces serve the State in many ways beyond their primary role of defence against external aggression. Indeed, we look to them to carry out a wide range of duties to help to create a secure stable environment, to provide a final bulwark in times of emergency and to add their own element of lustre to the life of the nation.  They are there at all times to render service necessary in carrying out their statutory role of aiding the civil power.  They add to our international status as they serve the cause of peace as contingents of the United Nations.  They support on request the regular emergency services and their skill and value in such <Col N="73" /> areas as search and rescue and air ambulance missions are widely acknowledged. They are prominent too in the effort to preserve and develop the country's marine and coastal resources as they carry out their assigned fishery protection and marine oil pollution response roles.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the assigned task in relation to internal security matters continues to be a dominant role.  While the Garda Síochána have primary responsibility in this regard, the Defence Forces have a vital supporting part to play.  The present security situation, especially in the Border areas, necessitates the deployment of Army personnel and resources on a large scale to assist the Garda Síochána in the maintenance of the rule of law.</P>
    <P>The necessary preoccupation with internal security imposes a heavy burden on the personnel of the Defence Forces. The following particulars of the main security tasks undertaken in the 12 months up to March 1987 will give some idea of the level of demand on them in this area: about 11,000 military parties were supplied in Border areas for checkpoint duties and over 12,000 joint Garda/Army checkpoints were set up; more than 10,000 patrols were sent out into the road network along the Border; escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on about 1,000 occasions; over 3,000 escorts for the movement of cash were provided; and over 200 requests for bomb disposal teams were handled.  The Army also provide guards for the movement of prisoners and assist in searches for arms, ammunition and explosives.  In addition, certain vital non-military installations are protected either by permanent military guards or by military patrols.</P>
    <P>When the country is facing economic difficulties and when, because of the scarcity of financial resources, many drastic economies over a wide area have to be made, it is sad that we should be obliged to commit such a substantial amount of defence expenditure in this direction.  However, such a commitment is essential to the stability and security of the country and it is a commitment to <Col N="74" /> which the Government will continue to give top priority.  This is the price which has to be paid to maintain our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>A rather similar role which is again worthy of special mention is the service rendered abroad by the Irish Defence Forces in the cause of international peace.  Deputies will be well aware that our forces have a proud and honourable record in carrying out a number of United Nations peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <P>At the present time, an Irish contingent of about 745 all ranks is serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &mdash; UNIFIL.  Eight members of the Permanent Defence Force are serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus and 21 Irish officers are serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation &mdash; UNTSO &mdash; in the Middle East.  Through their dedication and selfless efforts in the cause of peace, these troops and other military personnel who have served the State overseas have brought credit to the Defence Forces and to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been well demonstrated that our troops have the necessary attributes to make a success of the difficult task of peacekeeping.  The personality of the peacekeeping soldier is of the utmost importance in fulfilling his role and he must show qualities of understanding, tact and firmness.  The key to successful peacekeeping is impartiality coupled with adaptation to the cultural background of the groups encountered in the peace-keeping areas.  It is fair to say that in this respect Irish soldiers have not been surpassed.</P>
    <P>Personnel selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection at times of stress and tension.  In recent times troops of the Irish contingent serving with UNIFIL have been required to operate in difficult and often tense situations.  Incidents involving firing at Irish troops or their positions, and other events such as confrontations at check-points, have <Col N="75" /> occurred.  All such incidents are protested about locally to the parties involved in the conflict and are also the subject of vigorous protests as necessary at diplomatic level.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties which it has faced, UNIFIL remains an element for stability in south Lebanon.  It plays a large part in protecting the local population from the activities of the Israeli forces and the so-called South Lebanon Army. Its presence is welcomed both by the local population and by the Lebanese Government.  Since first participating in UNIFIL, Irish troops have worked for the benefit of the local people and they have contributed much to restoring peace and normality in their area of operations.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret that since August 1986 the unstable situation and the harassment of our troops has resulted in the deaths of three Irish personnel.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute again to all those who have made the supreme sacrifice in pursuing the ideals of peace.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Defence, I am particularly concerned about the safety and welfare of our troops in Lebanon and these matters are kept under constant review.  I intend in the very near future to visit personnel of the Defence Forces serving in the Middle East and Lebanon to see for myself the conditions under which they are required to operate.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that Lieutenant-General Callaghan, who served for over five years as Force Commander, UNIFIL, will be retiring next month from his present appointment as Chief of Staff, UNTSO.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to him for his distinguished service at home and abroad and to wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    <P>The nation as a whole should take pride in the achievements of the Defence Forces over the years in peacekeeping operations.  The international recognition which we have won as peacekeepers has enhanced Ireland's ability to speak out independently in the various matters of foreign policy and international affairs <Col N="76" /> which concern us.  For the wide range of duties which they perform, often in tedious and dangerous circumstances, the officers and men of the Defence Forces are indeed deserving of our gratitude. Their high standard of service which is given so willingly to the community is in the best traditions of the Defence Forces.  They, together with the Garda Síochána, who act in defence of our institutions and basic freedoms, are entitled to our full support and commendations. People on a nine-to-five job may not always remember that the duties which our security forces perform often entail long absences from home and inevitably cause a disruption to family life.  I am well aware of the support and encouragement given by the families of security personnel and they also deserve our gratitude and appreciation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific matters which merit some comment and I should now like to advert to these items.  I have already given a general picture of current strengths and commitments.  The question of an intake of recruits later this year will be examined in the context of the general financial constraints and the overall budgetary situation.  The overriding consideration, however, is the adequacy of numbers to meet requirements and this will continue to be the guiding principle.</P>
    <P>The pay and conditions of service generally of members of the Defence Forces continue to be maintained at a reasonable level.  The Government are concerned to ensure that the remuneration of the Defence Forces keeps pace with that of other sectors of the public service.  The starting pay of a recruit is now almost £130 per week.  After about 14 weeks' basic training it rises to £150.  On advancement to private three star, gross pay rises to over £155, while after three years' service, the gross pay of a private is over £170.  I am sure that the House will agree that these rates of pay are reasonable.</P>
    <P>Allowances are payable to officers and men who perform duties of a security nature.  The rates of these allowances are kept constantly under review to ensure <Col N="77" /> that personnel are adequately compensated for the duties which they are required to undertake.  These allowances were increased by 3 per cent with effect from 1 January 1987.  The current rates of allowances for service in the Border areas are £21.91 per week for officers and £19.04 per week for men, while the allowances for other duties in aid of the civil power such as guard duties on vital installations, cash escorts and prisoner escorts were increased to £9.33 for each week-day and £18.66 for each Sunday or Army holiday.</P>
    <P>Education and training in the Defence Forces are very important.  At present there are 86 officers attending full time at university and similar institutions.  In addition, members of the Permanent Defence Force who attend educational courses in their own time may be recouped costs of tuition and examinations.  In association with AnCO there is a scheme whereby apprentices may be qualified in various trades.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army and Air Corps were held in 1986 and 44 cadetships, including four to female personnel were awarded. The question of further competitions for 1987 is at present being examined.  Last year 59 apprenticeships in the Army Apprentice School, Naas, and the Air Corps Apprentice School, Baldonnel, were awarded.</P>
    <P>Seventeen non-commissioned officers are at present attending a potential officers' course.  The course, which is of nine months' duration, will finish in June 1987 and the successful participants will be commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>As regards the FCA and Slua Muirí, I regret that it has again been found necessary to reduce annual training by seven days.  The reduction continues to be necessary as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure.  The saving involved is substantial, being almost £2 million.  Notwithstanding the reduced period, however, it has again been decided that the gratuity payable to qualified members of the Reserve who <Col N="78" /> complete the maximum permissible period in 1987 will be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance at training for the shorter period.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out their various roles, the estimate provides almost £66 millions for non-pay including the maintenance and improvement of equipment.  The programme of improvements will continue within the financial constraints necessarily imposed on all Government spending.  Some modern equipment will be purchased this year and in this connection I wish to say that the replacement of the 7.62 mm FN Rifle, which has been used by the Defence Forces over the past 25 years is under consideration.  A number of weapons have been undergoing evaluation by the military authorities and this process is expected to be concluded over the next few months.  It is hoped it will be possible to place a contract for an initial supply of a new weapon before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>All the new Dauphin helicopters have now been delivered and will be fully operational by the autumn.  At present, a programme of familiarisation and training for personnel is nearing completion.  The helicopters have already carried out a number of operations and when fully operational they will increase the capability of the Air Corps to fly in bad weather and over water and to provide improved search and rescue, and air ambulance services.</P>
    <P>There is a continuous programme of improving uniform components in the light of modern developments.  For instance, a new style working dress, composed of tunic and trousers or, alternatively, sweater and trousers, will be worn by personnel engaged in general duties thus reserving the service tunic and trousers for ceremonial parades and more formal occasions.  In addition, a new style waterproof tunic and trousers, together with a field cap, will be worn over the combat uniform by personnel during periods of inclement weather.</P>
    <P>Provision of £9 million is made in subhead S of the Estimate for building and <Col N="79" /> engineering works as compared with last year's outturn of £8.8 million.  This includes a capital sum of £6 million for new buildings and major refurbishment works.  This provision will permit some improvements to be made in the accommodation and other facilities for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The proposed improvements include the construction of new billets; the building of new catering complexes; the development of recreational areas; the provision of new administrative and operational accommodation as well as the renovation and modernisation of existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>In recent years new billets with modern amenities have been built at a number of locations.  It is hoped to have contracts placed for further such billets at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, and Lifford Military Post, County Donegal in the near future.  Renovations of existing billets will continue to have a high priority.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding at present on the building of a catering complex at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  Site clearance works for a new barracks at Cavan and hangar refurbishment work at Baldonnel are also under way.  It is hoped to have a contract signed for the construction of the new Cavan barracks before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>A new cookhouse/dining hall has recently been provided at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, County Cork. Arrangements are being made for the provision of similar accommodation at other locations.  Major maintenance works such as reroofing and rewiring are also being undertaken.</P>
    <P>While new accommodation and facilities are required in various locations, particularly in Border areas, we may question the need for the continued retention of some of the older barracks and posts which were built for conditions totally different from those obtaining today.  The maintenance and operation of the older posts is expensive in manpower and money.  With a view to a possible rationalisation, I am having the whole area examined to see whether our present <Col N="80" /> dispositions are the most cost effective. It may well be that a number of locations can be designated as surplus to requirements.</P>
    <P>The Department have for a long time been involved in equitation through the Army Equitation School; 1986 was a successful year for the school and Army riders won prize money in excess of £32,000.</P>
    <P>Another special Departmental programme is the Asgard sail training scheme.  &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; completed a full programme of cruises during 1986 involving 527 trainees.  There was increased sponsorship of trainees during the year, including sponsorship by the probation and welfare service and the Youth Employment Agency.  Sponsorship helps young people who can derive most benefit from cruises on &ldquo;Asgard II&rdquo; but are least able to afford the fees.  This is something which Coiste An Asgard are most anxious to encourage.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the matter of civil defence.  Deputies will be aware that the civil defence organisation in Ireland is a very important element in our defence against the threat of war, particularly the threat of nuclear war. Civil defence is based on a volunteer force organised under the local authorities in all parts of the country.  Its elements consist of the warden, welfare, casualty, rescue and auxiliary fire services, and its purpose is to minimise the effects of war on the civilian population. It does, however, also provide considerable service to the population in peacetime, whether in the event of a nuclear accident abroad or a disaster at home.</P>
    <P>The provision of £1.75 million for civil defence in 1987 will facilitate the continuing development and improvement of this vital part of national defence measures. The Minister of State will go into this matter in more detail.</P>
    <P>Various other purchase programmes are being continued this year to cater for the needs of each civil defence service. An information package on civil defence will be made available to schools for the 1987-88 year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> It is only fitting that I should pay particular tribute to the many thousands of volunteers of the civil defence organisation throughout the country who give so generously of their time and effort in the service of the community.  We are very much indebted to all our volunteers for this generosity.  I would like also to extend this tribute to all members of the voluntary aid societies affiliated to civil defence.</P>
    <P>I move now to the Army Pensions Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1987.  The Estimate is for a net sum of £41,015,000 which represents an increase of £3,304,000 or 9 per cent on the 1986 outturn.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for the balance of increases due in 1987 under the public service pay deal and a grade claim and for the second stage of a concession announced in the 1986 budget on <i>ex gratia</i> pensions payable to widows and children of former members of the Defence Forces.  Under this concession the difference between the rates of these <i>ex gratia</i> pensions and the corresponding contributory pensions was eliminated as from 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>The main increase in 1987 as compared with the 1986 outturn is £3,250,000 under subhead E1.  This subhead provides for retired pay, pensions and gratuities granted under Defence Forces pensions schemes.  The increase is due mainly to the rise in the number of gratuities payable to officers and men on retirement and to increases in pensions payable to their dependants.</P>
    <P>There are reductions in the provisions relating to pensions and allowances payable to veterans of the War of Independence due to a fall in their numbers. The number of military service pensioners on pay is 898.  In addition, there are 2,025 in receipt of special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.  As well, there are 7,021 widows of former veterans on pay.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to comment on one or two matters which stem from the general recovery programme which <Col N="82" /> is being pursued diligently by the Government. One is the question of decentralisation. The reduction of regional imbalances and the stimulation of further development of local centres outside the Dublin region are among the objectives of the Government.  I am happy to say there will be a contribution from my Department in this regard through the decentralisation of a substantial proportion of the Department to new offices to be built in Galway.  The number of staff to be transferred, approximately, 200, is equivalent to about one-third of the total staff.</P>
    <P>A brief summary of the present position is that a site has already been selected on the Department's property at Renmore and the Office of Public Works have commenced the process of seeking tenders.  Under that process, private concerns will be asked to provide the required accommodation, meet all building costs and lease the property to the State with an option to purchase.  My Department have initiated the process of planning and preparing to decentralise as decided by the Government when the new offices are ready.  The transfer will, as far as possible, be on a voluntary basis and I am sure the move will be equally welcomed by the people of Galway and the Civil Service staff who decide to relocate in that highly regarded area of the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of a broad organisational review of defence. The role of our Defence Forces is well understood and widely accepted.  The process of review at the various levels within the organisation is an ongoing feature. However, from time to time each large organisation needs a special, more intensive examination to ensure it is functioning as efficiently and as effectively as possible.  It would be remiss of me, as a newly appointed Minister for Defence taking up office in a critical economic situation, if I did not ensure that the defence area was given due attention in the wide-ranging organisational and financial review which is being conducted by the Government.  I have, therefore, directed the civil and military authorities <Col N="83" /> of my Department to give special immediate attention to an organisational review to ensure, among other things, that the concentration of resources and effort is in the proper direction, that the best possible use is being made of the available pool of skilled personnel and that the maximum benefit will be obtained from the necessary commitment of funds for defence purposes.</P>
    <P>In the current drive to reverse the economic graph, indeed to alter the mood of the nation, it is fitting that we should recall the old Gaelic proverb, &ldquo;Ní neart go cur le chéile&rdquo;.  What is divisive in society we must strive to eliminate and in every possible way we must nurture a spirit of teamwork.  Daily, in my new appointment as Minister for Defence, I see teamwork in operation.  I see it not alone within the Defence Forces but also in the Department whose unique legal structure of civil and military branches calls for excellent teamwork and co-operation if the Department is to function as it should.  I am glad to say that it does and I should like to compliment and thank my officials, with and without insignia of office, for combining as they do in the interests of society at large.  Those who serve within the public sector may get more than their fair share of blame and some of their good deeds may go unrecognised. The Government intend to do what they can to redress the balance because we know that only a motivated public sector and a motivated people can move to the better state of affairs to which we aspire.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>An occasion such as this presents us with an opportunity to examine the Estimate for the Department of Defence and to take a look at both the Army and the Naval services and all related matters.  There are many aspects of this Estimate which I would like to speak about but because of the constraints on time I will refer to two or three aspects of the policy which I <Col N="84" /> consider we should pursue in the future. As the Minister outlined in his speech, the main purpose of our Army, or of any army for that matter, is to provide protection for its citizens against external aggression.  That is a role which many people seem to forget and it is a role which will take on a new significance in the future, one very different from the traditional role.</P>
      <P>I would regard the Army's peace-keeping role and their special relationship with the civil power which in the eyes of the ordinary individual is becoming more apparent every day, as their next most important objectives.  Society now dictates for one reason or another &mdash; usually for the wrong one &mdash; that there is greater Army presence on our streets, even in our provincial towns.  As legislators we must take a close look at this development.  It is our responsibility to ensure that the organs of State function in the normal way and that individuals can go about their ordinary every day business without fear.  It is unfortunate but we have to accept that it is a sign of the times we live in that you can barely shift a £5 note from A to B without having protection from both the Garda and the Army.  There is no point in wasting time talking about the reasons for this development; there will be other occasions on which to do that but the increased spectacle of convoys accompanied by the Army, particularly during the past ten years, is leading to many people asking whether that is a proper role for the Army or whether the commercial enterprises should pay for that protection.  This role in recent times has put a great strain on the budget of the Department of Defence.  I do not wish to get into any controversy but those are matters which the ordinary citizen is talking about at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A debate such as this gives us an opportunity to query some aspects of our defence policy and to be critical in areas where it is felt that we as legislators should be calling for changes which are necessary in this modern age.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I would like to compliment the Army on their overseas <Col N="85" /> activities in the many war torn areas around the world.  Let me say it is a tribute to the Defence Forces that they have remained as a peacekeeping force in those areas and have not allowed themselves be drawn into local disputes which are sometimes contrived and manipulated by self-styled leaders who are interested in power rather than in responsibility.  Our Defence Forces have conducted themselves with honour in each of the assignments they have undertaken all over the world and none more so than in the most complicated of areas in Lebanon.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that shortly he is going to review the situation.  The scene in Lebanon is ever changing and I would like to say that although we have played a very important peacekeeping role in that country we will have to keep our position under tabs in order to make sure that we do not end up as the meat in the sandwich.  There will be many other forces who will be bringing pressure to bear on the various parties who are involved in that conflict.  Of all the areas we have been involved in that is perhaps the most complicated.</P>
    <P>Our forces together with the forces of other countries involved in UNIFII have done their best to keep the peace in Lebanon which admittedly is a shaky and a temporary one but it must always be remembered that the ultimate decisions will have to be made by those who will have to cohabitate in the territory involved.  As I said, our sole aim is to act as peacekeeper and not as law enforcer. There are others who can and will enforce law and order once the politicians and community leaders have developed the proper environment in which law and order can flourish.  To say, given the aggression on the world stage at present, that our role is insignificant is to completely ignore the so-called psychological reasons that internal disputes, even small internal disputes, can get out of hand.  I have no doubt that our presence along with others has quelled what would be regarded as serious confrontations where the Super Powers could yield an undue amount of influence to the detriment of <Col N="86" /> all those involved.  It is a case of nipping those conflicts in the bud.  Our Army deserves our gratitude.  Many people living in areas which have been embroiled in serious conflict are thankful to the Irish people for giving the Army this role.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to an issue which has dominated our discussions during the past few months.  This might be an opportunity to open up an intelligent and open-ended debate on our policy of neutrality, a question that has been trotted out on every stage right across the country in the past few weeks in particular.  Now that the referendum on the Single European Act is over and the emotional vibes have subsided it may not be a bad exercise in the national interest to open up a discussion on this matter.  I can understand and appreciate that neutrality is cherished by all of our people.</P>
    <P>There are many questions to be asked. Do we play our full role as a neutral country in the search for world peace? Do we see a greater potential for us in this area?  If we do, can we make our presence felt in conjuction with other like-minded States?  With others, we can develop what I would describe as a more positive type of neutrality where the smaller, non-aligned countries can be more forceful in pursuing a role of peacemaking, of opinion forming and of the formation of the right climate.  Our traditional and widely accepted stance on neutrality of a silent, good boy approach might not, at the end of the day, be what the dangerous world situation demands. There can be little doubt in anybody's mind that the status of neutrality can be very different in today's circumstances from pre-nuclear days.  We must ask ourselves, if we adopted a more aggressive approach in bringing pressure to bear on the countries that would eventually wreck the world to rethink their strategies, would we be cast as a positive neutral country which would have far-reaching consequences for the betterment of all mankind?</P>
    <P>We should have this positive approach to the whole question of disarmament. In European discussions on the subject matter of the number and placement of <Col N="87" /> nuclear armaments, we would have many fellow travellers from non-aligned countries who would like to have a positive say on those matters.  Surely nobody here would want us to dodge our responsibility on discussion on disarmament in the United Nations or, for that matter, on the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  I want to put on record that I am very proud of our stand on neutrality down through the years.  My belief is that it was the only commonsense road to take.  The world stage is becoming more dangerous and one must remember the old saying that for evil to prevail all that is necessary is for good men to say, or perhaps do, nothing.  What about the good, non-aligned, well intentioned states keeping their noses clean in such circumstances?  It behoves all of us at this stage, while this is on our minds here, to have another look at the way in which we use neutrality.</P>
    <P>We must always be a neutral country, of that there is no doubt.  That is what the vast majority of the Irish people want, but the situation must be reviewed.  There are many countries around the world that would have a view like ours and we can bring great benefit to many areas and between the Superpowers.  I sincerely hope that we can have that type of indepth discussion, devoid of all emotion, to rethink once again this whole question of neutrality.  We can have the best of both worlds.  One is not going to see a change in our attitude towards neutrality. In my view that would be a wrong course for us to take but it is important to be positive in the future.  It is not just enough to sit on the sidelines, be the good boy of the class and not open one's mouth in respect of what happens around the world, saying that it does not concern one.  One would attract less flak in so doing, but whether at the end of the day we would be doing what good, well intentioned small countries like ours should be doing we would have to look at.</P>
    <P>As far as the members of the permanent Defence Forces are concerned, there are a few things beginning to <Col N="88" /> happen that, while not alarming, would show that there is a huge slow down of infusion of youth into the Army.  For obvious reasons, the embargo has led to this in the last couple of years and irrespective of what the Minister said today about a review, if one can believe all one sees and hears from the Taoiseach, I do not think there will be an extra person employed in the Army at any level for the next couple of years.  I reckon that the Army are losing numerically at the rate of 50 a month.  That would appear to be the actual haemorrhage out of the Army from natural wastage &mdash; although I do not like that term &mdash; retirement, etc.</P>
    <P>If that is allowed to continue for long enough, there will be a serious problem, although not so much because of the actual strength of the Army itself.  I am not sure what will emerge from the new in-depth look that the Minister will give. I think that should be done in any organisation of its size.  It should be put under the microscope very often to make sure that we are getting good value for money. What would concern me greatly is if there were not a number of young people coming into the Army on a fairly regular basis with new fresh ideas.  I know that within Army circles many see this as something which should be rectified very soon.</P>
    <P>There are fairly massive cutbacks on the second line reserve, the FCA. Despite what the Minister said, I understand on the ground that the pruning there is quite severe.  This is something that we should not allow to happen.  We should be proud of the fact that we have a very good reserve force here at good value on a cost-benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>The pruning shears hit hardest of all on civil defence.  There is a fairly drastic reduction from £1.9 million to £1.7 million. In itself, such a reduction might not make that much difference but in the context of the inflation rate and the general cost of living index the effect is obviously greater.  The local authorities will find it extremely difficult to continue with services which were there.  If one puts the store that the Minister has &mdash; and rightly <Col N="89" /> so &mdash; on civil defence, it appears to be a strange decision with regard to something which many people genuinely believe to be value for money.  I do not intend to deal in detail with the importance of civil defence, except that there is no doubt that it is a great motivating force at local level to do the kind of thing that one could not pay a permanent Army to do, even if one had the money.  When tragedy strikes one cannot do without the kind of local knowledge that cannot be put on a computer.  The civil defence organisations deserve better than this.  I know that the Minister has a huge problem in balancing the books, but perhaps if a closer look were taken at some of the other areas it might be possible to redress the imbalance.</P>
    <P>I notice that the mechanical transport subhead is down from £5.3 million to £3.4 million, about 35 per cent of a reduction. How did the Minister manage to make that type of economy at a time when petrol, fuel and oil for the Army is a colossal sum of £4.5 million, or up 18 per cent?  It is no harm that the House should know this.  This is at a time when the provision for mechanical transport is down.  As well as that, I understand that the cost of maintenance has jumped almost 100 per cent.  That leads me to believe that many of the vehicles the Army have at their disposal are old, have outlived their usefulness and that it takes much time, energy and personnel to bring these vehicles up to a reasonable level of maintenance.  The figures I have before me indicate that is the case and obviously the Minister will have to take a look at what types of new machinery are needed by the Army.</P>
    <P>Another very interesting aspect I noticed when reading through the figures in the Estimate is that road tax for mechanical transport in the Army was £510,000 during 1986 but there is no provision for this in this year's Estimate. Does this mean that the Army lorries will not be taxed?  Who will pay the tax?  I am sure there is a very sensible answer to that question.  One could be forgiven for thinking that if the Army can get away without having to pay road tax for their <Col N="90" /> vehicles so could the TDs but that is another story.  I am sure there is sensible answer to this but this is the way I read it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Army bands.  They are a credit to the Army and the nation. Wherever they appear they are good for the locality and for the Army.  I ask the people concerned in the Department of Defence and in the Army to make the Army bands as available as possible.  I know that people, even those in small districts around the country, would be willing to pay for visits from the Army bands and I ask the Minister to continue this.</P>
    <P>I have also a bouquet and a rosette for the Army Equitation School.  It was important to increase the subhead for the school so as to ensure that Army riders appear and perform better throughout the world at showjumping competitions. They are as good an ambassador for tourism and the horse industry as could be found anywhere.  I congratulate the Minister and the Department in ensuring that the necessary funding is made available to the school and I sincerely hope that this funding will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State with special responsibility for civil defence, I would like to add to what the Minister for Defence has said on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to the volunteers and I must endorse his remarks. Since I assumed responsibility for civil defence, I have come to appreciate the great dedication and enthusiasm of this voluntary and unpaid force.  I had, of course, been aware of the existence of the organisation but I must confess that I was not fully appreciative of the commitment which the volunteer gives to training or of the expertise which comes from that training.  The very high standard of training in the various services is a measure of the high quality of the instructors who teach the volunteers their skills.  The instructors are the product of the civil defence school.  I visited the school recently and I was very impressed <Col N="91" /> by their professional approach to training. I invite those Deputies who are interested in civil defence to visit the civil defence school also and I guarantee that they will not be disappointed.</P>
    <P>When one gets highly motivated people and trains them well in such useful skills as dealing with casualties, fire-fighting, rescue work and welfare help, those people can be a very useful force in the community.  Civil defence has proved its worth time and again in peace-time in all sorts of situations.  In recent years these have been as diverse as the Dublin bombings of 1972, the Papal visit in 1979, the Cherryville train crash in 1983, and on New Year's Day this year the gas explosion at Raglan House.  By responding to peace-time emergencies, the organisation keep in a constant state of preparedness and practise their training.</P>
    <P>Of course, we see also civil defence involved in such things as stewarding and first-aid at athletic and sports meetings and sometimes people criticise this as being totally irrelevant to the nuclear danger.  This is unfair criticism.  The volunteers learn discipline and team spirit by working together, their being seen at worthwhile events helps to recruit new members and they must be actively involved with their communities if they are to help them in any major emergency.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the nuclear danger rather than nuclear war because, as the world realised after Chernobyl, a peace-time accident at a nuclear power station can have disastrous consequences.  The invisible clouds of radioactivity which swept across Europe in the days and weeks after Chernobyl brought contamination in the air, on the land, and in food and water.  The public came to appreciate for the first time that the nuclear age had brought great dangers other than nuclear war.  Many were confused and frightened &mdash; both by the contradictory statements of some scientists who had previously said Chernobyl could not happen and by alarmist media reporting, not necessarily in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Out of all this was born an appreciation, however reluctant, that radioactive fall-out is no respecter either of neutrality or nuclear free zones, and out of it came also an expanded role for civil defence.  Here in Ireland we were spared the worst effects of Chernobyl but civil defence volunteers did excellent work in collecting samples of milk and vegetables for testing for radioactivity.</P>
    <P>We have not been left with uninhabitable lands and villages as in the USSR; we did not have to give our children stable iodine to protect their thyroids, as in Poland; we did not have to destroy large quantities of food as in West Germany.  Chernobyl is over 1,000 miles from Ireland.  However, we have nuclear stations much nearer, for example, in Britain and in Europe, and we have all the time the continuing threat of Sellafield. The message for us is to be prepared and the draft plan, referred to by the Minister for Defence, in which civil defence has an important role, will give effect to that preparedness.</P>
    <P>Coming to the civil defence provision in this Defence Estimate, I must emphasise that, as the civil defence volunteers are unpaid, the organisation give very good value for money.  Deputies will be aware that the primary responsibility for the co-ordination of civil defence planning and organisation rests with the Department of Defence and, subject to my overall direction, local authorities are responsible for the recruitment and training of the volunteers, and the development of civil defence measures in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>The expenditure of the local authorities is funded generally at 70 per cent from the civil defence provision in the Defence Vote.  Putting together this year's specific provision of £1.75 million, with perhaps a further £0.5 million as the local authorities' own expenditure and allowing for Departmental staffing costs, we still spend appreciably less than £1 per head of population on civil defence.  For this we get a dedicated, well-trained and equipped force of some 20,000 active volunteers with perhaps as many more available in an emergency <Col N="93" /> because they have been trained but are no longer classed as active.  This is good value by any standards.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the civil defence have a major role in peace-time.  While our attention may have been diverted by Chernobyl and Sellafield, the nuclear arsenals remain and no effective disarmament has yet been agreed.  There are some who say that there will be no surviving the immediate and consequential effects of a nuclear war.  I accept that the level of casualties would be appalling but I subscribe to the view of the Department of Defence that it is virtually certain that civil defence measures would save many lives, particularly in the type of situation which is likely to prevail in this country.  Against a direct saturation attack on Ireland &mdash; surely an unlikely event &mdash; protection may be beyond our capability but this is no argument to suggest that we should not have some insurance, such as civil defence provides, against lesser but much more likely hazards.  We, in Government, cannot afford to take a negative attitude and ignore the continuing danger of nuclear war.  Civil defence is our only insurance against the possibility of such nuclear war and the provision in the Estimates is an indication of the Government's commitment to civil defence preparedness.</P>
    <P>I conclude by inviting all Deputies to support civil defence in their constitutencies and local authorities.  It is an organisation most worthy of support for the benefits it confers both on those who join and on the community.</P>

I would refer the Deputy to the Free Ports Act, 1986 which is an enabling measure permitting the establishment by ministerial order of free ports anywhere in the State.  The prime purpose of that Act was the establishment of Ringaskiddy in Cork lower harbour.  We must learn from experience there before we consider setting up other free ports.  I am not dismissing Deputy McGahon's suggestion but we must learn from the experience which we will gain from the free port at Ringaskiddy.  The matter will certainly be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 9 and Priority Question No. 21 together.</P>
      <P>The use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing is banned under by-law 639 of 1984.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the enforcement of the fisheries laws which includes the ban on the use of monofilament netting is a matter for the regional fisheries boards.  I have recently urged the boards to do their utmost to prevent illegal fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review group are examining all existing salmon conservation measures including the ban on monofilament netting in <Col N="98" /> salmon fishing at present.  This review body were set up by my predecessor and I hope to receive an interim report shortly.</P>
    <P>Pending the receipt of the report of the group, I propose to make no changes in the laws governing the use of monofilament nets in salmon fishing.</P>

      <P>A review group were set up in September 1986 and I have no intention of trying to influence them in any way.  I have every confidence in them looking as objectively as possible at the regulations in relation to salmon fishing generally.  I do not propose to pre-empt their report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the opinion that it is particularly difficult, while illegal nets might be used in some areas, to curtail the activities of some of the fishermen.  I have every confidence in the review group.  Let me add that this review group were set up in 1986 in September and their terms of reference were very narrowly defined then.  I believe that they should be much broader.  Deputy Kavanagh is not in the House but he has a question down.  I do not believe that the motives were right for the setting up of that review group.  That was done as a result of a statement by the Deputy's colleague at that time in Government who was setting about the legalisation of outlawed fishing nets.  I believe that the review group were set up for that reason, but I would like their terms of reference to be much wider.  There are broader questions such as the employment and efficiency dimensions of the problems not encompassed in the terms of reference which were given to the review group.</P>

      <P>Commencement of the proposed harbour development work at Burtonport, which consists of dredging the harbour area and its approaches, depends on the availability of funds and suitability of weather conditions.  The work will be carried out by contract based on competitive tenders.  In such cases it is not policy to disclose the cost estimate. It has not been possible to include Burtonport in the 1987 harbour programme.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Gallagher, from Donegal South-West on his appointment to this important portfolio and I wish him every success in it.  I will not say that I wish him many long years there but at least success while he is there.  Is there an allocation in this year's Estimates for the dredging and extension of Burtonport harbour?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for his kind remarks.  There is no provision in this year's Estimates for the extension or the dredging of Burtonport harbour.  Last year there was an allocation which was not fully expended. I hoped at that time in 1986, while it was not fully expended, that work on Burtonport harbour could have been commenced, but generally most of the works on which finance has been expended this year are ongoing programmes. I think Deputy McGinley got a copy of a list of them yesterday in a written reply.  I can assure the Deputy that immediately on assuming office I met the representatives of the fishermen's organisation in Burtonport on 16 or 17 March last.  I propose to meet them again on 6 June at Burtonport.  I fully appreciate the necessity of dredging the <Col N="104" /> approach channel to Burtonport.  Certainly it will be very high on our priority list when we are preparing the Estimates for 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister of State is very much aware of the difficulties being encountered in Burtonport at present, the constraints on the further development of the fishing industry and on the fleet at that port.  In reply to a parliamentary question of mine on 22 October 1986 the former Minister said he had approved the dredging work there and that financial accommodation was being arranged.  Indeed it was common knowledge throughout the north west, particularly in Burtonport, that work was to commence early in 1987.  The Minister of State himself is on record as saying in Donegal County Council that he understood from the Department of Fisheries that the operation would be completed by the end of next year &mdash; that is 1987&mdash; and that the work would have commenced in March 1987.  Am I to understand now that there will be no work whatsoever carried out in Burtonport during 1987?  In other words, has the outgoing Government's commitment been reneged on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will point out to Deputy McGinley that the former Minister, on 22 June 1986, approved only but made no provision even in the Book of Estimates for the dredging of Burtonport harbour prior to the previous Government going out of office.  Approval of the works only was given.  At that time Donegal County Council agreed to a local contribution of 25 per cent.  I must point out to the Deputy that in 1982 there was an allocation of £1 million for Burtonport. By coincidence or otherwise, when the Coalition Government assumed power in that year the Estimate was reduced by £1 million and, as a result, Burtonport lost out.  However, at the end of last year, all of the harbour moneys had not been expended.  I am surprised that at that time the Minister did not ensure that work commenced.  As of now there is no money there.  I fully appreciate <Col N="105" /> the Deputy's concern and assure him that it will be high on the priority list for next year.  There is no question of this Government reneging on financial commitments given by the previous Government. Approval of the work only had been given.</P>

Finance was available at that time but the work never commenced.  If I give a commitment now I will stand over it.  I can assure Deputy McGinley that those works will be high on the priority list for <Col N="106" /> next year and Deputy McGinley will be one of the first to know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the last 12 months a total of 66 fish kills resulting from pollution incidents were brought to the attention of my Department.  The number of fish lost in each kill is not available.  Consequently, it is not possible to quantify the total cost of replenishing fish stocks as a result of these incidents. Responsibility for anti-pollution measures rests primarily with the Minister for the Environment and the local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>Protection of fishing waters from poisoning and pollution is provided under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, under which the regional fisheries boards usually take action against offenders.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the grave concern caused throughout the country by the many incidents of pollution occurring in our rivers and lakes.  I am surprised there are no figures available of the numbers of fish killed or of the cost involved. Is the Minister aware of the effect this is having on our tourism and also on the rivers used for supplying water to many homes throughout the country?  I know <Col N="107" /> he has said the Minister for the Environment is responsible for the implementation of measures but surely the Minister present has a responsibility and I am sure has been in touch with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  Can he say why no effective measures are being taken against polluters, many of whom have been well known for many years and have not been penalised?  Can the Minister say if he and his colleague have discussed this matter and whether they have any measures in mind for dealing with this dreadful problem?</P>

Indeed, I thought the Deputy might have been referring to a recent fish kill.  Legal proceedings have been taken in the past.  It is my belief that the laws obtaining are adequate but it can be difficult at times to pinpoint an offender.  There are penalties and fines, or provision for a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months which can be imposed at the discretion of the court but it can be very difficult to ascertain who are the offenders.  Resulting from a news item last evening, which referred to a fish kill in the south between 7 and 8 May, the regional fisheries board there and the local authority are vigorously pursuing the matter and prosecutions are envisaged in this case.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear from the Minister that this pollution incident is being pursued.  I am sure he is aware of the fact that knowledge of such fish kills is spread throughout the world in angling and tourist journals and so on.  Will the Minister say whether he has considered, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and indeed also the Minister for Tourism and Transport, having discussions on this matter?  As it has been going on for so many years throughout the country, I am sure he would agree it is imperative that the relevant Ministers ascertain how they <Col N="108" /> can overcome this problem and impose more instant penalties on polluters.</P>

      <P>I have met the Northern Regional Fisheries Board and the Minister for the Marine has met the Shannon Fisheries Board, when this was one item high on the agenda.  We propose meeting the other regional fisheries boards in the country.  Last week we had a meeting with the managers of all the boards here in Dublin when we discussed many aspects of inland fisheries, particularly that in relation to pollution. I would point out to Deputy MacGiolla that two of the regional fisheries boards, the northern and north western, recently inserted advertisements in local newspapers being circulated in their areas reminding farmers who were planning to make silage of the need to ensure that they have proper facilities for the disposal of effluent.  I will take this opportunity of reminding farmers of the serious, detrimental consequences from such a spillage, whether minor or otherwise.  One gallon of spillage is sufficient to affect 10,000 gallons of water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the extent to which financial cutbacks are preventing the fisheries boards and their staff from carrying out their statutory responsibilities in accordance with the Fishery Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the fisheries boards and their staff are doing their utmost to carry out their statutory responsibilities within the resources which have been allocated to them but like all public agencies they have to exercise financial restraints having regard to the general curbs on public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously expect us to accept or does he accept that the fisheries boards are carrying out their statutory functions to any <Col N="109" /> extent in the areas of conservation in particular, protection and development of inland fisheries and sea angling up to the 12-mile limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that all of us are concerned because of the cutbacks, in particular with regard to the Central Fisheries Board.  We allocate money to the Central Fisheries Board and it is a matter for them to allocate money to each regional board.  However, I accept there is a shortfall in last year's allocation to the board of £5.022 million and it has been reduced by £209,000 this year.  The bulk of that reduction had already been imposed by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there have been restrictions generally in all these areas but a further restriction in this area has effectively made the fisheries boards totally impotent.  Does the Minister accept that or has he plans to rationalise the boards generally?  We have reached a stage when there is no point in having fisheries boards as they are now structured because they can literally drive to the river bank and catch the odd illegal rod angler who may or may not have caught a salmon but they cannot prosecute him because of the cost of bringing the case to court.  Is this a window-dressing exercise or are we serious in relation to the job we have asked the fisheries boards to do?  Will we now tell them: &ldquo;We cannot afford you any longer&rdquo; and therefore the poacher and the pirate can do what he likes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions of the regional fisheries boards are, as the Deputy outlined, to conserve, protect, develop and manage inland fisheries. They have a vitally important role to play and they have a statutory obligation in this regard.  I realise that the financial cutbacks have some effect.  However, we met with two representatives of the fisheries boards and with all the managers and we have impressed upon them the necessity to carry out these functions within the constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I would also like to point out to the Deputy that the cutbacks imposed by the previous Government and those imposed by our Government are very similar.  I appreciate there is a difficulty with regard to the contracting of finance and we must consider, in conjunction with the regional boards, other methods of financing in addition to the finance allocated from the Exchequer.  This must be done before next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the fisheries boards and their officers have the finance to pursue conservation other than perhaps by patrolling the banks of rivers for the illegal rod angler, the small man as it were?  Is he satisfied that up to the 12-mile limit the job is being done as statutorily laid down?  He is probably aware that 5 per cent of fishermen catch over 85 per cent of the salmon illegally.  All our resources should not be concentrated on the chap on the river bank with the rod, even though he is breaking the law and deserves to be brought within it, or on the estuary people alone.  The law should be applied to everyone equally, particularly the bigger fishermen who are having a heyday at present because they are aware that the fisheries boards have not the resources to see what they are up to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that a responsible spokesperson on marine affairs would take this opportunity to suggest that there should be co-operation on all sides.  I have taken that opportunity and I will take it again.  Due to the constraints there should be co-operation between the Department, the regional boards and the fishermen, whether they be inland or deep sea fishermen.  I outlined earlier that I met with the Northern Regional Fisheries Board, the Minister met the Shannon Fisheries Board and we intend meeting the other boards within the very near future. We met all the managers of the boards and in turn I asked officials of my Department to meet them to ensure that they <Col N="111" /> are in a position to carry out their functions. We will do our utmost in this regard.</P>

It is not necessary for me to ask the regional fisheries boards to carry out their functions because they know what they are and they are responsible boards with responsible managers. I have every reason to believe they will carry out their functions and ensure that all the waters are patrolled and that they will pursue any court cases that arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am having the various options for the future management of Dún Laoghaire harbour, including <Col N="113" /> establishment of a harbour authority under the Harbour Act, 1946, reviewed by my Department at present with a view to the rational and efficient development of the portal and marine facilities in the Dublin Bay area as a whole.  I consider such a review essential to enable me to take a decision that will result in the best use of the limited public funds available for harbour development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us the nature of this review, who is conducting the review, the composition of the review board and when the reveiw will be completed?  Will the review board encapsulate the harbour authority or what will the terms of reference of the board be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Green Paper on Transport Policy which was published in November 1985 and which gave three options for the future management of Dún Laoghaire.  The previous Government, in their document <i>Building on Reality,</i> decided there should be a harbour authority in Dún Laoghaire. In turn, the Minister for Finance advised the Minister for Communications at that time that finance would not be made available for this purpose.  Deputy Andrews has been pursuing the question of a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire.  It has been reviewed within the Department and we hope to have recommendations within the next few months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the last Government made a Cabinet decision to establish a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire and the legislation was in the course of preparation in the Department of Communications at the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Government made a decision in this regard last year but I am also aware that on 30 October 1986 the Minister for Finance made observations in relation to the harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire.  He said he was opposed to the proposal to <Col N="114" /> establish a harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire because the arguments cited by the Minister for Communications in favour of the retention of the existing arrangements were conclusive and showed that existing management arrangements had successfully improved the harbour's commercial operations while at the same time retaining its important amenity characteristics.  There was a Government decision taken at that time but it did not have the blessing of, and finance would not be available from, the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reverse the philosophy of the previous Minister for Finance in relation to the creation of a Dún Laoghaire harbour authority?  I would ask the Minister to consider the amenity and commercial elements in the context of a harbour authority. What we require in Dún Laoghaire is a harbour authority encapsulating a marina and a unified car ferry terminal. I believe this would be within the terms of reference of the review body.  I was very disappointed to learn from the Minister &mdash; and this was the first time I heard it &mdash; that the previous Minister for Finance was not in favour of a Dún Laoghaire harbour authority.  I am certain the people of Dún Laoghaire will be interested to hear that point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern being expressed by fishermen at the de-manning of the lighthouses programme being implemented by the Commissioners of Irish Lights; and the steps if any, he intends to take to discontinue the de-manning programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, responsibility for the provision and maintenance of lights services around the coast of Ireland is vested in the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Expenditure by the commissioners is met by the General Lighthouse Fund which derives its income from the collection of light dues in ports in Britain and Ireland together with an annual subvention from the Exchequer towards the cost of lights services in the State.</P>
      <P>Since 1960, the Commissioners of Irish Lights have been engaged in a programme of automation of Irish lighthouses. At present there are only 19 manned stations, of which 16 are in the State, out of a total of approximately 90 lighthouses in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed at the de-manning of the lighthouses and at the cessation of the incidental coastwatch assistance which lighthouse keepers are in a position to provide by reason of their location.  The Minister and officials of his Department have met representatives of the lighthouse keepers on a number of occasions to discuss the matter.  I have asked my Department to consider any implications <Col N="122" /> the de-manning of the remaining lighthouses may have for the search and rescue services of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government agree with the de-manning programme being pursued by the Commissioners of Irish Lights as a result of a decision of the British Government to withdraw support from them?  Has an approach been made to the British Government in an effort to come to an arrangement to maintain this important service along the Irish coast due to the fact that we do not have a coastguard service or a coastwatch similar to that in the UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights have a statutory duty to maintain the lights around our coast. Many Deputies, and people involved in the fishing industry, have expressed concern about this move and I propose to meet with my British counterpart to discuss the matter.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that in 1960 there were 90 lighthouses located along our coastline and 71 of them have since been de-manned. Three of them were de-manned recently, the old Head of Kinsale, the Skelligs and Inishtrahull in Donegal. From 1960 to date those involved in the industry have expressed concern but very little concern has been expressed by others.  The technology today is much better but I appreciate the concern of those involved in the industry and officials of my Department will consider the implications of any further de-manning. The programme is for the de-manning of about two per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the organisation representing the lighthouse <Col N="123" /> keepers made a submission to the Minister suggesting that a certain number of lighthouses, ten or 12, should be manned. Has that submission been considered? What is the Minister's attitude to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and officials of the Department met representatives of the lighthouse keepers to discuss the matter.  It is worth recalling that between December 1981 and May 1985, 65 distress calls involving lighthouses were received.  Fourteen of them were at Mizen Head and 15 at Baily. Between one and three calls were received at the other lighthouses which the lighthouse keepers are suggesting should not be de-manned.  I am concerned about this matter and I should like to assure the Deputy it will be considered again by my Department.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that we have the search and rescue services of the State available.  They include the coast life saving service, the marine rescue coast-guard centre, the lifeboats, our Navy and Air Corps.  I should like to pay tribute to these services, particularly those who act in a voluntary capacity, for the great work they are doing around our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that about 140 people are employed by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and I should like to know what the future holds for those people if the commissioners proceed with the de-manning policy?  They are in permanent and pensionable employment and I should like to know if it is the intention to make them redundant? Lighthouse keepers responded to 220 distress calls in 1986 and if they are made redundant who will keep watch? The Taoiseach has said he owes his life to the vigilance of the lighthouse keepers at Mizen Head and that is an indication of how serious this topic is.  Can we get an undertaking that the policy will be reversed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a serious matter and I should like to point out to the Deputy that the implications <Col N="124" /> of de-manning the remainder of the lighthouses is being considered.  The future of the personnel is a matter for discussion between my Department and the union representing those involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the steps, if any, he is taking to prevent the introduction of new virulent fish diseases into our natural fish stocks by the importation of foreign stocks for Irish farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1972, the importation of live fish and the eggs or young of such fish, has been prohibited except under licence from my Department. In addition the health status of the fish being imported must be certified by the relevant authority in the country of origin on the basis of criteria set by my Department.</P>
      <P>Where juvenile fish are concerned, these are examined at source by my Department's fish pathologist to establish their disease-free status before importation can be allowed.  As an additional precaution, all materials involved in the transporting of imported fish must be destroyed.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to encourage the relatively new fish-farming industry to become fully self-sufficient at all levels of production as soon as possible and thus virtually eliminate the need to import young fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he give an assurance that our fisheries research centre is in a position to cope with the demands on it.  Is a fish pathologist employed at the research centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied we have adequate facilities at the fish research centre and we do have a fish pathologist.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn the fish pathologist is the person about whom we had a debate in the House some weeks ago.  I had the pleasure of visiting Abbotstown recently <Col N="125" /> and I was impressed with the facilities available.  I am satisfied the centre has the facilities to deal with any problems that may arise.  I invite the Deputy to visit the centre to familiarise herself with the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to accept that offer and I will discuss the matter with the Minister.  The Minister said it was the Department's intention to make the fish farm self-sufficient in relation to young stock and I should like to know if he has any time scale in mind in regard to this? We are all too well aware of the havoc caused to our most lucrative oyster industry recently when a disease from beyond our shores affected stock and it is because of that that I would like to know the deadline the Minister has in mind.  I accept it is most important that we become self-sufficient very soon because of the threat to our stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate it is a question of the Department impressing upon the industry the importance of this move.  The Minister, Deputy Daly, and myself had a meeting with those involved in fish farming and we impressed upon them the need to become self-sufficient.  As far as shellfish imports are concerned, oyster, spat and clams, I should like to tell the Deputy that there are very strict regulations involved. We only permit imports from certain countries and from certain areas in those countries.  I do not think it is necessary to name the countries from which we are not prepared to import shellfish because we had a full debate on this matter when dealing with the question of the bonamia. I should like to tell the House that a licence is required for the movement of all bi-valve shellfish, oysters, mussels and clams.  That is accepted by the trade.  We regret the inconvenience but the quality is of primary importance to us.  Samples are being taken from all areas and the fish pathologist has advised me that there is no evidence of bonamia now except where it originated, in Cork harbour. Unfortunately, we have not yet established how it arrived there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that applications in respect of three new vessels were included in the list submitted by my Department for benefit under the new EC structures policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied <Col N="127" /> that three new vessels will suffice as most of our vessels are over ten years old? When every £1 million spent is matched by £3.5 million from the fisheries structures policy in Europe, why have a mere three applications been made?  Is the Minister processing more applications to be sent in by the second deadline in November?  What plans has he to ensure that there will be a revitalisation of the fishing fleet which is so necessary for a modern, competitive industry in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be able to tell the Deputy that we are processing many more applications but of course there are financial constraints. When the structures policy was agreed, there was a difficulty in so far as we had to provide 10 per cent of the overall cost before we could avail of grants from the Community.  I do not believe there will be another batch processed before next year.  Speaking from memory, there will be one batch this year and two batches in each year in future.  In regard to the question of the return from the investment, the grants available are 35 per cent for new vessels and vessels modernisation, except for those over 35 metres where 25 per cent is payable; 40 per cent for aquaculture and a maximum of 50 per cent for facilities at ports.  In the case of vessels up to 33 metres and of aquaculture, the member states' contributions must be in the range of 10 to 30 per cent while it must be between 5 and 25 per cent for facilities at ports and between 10 and 30 per cent for vessels over 33 metres.  However, we have submitted applications and if they are successful &mdash; I am talking about the industry generally &mdash; grants will total £8 million. We submitted a total of 28 applications relating to aquaculture projects, 32 relating to modernisation of vessels and three in respect of new vessels.  I accept that the newest boats in the fleet are about four years old.  Therefore, we must strive to obtain the maximum grant aid from the Structures Fund for the provision of new boats and the lengthening of existing boats.  We were curtailed in the past in <Col N="128" /> so far as we were limited in the size of boats for which we could obtain grant aid.  Fortunately, that limitation has been lifted and I hope we will be in a position to avail of greater grants from the total of £650 million under the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I interpret from that that there is a demand from the industry for far more than the three new boats in respect of which applications were submitted under the structures policy but that because the Department of Finance could not put up the Irish Government's share of the funding we could only proceed with these three applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Finance is a problem. However, we are looking at a long term programme because it is difficult to plan from year to year.  I propose to examine this matter in a much wider context over a four year period to fit in with the structures programme.  As I said, finance is a problem particularly since a decision was taken to increase the State input from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Unfortunately, we cannot submit all the applications in one year, we must plan ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it will be a long time before we have a fleet of vessels fit to compete in the modern industry if we proceed at the rate of three a year?  Is he aware that the Scots have 70 applications in for new boats?  In Ireland, we have 25 per cent of the waters and it is intolerable that this industry in which the Taoiseach, the Minister and their party placed great faith in developing, should only be looking for grant aid towards three new boats when our fleet is so old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of three is somewhat deceptive as there are a total of 32 applications relating to the modernisation of vessels which would include their lengthening.  The modernisation of many of the 32 boats will contribute to the enlargement of the fleet over the 120 feet bracket and will give us the capacity to catch fish and to compete with the <Col N="129" /> other nations to which the Deputy referred.  One of the most modern vessels will be launched next Sunday in Norway for this country and a factory ship is also planned.  I am particularly concerned about the larger vessels because we must strive to catch greater quantities of the non-quota species with which we had a problem as far back as 1975.  There is a total allowable catch in relation to horse mackerel and blue whiting and we are striving to ensure that we get the maximum quotas available.  I can see a great transformation in our fishing fleet over the next four years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 20 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the shares of total allowable catches available to member states are enshrined in the EC Common Fisheries Policy.  The quotas for 1987 have already been agreed.  Discussions on the 1988 quotas will not take place until late in the year and I will be pressing in these discussions for the maximum level of quotas possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course determined to ensure that as far as possible these quotas will allow for the further development of the Irish fishing industry.  Already both the Minister and I went to Brussels last month to meet the EC Commissioner for Fisheries.  During the discussions, which covered a wide range of issues, we raised the question of the Irish quotas generally with particular emphasis on those species of greatest importance to us.  The Commissioner accepted our invitation to visit <Col N="130" /> Ireland and see the situation at first hand for himself.  It is expected that that visit will take place sometime during July next and I will be availing of the opportunity to again raise with the Commissioner the issue of the quotas available to Irish fishermen. I would also like to point out that at a recent Council of Ministers meeting, the Minister, Deputy Daly, impressed on his counterparts the difficulties we were experiencing due to lack of an adequate quota.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that the time has come for a review of the Irish quotas?  The quotas which have been agreed up to now have not been sufficient.  The Minister has referred to his intention to examine specific areas. I ask him to name the species he is talking about and the plans he has formulated and which he will put before our fellow members in the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious problem as far as pelagic fish are concerned, both mackerel and herring.  Our boats have the capacity to catch far more mackerel than the quota allows us to do. I want to pay tribute to our fishermen who deposit some 80 per cent of the catch for processing whereas some of our counterparts in the Community land only some 20 per cent of the mackerel they catch.  Because of this we are creating jobs in coastal areas where there are no other employment opportunities.  In particular, we will be raising the issue of our mackerel quota as that is the big issue of the moment.  Of course, there are problems with regard to the herring quotas in the Celtic Sea area and along the west coast.  There are also some species of whitefish involved.  We are committed to having a review of the overall structure of quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that when he and the Minister, Deputy Daly, recently met Commissioner Cunha they received a very unfavourable response to their request for an increase in the percentage of the TAC?  Is that not the reason Commissioner Cunha has <Col N="131" /> been asked to come to Ireland, more or less as a window-dressing exercise?  I do not say that too cynically because there is much he could see and learn about our coastline and our fishing industry.  The most important requirement of the fishing industry at present is an increase in our percentage of the TAC.  Commissioner Cunha told the Minister of State and his colleagues to forget about it for the foreseeable future and because of that bad news they told him to come over and see it for himself.  How does the Minister of State intend to pursue what we all agree to be a most vital interest for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to wonder whether I was in Brussels at all and whether I was able to comprehend what the Commissioner stated to us.  First of all, we asked the Commissioner to meet with us; our intention was to invite him to visit this country and he responded favourably.  Having heard our verbal submission the Commissioner full appreciates the difficulties we are now experiencing.  There is no question of any window-dressing as far as we are concerned. We are totally committed to achieving a greater quota for our fishermen. I suggest to Deputy Doyle she should avail of other sources of information in the future.  I do not intend to mislead her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister of State that my question and information was well sourced.  Will he respond to the most important aspect of my question, that the response of Commissioner Cunha was unfavourable in relation to an increase in the percentage of TAC for our fishermen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

If we are going to have a fishing industry in the future, one which is going to be viable and which will be able to expand, the time for laying our cards on the the table is now.  There must be results.  If we want to have an industry left, the time has come for us to make our demands heard.</P>

      <P>In order to make these demands we must first make our case.  Last year the industry in conjunction with officials of my Department carried out a survey on mackerel which proved beyond all doubt there are adequate stocks available and we could look for an increase in our TAC.  A further survey will be carried out this year and I hope the results of this survey will be available to the Minister and to me prior to any negotiations which will take place in relation to the quotas for 1988. This information is of vital importance to us.  We realise there has to be conservation but we also realise that there are ample stocks available.  We must convince our friends in ISIS and in the Community that we can increase our percentage without affecting the stocks.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy who lives near the Border I am glad of this opportunity to say a few words on an Estimate which has very definite implications for my own county.  The budget for the Department of Defence at £296 million is an unbearable burden for this very small nation and comprises 10 per cent of our gross national product.  This is in stark contrast to Japan which spends less than £1 million on defence.  The size of the budget shows the appalling burden which the IRA have inflicted on this country.  An illegal army masquerading as defenders of the Irish nation, they have committed crimes on an horrific scale in the North and along the Border, crimes which make me ashamed of being Irish. It is not just in the wanton taking of life that the IRA have hurt the nation, they have also hurt it economically to an unacceptable degree.  At present, a new terror is stalking the land, the terror of getting sick and having to pay for a hospital bed. Yet, this tiny nation allocates £296 million to its defence budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I wish to thank the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána for the surveillance they carry out right along the Border but I would like to pose a question: who is the enemy?  Is the enemy without or is the enemy within? In recent years, 14 Irish policemen have been murdered in this State by various shades of IRA armies &mdash; I include the Official IRA among them &mdash; and one has <Col N="166" /> to come to the conclusion that the real enemies are the forces of subversion within the State.</P>
    <P>While there is always the threat of a Protestant or Unionist backlash from the army of the UDA, the real enemies of this State are here in our own State.  I must deplore the absolute waste of money on Border surveillance.  While I am very thankful that the Irish Army have a divisional headquarters in Dundalk and thankful also for the efforts of the Garda Síochána, I must ask the question: is Border surveillance money spent in the right way?  It is time for us to look at the Irish Army.  This country has an Army of, I think, 14,000 soldiers.  It is structured in the conventional way, with air forces and land forces.  Has the time not come to look at the restructuring of the Army?  I do not believe that the expenditure of large amounts of money on planes and tanks is justified.  The justification for the Irish Army is to keep this country safe from the enemies of this State &mdash; the IRA.  The Army should be geared to fight the IRA.  Part of that should include the prohibition by the Government of paramilitary displays at IRA funerals.</P>
    <P>Recently we had the unhappy spectacle at Emyvale in which a policeman, I believe, was so terrified when confronted by a group of people that his gun went off in his hand.  There was a lack of police and Army presence in Emyvale.  Conversely, four or five months prior to that, at the funeral in Dundalk of two IRA gangsters of the INLA variety who were shot in the holocaust at Rosnaree, the authorities allowed the INLA to stage manage a funeral that took almost two hours to pass through Dundalk.  Gangsters wearing balaclavas were allowed to strut through the streets of the biggest town in Ireland and take the coffin out repeatedly and do their double shuffle through the town, instead of being told to get out of Dundalk and out of the State by the back door as quickly as possible. They were watched by a large force of the Garda Síochána.  This is part of the ambivalence shown by the Irish State and Irish Governments to subversion in this <Col N="167" /> country.  Until we come to grips with the forces of terror, we will always be held to ransom by various shades of the IRA.</P>
    <P>The massive cost to the Irish taxpayer for providing escorts for banks, if you please, moneylenders, for the transportation of cash I believe is in the region of £1.5 million.  We are providing this service for banks that would screw &ldquo;Maud Frickert&rdquo; if they got the opportunity while we are charging people to be sick in hospital beds.  This is an outrage. I call on the Government to do something about it.  The banks have had a licence to do what they like and the last Government, which I supported, provided a back-up facility for the AIB.  Whatever justification there was for that, there is no justification whatsoever for the provision of a large part of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána in escorting these cash convoys around the country. Every so often there is a convoy of gelignite brought to the Border en route to County Antrim and that is covered all the way by a large convoy of police and soldiers.  How long will this continue? How long can the Irish taxpayer be asked to subsidise this?  It is not only the banks we are subsidising; we are subsidising insurance companies because the attitude of the banks is that if they are requested to provide this facility and do not do it, the insurance corporations will have to pay.  The insurance companies are hardly a poor sector of our community.</P>
    <P>I do not want my remarks to be taken as criticism of the efforts of either the Army or the Garda Síochána.  They have done a good job in protecting towns like Dundalk and Clones against possible threats.  I suggest that there is extreme waste in the Border region in the carrying out of Border surveillance.  For the last 20 years the people of Dundalk have witnessed a road block at Lisdoo Corner on the main Dundalk-Newry road.  That block has inhibited business activity in the town but has not resulted in the capture of any criminal or any subversive, nor has it resulted in the capture of any cache of arms.  Yet we have seen the economic life of the town brought to a virtual standstill <Col N="168" /> by the use of this surely outmoded and outdated form of surveillance.</P>
    <P>The Army should be used for this purpose. Up to about five years ago they were used but then because of some Government decision they were more or less withdrawn to barracks.  Very seldom would one see Army personnel at a roadblock. The Garda Síochána took over. With that came a resultant bulge in the expenses because the Garda had to be paid for this work whereas the unfortunate soldiers got no overtime at all.  The function of the Garda Síochána should primarily be to fight and control crime here and the role of the Army should be to combat terrorism.  Much money has been misused and wasted in this area and the efforts of the ordinary Army privates and corporals have not met with the monetary reward they should have.  People who do overtime duties in the Border region, particularly poorly paid soldiers, should be given some monetary recompense. I ask the Minister to consider using, to a greater degree, the Armed Forces based in Dundalk and Castle-blayney and releasing the Garda Síochána for their real role of fighting crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> I take this opportunity of thanking Deputies for the tributes they have paid to the personnel of the Defence Forces.  I wish to join in these tributes. In the short time that I have been Minister for Defence but having had the opportunity to observe and appreciate at close quarters the operations of the Defence Forces, I realise how deserved such tributes are in terms of recognising the dedication, diligence and loyalty with which the personnel of our Defence Forces discharge their duties both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity for discussion on the role of the Defence Forces only presents itself once a year.  It is fitting that the House should avail of the opportunity to express to the Defence Forces its appreciation and that of the public generally of the work they do.  I consider myself honoured to hold the position of Minister <Col N="169" /> for Defence at this stage and to be associated with a body of men and women who have served and will continue to serve the country and its elected Governments with such commitment and unswerving loyalty.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a number of points raised during the course of this debate. Deputy Connaughton referred to the various roles of the Defence Forces and rightly stressed the need for their continued participation in UNIFIL.  The safety of the Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Lebanon is kept constantly under review.  I would like to remind the house that troops selected for this service undergo a very rigorous programme of training.  This programme is designed to assist them in carrying out their peacekeeping duties and, more importantly, to provide for their protection. They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.  Having spoken to Defence Forces personnel both on their way out to Lebanon and on their way back I am satisfied that the training, weapons and equipment of our troops are adequate to ensure maximum safety, consistent with the performance of their duties.  The Government will continue to monitor developments in south Lebanon with a view to taking whatever measures may be necessary at any time to ensure the safety and welfare of our troops.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred also to recruitment to the Permanent Defence Forces during 1987.  I assure the House that no decision has been taken to suspend recruitment to the Defence Forces in 1987.  There is a financial position in the Estimate for an intake of about 400 recruits.  Therefore, the question of an intake of recruits will be examined later in the light of the strengths and commitments of the Defence Forces and in the context of the overall budgetary situation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> If that is what the Deputy thinks far be from me to deter him from his opinion.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present strength of the Defence Forces is adequate to meet the existing operational commitments of the force.  I am keeping this under constant consideration in view of their existing, continuing and perhaps increased commitments.  Not alone am I reviewing the position but I am observing it at first hand.  I have visited a number of Border posts and spoken to the men involved.  I am fully aware of their problems. These are being considered very carefully and a decision will be reached in due course.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to the FCA and to the fact that there were cutbacks in recruitment to the FCA.  I want to remind the Deputy and the House that recruitment generally to the FCA has been committed to the extent necessary to replace wastage.  This includes the numbers posted to the non-effective list in January of each year.  Those same conditions will apply during 1987.</P>
      <P>The strength of the FCA was 14,447 on 31 January 1984.  On 31 January 1987 the strength of the FCA was 14,522.  The Deputy need have no fears in relation to this because the strength of the FCA will be kept up to the level required and necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton referred, too, to the adequacy of Army transport. Vehicles are added to the fleet from time to time where necessary and in the light of operational requirements.  The vehicles in the fleet are fully maintained and repaired to ensure that they meet normal standards of road worthiness.  I am satisfied that the level of provision in the Estimate for mechanical transport for 1987 is adequate to meet the operational needs likely to arise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred also to road tax.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> There is <Col N="171" /> an answer to every question.  Road tax payments in previous years were made to the Department of the Environment but with a view to eliminating unnecessary interdepartmental transfers of funds, road tax is no longer payable on military vehicles.  That accounts for the reduction in that subhead.  Instead of being made available through the Department of Defence the necessary funds are now being transferred from the Exchequer to the Department of the Environment.</P>

This has been discussed extensively in the recent past so I do not intend to go into it in detail now.  The policy of neutrality has been supported by successive Irish Governments and Ireland is not part of any military alliance.  There are implications other than military ones in neutrality. Economic considerations are involved as well as international relations.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £221,632,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate before us, provides, as indicated, for net expenditure of just under £222 million in 1987, as compared with an outturn of almost £240 million, in 1986, an overall decrease of £18 million.</P>
      <P>This Estimate contains the major share of the public expenditure allocations for the development of industry.  As Deputies will be aware this is by no means the full extent of State assistance to industry, a considerable part of which arises indirectly in the form of the various tax measures and incentives available.</P>
      <P>The provision of monetary incentives, however generous, whether direct or indirect, will not, in itself, result in a satisfactory development of our industry. Indeed, as we have found, to our cost, the high level of Government borrowing which is required to fund this assistance leads, in itself, to the very stultifying of growth in the industry.</P>
      <P>This is an issue which we have already started to tackle in the recent budget and which we will vigorously pursue.  Already the benefits can be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of Government in improving the industrial environment is crucial, but it is not the only factor governing the approach to development.  In this country &mdash; and I am not suggesting that we are unique in this &mdash; we see too often an immediate resort to a confrontational approach.  We have got to get away from this &mdash; to work together &mdash; to act as partners rather than adversaries.  The Government can help in this, as we have <Col N="174" /> done, by ensuring that there is equity in the way people are treated.</P>
    <P>In my own case, I am very conscious of the obligation to strike a reasonable balance between the needs of industry and the rights of consumers.  Later in my speech I will touch on some areas where steps are being taken which will be of benefit to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Many recent reports on science and technology including my Department's <i>Review of Industrial Performance, 1986</i> conclude that much greater attention needs to be paid on a continuing basis to innovation, enhancing the technological capacity of firms, and to the raising of technical and quality standards.  Urgent action in these areas is essential if this country is to face up to one of its major challenges &mdash; the building and sustaining of a strong indigenous industrial base. We need to pay far greater attention to the application of technology in industry in order to help our good firms survive and expand, and to encourage the growth of new high technology Irish companies on the international market.</P>
    <P>We need to strengthen and make much better use of our R and D infrastructure to enable Irish firms and Irish products attain an increasing percentage of the keenly competitive world market in both goods and services.</P>
    <P>Recent reports from the sectoral development committee, the OECD, and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses have commented on the low level of research and development in Irish industry, and the low use of State R and D facilities, which in turn reflects on the poor capacity of indigenous firms to innovate and expand.  I intend to initiate a programme of action to increase the innovative capacity of Irish industry.  I want to bring about a situation where our best graduates in science and engineering will use their skills and talents within Irish firms.  It is there, within industry that they can apply their talents most directly to the question of developing new products and new markets for this country.</P>
    <P>The importance which this Government attach to science and technology was outlined in the Fianna Fáil policy <Col N="175" /> document &ldquo;A policy for Science and Technology&rdquo;.  Due to the present economic constraints, it is not possible in this financial year to initiate a full programme of activities.  Nonetheless, it is important to make an initial commitment to this important development activity.  I indicated recently in this House that I was establishing a programme for priority action in the area of science and technology. As I mentioned to the House only last Thursday, I am now finalising my consideration of this matter and expect to announce my decisions thereon very shortly.  This will be done by a reallocation of funds within the Estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Referring to growth and job creation, in 1986, industrial output increased by 2.8 per cent and industrial exports rose by nearly 4 per cent in real terms.  This level of output was achieved through the recovery in the chemicals sector and the expansion in the office machinery and data processing sector.  The poor performance of the more traditional industrial sectors was due largely to increasing import penetration of our market combined with a fall-off in domestic demand. An analysis of the domestic market indicates that about one-third of the loss of output of domestic manufacturers in the period 1980-85 was due to a fall in domestic demand and about two-thirds due to increased import penetration.</P>
    <P>During 1986 over 11,000 first time jobs were created in IDA-supported industries, while SFADCo created over 900 jobs in the Shannon free zone and in small indigenous industry in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Despite the increasingly competitive environment for mobile international investment, the IDA negotiated over £550 million in planned new investment in 1986 which reflects a substantial increase in investment from overseas.  It is expected that 15,700 jobs will be created as a result of this investment; 12,400 of these jobs are in new projects or the expansion of the overseas industrial base already in Ireland.  In addition 3,300 jobs <Col N="176" /> were negotiated through technology transfer agreements with Irish companies which include takeovers and joint ventures approved by SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>On the home front considerable activity has also taken place.  Small Irish firms committed investment of some £42 million in 1986, and 450 firms of the 800 approved for assistance are start ups which augurs well for the entrepreneurial spirit in the country.</P>
    <P>There is also a renewed effort to encourage development among mature Irish firms.  In 1986 the level of investment negotiated with such firms of £110 million was disappointing.  I believe the potential for development of our major firms is enormous and I will be referring to this later in my speech.</P>
    <P>As to performance in 1987, the latest economic commentary from the Economic and Social Research Institute predicts that the volume of manufactured exports and production will continue to grow during 1987 by 5 per cent.  Investment in industry is expected to continue at a slightly higher level than in 1986 resulting in the creation of about 11,000 new jobs in IDA-backed firms and 1,200 jobs in SFADCo firms.</P>
    <P>The IDA will intensify their industrial promotion strategy in the Far East where significant projects were approved from Taiwan and South Korea in 1986.  The recent expansion of the IDA's Tokyo office and the establishment of an office in Seoul were part of the drive to promote Ireland as a suitable investment location for Far Eastern countries where there is considerable potential for industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>On industrial policy, for some time now I have been concerned about the emphasis being placed on the interventionist approach to industrial policy in the form of State agencies, industrial grants and tax concessions.  I have long held the view that the role of the State in supporting industrial growth required a balance to be struck between the level of direct support and the creation of a positive environment in which industrial activity would flourish and lead to <Col N="177" /> improved economic performance in all sectors.</P>
    <P>The net contribution of the existing interventionist regime has not led to the degree of industrial growth we hoped for when we first embarked on this policy. Manufacturing employment in 1986 was only 20,000 higher than in 1963, when the country was in a pre-industrialised state.  Of the 20 largest indigenous plants in Ireland in 1973, four have closed and the employment in the remainder at the end of 1985 was only half of its 1973 level. Output growth &mdash; which has slowed to below 3 per cent in each of the last two years &mdash; has been concentrated in the modern subsectors of electronics and chemicals which are dominated by overseas companies.  Profitability in indigenous industry is extremely poor and investment is at very low levels.</P>
    <P>While the budget involved reductions in the levels of direct State support for industry, these reductions have, I believe, been well understood by industry generally.  This is because they realise only too well that the substantial Exchequer investment in industry &mdash; between £370 million and £400 million each year since 1984 and tax incentives and allowances of £250 million per year &mdash; cannot be preserved in a situation when general cuts in expenditure elsewhere are demanded by the economic circumstances which we face.</P>
    <P>The Government's basic strategy towards industry is to boost investment and confidence through addressing the critical imbalance in the public finances which is at the root of such problems as unemployment, high interest rates and penal levels of taxation.  These are the critical obstacles preventing growth and enterprise in our country.  The budget strategy has already paid off with interbank interest rates having fallen by 2.5 per cent and with significant declines in the rates to business.  There is still a long way to go in order to stimulate the growth in our economy that is so badly needed. I believe that a greater level of commitment in tackling the business environment is urgently required if we are to take advantage of the great opportunities <Col N="178" /> that will be afforded us in the wake of the completion of the internal market within the Community by 1992, and, indeed, opportunities which exist even now for Irish products further afield.</P>
    <P>Industrialists realise only too well the benefits which can accrue from a more positive overall environment for investment. They know that interest rate reductions of the order which I have mentioned &mdash; and indeed with the prospect of more to come &mdash; are much more beneficial to them in terms of competitiveness, market share and profitability than a relatively small reduction in the aggregate level of direct Exchequer grants to industry which would at worst impact only marginally on the level of job approvals achieved.</P>
    <P>Despite the major decline in the rate of inflation in recent years, the benefits which should have come our way were severely reduced by the lack of a similar level of decline in interest rates.  This, together with the volatility in exchange rates and a lack of confidence in the economy presented a serious setback to growth in the economy.  These are the reasons we must concentrate more on the importance of the environment for industry and why the need for cuts in public expenditure, including the levels of direct support for industry, become fully apparent.</P>
    <P>However, I would not wish to convey the impression that the level of direct investment in industry is not providing a good return to the Exchequer, nor would I wish to suggest that the valuable contribution of the State agencies involved in this work is somehow redundant in favour of the approach I have outlined here.  Rather I would prefer to think in terms of a simultaneous attack on the way we have pursued our industrial policy heretofore, where we recognise the importance of the contribution of both approaches and ensure that they are applied in a co-ordinated and logical way to the overall benefit of industrial growth and employment.</P>
    <P>It is undeniably true that the structure of our industrial base is such that we need to offer direct support to industry seeking <Col N="179" /> to develop in competition with overseas firms for world markets and also to attract new overseas projects to Ireland in the face of very strong competition from other European countries with the advantages of better strategic location.  This situation is not going to alter radically in the medium term but we must, nevertheless, examine how we can secure a greater proportion of inward investment at a better return to the Exchequer.  We must also aim to develop the necessary skills and resources to develop a strong forward-looking, export oriented, indigenous industry skilfully exploiting the expertise that is needed today in areas such as marketing and technology.  These were amongst the areas which were analysed in the <i>Review of Industrial Performance 1986,</i> published recently by my Department.</P>
    <P>The review concluded in the case of overseas industry that the Irish incentive package is still attractive by international comparison and that a push for a better return for State assistance to such projects was fully justified.  Already a certain amount has been achieved in that promoters are accepting performance related clauses and parent company guarantees in grant agreements without any undue concern about such projects locating elsewhere.  I am in full agreement with the further decision in the review to reduce the level of State support for fixed asset investments in overseas projects to 45 per cent and 30 per cent in designated and non-designated areas respectively, leaving the excess to be made up by the use of State equity, loan guarantees or deferred grants or a combination of any or all of these.  This decision will not only lead to a better Exchequer return on its investment, it will also encourage the location in Ireland of better quality projects where overseas promoters would include their key business functions in Ireland, such as marketing and R and D, thereby creating a more long term and fully integrated operation here.  These are the overseas projects in which we need to concentrate our resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> However, foreign industry alone will not be sufficient to realise our ambitions for growth and employment.  The key to a strong and developing industrial sector is indigenous Irish industry.  However, it is also this sector which has been our Achilles heel when it comes to gearing up for international competition.  The problem with many such firms is that they operate in traditional low cost product segments or they depend on the small domestic market and are increasingly being plagued by competing imports.</P>
    <P>In current value terms, competing imports increased their share of domestic consumption from 34 per cent in 1980 to 41 per cent in 1985.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> indicated that, side by side with vigorous export development, we will strengthen manufacturers in the home market by import substitution within the public sector.  There is considerable scope for improvement in this area consistent with our EC obligations.</P>
    <P>The increasing level of import penetration in the consumer products market also is striking evidence of the failure on the part of indigenous industry to counter competition from abroad in key product areas such as food, textiles, clothing, footwear and furniture.  It is difficult to see how the full potential for the development of indigenous industry can be secured unless there is a major concentration on assisting Irish firms to retain and regain domestic sales.</P>
    <P>There are a number of initiatives in place to support Irish firms in this area including the marketing support services of the Irish Goods Council designed to assist smaller companies, the national linkage programme, which is aimed at developing a successful industrial sub-supply base and the initiatives aimed at encouraging major purchasers, both private and public, to adopt a more supportive attitude to indigenous manufacturers by providing easier access to their buyers, facilities for merchandising activities and arrangements for feedback of information on likely demands and products.  In the public sector particularly there is considerable room for improvement in the level of <Col N="181" /> information provided in relation to purchasing intentions and a number of further initiatives in that regard will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>Many of our medium and large indigenous firms suffer from management weaknesses and only one-third, approximately 200, are estimated to have significant growth potential in internationally traded markets.  These are the companies that are appropriate to the company development programme.  The programme was initiated with the intention of redressing the problems which have inhibited the development of indigenous companies, helping them in turn to identify and implement strategic initiatives and programmes.  In 1986, 45 firms completed the company development exercise and a further 50 firms will be covered in 1987.  While the review highlighted problems of co-ordination with the programme I am satisfied that these problems can be ironed out in the context of my Department's examination of the most appropriate means of operating the programme in the future.</P>
    <P>My Department will also undertake a review of the small industry programme during the course of this year.  The need for this review arises from the fact that while there are optimistic signs for this sector, in that it has achieved a net increase in employment, this increase can be attributed almost entirely to start-up activity leaving a vacuum in the area of expansion of new small firms.  It seems to me that a partial redirection of State assistance is what is needed in order to provide help of a more directly operational nature.  In this regard I have asked the agencies to adopt a more developmental approach to indigenous companies to help them focus on the strategic development aspects of their enterprises. However the long term initiatives to redress this imbalance can only be considered in the light of a full analysis which will identify the factors which impede small firms from growing into medium-sized firms.  The small industry review will also identify the conditions under which a greater proportion of funding to small industry projects can be achieved <Col N="182" /> by recourse to equity participation instead of an over-reliance on State assistance in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>There is one final area of my Department's review of industrial performance on which I would like to comment briefly. This is the conclusion that there is a need to rationalise the institutional arrangements associated with industrial policy as it is currently organised and delivered. The move towards rationalisation has been greeted generally, both inside this House and outside, with much interest and a general desire to know more about the approach to be adopted in effectively implementing such a rationalisation programme. The House will appreciate the enormity of the task ahead when I say that there are at present 3,400 staff involved in 20 separate institutions engaged in supporting industry in one way or another.  This fragmentation of resources, despite co-ordination efforts, must inevitably lead to duplication of effort and a waste of valuable and costly resources.  Indeed the survey of attitudes of senior executives in the review showed quite a concern amongst industrialists about the duplication of agencies with a substantial number of them, 86 per cent, believing that there are too many agencies involved in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to rush headlong into an exercise involving the engagement of outside consultants to produce a quick fix solution which might do more harm than good.  I have commenced the first phase of the exercise along the lines of (a) a clear statement of objectives which would include a longer term vision of the objectives of industrial policy combined with a concern to work within the public expenditure profile which is likely in coming years; (b) the optimal organisational arrangements to deliver these objectives; and (c) an indication of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy, published by the previous Government in 1984, set a target for growth in net manufacturing employment of between 3,000 and 6,000 a year.  Not only was this target not achieved but there has been an average reduction of 6,000 jobs each year <Col N="183" /> in manufacturing employment during 1983 to 1986.  My principal objective as Minister for Industry and Commerce is to reverse that trend.  I believe that the new Government have made a good start, that confidence is improving and developmental policies are being speedily introduced.</P>
    <P>It is clear to everybody that the development of an Irish food industry will be the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the relevant sector of that Department having responsibility for the development of the food industry.  I have already made arrangements in my Department to have officers who deal with the food sector there transferred to the Department of Agriculture within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Bord Glas and the allocation of staff to that board is another clear indication of the Government's commitment and positive approach to tackling the scandal of the importation of vegetable and horticultural products.</P>
    <P>In the other developmental area there was the announcement by the Government and their commitment to the establishment of an international financial services centre at the Custom House docks site.  I expect that the development plans for the Custom House docks site will be announced within the next two weeks.  I expect to be in the United States with the IDA in approximately two weeks' time to market this new financial services centre.  I believe it has great potential in Dublin, with the right tax environment now put in place, and the supply of highly skilled graduates.  Surely this must constitute the first step in stopping the brain drain from this country, to retain the people in whom we have invested our money at home in as large numbers as possible, ensuring their commitment to the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation Ltd., commenced operations on 11 June 1986, the vesting date on which it took over from the National Enterprise Agency.  The increased level of funding <Col N="184" /> allocated to NADCORP for 1987 by way of grant in aid for administrative expenses reflects the fact that this year is the corporation's first full year in operation.</P>
    <P>The immediate priorities of the corporation in their earlier stages were the progression of proposals and the completion of investment commitments inherited from the NEA as well as the active management of a portfolio of NEA investments, including operational subsidiaries, which had been vested in the corporation on 11 June.  At the same time the board had the task of putting in place the permanent staff structures and procedures to enable the corporation to fulfil their commercial and developmental role as set out in their legislation.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the appointment of a managing director, these structures have now been established and NADCORP is fully operational and able to adopt a more active approach to identifying suitable investment opportunities. The provision in the Public Capital Programme for investment purposes by NADCORP in this year is £7 million.</P>
    <P>To date NADCORP, of its own right, have approved investments totalling over £6 million as well as completing further investments in respect of commitments taken over from NEA.  The corporation's report for the period 11 June 1986 to 31 December 1986 will be presented to me shortly and subsequently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised that a major problem facing many Irish-owned firms in the traded goods and services sector is their lack of an adequate equity capital base leading to an over-reliance on bank borrowings as well as a continued dependency on State aid.  Up to recently, there has been a marked reluctance in our small to medium-sized companies to seek equity investment in their businesses from outside sources.  With the general development in venture capital activity in recent years attitudes to outside equity investment are changing.  Outside equity offers many advantages.  It is free of interest and does not have to be repaid.</P>
    <P>It gives a company that extra financial <Col N="185" /> leeway that can at times mean the difference between closure and success. Outside investors can, with their investment, bring new expertise, experience, disciplines and new growth ambitions to a company which are so essential in the current competitive business environment obtaining today.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme, which has encouraged the investment of over £12 million by way of new equity in 125 smaller companies by outside investors to date, has helped to change the attitude of promoters to outside investment. However, it is disappointing that so little use has been made so far of the facilities available in the Stock Exchange, particularly its smaller companies market, for the raising of capital.  If our smaller indigenous companies are to become strong, it is essential that they be prepared to go out to the market to seek the investment funds that are available there so that their development will not be restricted by the lack of adequate capital.</P>
    <P>NADCORP have an important role to play in industrial and job creation strategy. As the States venture capital agency it can complement the grant, loan and advisory functions of the other State industrial development agencies and either on its own account or by leveraging in other investors can act as a catalyst in the initiation of new projects that might not otherwise get off the ground.</P>
    <P>There are several benefits perceived in having NADCORP as an investor, as opposed to private venture capital companies. As the State venture capital agency, and within its commercial remit, NADCORP can invest in higher risk enterprises of a national strategic nature. It is also a more patient investor than most private venture capital companies, and is prepared to wait somewhat longer for a return on its investment.  A further advantage is that NADCORP is prepared to invest in smaller firms.  Private sector venture capital companies tend to invest amounts of not less than £100,000 and enterprises seeking amounts of less than this figure can experience difficulty in obtaining equity capital.  NADCORP is helping to fill this gap in the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> I am currently considering NADCORP's business plan which sets out its strategy for the next few years.</P>
    <P>Of course, production can be of no benefit to industry unless it can be sold, and at a profit.  For us today, with an export oriented industry, it is crucial that we secure, and maintain, access to our foreign markets.  A critical factor in this is our membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Most Favoured Nation Clause&rdquo;, a fundamental principle of the GATT, enables Ireland to enter third country markets on the same footing as every other member including the more powerful trading countries.  Because of our critical dependence on exports for employment and economic recovery we have a vital interest in maintaining and strengthening the GATT, which embodies the idea of a free international trading system.</P>
    <P>Threats to the authority of the GATT and the ordered world trading system were posed by the increased protectionism, and threatened trade wars. Trends towards bilateralism, part of the armoury of US trade negotiations, are of particular concern of open economies such as Ireland, which are vulnerable because of our small size.  Consequently Ireland was supportive of calls by the European Community and others for the launch of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations.  This new round, destined to restore discipline to world trade and to contribute to its expansion, was launched last September in Uruguay.  I am confident that an enhanced framework both for the trade in manufactured goods traditionally dealt with by GATT and the new and growing subject of services, which is something new in the negotiations, will emerge and provide a positive trading climate for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Welcome as the new round of multilateral trade negotiations may be it is clear that, given our crucial dependency on exports to the European market, the growth and further liberalisation of that market is equally vital.  It takes more than 70 per cent of our total exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> Hidden protectionism in Europe in the form of physical and technical barriers to trade is probably the single most damaging obstacle to the further expansion of our exports and the attendant creation of much needed employment at home. Until these internal barriers are abolished, the full export potential of our membership of the EC &mdash; which is after all the largest single trading bloc in the world &mdash; will not be achieved and we will not be able to reap the full commercial benefits to which we aspire for our people.  Neither will firms throughout other countries in the Community be able to achieve their full potential in competing efficiently and aggressively with US and Japanese companies both on the European and world markets.  Given our dependency on exports to other more prosperous member states, we have a vital interest in maintaining their prosperity so that they may continue to increase their imports from us.</P>
    <P>The creation of a true obstacle-free common market has been boosted by the acceptance of the Single European Act by the Irish people.  Indeed, the fulsome debate we have just engaged in has clearly shown how the people realise that our commercial wellbeing in the future is dependent on our exports to the Community. With the hoped for improvement in decision making which will follow the Act's ratification and implementation, we can expect to see a distinct improvement in the environment for our exports and experience hand in hand further employment opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>The fact that growth in volume terms of 1 per cent to 2 per cent was recorded in 1986 represents a solid performance by exporters in the climate in which they have to operate.  Merchandise exports, down from their record high of £9,744 million in 1985, were valued at £9,387 million in 1986.  These figures, however, mask the upturn in economic activity in our main markets as a result of the decline in oil prices which became evident in the latter part of 1986.  This improvement should gather momentum throughout <Col N="188" /> 1987.  The volume of world trade is expected to grow by about 4 per cent this year.  In the OECD countries, which account for about 90 per cent of Irish trade, economic growth should be about 3 per cent and this should afford Irish exporters new opportunities for expansion in world markets.</P>
    <P>In 1987 I expect that merchandise exports will approach the £10 billion mark for the first time ever.  It is expected that the volume growth of Irish exports this year will be between 3 and 4 per cent and this will be combined with an increase in export prices of 1 to 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>For the first four months of 1987 we have recorded a trade surplus of £162 million.  It would be unwise to draw too many conclusions from these figures at this stage of the year but they do provide some grounds for optimism in that there was a discernable pick up in trade over the past six months.  More recently, the CII's survey of business which records the level of a number of key business indicators, has shown that companies' order books are on the increase in the past six months and are now at their highest level since 1980.  In addition production expectations are at their most buoyant since 1980 and companies' capacity utilisation is picking up.  All these indicators bode well for the future. It is my intention and the intention of the Government to create the climate in which Irish exporters will be encouraged to go out and seize these opportunities.</P>
    <P>Exports from Ireland currently represent 64 per cent of our gross domestic product compared with a figure of 15 per cent for Japan, 7 per cent for the USA and a European average of 32 per cent. Another indication of the importance of exports to the Irish economy is the fact that two out of every three jobs in manufacturing industry are export dependent.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the critical role of exports in our economy the Government have allocated £24.272 million to CTT to enable them to carry out their activities in 1987.  Of this figure, £23.022 million is being allocated to CTT's promotional and strategic marketing schemes and <Col N="189" /> £1.25 million is being allocated to the market entry and development scheme.</P>
    <P>In 1986 CTT were originally allocated a total of £25.336 million, of which £24.536 million was given to promotional and strategic programmes and £0.8 million to market entry and development.  These budgetary targets were not fully met in some of CTT's strategic marketing schemes mainly because of the reluctance of firms to meet the new criteria for a strategic marketing approach.  The actual 1986 outturn figures for CTT were £23.758 million for promotional and strategic programmes, £0.582 million for market entry giving a total of £24.340 million.  The amounts not spent were returned to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that given the current economic climate and the 1986 outturn, the 1987 allocation represents a strong commitment to CTT and its activities <i>vis-a-vis</i> the demands by the various other State agencies and the need for major savings across the board.  The overall allocation reflects the Government's commitment to improving the marketing capability of Irish industry, and is a clear indication of the Government's appreciation of the vital importance of export growth to our national wellbeing.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in his interest in the development of financial services in Ireland.  While Minister for Finance, I was involved in negotiating the European mercantile exchange project which, I hope, if it comes through, will involve approximately 1,000 jobs in Dublin in futures trading.  I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce is now responsible for this project and that an IDA feasibility study has been completed.  I hope the Minister will give his personal attention to the project which was initiated during the period of office of the previous Government.  It requires a different type of package to the one that is conventionally given to overseas industrial projects coming into Ireland.  I hope he will be able to cut through the red tape, as I would have done, to ensure that this project, which could provide over 1,000 jobs, is brought into being.  As the first major project in the financial services centre to which the Minister referred, it would be a suitable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask for some information about the role of the Minister of State in the Department in regard to marketing.  He has made a number of statements in recent times, for instance, calling for the amalgamation of CTT and CBF, he has been very critical of CTT and their traditional approach, as he described it, and he has called for trade attaches in foreign embassies.  I would like to know who is in charge of marketing policy in the Department.  Is it the Minister or the Minister of State?  Is it Government policy that CTT and CBF should be amalgamated?  Is it Government policy that we should appoint trade attaches to well-cushioned employment around the world at a time when we do not have enough money to keep nurses in hospitals?  Is it Government policy that responsibility for marketing should be split between trade attaches in embassies and CTT?  I may be a bit of a traditionalist but I believe CTT are doing a reasonably <Col N="191" /> good job and there is no need for trade attaches.  I would like clarification of what is the policy here.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to bring forward very quickly the restrictive practices legislation published by the previous Government.  There is no doubt that importers in certain sectors are making substantial profits because there is not sufficient competition.  We need even stronger legislation than that proposed by the previous Government to ensure that immediate action can be taken in the restrictive practices area to stamp out unfair practices.  At present restrictive practices legislation says that if a particular practice has been identified by an inquiry it can be subsequently banned.  I suggest that a different approach might be adopted.  Certain practices in the trading area should be banned <i>a priori,</i> where anybody who undertakes them can be subsequently prosecuted and fined rather than having individual sectoral examinations before any action can be taken. Unfortunately at the moment, inquiries take so long that by the time they are complete and the legislation is introduced the problem has solved itself because the people who were suffering have gone out of business.  I suggest a system of generalised bans of certain anti-competitive trading practices might be included in the restrictive practices legislation.  That goes further than I proposed when I was Minister. This is something which needs to be talked about because although the legislation we proposed would have speeded up investigations it might not go far enough.</P>
    <P>On a critical note, I would like to know how the IDA are going to do business under the present allocation.  They have a net allocation of approximately £143 million this year, taking into account their own income and what they are given by the Department.  Of that amount, up to one month ago £130 million was already committed to existing projects.  That means they have only £13 million for any new projects submitted during the year. I do not know how they will operate on that amount of money because if one big <Col N="192" /> project comes along that will be their entire budget gone.  That needs to be explained more fully than has been done so far by the Minister.  Generalised statements like &ldquo;their budget is adequate&rdquo; will not satisfy.  We need to get figures.  If my figures are wrong perhaps the Minister will give the right figures.</P>
    <P>I would like information on the progress of the NET-ICI talks in regard to the merger of the two companies.  I would also like information on the initiative I took to have Irish Steel take in an outside foreign partner to develop their equity base.  Irish Steel will not be able to get any equity from the Government and if they are to expand they must get equity somewhere else.  I strongly suggest they do not borrow because they already have too high a borrowing requirement and they need an outside partner.  Is the Minister taking an interest in this?</P>
    <P>I agree with his critical remarks in regard to the interventionist approach in industrial policy.  We need to have a hard look at that.  I think the IDA are extremely good at bringing in foreign industry.  However, the disciplines involved in bringing in foreign industry and in developing existing small firms in this country are entirely different.  I do not believe the IDA have been as successful in the domestic sector.  I am not sure the ethos of the IDA is necessarily the appropriate one for the domestic sector.  It is very difficult to turn an organisation around but I think we need to look at this to see if there is a need to separate these two functions in the IDA so that there is a clearer management focus on domestic industry and its particular needs.</P>
    <P>As far as domestic industry is concerned, there seems to be an assumption that if you undertake a certain type of activity &mdash; for example, if you put in a machine &mdash; then you must get a grant at the maximum level.  Many of the improvements made by domestic industry would have been made whether they were grant aided by the IDA or not.  Therefore, we must ask ourselves if it is reasonable to assume that domestic industries should always get a grant for carrying out these <Col N="193" /> improvements.  This is where we need a different approach.  We can say this about domestic industry but we cannot say it about foreign industry because if we do not give grants to foreign industry they will go somewhere else but domestic industries do not have the same option. Therefore, a different approach, and perhaps completely different codes of grants, might be appropriate if we can make that distinction without being in contravention of EC rules.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us why NADCORP have not succeeded in appointing a managing director.  That is a scandal when one takes into account the time this corporation has been in existence.  The Minister should spend a lot of time considering the internal market of the EC.  I know that one of the reasons Travenol closed in Castlebar was that the company had another plant in France.  They knew if they closed the French plant they would lose sales of their products in the French health care market because the French health care authorities discriminate, although they should not do so under the Treaty of Rome, in favour of firms with plants in France.  That has to be stopped if a peripheral small country like Ireland is to have any chance of attracting industry. One of the places it can be stopped is in the internal market.  The adoption of the Single European Act is very important for industrial development because it will enable us to do something about that type of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Why have the CTT grants for marketing failed?  The Minister said it was because of a reluctance of firms to meet the new criteria for a strategic marketing approach.  I was responsible for those criteria so I am not criticising the Minister, but if the grants are not working one should ask why.  One should not simply assume that the firms are stupid.  Perhaps there is something wrong with the criteria I set, <i>mea culpa.</i> Perhaps we should change them or perhaps the criteria are such that they indicate to a firm they will only get a grant if they absolutely need it; in other words, if they are on the floor. If they say that, then the only firms to <Col N="194" /> whom we will be giving grants will be those which are so poor they will never do a damn thing.  If we want to pick winners it means giving money to firms which are strong, but if we want to be selective with support we will give assistance to firms which are weak.  This means we are in conflict with ourselves.  I would like to know what is the legal status, if any, of the office of trade and marketing under the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan.  Is it any different from the office occupied by my brother, Deputy Richard Bruton, other than in title?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister care to speculate why firms have not used the smaller companies market?  I was very keen on that but it has been a relative flop.  The Stock Exchange should be asked why it is not working.  They should be asked to change their rules or firms asked to change their behaviour in order to ensure that that market is a success.  It was fine when it was set up and it looked good but it has not worked and we must ask questions about it.</P>
    <P>We had to step in in two cases, when in Government, to rescue insurance companies, PMPA and ICI.  There can be lots of arguments about whether we did the right thing but one thing is certain, we kept those companies on the road and prevented a banking crisis and, certainly, an insurance crisis in both cases.  However, we introduced crisis measures to take the companies into a form of public ownership under the supervision of the court but crisis measures should not become permanent solutions. Running insurance companies through the agency of accountancy firms who are being paid very large fees for the privilege of running them is not the best way to manage such concerns.  There is no reason why those two companies should remain in a form of State ownership for ever.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider finding a way of selling those companies, or the State's interest in them, as quickly as possible. The recovery programme they have is good as far as it goes but it will probably go on forever if it is allowed.  I suggest that the Minister should not allow it to <Col N="195" /> go on forever and that he tackles the issue as quickly as possible.  That was not possible for the previous Government because the rescue had only taken place but the Minister may have a chance to do something about this in the next few months.</P>
    <P>I should like to question the Minister in regard to his plans for the allocation of resources in industry.  In the White Paper on Industrial Policy the previous Government published a graph which showed how we saw industrial funds being distributed between technology, acquisition, marketing, R and D, training, machinery and factory construction in 1988.  That was the policy of the previous Government and I should like to know if it is the Minister's policy.  If it is not his policy will he explain his policy to the House in regard to the allocation of funds?</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's view about the level of electricity and telephone costs for industry?  Are they too high?  Is the Minister satisfied that he has enough clout to do something about those costs? Does he intend to continue with the cost-monitoring committee which I established? Does the Minister believe that that committee is strong enough and if not, does he believe it can be given further teeth to enable it to be effective in this area?  Will the Minister explain the position in regard to the new role of the Minister for Agriculture and Food <i>vis-a-vis</i> the IDA?  I understood that the IDA were responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce but it seems that the IDA will now have to report to two Ministers.  They will have to report in regard to most of their work to the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and will have to report in regard to the work of their food division to another Minister.  Surely that will create a system of schizophrenia in the IDA.  Will there be two separate budgets for the IDA, the IDA food budget under the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the IDA industry budget under the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  If that will not be the case then the idea of transferring civil <Col N="196" /> servants from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of Agriculture is a cod.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA should be under the control of one Minister.  To have the IDA reporting to two Ministers is a recipe for a lot of trouble as far as proper control of expenditure is concerned. In my view AnCO should be under the Minister for Industry and Commerce and not under the Minister for Labour.  The vask bulk of their work is concerned with industrial development and it is wrong that such a huge sum of money, some of which is being spent on projects that are being carried out by CTT, such as training and marketing, is being spent out of the Vote of the Department of Labour.  That is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I should like to make two suggestions to the Minister as far as the GATT round is concerned.  My views on this topic are on record following the OECD meeting in Paris last year.  Under the GATT rules there should be the ability for a citizen to pursue his or her own government if that government acts contrary to GATT principles. Consumers are ripped off whenever a government fail to apply GATT principles but consumers in member states have no means of hauling their own governments over the coals for doing so. There should be a possibility for third party complaints.  If Japan and America sign a voluntary agreement in regard to semi-conductors there should be the possibility for Ireland, or Europe, to complain to GATT about that but as long as two countries agree at the moment nobody can complain.  That is unsatisfactory. If Japanese semi-conductors are kept out of America they are diverted to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted most of the decisions of the Review of Industrial Performance published by the last Government before they left office.  I should like to raise one or two matters in regard to that.  In regard to the data base being <Col N="197" /> established on value for money for industrial policy the Minister told me in the House recently that he does not have any intention of publishing that data base or allowing anybody, other than his own officials, have access to it.  I realise that some of the material in the data base is confidential but I hope that an abbreviated or truncated form of the data base will be publicly available or available to Members of the House.  We should know if we are getting good or bad value for industrial policy.  It is a matter of public interest as well as being a matter of interest to the Minister and his officials. The Minister should consider allowing access to the non-confidential information.</P>
    <P>When will the White Paper on science and technology be published?  When will the consultants be appointed in regard to the rationalisation of agencies?  I note that the Minister seemed to be pulling back from the idea that consultants should be appointed immediately and I am not so sure that he is wrong.  It may be a waste of money.  In my view the best consultant that can be obtained in regard to the agencies that should be rationalised is the Minister, possibly with a little help from one or two former Ministers for Industry and Commerce who should be readily available, if sought.  We do not need people who will be paid huge sums, probably in dollars, to tell us what we already know.  I suggest to the Minister that he take his courage in his hands and if he is going to amalgamate a few bodies he should do so rather than waiting around for consultants to tell him when he can do so.  That is a suggestion and I hope the Minister accepts it in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the cutback in the allocation to the Irish Goods Council, an excellent organisation.  The allocation made by the previous Government should not be cut.  I understand that £94,000 is involved and I will not make a big deal about that.  I wish to make an inquiry in regard to the grant to the Irish Productivity Centre.  The previous Government gave that centre a grant to carry out studies on encouraging worker <Col N="198" /> shareholding in industry.  The grant has been cut by the Government and I should like to know if that means that their study on worker shareholding in industry will be scrapped.  If that is so the Government have made a wrong decision because a lot of money can be saved by good industrial relations and good harmony in industry. Work shareholding is one way of getting that.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that the IDA before giving a grant to a company &mdash; this was in the White Paper published by the previous Government &mdash; should ensure that the company have a proper quality control procedure within their own organisation?  There is no point in giving grants for more expenditure to companies that are not properly controlling the quality of what they produce with existing equipment.  I know the IDA do not want to have to do this because it amounts to their having to ask another question.  The more questions they have to ask companies the more work IDA executives are involved in.  However, given that they are dealing with a lot of money it seems foolish to be giving grants to companies that do not have a formalised quality control procedure.  Quality control has developed to such an extent that there is a system right through from purchasing to sales with all the intermediate procedures.  A grant should not be given to anybody who does not have a quality control procedure.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what co-ordination problems occurred in regard to the company development approach to which he referred in his speech.  He said it did not seem to be working very well.  What went wrong?  I am sceptical about this because it involves the IDA becoming a sort of godfather who is involved very frequently with companies, pointing out their strategic interests.  I do not hold the view that businessmen know everything; very often they do not necessarily know what is good for themselves, otherwise companies would not go bust.  On the other hand, I do not hold the view that people in agencies necessarily know better.  I would like &mdash; perhaps not in this abbreviated debate <Col N="199" />&mdash; to have a fuller report from the Minister on how the company development approach has worked.  The IDA were extremely keen on the idea and they were going to do great things.  Has it achieved much?  From the figures the Minister quoted in regard to indigenous industries it has not been such a marvellous success. Perhaps it is early days but the Minister should give a report on the subject as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to convey my best wishes to the Minister in his term of office.  He is well qualified for the job and I hope he has a short but happy tenure of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I also extend my good wishes to the Minister.  I wish to make a few remarks on how my colleagues and I hope that the Minister will proceed.  The areas that lie within his ambit of responsibility are germane to the economic wellbeing of the country and the Minister's success will lay the foundation for the next decade or two in relation to our economy and to the people who are lining up at the Passport Office.</P>
      <P>A whole range of options and possibilities need consideration.  Even though it does not fall immediately within the ambit of the Minister's responsibility, a priority in getting a national consensus for any form of action which the Minister and the Government wish to introduce will be the reform of this institution.  It is not just a question of common sense, justice and correct procedure; it is also a way of ensuring that the people who look to this House &mdash; perhaps less and less &mdash; for leadership will believe we are serious in our intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the development of industrial policy, I was pleased and interested to hear the Minister referring to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance 1986</i> published by his Department.  It is a very interesting document which, if I may say without disrespect to anyone, was unusually frank for a Government Department and, because of that, it received scant attention from other Government Departments or indeed from the Government. I am pleased the Minister seems to <Col N="200" /> be taking on board some of its contents. It is not possible to develop the theme of economic development unless one does so bearing in mind the need for social justice.  The improvement of living standards and job opportunities will ultimately depend on the added value output of goods and traded services in home and overseas markets.  That is a matter for enterprises in both private and public sectors, both of which can offer great opportunities if a number of conditions are laid down.  One of those conditions is the concept of economic democracy: I am talking about participative shareholding and investment by workers in public sector employment.</P>
    <P>There is a traditional attitude here to home ownership of which we have the highest rate in the industrial nations. There is also a traditional attitude in rural communities to the importance of owning land which should permeate the area of industrial development.  Workers should be entitled to feel they could have a share in their enterprises, both public and private. If that is pursued logically and rationally it will not just bring about greater social justice, it will help to create an enormous momentum in terms of improving industrial development and success.  At present, unfortunately, the conflict approach to which the Minister referred is implicit in the way we pursue industrial relations and the kind of major blocs which represent workers and employers.  This is the antithesis of what we should be doing if we wish to build a consensus.</P>
    <P>I argue very strongly that public sector employees who, because they are to some extent accountable to Government could give the lead, should be facilitated in having shares in their enterprises. In due course, my colleagues in the party and I will be spelling out in greater detail some broad suggestions in this respect. The concept of economic democracy is germane to a healthy society and good for us all from the point of view of creating a sense of belonging.  It is also good for us economically because it means that people get some degree of reward in relation to effort and have a sense of <Col N="201" /> responsibility for the enterprises in which they work.  The concept of economic democracy is essential.</P>
    <P>It is past time that there was a dramatic and radical rationalisation and regionalisation of the wide ambit of State and semi-State bodies active in the area of industrial promotion.  I am reluctant in a sense to go down this road because I am troubled by the fact that these bodies are, to some extent, easy targets and they are apparently expected to be passive and absorbent and not to answer back.  At present State and semi-State bodies need a radical review of their function, purpose and role and their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House or in those bodies can deny there are significant areas where their remit has become very fuzzy.  There is a degree of overlap and duplication.  That aids and abets what I would call a buckshot approach to investment, the grant aiding and spending public moneys by the Government in the sense that a whole gamut of industrial endeavour is open for grant aiding instead of perhaps a much more narrowly focussed and selective approach by Government in consultation with the various interests deciding on the key areas of economic activity which we believe to be appropriate for job creation and, more importantly, to be areas in which we could achieve excellence.  It seems nonsensical for us to enter into competition with Britain and West Germany and other countries in areas which we presently grant aid but in which we will never be able to fully compete.  If you are going to focus the investment in key areas, for example, in food processing, you are going to have to take it from somewhere else and perhaps that is the hardest part of it but this buckshot approach, throwing money in every direction, is a waste of money and has resulted in a diffusion of State resources.</P>
    <P>We should decide those areas which are essential to us as a nation, those areas in which we can achieve standards of excellence, those areas which serve key markets and which are not already being served, and those areas in which we have particular skills and educational <Col N="202" /> resources and go after them while by and large allowing the others to fade away. That will mean that we will have to review, rationalise and, where appropriate, regionalise the State and semi-State structures to cope with that targetting. That does not happen at present. There are a number of State and semi-State bodies which in some cases were set up decades ago and which have carried out excellent work in establishing a bridgehead or in meeting a temporary need and which are still in existence because, metaphorically, no one wants to put a gun to their heads.  Nobody wants to say to them that their time has come and that they are no longer needed in the way they used be needed.  A focus on industrial development does not exist at present.  If one was asked to sum up the industrial development profile of this country they would have to say that it is very fuzzy.  We are the fourth largest exporter of micro-technology in the world yet we are an agricultural country. We are supposed to be big in tourism but are we?  Last year we spent £30 million in this area.</P>
    <P>Where are we going to be when we grow up industrially?  Until we answer that question it follows logically that the structures that are in place will be similarly confused by the lack of clarity of target and it follows that the resources we are applying in the various areas are either being mis-spent or misapplied or that the emphasis is not correct.  We must know what we are going after and all other things may then follow.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to our approach must be that we reduce drastically the over-regulation and the over-bureaucratic approach by Government to enterprise. I am not just talking about private enterprise, I am talking about semi-State enterprise.  It is preposterous that there are semi-State bodies who in one week can receive between 70 and 80 pieces of correspondence from the Department of Industry and Commerce asking specific questions regarding their activities.  That correspondence is unnecessary because the information will already have been supplied but it results in heads of staff <Col N="203" /> filling out ludicrous questionnaires to which subsequently people pay no attention. That is happening.  Until such time as we reduce to a minimum this over-regulation and strangulation through this unnecessary paper work all we are doing is depressing people who will ask what is the point of their trying if every time they want to do something they are hindered and inhibited by a Department who, with no disrespect meant to them, may not necessarily have either the expertise, insight or the experience to know what the marketplace needs or demands. Again, from our point of view, there is a very strong need to reduce Government involvement in economic activity &mdash; State, semi-State and private.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is room for a dramatic improvement in this respect and a vast overhaul of the duplication of work.  I do not see any reason for several levels of auditing and several levels of accountability.  For example, if there is an evaluation of the work of a semi-State body, another evaluation will take place by the Department.  We could also pose questions on that matter and ask how well those evaluations are being done in view of certain disasters which have taken place in recent years but on this occasion I will not do so.</P>
    <P>If we could row back on regulation and get the Government off the backs of as many people as possible, we would free up the sense of enterprise among people. The level of Government management of the economy in general terms is reflected at both national and local level. Government involvement in the economy is of the order of 70 per cent of national output.  That is incredible.  It is the highest single statistic of Government intervention in any democracy that I am aware of.  It is continuing to happen.  An incredible array of institutional structures are employed in running this country.  It is incredible that a country of this size with a population that one could almost lose in, say, the city of London has more than 40 local authorities, eight health boards, God knows how many vocational education committees, 15 Government <Col N="204" /> Departments and a plethora of agencies and semi-State bodies, etc., spending a sum of money which is smaller in size than the budgets of many international companies which are run under one management. Unless that incredible house of cards is shaken down, we can imagine what will happen at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>There has to be a strong emphasis on the development of all relevant areas of internationally traded services, such as financial services, tourism and a whole range of professional services.  I have heard the Minister suggest this in the past.  If necessary, the mandates of the various semi-State bodies must be looked at in order to give them that facility.  Until recently those services were somehow considered to be inferior as regards their potential for job creation and economic activity and development.  Of course there is no truth in that.  Indeed, in many cases the argument perhaps is in the other direction.  As a nation which invests heavily in education particularly we have the potential to give an outstanding quality of service.  There appears to be a certain amount of indifference to the need to provide an improved climate for the development of internationally traded services using Ireland as a base.  That indifference should cease and there should be a major commitment in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a redeployment of public service personnel to the greatest possible extent in areas related to economic development and to the enforcement of public revenue collection, the elimination of abuses in the use of public expenditure programmes and the elimination of the black economy.  This can only happen if and when there is some degree of reduction in tax levels.  As the recent budget added 14 per cent in real terms or over £300 million to the level of taxation, this does not look like happening. The reason the black economy is a boom area is because high taxation levels are driving ordinary people into all kinds of gymnastics in order to avoid paying tax.  That will continue to happen as long as the tax take is as big as it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> The extraordinarily high level of personal taxation has to be dealt with and the only way of dealing with it is to reduce public expenditure.  There is no easy way around that but if we do not reduce taxation levels we are going to lose more and more money out of the legitimate economy.  Estimates show that in 1985 the black economy was worth almost £2,000 million or 12 per cent of GDP.  All the estimates will have to be hazy as no one knows precisely the size of the black economy but that is an estimate which comes from people who should know.</P>
    <P>In the area of abuses in public expenditure programmes I want to draw attention again to the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General which year in year out give incredible examples of systematic wasteful deficiencies in the way the Government spend taxpayers' money.  In many cases it involves systematic fraud, deliberate falsification of documents by people in public employment. That is not my allegation; these are the allegations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I cannot understand why this is allowed to continue when we look every year at the same Departments, the same health boards, the same areas of Government misspending and abusing taxpayers' money and nobody held to be accountable.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention, in passing, to one very important paragraph in the most recent report which is 1985 &mdash; that is symptomatic in itself &mdash; of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he says:</P>
    <P>With the optimum utilisation of the resources now available, in my opinion it will not be possible to achieve an adequate level of audit examination in all areas of departmental expenditure and revenue on a continuing basis and the timely completion of the audits and accounts of some State-sponsored bodies and departmental funds.  Bad as it was, it is now going to get worse.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister that we should review all subsidies and grants with a view to targeting on need, whether that need be economic need in pursuit of the targets I mentioned already which <Col N="206" /> should be clearly defined or, indeed, targets in the areas of social justice.  There is indiscriminate grant aiding, in some cases in direct contravention of our approach to employment, say, for example, agricultural re-equipment grants which automatically disemploy people.  If we decide that is the road to go, fine, but it is indiscriminate and arbitrary. Nobody has thought about it.  I want the lack of clarity in the mandate of public enterprises cleared up.  None of them knows what it is at, none has clear targets to aim at and there is no absolute list of State-sponsored bodies available even from Government.  That is because State-sponsored bodies, in my definition, are those who receive public funds, but that is not what the Department believe State-sponsored bodies to be.  That is a different and more exclusive type of definition.  We do not know where public money is being spent and, therefore, that money is not being used in pursuit of the targets for which this Government would claim to have a mandate.  There is a lack of clarity in respect of the role, functions and financing of local authorities which are, or could be, enterprises.  Perhaps they should be run as public utilities.  At present they account for some 10 per cent of GDP, a very low rate of return on investment in indigenous Irish industry which obviously cannot go on because we will not get the investment.</P>
    <P>I want to advocate strongly private sector participation in public infrastructural projects.  I am talking here about investment not just by multinational corporations; I am talking about investment by ordinary citizens in pension funds &mdash; anybody who has a few bob to invest and there may not be that many of them left out there.  That investment should be on a commercial basis. There should be no underwriting or guaranteeing by the State.  It is an area of risk.  If it is an investment opportunity with appropriate returns, there cannot be the safety net of the taxpayer once gain.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, we have a major task to do if we are going to focus clearly on industrial policy, on the targets that at present are totally vague.  I do not know <Col N="207" /> what we want to pursue industrially.  We must create the structures to pursue those targets and that will mean major rationalisation of some of the existing State and semi-State bodies, putting the funds to pursue that into place and setting up structures which have clear accountability for those funds and actually monitor their effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point on which I started.  The very first thing this Government should do is to review this House, this institution, and cut out some of the nonsense and abuses that are going on here so that that will give a lead.  In the next few weeks this party will be tabling a Bill to deal with one area of that abuse, that is the area of people who are still active in this House and at the same time drawing pensions as former Ministers. If we give that kind of lead, we can communicate our gravity of purpose and our genuineness of intent to the people out there, who may actually then begin to listen to us once again.  Long ago they have turned off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Reynolds, has already addressed the major areas for which the Department of Industry and Commerce have overall responsibility.  I will focus on the specific areas which fall within my formal area of responsibility, that is, trade and marketing on the one hand, and insurance on the other.</P>
      <P>The new Office of Trade and Marketing is a key element in the economic planning of this Government.  This is so because our starting point is that the economic growth we need must be export led.  When we talk about going for growth we are talking mainly about exporting, selling more of our goods and services abroad.  Marketing is crucial to getting that growth precisely because in the past marketing is where we have been weakest as a nation.  We have been a production-led economy and to a very large extent we have neglected the side of wealth creation that marketing represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be fully aware that this <Col N="208" /> weakness in our industrial approach has been pretty well documented.  Over the past decade, we have had report after report singing the same tune, that marketing is our Achilles heel and that we must do something about it.  We must turn our economy from one that is production-led into one that is market-driven.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Office of Trade and Marketing was a firm commitment by the Government that the time for talking about this problem has passed and that the time for action has arrived.  Perhaps I could sketch out for the House the four main areas that I see the office concentrating on in its early days.</P>
    <P>The areas are: firstly, to raise national awareness of the central importance of exporting; secondly, to restructure our export effort so that it produces the best return on the investment we make in it; thirdly, to reduce the cost penalty on Irish goods that undermines their competitiveness on international markets today and fourthly, to remove the obstacles to export growth.</P>
    <P>The first area, the need to raise the profile of exporting, may strike some Deputies as surprising, but it is a very real need.  To be frank, it amazes me how many people still do not realise we are now a fully-fledged trading nation and that we are three times, proportionally, more dependent on exports than Japan and nine times more dependent than the United States of America.  Too many of us still tend to think that exports are a fringe activity, the icing on the cake, as it were, instead of seeing them as our lifeblood, which is exactly what they are.</P>
    <P>We need business to be more export-conscious, so that more of our talent will be focused on exporting, to bring more companies into export trade and to persuade existing exporters to give it a higher priority.  We need the public sector to be more aware of the real, practical needs of our export business.  We need the semi-State sector to focus more on the possibilities of selling abroad.  We need our educational system to gear itself to equipping more Irish people for exporting &mdash;<Col N="209" /> most importantly, in the crucial area of languages.  In all these areas my office have already begun initiatives to get more attention for exporting.</P>
    <P>The second main task that faces the office is to restructure Ireland's export effort, so as to make sure that we get the best results from the very limited resources we have to invest.  I would like to touch on three aspects of this restructuring this evening.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála, for which I have formal responsibility, which has been allocated over £24 million this year, is the spearhead of the State's effort in the promotion and development of exports. It is a State agency of which we can be proud and its track record is highly impressive.  In seeking to maximise its contribution in the period that lies ahead of us, we need to ask some basic questions &mdash; questions that have not really been addressed since the agency was first set up in the fifties.  What exactly do we want it to do?  Where do we want it to focus its attention?  Where is the greatest potential for State involvement in exporting, in the circumstances we are working in now?</P>
    <P>These are the questions I propose to address through legislation for Córas Tráchtála, which is at present being finalised and which I hope very shortly will be brought before the House.  The thrust of that legislation will be to focus the activities of CTT on the task of encouraging more Irish-owned companies to adopt a strategic approach to exporting. The emphasis will be on Irish-owned companies first of all, and on getting those companies to make a planned, long term attack on selected export targets.</P>
    <P>Another agency provided for in these Estimates is the Irish Goods Council; the Government have provided £1 million for their activities this year.  This body has for many years been working to raise the marketing competence of manufacturing industry that is geared towards the domestic market.  I hardly need to remind the House of the importance of import substitution &mdash; it is, in effect, a hidden exporting market.  Every pound of home <Col N="210" /> sales won against an imported product is a pound won for our balance of trade, just as much as if it had been won by exporting directly.  An area of great potential development is in sub-contracting to major exporters, who at the moment source in Ireland a disappointingly low level of their needs, a level that is low when compared with international norms.  This is a major concern of the Irish Goods Council and the office of Trade and Marketing.</P>
    <P>I intend to discuss with the council the possibility of giving a fresh and added impetus to their very valuable work.  It is a body that has evolved over the years in response to changing circumstances, and the time is now ripe to stand back and see if through restructuring the Irish Goods Council and redefining its role we can help it to do even better.  I propose to set about that restructuring and redefining as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Another part of the restructuring task is to look for gaps in our export effort &mdash; and it is clear that we have already identified one.  Deputies will recall that when I was speaking in the budget debate last month, I raised the idea of export trading houses, which I saw as a way of getting small new companies into the export business, and of providing services to bigger exporters in markets that were not top of their list presently.</P>
    <P>I was very gratified by the highly positive response to this idea from the marketplace, and this response has encouraged the Government to press forward with the idea very quickly.  Last week's Finance Bill provides that these trading houses will qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, and indicated that investments in them will qualify for income tax relief under the business expansion scheme.  These export trading houses will be private sector, free market entities, but they will be licensed by the State so that we can be sure they are effectively carrying out the role we see for them.</P>
    <P>The third main area of concern to the Office of Trade and Marketing is the reduction of the cost penalty on Irish exports, the penalty which undermines <Col N="211" /> our international competitiveness.  From an export viewpoint, our energy costs too much, our post and telephones cost too much, and certainly insurance costs are too high &mdash; just to give some examples. It must be a priority to search for ways of reducing this penalty, and my office are doing so.  I will return to the specific problem of insurance in a few moments.</P>
    <P>The fourth area is to remove the obstacles to export growth.  The obstacles are many, and some of them are daunting &mdash; but this must not reduce our determination to tackle them.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of matters like the maze of documentation that has to be coped with, much of it unnecessary.  Important progress is being made on this at the European level, and I am very concerned to make sure that here in Ireland our demands by way of documentation are no more than are fully necessary.</P>
    <P>Transport problems are another obstacle that require close attention, given our remote position.  The financing of exports also urgently needs to be improved.  I am looking closely at this.</P>
    <P>A major export obstacle that we have virtually ignored in the past, much to our cost, is the language barrier.  If we are an exporting nation, we must speak to the marketplace in its own language &mdash; whatever that might be.  Germany is, for instance, a vital market to us &mdash; yet the amount of attention we devote to learning German is pitiful.  I am looking at what can be done to increase the importance of language teaching in marketing training.  What we want to move towards is a situation where no-one will be considered to be qualified in marketing unless they are fully capable of doing business in at least one foreign language.</P>
    <P>Those are the four headings under which the Office of Trade and Marketing is and will be working over the coming months, and I am hopeful that our efforts will begin to show concrete results very quickly.  Let me turn briefly to the area of insurance, for which I also have responsibility.</P>
    <P>The overriding function of Government in the insurance sector is, of course, <Col N="212" /> one of supervision &mdash; as a watchdog over an industry of vast economic importance and one that touches on the lives of every citizen.  However, in the context of our national recovery, it is the issue of insurance costs that is most immediately relevant &mdash; and it is this matter I would like to touch on briefly.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned a few moments ago, insurance is one of the elements in the cost penalty on Irish exports, one of the elements that undermine our competitiveness internationally.  What we are talking about here is mainly insurance of employers' liability, which is reckoned to be the third largest overhead item in industrial costs.</P>
    <P>I recently extended an invitation to the insurance industry to join with me in a partnership with the Government in an all-out concerted attack on insurance costs.  Within the last week I met a delegation from the Irish Insurance Federation, and we agreed that both sides would sit down together and identify the key steps that must be taken to reduce claim costs and premiums levels in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the highly positive response from the insurance industry to my invitation to work in partnership with them to get costs down.  My aim is to put together a package of measures which will achieve significantly lower insurance costs &mdash; and with the help of the industry and the public I hope we can make some progress on that matter within months rather than years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I wish the Minister and the Minister of State every good fortune in their offices be they for a long or short term and I assure them of constructive opposition from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to my own area of responsibility, the food industry, I am particularly interested in food processing.  The magnitude of this area was illustrated recently when the Minister for Food and Agriculture on Tuesday, 19 May, in reply to a parliamentary question, indicated that total processed food imports into <Col N="213" /> Ireland in 1986 amounted to £508.3 million. Price Waterhouse published a report entitled An Overview of the Irish Food Industry and Private Labour Marketing in April, 1986.  Price Waterhouse seem to indicate that there is approximately a 30 per cent greater volume of imports in the processed food area.  This indicates that the problem is somewhat larger than we expected or were given to expect.</P>
    <P>At present we have a very highly sophisticated educational system both at second level and third level.  We have a very skilled labour force readily available to us, a young population equally available and 250,000 people unemployed.  It is a very stark indictment of our industrial policy and many other policies that we do not seem to be able to penetrate to the extent necessary to provide more jobs for our population.</P>
    <P>We have progressed a great deal during the last 20 years.  We have become a consumer society.  Many of the products we were capable of producing at home years ago we no longer seem to regard very highly.  Our option seems to be to go and purchase, and in many cases the goods we purchase are produced overseas and imported.</P>
    <P>I experienced an example of this in the grounds of the House a few days ago. An old fashioned home made broom or sweeping brush made from heather and a handle bound into the head of it was being used to sweep the grounds of our national Parliament.  Up to twenty years ago there was hardly a house in rural Ireland that did not have one of these brooms.  Amazingly these items are still used but now they are imported from Portugal.  That is surely an indication of our total inability to recognise areas where we can introduce import substitution.  We do not seem to be able to home in on these areas and do something about them.  This is my way of leading into the criticism many people have of the IDA and the way their system works.  I know that the IDA have done great work and are continuing it and that they have a great number of successful enterprises to their credit but there is something wrong <Col N="214" /> when imports can come in such volume and in such variation for so long without an awareness and reaction from our people who might be interested in producing, manufacturing or processing. There is a gap somewhere in the communication system.  There are many things which are easy to produce and for which we have a ready market and yet we do not seem to be able to identify them.</P>
    <P>Various criticisms have been levelled at the IDA with regard to feasibility studies. Very often prospective manufacturers think that the bureaucracy to which they are subjected drags on too long and it ultimately breaks down their zest for the enterprise.  Something should be done about that if that is contributing in some way to the fall out from the time initial inquiries are made with regard to new enterprises.  In the food processing industry, for instance, there is a large number of inquiries but the number of enterprises that get off the ground is relatively few.  One of the reasons for that is the slow procedure through which the various stages are processed and the time it takes for a response to come to the prospective processer.  In our present climate we should lay special emphasis on that area.  If a prospective manufacturer or food processor arrives with an idea it should be possible with the modern technology available to us to have a feasibility study carried out and to have the necessary grants paid towards worthwhile products.  It should not be necessary to drag it on for a year or a year and a half by which time someone else in some other place may have found a system and may even be exporting to this country. This is an area which needs urgent attention.</P>
    <P>I generally welcome the sentiments expressed by the Minister and the Minister of State.  I would ask the Minister of State to clarify a speech attributed to him some time ago in which it is implied that CBF might be phased out or abolished or have its role in some way diminished.  I note that that statement was contradicted by the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Food, but <Col N="215" /> I would like clarification of the proposals in that area.  The role of the CBF is important and the role of the Department of Food is equally important.  The development of the food industry is an area where the greatest strides can be made over the next few years simply because we have all the advantages in relation to the production of food and it is up to us to utilise them.  It is also up to us to develop good quality products and to adopt an aggressive marketing stance like everybody else in the world.  If we do not we cannot compete.</P>
    <P>It is sad to note when one addresses a group of young people nowadays in any of our schools or colleges that what comes across is a defeatist attitude.  There seems to be an acceptance among young people that they will have great difficulty in succeeding and that the State agencies will be slow to assist or advise.  A general air of depression seems to permeate the young people.  Such an attitude can become selffulfilling. If one says often enough that one cannot succeed one will eventually fail because of adopting that attitude.</P>
    <P>Recently I addressed one such group of young people and I was startled at the magnitude of the depressed attitude which emanated from them.  Maybe some members of the House say that we live in difficult times and that because of them we have no future.  Such an attitude is damaging to society.  We should adopt an industrial policy which would make it known to young people who will be coming on to the jobs market from the second level system that the opportunities will be there and that they are within their reach if they try.  If an industrialist were to select a group of employees from two groups of young people, one with that depressed attitude, the people selected for employment would come from the group which consisted of positive thinkers who will ultimately be achievers.  One of our current problems is that we have a dearth of positive thinkers.</P>
    <P>Our industrial policy is a most important part of the foreseeable future.  I would like to see, as Deputy John Bruton <Col N="216" /> said a few moments ago, greater co-operation between the Department of Industry and Commerce and AnCO so that the services of the industrial training authority can be brought to bear in such a way as to channel young people with their talents and the training and experience gleaned from AnCO into productive employment, to either set up in the industry themselves or to become involved in an industry.  If we concentrated on that we could achieve a great deal more. There are countless opportunities in manufacturing of one kind or another in food processing and countless job opportunities are there.  They must be right under our noses, yet our reluctance to participate and become involved is the cause of many of our problems at present.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Irish Goods Council on the work they have put into existing small industries, nursing along small enterprises from the start and offering solid, constructive advice.  The IGC are doing more to break the defeatist attitude I have just spoken about than any other agency.  Like my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, I am sorry their budget has been cut this year.  They give very good value for money, and I hope that in future those cuts can be reversed.</P>
    <P>If it comes within the ambit of the Department, I ask the Minister for clarification on the abolition of juries and the Bill which was discussed at length in relation to which we all received considerable representations.  Is it proposed to proceed with the implementation of the Bill?  If so, when and what is the likely time schedule for it?</P>
    <P>In relation to a more parochial matter, in my constituency of Kildare we have approximately 6,000 people unemployed at present the biggest proportion of whom are young because of the age structure within the constituency.  Jobs are coming very slowly.  We have a number of industrial estates which are well placed. One of them is on the main Dublin-Galway road and has been developed for the past couple of years.  However, no industry is sited there yet and it does not seem to have the potential to attract one <Col N="217" /> in the very near future.  Maybe it has that potential, I do not know, but I would like to see some action there.  The area has suffered heavily from job losses in the past few years in that the meat processing plant at Leixlip which employed some 2,000 people some years ago has been closed for a long time.  I ask the Minister to give special consideration to that area.</P>
    <P>I was fortunate enough last year to travel to Germany with a group of colleagues. We found there an amazing lack of knowledge of our industrial promotion effort in certain parts of Germany.  That was difficult to understand since Bord Fáilte are very well known in that area, Stuttgart, as are various other Irish promotional agencies, but parliamentarians had very little knowledge of our industrial promotion effort.  The Germans were very anxious to find out more about our industrial policy and industrial opportunities here.  Here I may sound parochial, but everyone likes to look after his or her own place and it would be an advantage if someone who has an opportunity to go abroad and meet politicians or industrialists of other countries could produce a booklet which would explain to the people they are visiting the opportunities that are available in his or her own place.  It could be concise, not very expensive but produced in such a way as to get the message across.  That is done in other countries.  It has never been done here because it is not IDA policy to promote industry or industrial opportunities except on a regional or national basis. That is a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck by one of the general remarks made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he spoke about the duplication &mdash; perhaps I should call it the proliferation &mdash; of agencies and how he had plans to reverse this trend.  I was astonished to learn from the figures he gave that 3,400 staff are involved in 20 separate institutions in supporting industry in one way or another.  That figure seems incredible, but I presume the Minister knows what he is talking about.  Agencies with small staffs may be roosting in rookeries of which I have no <Col N="218" /> conception, but for a country like this to maintain 20 separate apparatus in support of industry is ludicrous.  I hope the Minister will be vigorous and successful in his efforts to condense that number.</P>
      <P>I notice in the demeanour of the Government in the past few months something of the character of a bull in a china shop in the way they are approaching so far a rather limited range of problems. For example, their behaviour in regard to health cuts and to the protection of Border traders and so forth has been reminiscent of that of a bull in a china shop, but I must say of a bull with the right idea in its head.  I am not being disingenuous when I wish them success in a general way in their efforts to cut expenditure and waste and in general address problems with more vigour than Governments formerly have felt able to do.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce brings the same bull in a china shop spirit to bear on trying to wind up redundant agencies he will have my warm support.  I suggested here a couple of years ago that we should have a new agency, a board whose only function would be to wind up agencies.  It would be an bord um threascairt bhord whose only criterion of success would be the number of agencies it succeeded in closing down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke in general terms about this matter in a way I could only approve of and I am disappointed to find that a little later he spoke about the National Development Corporation in terms which suggest that they have his warmest approval.  I hope I am not being unjust to him or to anyone in his Department or to anyone working under the umbrella of the NDC, but I suspect that we have here under our noses in the Minister's speech an example of the tenacious will to exist which is breathed into any State institution as soon as pen is put to paper to give it birth.  I remember as a father going to nursing homes when my family were increasing in number and I was struck by a phrase that nurses used about how a baby had a stronger grip on life on that day than he had on the previous day and this at the age of two <Col N="219" /> and three days and so forth.  They did not mean the baby had been ailing on the previous day; they just felt that the baby had got a sniff of the air of the world and was that much more determined 24 hours later to hold on to it.  That is what happens with institutions and when I read the bland statements in the Minister's speech about the NDC I ask myself whether his will to cut down these agencies can be trusted and whether we can really make an act of faith in it.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House of the genesis of the NDC.  They were spawned by the Labour Party.  They were part of the deal made when they were in Coalition. The agency would spend £200 million or £250 million a year, or certainly that was the amount that would be put into the infant's pocket to see what it could make with it.  Naturally, none of these geniuses had an idea of what this corporation would do.  I begged, implored and harried them in this House and out of it to tell me of just one economic activity they had in mind.  Naturally, gentlemen whose speciality is ideology must not be bothered with questions about concrete activities like whether they mean fishery, bog development or concentration on import substitution.  Such questions were below the belt to an ideologist from that quarter.  I asked that question over and over again in vain.  Finally my party got hooked on this.  It was part of the price we paid and ought not to have paid.  I asked people in my party what they wanted from the NDC or in what respect that agency were going to provide a facility which our existing battery of institutions did not offer.  If they were going to go into mariculture, did we not have An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which either has a function in that regard or could very easily be given a function without an entirely new institutional apparatus?  If it was bog development or forestry development did we not have Bord na Móna and the forestry division?  What were they going to do?  That question was never answered.  I used to get pitying looks from over there, from the like of one or other Deputy in the Labour Party, <Col N="220" /> as though I was really holding the place up by asking this simple question.</P>
    <P>We now have the National Development Corporation.  I see that their first full year's report has not yet been produced. Their activities seem to have been thin enough.  I do not quite see what can be the delay in producing their report. The Minister has taken the corporation under his wing.  He is like the hen on the old penny with all the chickens flocking around it.  He has happily adopted this Labour Party chicken under his wing and is providing it with warmth, support and protection.  Is there anything which the National Development Corporation is doing that Fóir Teoranta, the IDA, the Industrial Credit Company or one of the banks cannot do and, if so, what is it?  If there is some interstice, some tiny space, between the meshes of the existing State agencies through which perhaps the odd firm falls, unable, for one small print reason to get money out of the IDA, or unable, for some other reason, to get it from Fóir Teoranta or from the Industrial Credit Company, would it not be an easier matter to extend the remit of one of the existing institutions in order to close that interstice between the meshes than to set up an entirely new organisation? I argued this point, I suppose, a dozen times in this House.  Naturally it cuts no ice with my friend Deputy Desmond and his colleagues.  I would have expected it to cut some ice with my own party.  I was disappointed in that, as in other things.  I would have expected it to cut some ice with Fianna Fáil, but no, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has quite happily enfolded this little day old chick into the warmth of his dusty wing. It will survive and thrive and tomorrow its hold on life will be stronger than it is today.</P>
    <P>Regarding the National Development Corporation &mdash; NADCORP; it even has a little acronym now and I suppose even at this moment some natty little architect with a tweed tie is designing a stainless steel plate with a little logo with the word &ldquo;NADCORP&rdquo; neatly fitted beside it &mdash; the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> NADCORP has an important role to play in industrial and job creation strategy.</P>
    <P>God be with the strategists.  I remember the time when Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was always telling us about the Fianna Fáil Party strategy.  It was all nostalgia for the world war which he could dimly remember his people talking about &mdash; everybody on those benches used to talk like that then &mdash; they could remember their parents talking about it at the time. They were like little Rommels &mdash; the word fell easily from their lips &mdash; they had a strategy for industrial development. The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>As the State's venture capital agency it can complement the grant, loan and advisory functions of the other State industrial development agencies....</P>
    <P>Why cannot one of the others have its remit extended?  Why must we have a complete new stainless steel plate logo and acronym in order to provide this complementary aspect?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>either on its own account</P>
    <P>&mdash; here is a new arrival on the semiofficial jargon scene:</P>
    <P>or by leveraging in other investors can act as a catalyst in the initiation of new projects that might not otherwise get off the ground.</P>
    <P>I know roughly what a catalyst is and I know what a lever is but I am damned if I know where in the world of chemistry or in the world of metaphor outside chemistry one can use a lever to produce a catalyst.  That confusion of metaphors is not really the point I am trying to make. Nonetheless it is important because, when one finds language like that, it is masking a confusion of thought.  How does one leverage in other investors?  An investor is somebody with spare money. He is somebody with money surplus to his day-to-day requirements which he wants to invest and make a profit on.  If he sees something which will yield him a return he will put the money in without <Col N="222" /> any leverage from anyone.  If he does not foresee a return he will not put the money in.</P>
    <P>I do not know what return NADCORP envisages because I see, in the very next paragraph of the Minister's speech that he says it will be a more patient investor than most private venture capital companies, that it will be prepared to wait somewhat longer for a return on its investment.  Of course nobody in NADCORP &mdash; as he takes down his hat and coat from the Office of Public Works hat rack in the evening, puts them on and goes off to the DART or to his car in the carpark to go home &mdash; will lie awake at night worrying about whether it is perhaps taking a bit too long for a return to show on its capital.  It is not coming out of his pocket.  I say that in no sense critically &mdash; and I hope it will not be understood in that way &mdash; of public servants and officials who loyally, faithfully, sincerely and honestly do a lifetime job &mdash; my own father was one of them.</P>
    <P>I am not setting up as a critic of the Civil Service or public service mentality at all but I am saying that necessarily someone in public employment does not have the stimulus of risk on the one hand and profit on the other which an ordinary investor has.  When I read that NADCORP, with one hand, will be leveraging in investors my reaction is that I am damned if I am going to be leveraged in by NADCORP if I am going to have to wait for a return until NADCORP's patience runs out.  They will be doing that with one hand and with the other more or less twirling a daisy waiting for time to pass.  Where is the sense of purpose in that?  I do not expect the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, to answer that off the top of his head.  This is the first time I have spoken in the House in his presence.  I should like to wish him success in his job but I would like to hear an answer from somebody.  What is the point in talking about cutting down the plethora of institutional supports to industry while at the same time keeping alive this perfectly redundant socialist chick?</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan mentioned the food industry.  I want to say a word or two <Col N="223" /> about that, not so much about the technique of the food industry as about a broader reflection which mention of the food industry brings to mind.  The range of produce we export is so thin.  I remember, and I have mentioned in here more than once, a deputation of Irish food exporters going to a food fair in, I think, Berlin a few years ago and coming back very deflated, saying that the level of variety, of quality, of attractiveness, of inventiveness in the food products they saw from the rest of the world in Berlin depressed them.  They measured these products against the shapeless doorsteps of cheese which is our contribution to the European supermarket and said to themselves, &ldquo;we have not yet arrived at the fair&rdquo;.  That is something which will take more than the appointment of a Minister of State to remedy.</P>
    <P>I know we have a Minister of State with responsibility for food.  Many Governments have been deluded into that idea, often helped along by the public who want a special Minister for this and that, but one will not solve a problem by throwing a Minister at it any more than one will by merely throwing money at it.  It requires intelligent thought, sometimes from a long way back.  It requires the turning over of the soil, perhaps deeper than one had thought of doing before.  The reason Ireland has not arrived at the fair in the food industry is that Irish people have not sufficient acquaintance with the outside world.  Their acquaintance with the outside world in too many cases, apart from a quick run to the sun in Spain or the Canary Islands, tends to be in the English-speaking States which are not distinguished in regard to food.  In America a great proportion of the food is uneatable and certainly unenjoyable to the European palate.  In Britain where I lived for years and where I still visit frequently the position is not much better.  The standards of what one might call the food in the street, the ordinary common or garden restaurant, in both of those countries are lamentably low by the standards of continental Europe.  Until Irish people <Col N="224" /> instinctively understand from personal acquaintance the standards which are taken as automatic, as natural and as self-understood in Holland, Germany, Belgium, France and Italy, we will not arrive at the fair about which these exporters spoke.</P>
    <P>As I said, I visit Britain quite often.  I sometimes work there under my academic hat and sometimes I shop there. When I visit English supermarkets the only Irish products I ever see, and I always buy them of course, are Kerrygold butter, of which I eat very little but I go through the motions of buying it anyway, and Irish cheddar cheese.  There is no other Irish food of any kind, animal or vegetable, to be found in the average English supermarket.  I also visit Germany a good deal for the same purpose and I shop there.  In that country there are no Irish products of any kind to be found except a dusty bottle of Irish whiskey peeping shyly from behind a row of Scotch.</P>

      <P>We need not go into the brands.  They are all made by the same people anyway.  Deputy Joe Walsh, Minister for Food &mdash; I tend to lose track of the Ministers they are so numerous, but his name sticks in my mind only because of his public conflict with the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, a couple of weeks ago &mdash; has a major job on his hands.  It is not simply a question of ensuring hygiene with regard to the very limited range of products we have.  It is a matter of making sure that a whole cohort, almost a whole garrison, of Irish people in the food production area have enough experience of living, which means eating and drinking, abroad in the countries into which we are trying to sell our products.  They understand that what we take as being food will not interest the foreign palate.  I have seen printed and I have heard foreigners say, although not in quite the same compact language, that if you want to eat well in Ireland you would have to eat three breakfasts a day. The level of food is very nutritious, it is <Col N="225" /> of the highest possible quality, bursting with proteins and carbohydrates and all sorts of good things but it is not very enjoyable.</P>
      <P>The amount of innovation, inventiveness and variety shown with regard to Irish products is exceedingly narrow. That is the reason the home market is being taken over by foreign produce.  It is not because we are not buying Irish.  If you are spoiled enough as to want a certain variety of food and drink you will not be able to find enough Irish products as we have not got the range of products you would like to indulge in.  I am not speaking as an epicure or as somebody who makes a god of his stomach.  I do not do so and I am by no means expert on this, but I know from even the most casual expeditions into supermarkets here, in Britain, in Germany and also in Italy, that that is so.  The average consumer abroad, even somebody who is not in a very high income bracket, has a far larger range of indigenous choice in food and drink in his own country than we have here.  Until that is understood by Irish food producers there is no use whingeing and whining about us not supporting native industry and about import substitution being of high priority.  I am sick hearing that; I have been listening to it for 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to the Government, with their &ldquo;bull in a china shop&rdquo; approach, which I salute them for because it is a bull with its heart in the right place, if they do not make inroads on quite limited problems in their first year they will not make inroads on them at all because events will catch up with them.  I cannot foresee what events they may be but I remember from two stints as an office holder that events overtake office holders.  Fatigue overtakes them.  If jobs are left unfinished one week they will accumulate even more the next week. When colleagues are on holidays items on agendas have to be postponed and so on and suddenly the papers are talking about an election.  The Government are over the halfway mark, coming up to the post and nothing done.  They will realise <Col N="226" /> it is 8 o'clock and not a child in the house washed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say briefly in regard to industrial development that we ought to think not only of attracting foreign capital but also of attracting foreign artisans, foreign skilled tradesmen and in terms of personal tax incentives in that regard.  When Louis XIV persecuted the Huguenots in the 17th century and drove them out of France it enriched the economies of every country in the surrounding areas, even as far away as Ireland.  They brought skills with them which nobody else had.  We should go out and look for people with skills which no-one in Ireland has even heard of or knows about.  I do not care how much envy it causes but we should give them personal taxation incentives to settle here and make money and bring apprentices into their trade. That happened in the past &mdash; leave aside the Huguenots.  Most of the clockmakers in Ireland are Germans &mdash; the Wadels the Schormanns and so forth.  Every Irish country town has a German name over the clock shop.  The pork butchers in Dublin came from Germany &mdash; the Eastmans, the Hafners, the Speidels and so on.  Many German families came to Ireland to do such work.  The English are behind a great number of our more successful country houses, hotels and restaurants.  The fast food industry, although it was not so called in Italy, was largely brought here by Italians in the last century and the beginning of this century. I am not saying that we have to go out and look for people such as these but people can be induced to come and make a living in a place where they will do well.  We should realise the importance of <Col N="227" /> spreading artisanal skills in this country which has a very low concentration of them, barely about the besoms that Deputy Durkan was fulminating about. Apparently, there is nobody in Ireland who can make a brush out of a handful of heather.  We have to import them from Portugal.</P>
      <P>We have a very low level of skill here. This is an area which country after country and report after report from the IDA have identified as a potential growth area for prosperity and for employment.  The Minister ought to look at the possibility of setting up a scheme to induce the immigration of artisans and selected trades from other parts of the world, even from the Far East if necessary.  I do not mind the dilution of the sacred Irish race; we have enough holy cows here without worrying about that one.  We should consider taking that route not as a full answer to our problems but as part of the general battery of answers which any Minister sitting in the position of the two Deputies opposite will have to assemble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather concerned about the framework of the Minister's speech.  He indicated quite rightly and very understandably that about one-third of the loss of output of our domestic manufacturers in the past five years was due to a fall in domestic demand.  I am concerned that the deflationary impact of this year's budget may well be greater than that which the Government either intended or was prepared to forecast. There has been a severe impact on the economy with the major reductions in the public capital programme over and above what was anticipated by the previous Government.  One example is the loss of employment in the health services where the reduction in employment will be about 3,700 as against the figure anticipated by the Government of around 2,000, the take in taxation into the Exchequer being 38 per cent of total income as against an anticipated amount of 36 per cent, and the severe impact of policy changes in grants and construction. The deflationary impact on domestic <Col N="228" /> demand is proving to be a major strain on the economy.  I am worried that there might be a further fall in domestic demand.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the last thing the Minister would favour would be a change in policy &mdash; he indicated very clearly at the annual lunch of the Confederation of Irish Industry that the Government had no intention of changing their policy &mdash; and I would be very worried that another £70 million or £80 million might be taken out of the economy in the next few months by virtue of the current review of public expenditure.  That could have a further deflationary impact particularly on employment and domestic demand. For that reason I urge the Government to exercise caution.  While I share the view that the current budget deficit should not exceed 7 per cent or 7.2 per cent of GNP, the jolt which the economy has suffered in the budget has been very severe and is percolating into the economy.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his portfolio. I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, well in his difficult but very exciting work.  I have no doubt both Ministers are more than capable of meeting the intense demands which will be made on them in the months and years ahead.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the uncertainty of the last quarter has been removed in terms of Ireland's industrial involvement within the European Economic Community.  I met a number of foreign entrepreneurs who were worried about the outcome of the referendum because they were, and are, dependent on exports.  I am glad we decided so positively to remain in Europe and to directly participate in Europe because two out of every three jobs in manufacturing industries rely on exports and our agricultural industry also depends on exports.  Our industrial environment has settled and there is now the prospect of stability and, we hope, growth.  For that reason, the Minister can be assured of my support and the support of the parties in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to commend those who were responsible for the <i>Review of Industrial Performance, 1986,</i> published recently by <Col N="229" /> the Department.  It was an excellent review, a thoughtful document and well presented in terms of analyses.  Those responsible for this publication were by and large public servants.  This brings me to the point raised by Deputy Kelly.  I must cavil with his comments on the National Development Corporation.  He let the cat out of the bag when he said public servants should not be involved in this area because first they are not exposed to risk and second they are not profit oriented.  He said they are not able to take risks, and therefore are entrepreneurial eunuchs.  He cast them in that role.  This shows his lack of knowledge about the work of public servants, the motivation of people in society and the involvement of public servants in industrial development.</P>
    <P>I know men working in the IDA who are very profit conscious.  I also know men who work for CTT who are very conscious of the risk factor in new marketing ventures.  The fact that they might not own a brick in a factory or might draw a public service salary, is not a worthy reason to suggest that they must be cast aside as bureaucratic interferers or some kind of spawned ideological socialist mandarins who must be put down by Deputy Kelly.  This is the kind of, what I would call ideological naivety which, with respect to my colleague in Opposition, he should have overcome after long years in this House, and more particularly having been a former Minister in that portfolio.  He should at least understand the motivation of the people who do this work.  I strongly reject his statement that public servants and people working in State-sponsored bodies are irrelevant in the drive for industrial expansion unless they have, to use his own words, the stimulus of risk and profit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's report of the future work of NADCORP.  The Minister has given a clear and balanced analysis of the prospects of this body.  I remember the gestation pains which lasted about two years, but finally the Coalition Government gave birth to NADCORP.  We set it up after a lot of discussion in this House and after a great <Col N="230" /> debate in Government.  NADCORP is now in existence and we must ensure it has the resources needed to carry out its business, because I have no doubt it has a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's concern that there should be a rationalisation of the services involved in the industrial development drive.  The Minister will have to be very tough in regard to this.  I have always defended the work of the public service, whether in regard to the Department of Health or the Department of Industry and Commerce, but I appreciate that officials, like Deputies, fall prey to the occupational disease that once one is in a job and becomes a pillar of the organisation it is easy to coast and accept the conventional wisdom.  The Minister, with his industrial background and his capacity to cut through bureaucratic concepts, should be emphatic about the amalgamation and rationalisation of a number of the agencies assisting industry.</P>
    <P>For example, the National Board for Science and Technology might be offended at the suggestion that they should be amalgamated with the IIRS although it is a logical step and one which has been fought against for more than a decade.  In 1981 when I was a junior Minister at the Department of Finance I suggested that amalgamation and all hell broke loose not least because of a fond affection in the Department of Finance for certain roles of the National Board for Science and Technology.  I accept that both organisations have improved in recent years.  The IIRS, under their excellent director, have sparkled in many ways but we must go forward.  We have limited resources and skilled personnel.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems I found in Government was how to place the limited pool of highly skilled motivated people who are prepared to contribute at executive level in regard to industrial development. We encountered that problem when trying to select people to sit on State boards.  Very few have the time, the commitment or the personal resources to devote to such work in the national <Col N="231" /> interest.  We must concentrate on amalgamations in our State-sponsored bodies. I wish the Minister well in his efforts in that regard.  I have no doubt he will succeed in his efforts at rationalisation so as to develop our industrial expansion programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment about cowboy operators and their exploits.  On Tuesday evening viewers of RTE 1 watched in amazement as they saw the saga of a stock fish deal unfold. On that programme, for which RTE should be complimented, we saw the capacity of cowboys to operate and milk the system.  In the process a number of individuals gave our country a bad name because I have no doubt that programme will be broadcast throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, in the Seanad.  Between 1984 and 1986 many officials were involved in preparing that Bill.  I urge the Minister to have the Bill processed speedily through both Houses because it will have a profound effect on business confidence here and on the drive to establish new industries.  It will lessen the cynicism among the Irish labour force who are concerned that while their PRSI and income tax is deducted from their pay weekly others get away with gross abuse of limited liability and malpractice.  The Bill is an ideal piece of legislation to be processed through Seanad Éireann.  I hope it passes through both Houses this year.</P>
    <P>My final comment relates to price control. I notice a considerable change of heart by Deputy Richard Bruton in regard to the pricing of petroleum products here and I was delighted to hear of that change.  I raised the question of the alleged over-pricing of petroleum products in the House last week and I urged the Minister to have a look at this.  I commend the Minister on his activities in regard to restrictive practices and I urge him to ensure that Irish motorists get the benefit of retail margins.  There was no great need for the deregulating of price control in that sector.  Abolition of price <Col N="232" /> control has meant that the retail margins have not been passed on to Irish people in a number of areas with the result that our inflation has not reduced as much as it should.  The rate of inflation might be one half of 1 per cent lower than it is had we kept the reins on in a responsible way.  We do not need massive bureaucratic inspections.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on an excellent analysis of the work of his Department and I hope the various legislative measures which he mentioned and which are long overdue will be brought before us shortly.  They are now five and six years overdue because of a succession of changes of Ministers in that portfolio and no Minister has had a real run at the problem in the past half decade, I hope the Minister will have the opportunity of introducing the many legislative measures which he has outlined to us in his address today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Minister's comprehensive speech to the House tonight deals with a very full brief and gives a very good outline of the workings of the Department.  This is my first opportunity to speak since the Minister's appointment to the Department of Industry and Commerce and I wish him every success, happiness and health in his Department.  The Minister has a most important Ministry.  I think it is important in the interests of everybody in Ireland that Deputy Reynolds makes a success of it for whatever period of time he is Minister for Industry and Commerce.  On behalf of this side of the House I wish to assure the Minister that we will be happy to co-operate with him to ensure success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question asked by anybody who is considering setting up an industry, or the first question asked by a foreigner about to set up an industry in Ireland is, &ldquo;What are the costs like in Ireland?&rdquo; I believe if a person were to look at our costs it would be a major disincentive to starting a business.  I would go further and state that our cost structure is downright deterrent.  The Minister for Finance in his outline of budgetary strategy pointed <Col N="233" /> out that the reduction in the cost of borrowing money, the overdraft facilities and so on, is of major importance, and I certainly recognise that fact.  I am certain that the Department of Industry and Commerce realise that the cost of borrowing money for any industry setting up in Ireland, whether it be a native industry, an American or European firm setting up in Ireland, will be a deterrent. Governments have only limited powers to change the situation in regard to overdraft costs because the whole monetary system is such that we have not the final say as the decisions are taken outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will be brief as time is limited but I wish to raise the following points.  Everybody in this House has to examine seriously the cost of staff.  Many people in industry are moving in every way possible towards mechanisation and computerisation instead of employing more young men and women.  The cost of PRSI is a major deterrent to anybody starting a firm here.  The Minister knows all too well that every employer he meets must pay approximately 13.5 per cent and the employee must pay 7.5 per cent in PRSI contributions.  To see 20 per cent of the cost of an employee's wages each week going to PRSI causes a considerable amount of antagonism to both the employer and employee.  In the interests of Irish industry we must make a serious effort to grapple with this problem and to try to reduce the cost of PRSI as it is a direct disincentive to work here.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we must deal with our rate of tax, which I know is not within the Minister's portfolio.  People working in industry when they receive their pay see the rate of tax they pay, either 35 per cent, 48 per cent or the top level of 58 per cent.  The rate of tax for an employee or an employer is a disincentive to work. If people are to put in real effort there must be encouragement but there is no encouragement at that level of taxation. I appeal to the Minister in the interests of all of us to reduce that level of taxation. VAT rates of 10 per cent and 25 per cent, which are far too high, affect a wide scale of items and will have to be reduced. <Col N="234" /> VAT is a cost on our industries and services. It is spread right across the board for everybody and it must be tackled.  We are a small nation dependent on exports which are our life blood.</P>
    <P>The PLV on industries, on small shops, supermarkets and offices is in excess of £21 in the pound valuation.  It varies in different areas but £21 approximately in the pound would be the national figure. Anybody who has a fairly large industry, a supermarket, a small family shop or a decent size pub who is trying to make a living in a small country town and perhaps is employing one or two people has to meet the rate bill which is increasing each year.  He has to pay this charge on a falling income.  A large number of shops throughout Ireland are closed because the people who were employing workers are no longer able to do so.  I ask the Minister to give serious attention to this problem.  It is a nettle we must grasp. When we have succeeded in reducing our costs we will see growth.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the part of the Minister's speech which deals with an order made earlier this week entitled the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.  I congratulate the Minister on making the order as it is essential.  When in Opposition and in Government I referred to the desirability of such an order.  This order has come about as a result of the review by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  It bans &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; which is an abuse of the monopoly position of the supermarket chains in Ireland.  I do not know the current statistic of the share of the grocery market held by the supermarkets.  I believe it is approaching 55 per cent to 60 per cent but perhaps the Minister may have a more accurate figure.  This is a serious matter in its own way.  The introduction of this order is a step in the right direction.  As the Minister has had the courage of his convictions to go some of the way, I ask him to go all the way by bringing in an order to restrict the size of any further supermarket development.  I am advocating that no further supermarket development be allowed in excess of a given number of square feet, perhaps <Col N="235" /> 18,000 or 20,000 square feet.  We should try to curb the growth and development of these vast supermarket chains in this country.</P>
    <P>I recognise that supermarket chains have been of benefit and that they provide an excellent choice of food for the housewife.  It is a lovely environment in which a housewife can bring her children to shop and everything is nicely laid out with convenient trolleys to carry her shopping.  However, the growth of these huge supermarkets have sounded the death knell for many of our small towns all of which have lost small grocery shops. The figures indicate that closures are at the rate of 3,000 per annum.  Perhaps the Minister's efforts will help to retain family businesses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly and others spoke at length about the imports of food.  We must recognise that the greatest proportion of foods purchased here are imported.  This applies to biscuits, jellies, marmalade, jams, meat products, sausages and so on.  They are brought here in big lorries with large trailers attached. The only work involved for Irish people in this regard is for the person who unloads the trucks, the young boy or girl who places the products on the shelves and the check-out girl who tots up the bill.</P>
    <P>Many factories which manufactured this food here for the home market have closed and have not been replaced because of lack of demand.  We had a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign some years ago which did not meet with the approval of the EC because it was contrary to some regulation.  I have travelled in England, Scotland and Wales and in many shop windows a slogan is displayed which says &ldquo;Be British, think British, buy British.&rdquo;&ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; was no different, apart from the fact that it was a much more simple slogan.  Shoppers should be conscious of the fact that jobs will be provided only if they purchase foods manufactured in this country.</P>
    <P>An excellent firm, Green Isle, was set up in Banagher in 1966.  Unfortunately, <Col N="236" /> it is closing on 26 June.  In the past they employed 150 people who were involved in processing vegetables such as peas, cauliflower, beans, sprouts and celery. They then moved into the meat line and produced burgers, steak and kidney pies, beef, vegetable and curry pies and sausage rolls.  They have an excellent storage plant and meat processing area and the machinery is still intact.  Batchelors owned it but they were taken over by Northern Foods.  It was hoped at the time that Green Isle would be retained but that is not the case.  I appeal to the Minister to investigate the closure of the firm because so much food is imported which had been manufactured and processed in Banagher.  This town has considerable unemployment and the loss of these jobs will have a major impact.  It employed only 50 people including management and staff.  Perhaps the Minister will personally look into this matter to see if anything can be done to retain the firm and its factory.  They had an excellent skilled workforce involved in food processing and for years past the farming community produced the highest quality vegetables for processing in the factory. Many of these farmers used the growing of vegetables as a cash crop and they will now lose this income.  It is important to try to ensure that our food processing industries are retained.</P>
    <P>I know that the National Development Corporation do not come under the Minister's aegis but I hope he will involve them in developing the food processing industry.  Instead of importing so much food we should be exporting vast quantities of food.  We must be able to process our own food which will provide employment.</P>
    <P>When he visited Tullamore the Minister gave a most eloquent speech in regard to forestry, its development and the take-over by Bord na Móna.  A new agency is to be set up which will have responsibility for forestry.  I am disappointed that Bord na Móna were not given full responsibility for the development of our forestry resources.  There is tremendous potential for job creation in the forestry industry and in its spin-off <Col N="237" /> industries such as the planting and felling of trees and in the use of timber in house building and furniture manufacture.  I ask the Minister, who is young and energetic, to tackle this problem and to work in co-operation and in conjunction with his colleague who has responsibility for forestry. Forestry is an untapped source of wealth and offers one of the greatest sources of job creation.  I regret that I do not have more time at my disposal but I am glad I have had the opportunity to make those few points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank all those who contributed to this debate.  I thank them, too, for their very sincere good wishes to me.  Having listened to three former Ministers on the far side, including Depty Desmond who was a Minister in the previous administration, I think there is a good appreciation of the difficulties and challenges which lie ahead in trying to get our industrial policy right and in achieving the rationalisation which inevitably must take place if we are going to invest in the right direction at the right time.  It is important that there should not be the overlapping and wasting of resources which as the House generally appreciates does exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to reply to the various questions raised but if I should miss any question, I would be only too delighted to give the reply later to the Deputy concerned.  I will begin by answering the questions asked by Deputy John Bruton.  I thank him for his constructive approach to this debate.  He is a man of experience in this Ministry and he has had a lot to say. He referred to the PMPA and the ICI administrators and asked for my views in that regard.  I have to say that both companies are going in the right direction. That will be welcome news for <Col N="238" /> everybody in this House.  We will not go back and debate whether the previous Government made the right decision in relation to the ICI debacle but some people felt the banks got off the hook too easily.  However, there were arguments for and against.  Both companies are going in the right direction and I am giving an assurance to the House that the administrators will not be kept for one day longer than is necessary.  The less State interference there is the better. Business should be allowed get on with an operation it carries on very well.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the National Development Corporation is repulsive to Deputy Kelly but I would ask him to refer once more to my speech in which I said quite clearly and explicitly that a total review of the moneys spent in the industrial area by all of the agencies involved will be undertaken.  NADCORP is one of those agencies and its functions will be reviewed.  I do not take the narrow view that just because a previous administration set up something it should be immediately dismantled by an incoming Government.  I was a critic of many of the functions which were to be allocated to the National Development Corporation but as events have turned out it is a different animal to that which was born on the first day.</P>
    <P>One of the major weaknesses in small indigenous industries is that they lack an adequate equity base.  In this regard the National Development Corporation have a role to play.  The question could legitimately be asked as to why some other agency did not carry out that role, why we had to have another agency to carry it out?  That is a question which will be addressed in the examination that is to take place.  I will repeat what I have already said.  There was a role which was not being played by the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Industrial Development Authority or any other agency.  One of the major weaknesses in small and medium-sized industries is the lack of an adequate equity base.  One of the problems for an entrepreneur in establishing a business is where to get the initial capital investment because if he does not have <Col N="239" /> the equity the commercial banks will have no welcome for him.  I do not exclude the National Development Corporation from the examination which will take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was receiving favourable mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In a specific role but I would not give the National Development Corporation a role to play in many of the areas which were mentioned during the debate to set it up as clearly those roles can be carried out more effectively by existing agencies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred also to the European Mercantile Exchange.  What we are really talking about is the establishment in Dublin, in the financial services area, of a futures market and he asked me to take a special interest in its development.  I have done so and have met the principals involved and, if necessary, I will go abroad to meet some of the other people who are interested in setting one up.  Many of the bureaucratic blockages are being taken out of the system and the tax incentive package which will apply to the international financial services centre in Dublin is the type of package such a market would be looking for and it is now in place.  The project has been in the pipeline for between 18 months to two years.  I do not think Deputy Bruton would disagree with me regarding my intention to make progress in that regard.  He is a previous occupant of the Department which had control in regard to those bureaucratic matters.  The examination which has taken place so far indicates that such a development has potential but we have quite a distance to travel before I will give an assurance that it will be developed here.  It certainly would have a role to play and would be a marvellous addition to the financial services centre which is to be established on the Custom House dock site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton admitted and I have to agree with him that his efforts to establish small companies in the Stock Exchange <Col N="240" /> flopped.  They did and he asked why.  I know part of the answer, the rest I want to find out.  In this connection I had a discussion with a former president of the Stock Exchange.  I accept the views that he expressed but I think part of the answer lies with our psyche which was referred to in this debate.  We like to own our own homes, our own land and our own factories, when we get something into our ownership we like to keep it. Perhaps history has made us a dependent race.  It is an educational process on the one hand, it is part of our Irish psyche on the other.  One thing is certain; in the fast moving world in which we live today we are better off loosing up on ownership and taking a national view.  People will have to take a different view of ownership, otherwise we will lose our place in trying to trade internationally with the competition we have to meet.  I have no doubt that many small industries here owned by families and by individuals hold that view very strongly.</P>
    <P>However, one can look back at the successes, the real successes in Irish industry and business, for example, Ryanair.  This was a man who worked for Aer Lingus, got out and got a small share of the company, was prepared to take a smaller and smaller share of a much larger and larger company.  He could have stayed where he was, but he did not.  He could have owned a lot more, proportionally, but how long would it last in the world in which he has to operate? The Smurfit organisation are another glorious example.  Until we can educate those who do not see the world as small as those successful business people did, there will not be wholesale success.  I have mentioned two out of many but, unfortunately, there are not enough of them.  Until we come to realise that total ownership is not the be-all and end-all of development, we will have this reluctance to come to the small companies market.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Stock Exchange past president and will be speaking to the new man coming in.  There are a few companies under examination at the moment.  By and large, what Deputy <Col N="241" /> Bruton said is true, the small businesses idea has not taken off, but I give him the assurance that anything I can do will be done.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned Irish Steel which he said will have no more financial aid forthcoming from the Government. That has been a decision of the past Government and it is governed by the EC situation in steel.  That situation has not improved to any great degree.  Next Monday I shall be in Brussels for a meeting of the Council of Ministers on the whole steel quota situation.  The problem has not been resolved to any great extent on the European scene and it will put Irish Steel to the pin of their collar to survive in the present stakes.  I was with the management of Irish Steel three weeks ago.  They are fully aware of the challenge which is before them.  In fairness, they are meeting that challenge. The workers responded when the previous Government were making equity investment in relation to wage freezes and the breaking down of some of the demarcation lines.  Some still exist and we cannot afford those demarcation lines in an industry which has to try to survive with the present over capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also mentioned NET. The joint venture of NET and ICI is proceeding.  It has taken a very long time and I have tried to put a date on the finalisation of the very complex financial negotiations going on between the commercial banks and the company.  I hope within the next week or so to be announcing my appointees to the board of the joint NET-ICI company.  That is another State industry and another company that certainly did well for a couple of years, but have come under pressure for the last 15 or 16 months due to oversupply on the fertiliser market.  Third World countries, because of availability of cheap energy, are now beginning to manufacture even more fertiliser.  There is a very difficult world situation and the sooner this joint venture gets running, the stronger will be the company.  These two companies by merging and putting their company of Richardsons in Belfast into the joint venture with the Arklow plant would seem <Col N="242" /> to have chosen the strongest way to attract the market.  I am looking at ways and means of improving productivity, in Marino Point in Cork especially, by more synergy between that and the existing Whitegate oil refinery.</P>
    <P>I am already getting co-operation of other Ministers who control other State companies.  Each and every one of these companies have operated in isolation in their own little independent republics. There is much synergy that can take place between many of the State companies. There is spin-off benefit for all.  There has been this neglect of the capacity and the opportunities that have been there; there should be more interaction between them, rather than having them stand out on their own.  The same criticism could be applied to many Government Departments. We cannot afford the luxury of the barriers that separate one Government Department from another, or one semi-State company from another.  These barriers must be broken down and will be. That is the commitment of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question as to why the new Department of Agriculture and Food should have the IDA reporting to them in the development of the food industry.  The IDA report to me.  In relation to food development they will report to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  This works with single party Government, it will not work with Coalition Governments with two Ministers from two different parties.  Already, the Minister of State with responsibility for the development of the food industry and the Minister for Agriculture have been to my office and <i>vice versa.</i> Within seven days of coming into Government the civil servants dealing with that area were transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  That is the sort of co-operation that is needed if this country is to share economic recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a separate allocation to the Department of Agriculture to deal with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not have to <Col N="243" /> be.  The Deputy is trying to put even more blockages in the way.  There needs to be a breaking down.  There is no need for more and more segregation.  We are all members of the one Cabinet sitting at the one table.  We are adult people and the job can be done.  If Deputy Durkan wants to wait for another month or two, he will see the fruits of this work.  The approach to development in the food area will be sector by sector, not an overall generalisation &mdash; that would not succeed. One must home in on the various sectors.</P>
      <P>A point was made by Deputy Kelly in relation to his visits to Germany and other countries.  I do not know where he travelled to in Germany because it is not so long since I was in that country, albeit that my German interpretation might not be great from time to time.  Irish products are on sale in supermarkets in Germany and good strong Irish companies, although not half enough of them, have made the break-through.  However, we must build on the strength of those companies to penetrate that market.  With regard to the beef trade the Goodman organisation have negotiated direct sale from Ireland to the supermarket shelves in Germany.  That shows the way for the future development of that industry.  I do not know where Deputy Kelly shopped in the UK and cannot understand how Bailey's Irish Cream was missed out &mdash; in the UK, Germany or elsewhere.  I accept what Deputy Kelly says, that there are not enough of these products, but they are on sale there.</P>

      <P>If we had ten more Bailey's firms around the world, we would be far better off.  In relation to food processing, I take on board many of the criticisms and the job is there for development. We must think of the quality of the food and its presentation.  Who will do the product development?  I said before and people laughed at me that there is no point in trying to develop an Irish food industry if we do not recognise first that we need the product developed and need to respond to the tastes of the consumer in the marketplace.  I cannot understand Deputy Kelly's point that we need three breakfasts when we are visiting hotels. Perhaps that is what is wrong with us, that we are overfed.  One breakfast will do me at any time.  Sometimes I would not even eat a half of one breakfast served up in Irish hotels.</P>

      <P>There are not enough of these restaurants.  Who is going to do the product development?  We have plenty of young people who have served their time as chefs.  They were sent to Switzerland and France.  They are working in hotel kitchens every day of the week.  If one is asking somebody to give them the taste housewives buy off the shelf, their chefs are the ones to do it. They have been trained in the food business. Unfortunately we go for production managers who have not been trained in the food business.</P>
      <P>On the production side we have students with third level degrees in science and chemistry.  The whole team must be put together.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have excellent people working for them.  There should be more interaction between the institute and industry.  This is another one of our failings.  I think it was Deputy Desmond who said that when one goes to work in an institution or a semi-State body one is there for life.  These people should not be there for life; they should be moved in and out so that the people in the institution or the semi-State body know what is happening in industry and the market place.  These people should not be locked behind closed doors with their talent going to waste.</P>

      <P>What about the lack of knowledge among German politicians with regard to an Irish industrial promotion? Some of the Minister's colleagues were on the delegation who went to Germany.

Not alone did Fine Gael not achieve 3,000 to 6,000 jobs a year but they lost 6,000 jobs a year for the three years they were in Government.  Despite their short term Government policy, that sort of deceit does not bear comment on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to comment on that strategy.  I want to return to the question of skills.  Manufacturers in Germany are employing Irish science and engineering graduates.  As Deputy Kelly has said many times in this House, our students lack training in foreign languages. We are only now introducing German into our schools.  Anybody who looks at the German population structure will see what exactly is happening there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Germans are looking towards Ireland as an investment base, firstly, because the Deutsche Mark is getting so strong and, secondly, it leaves their home market open to penetration for the first time and their exports are coming under pressure.  This is why the Germans are going to have <Col N="248" /> to diversify their production bases into other currencies.  They are looking towards Ireland not because of the grant structure but because of the availability of skilled labour &mdash; and if workers could speak German they would be even more sought after &mdash; and our political stability.</P>
    <P>Many people might think that because we have had so many elections we do not have political stability.  Irrespective of what Government were in power industrial policy was kept intact and not chopped and changed with each change of Government.</P>
    <P>We have a low productivity rate. German industrialists do not blame, as some people in this House do, the lazy Irish workers for this.  They believe that this is as a result of bad management.  It is management motivation that gets the maximum out of Irish workers.  German management in Ireland have shown that Irish workers, if properly led and motivated, can produce as good a productivity level as Germans.  There are German companies in Ireland to prove this.  We should stop knocking ourselves and start looking at our strengths and build on them.  We should stop decrying everything that goes on.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Enright's contribution and I compliment him for some of the suggestions he made.  I will certianly follow some of them up.  He referred to the PRSI and the social contributions paid by workers.  He should examine what is the average paid by wokers around Europe and he will see how well we come out.  The confusion starts when one looks at the overall amount that is taken out of wage packets. In effect the overall level of what is taken out is the very high level of personal taxation.  This is a big disincentive to workers to produce extra effort because they do not believe they are remunerated for it.  We do not have high rates of PRSI and social contributions but we do have high levels of personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that we are out of line with the rest of Europe in relation to electricity and telecommunication charges but at least I can say to this House that there will be no increases in electricity, <Col N="249" /> postal and telecommunication charges this year.  This is a start towards driving down these costs that have got so badly out of line.  It cannot be fixed in a year; it is going to take time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of interest to investors, industrialists and anybody else in business, our first priority was to try to get interest rates down.  Nobody could stay in business if they continued to pay the real rate of interest that had to be paid.  The real rate of interest may be 11 per cent but 11 per cent over the rate of inflation makes it impossible to run a business.  The first priority of this Government was to tackle interest rates and the cost of money and to do that we had to take hard decisions to reduce public expenditure and the public sector borrowing requirement.  That has already shown some benefits in the reduction in the inter-bank rate by 2½ per cent.  We have a long way to go and hard decisions will have to be taken.  I reaffirm, at the request of Deputy Desmond, that this is the reality of our economic problems.</P>
    <P>We have to reduce public expenditure. I played my part in the first budget of this Government in reducing the allocations for industrial development by £18 million in the overall Estimate for my Department. That can bring more benefit to industrialists who are not necessarily successful because they have received a big grant.  If one examines indigenous Irish industry, looks at the grants they get in a particular year and at the profits they have generated, one is startled by the fact that the industrial investment incentive package that has gone to indigenous industry at least equals if not slightly exceeds the profit margins those companies generated.  Are we sending money round in circles in transfers that are defeating the purpose?  We are spending a lot of money paying the people to administer these systems of sending money around in circles.  What is needed is perhaps to bring down the cost structure of industry by lessening those grants. That is the reality which I set out clearly in my speech this afternoon.</P>
    <P>If the State interventionist policy in industry in the way we have pursued it in <Col N="250" /> the last 25 years had been successful then we would be the most successful industrial economy around, but that is not the case.  We have only 20,000 more people working today than we had in 1963 which was pre-industrialisation here.  Surely it is time that somebody grappled with the problem?  It does not matter which Government or which Minister are in office.  We must face up to the reality of the price we have paid since 1963 to date, that we have only 20,000 more people working.  We should not ignore the reality of what happened when we entered the Common Market.  There had to be a shake out of traditional industries that did not move with the times and which did not modernise or diversify.  We have to get our policies right and I will pursue that task for whatever length of time I remain Minister.  I was only here for nine months on the last occasion.  There is consensus that there is a job to be done and I look forward to more than nine months on the job this time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the food industry, there are many reasons for our lack of development here.  First, we never had the structures in place.  We had four Government Departments and nine semi-State agencies involved in the food industry.  That was nonsense because what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  If responsibility is spread everybody does a little but nobody does the job.</P>
    <P>The situation is worse in relation to developing the fishing industry.  The first decision the Government took was to force the whole lot in together under one statutory head.  This Department will get the full backing of the Government.  The sectors in the food industry must be taken individually.  The bacon sector should have been rationalised 15 years ago.  It has started now on that road.  With aid to the tune of 50 per cent from the FEOGA grants structure in Europe and 25 per cent maximum in Ireland, there is a huge incentive for somebody to do the job properly.  The job must be done properly or we will not survive in the marketplace. Sector by sector is the approach to the development of the food industry. Deputy Kelly said that if one goes into a <Col N="251" /> supermarket one sees many foreign convenience foods.  That is the case in many supermarkets but some very interesting developments have taken place over the past few years.  In order to stop imports the whole area of convenience foods is being tackled.  It is nice to see young people who were buyers in supermarkets going into production, knowing what the market wants in the line of convenience foods.  There are a few very good examples of how successful that can be.</P>
    <P>The problem in relation to the development of the food industry from the small industry point of view is that we have been production-orientated rather than market led.  That is a basic weakness in small industry.  We are great at producing things but we do not seem to stop to think about what the customer wants.  We want to reverse that trend.  Another major weakness in the small industry area relates to marketing.  The initiative taken by this Government to address that major weakness was to set up export trading houses enjoying a tax incentive at 10 per cent which can bring into play, in their establishment, the business expansion scheme.  Both CTT and the IDA have been trying to nurse small industry along. We cannot afford to wait.  Export trading companies can do the marketing for all the companies who can produce good products but who can never break into the international marketplace because of their lack of financial strength and the expertise to do it.  This is a concept which has worked successfully in Japan, Taiwan and Korea and we should try it here.  It can make a good contribution towards eliminating a major weakness in marketing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>CBF are in charge of meat marketing and will continue to be in charge of it.  The role of the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, was queried by Deputy Bruton.  Minister of State, <Col N="252" /> Deputy Walsh, is in charge of the food industry with responsibility for CBF and neither Deputy Brennan nor I have involvement in the marketing of beef in CBF or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I was asked by Deputy Bruton to clarify the situation in relation to policy formulation and new policy decisions in the Department of Industry and Commerce. Since Deputy Bruton was a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, I do not see his reason for asking that question and perhaps he was being a bit facetious.  Even as he asked the question the Deputy would have known full well that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the sole responsibility for policy development and decisions and even if he chose he could not delegate that responsibility.  I have dealt with the food area reasonably well.  It is a long haul, a very difficult job.  Attitudes must change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kelly to a certain extent.  We are lacking in tool making skills on the engineering side.  Maybe we have not people of the calibre necessary such as are found in the German and other successful economies.  I have mentioned this to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.  Tool making is basic to engineering.  I do not know whether that weakness exists but I fear that it does and if so it should be rectified by whatever means we have for that purpose. However, in many other areas we have no shortage of skills.  A few years ago when I was in Government the Prime Minister of New Zealand was here and he had carried out an industrial review. I asked him what it showed.  He said that it showed there were many areas that New Zealand should not be in.  I asked what areas they should be in and he said that he came to the conclusion after the industrial review was carried out that if it grows New Zealand should be in it.  He was saying in simple terms that their basic strength was in agriculture, food and so on and that was the area they should be in.  When I asked him what he was doing with the sectors of industry that could not compete with low price bargains in the <Col N="253" /> Far East he said that he created the environment for closure.  He did not survive the following general election, but that does not mean that he had not the right ideas about how to do the business.  That is political reality.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent opportunity in the aftermath of Chernobyl.  All central Europe is beginning to ask where the source of the food is, whether it is frozen, convenience or whatever, and that question is going to raise its head more and more in the years ahead.  Much of the Chernobyl fallout has destroyed or put serious question marks over the environment in which much of central Europe's food was produced.  We have a golden opportunity if we keep our environment clean.  The best marketing tool we can have is the green pasture image going into consumer markets like Germany and France.  We have it and we must protect our environment to ensure that it continues.  I do not see it as an insurmountable challenge.  Sufficient young people are coming out of various educational establishments who can be trained in the food industry and their future is there.</P>
    <P>I have looked at market research from a very large operation in the UK &mdash; I was going to say as a customer but I must say a former customer considering the job I have now.  This company spend a great deal of money on market research which they say shows that in the next ten years there will be a return to fresh food and Ireland could not be better placed for that.  An idea grew up in this country in the last 20 years that economy in scale production of food was going to succeed. That may have been true then.  It is not true today because the market is there for quality food delivered on time, well packaged and well presented and priced. A recent survey of the grocery market in England shows that price slots in at No. 3.  Quality is No. 1, reliability and consistency No. 2, price No. 3, and presentation comes up in joint third place. That is the challenge facing us.  We will not succeed overnight.  There is a job to be done and we have taken the right steps to face that challenge.  I hope that my <Col N="254" /> colleagues in that Department will be successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating raised the philosophy of the semi-State sector.  He said, rightly, that 25 years ago many semi-State bodies were set up with an objective in mind. The late Sean Lemass set them up to do a specific job and fulfil certain objectives which are not necessarily relevant 25 or 30 years later.  This matter should be examined.  I have spoken about co-operation between them.  The semi-State bodies can produce a great deal more but somebody must push their heads together in order to help them achieve that.  Cross-fertilisation of boards of directors is only a step.  Making it happen is what it is all about.  I have certain ideas in that regard that I am pursuing at Government level. I hope to see them through and that will be able to show exactly what can be done by better co-operation and somebody forging the heads of management of some of our semi-State bodies together.</P>
    <P>Regarding the establishment in our embassies of trade attachés, CTT do the international marketing.  This is not the time to create new positions and new posts.  Embassies could take a more active role in the promotion of trade abroad and so far as we can assess how their roles can be made more effective in the marketplace that will be examined. This is not the time for the establishment of more and more jobs.  We need redeployment of the skills and the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan asked when the Courts Bill will be introduced.  I expect my colleague, the Minister for Justice, to make an announcement in this regard in a week or so.  The Bill will have an impact on employer liability.</P>
    <P>Two Deputies contributing to this debate mentioned the price of petrol, diesel oil and fuel.  Petrol, oil and diesel prices went out of line in this country in the latter part of 1986.  I am not jumping in for a quick solution to that or getting into an argument about the abolition of price control.  It is easy to say with hindsight that the wrong time was chosen because we are entering an era of falling world oil prices.  We must be vigilant in <Col N="255" /> that regard.  I am not looking for a temporary solution but for a long term solution as to how we can get the benefit of a collapse in world oil prices which we have not been enjoying.  Perhaps prices are inching up somewhat but they are not expected to exceed $18 or $20 a barrel.  I am carrying out an evaluation of that and when that is completed the House can be assured that whatever action I can take to redress it will be taken.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of the spin-offs of higher petrol and oil prices.  The Irish economy is being charged $244 million more for its products than the French economy is at the moment, exclusive of all taxes.  Various factors are involved in that.  We have more distribution margins than France has.  There is a difference of distribution in the marketplace because we have a small market.  I could make a similar comparison with the Greek economy. However, there is one difference that is not explained and that is the one I am homing in on.  The matter calls for bigger decisions and actions than just a quick call across the House on price control or some such matter.  It is more fundamental than that and I am looking at the fundamental aspects.</P>
    <P>Regarding regulation and deregulation, anybody who knows me knows that I abhor red tape and bureaucracy. Export documentation costs £200 million plus to this economy.  This nonsensical running around having to produce an export licence where some agencies will not accept a carbon copy or a photocopy of it means that you have to bring the export licence from A to B to C.  If you are exporting from three different ports somebody must drive to one port with that export licence and then drive with it to the next port and the one after that. The whole range of export documentation retards any entrepreneur who is trying to get into the international marketplace. If the Single European Act means anything it means that we are on the road to rationalisation of trade, but we have a long way to go in that regard. At the moment I have a task force examining export documentation not alone for <Col N="256" /> the cost which can be redistributed in the economy but for the management time and the nuisance of having to run around in circles.  We live by exports, our whole future is bound up in them.</P>
    <P>The world does not owe us a living, we have to go and earn it.  It is the duty of Government and any Minister to remove all those obstacles.  Export documentation is a glaring example of something that has never been tackled in this country.  Does anybody realise the benefits that can be brought to bear on this economy by so doing?  That is the philosophy of this Government's approach to economic recovery and management.  We are going to break down the barriers existing between various Government Departments and semi-State agencies. There will be total co-operation between 15 sitting around the Cabinet table because, in management terms, that is what it is all about.  We all play on a team. We do not play an individual role.  There is no place for anybody who plays an individual role with the challenges, the obstacles and the real problems confronting this economy at present.</P>

The company are back on the road to recovery, on the road to showing a profit, small though that may be in relation to ICI.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Museum, as long as I can remember in my adult existence anyway, has been housed in very <Col N="258" /> difficult conditions.  One of the first debates in which I took part on being elected to the Oireachtas 18 years ago was one on a report of the Visitors of the National Museum which took four years even to get into print so despised was that institution by the Government of the time.  Although I hope matters have changed with the various changes of Governments in the meantime, the museum still is very much an institution which, even a casual glance will show, has been treated in a stepmotherly fashion.  It is the Cinderella of the State institutions. I compare it even with the way it was when I was a child and used to be taken round it by my father.  I am appalled, not just at the lack of development of its facilities, but at the degree to which neglect, clutter and inertia have overtaken it and, to some extent, demoralised the very devoted staff who work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can remember for some purpose visiting the labyrinth of rooms which underline this building and the adjacent Government Buildings, when I saw there in a state of decay items I remembered seeing on display in the National Museum when I was a small boy more than 40 years ago.  The research, restoration, repair, study facilities, all of the facilities which in any normal museum in western Europe are taken for granted are present in the National Museum at shoestring level only unless things have changed very radically in the few years since I last had a look at the insides of it.  Not only that but the space allotted to it is wildly insufficient for its needs.  I am speaking both about the Antiquities Museum and the Natural History Museum.  On the first occasion when I was taken through the back parts of both of these parts of the National Museum I saw exhibits which mean nothing to me &mdash; because I am too ignorant on that plain &mdash; geological exhibits stacked in corridors in boxes which were bursting, they were falling out into the corridors having been unceremoniously extruded from the original position they had occupied in the museum premises.  One might well ask why and the answer is that the Houses of the Oireachtas had moved in on them <Col N="259" /> and taken up the space on which they had formerly relied.  That was when the extensions here were carried out about 20 years ago.  The condition of the main geological collection was a national scandal, with large lumps of rock which mean nothing to me but of course are important to those who understand them.  If they would not fit in packing cases they were simply beaten with sledge hammers until they did fit.  That sort of conduct I mention only because it symbolises the State's attitude towards the National Museum down the years.  There are not many votes in antiquities.  There are not many votes in geological samples from comets, meteors, from this or that disused quarry. Accordingly the museum was very much in the condition of the weakest of the farrow of bonhams and was very lucky if the sow did not roll over and kill it.</P>
    <P>The proposal about which I have read in the last little while is that, in the length of time it takes to repair the Seanad Chamber in Leinster House, the Seanad should be accommodated in the round entrance hall of the National Museum, which is the only entrance hall I know.  It is a largish space, not by any means unused because it contains the entrance to the entire institution and is used for checking visitors.  In these days of security, they have to be very carefully checked, parcels have to be examined, sometimes retained and given back to the visitor when he or she is leaving.  Parties of school children, parties of visitors, sometimes parties of distinguished guests from overseas are received there.  The suggestion is, as far as I know, in the quite unlimited time &mdash; in the sense that nobody knows how long it will take to repair the Seanad Chamber &mdash; the sittings of that House should take place over there.  That has caused consternation among the board and staff of the museum.</P>
    <P>I asked the Chair's permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment because, first, these matters are not very often dealt with in here and, second, I think it unfair and wrong that a devoted staff who have suffered from neglect on the part of <Col N="260" /> the State for generations, should be asked to tolerate this further contemptuous invasion of the very limited space they have in which to do their work.  Before reverting to the question of the staff, their morale and needs, that change is bound to mean more unsightly prefabricated building if it goes ahead.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister of State over there. I know he will be replying.  I hope he will be saying that no decision has been taken about this matter yet, that all other options are being examined.  I hope he will be able to go a bit further than that in making me happy.  But I expect him to say at least that much.  He will know, from his knowledge of the site, I suppose, that one cannot make a public entrance at the Kildare Place side without some kind of extension which, from my experience, will be unsightly.  It will not be possible, in that small entrance, to carry out the ordinary operations of checking visitors' parcels, suitcases, satchels and so forth.  It will not be possible to receive in any dignity there parties of important visitors from abroad.  It will not be possible to admit in an orderly way large numbers of school children and it will not be possible there to ensure their egress quickly in the case of an emergency. Security will only be capable of being discharged by the erection outside the museum, on Kildare Place, of some kind of hut or shack.</P>
    <P>Kildare Place is one of the saddest and most disreputable chapters in the architectural history of this city and in the history of official taste, both governmental and corporational.  It is a backwater as far as streets are concerned because it is only a recess in Kildare Street but it used to be an architectural gem.  There were three or four early 18th century houses on that street which, even as an uninstructed schoolboy, I remember admiring and which people who knew about these things very strongly admired. Those houses were pulled down ruthlessly in the sixties or perhaps the late fifties to make room for an extension to the Government Buildings complex.  It was the era of the rising tide which lifted all the boats and it was the same era in <Col N="261" /> which the ESB were allowed to pull down a whole range of buildings in Lower Fitzwilliam Street.  It was an act of official vandalism not markedly worse than any other at the time or any other which we have seen since but we should try to prevent the same happening again.  I do not want to see prefabricated buildings on Kildare Place, apart from the functional and the security difficulties which any system of entrance and exit would cause there.</P>
    <P>The staff of the National Museum have a very difficult and important job to do which is too often the object of a perfunctory salute.  They have been, as one can see by inspecting their conditions of work, the victims of official indifference over generations.  In the most primitive emerging country in the world there would scarcely be as much collective indifference shown to the sort of things we like to pretend we are interested in as we have shown towards the National Museum.  We are great at inviting American Presidents and showing them the Book of Kells, the Tara Brooch or the Ardagh Chalice, having a quick photo call of some dimly understood, glamorous item from our past and then we put the museum out of our minds for the next five or ten years until some other dignatory arrives and Pat is again asked to tip his forelock and be photographed with him.  I always notice when photographs are taken that the Irish Minister looks up admiringly at the foreign man who looks straight ahead.  At those times we take an interest in the museum but at other times it is neglected and forgotten.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the museum staff on finding that they are once again being asked to allow their already inadequate premises to be used as an overflow site for the operations of Leinster House is understandable.  They have been sufficiently demoralised during the years by the relative neglect of a country which prides itself on its rich cultural heritage and its interest in that heritage.  I would not like to allow this suggestion to pass in the House without protesting against any further demoralising of that staff by making the main entrance of the museum <Col N="262" /> the position for the deliberations of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will make a show of us.</P>
    <P>We are very keen to impress our neighbours but if we go ahead with what is being suggested, visitors abroad will be brought in through the back entrance of the museum and that will disturb the natural sequence of viewing the exhibits. The front entrance will not be used for most of the time because the Seanad, as everybody here knows, usually sits only one day a week for about 20 weeks of the year.  Most of the time the front entrance will be as silent as Tutankhamen's tomb. That is no way to treat the main entrance, of the antiquities division, of the National Museum of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is sad that a Government, presided over by a Taoiseach who is interested in the arts and in trying to raise the general level of appreciation and awareness of artistic and cultural elements in life would lend themselves to the desecration of the museum.  No doubt it would start out as a temporary measure but it might easily stretch to several years.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously and urgently alternative sites.  They will not be perfect but nothing provisional is perfect.  I cannot see why the Seanad would not meet in Room G24 in Setanta House which would be big enough.  Although it would not be very comfortable, it would be tolerable for people who would be asked to sit there for only a few hours on one day a week for about 20 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>I understand that the former Kildare Street club premises which now belong to the State are not in use.  I do not know what the conditions of the inside of that building are like but I was in the building once or twice as a guest under its old management and I recall that it has one or two extremely large rooms.  The old dining room is very big and it might be adaptable for use as a Seanad Chamber. Another suggestion made was that the Seanad should use the Dáil Chamber.  I hope we are not standing so much on our own dignity that we would think the Dáil Chamber would be diminished if the other House were allowed to sit here on days when it is not in use for Dáil proceedings. <Col N="263" /> What is wrong with allowing the Seanad to sit in the Dáil Chamber on Mondays and Fridays or on Tuesday mornings? Frequently the deliberations of the Seanad do not extend beyond the length of time that would allow them to be accommodated in the Dáil Chamber up to 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays.  Why must we convulse one of the major national cultural institutions when we could adopt that alternative?  We have all the facilities in this Chamber which a legislative assembly needs.  The same facilities which are available to the Seanad are also available to the Dáil so why can the Seanad not sit in this Chamber when the Dáil is not sitting?</P>

      <P>I will conclude by asking the Government not to lend themselves to another act of official vandalism.  The idea I am putting forward will not cost a halfpenny.  For the sake of having an echoing empty chamber for about 320 or 330 days out of the 365 days in the year, we are going to build a false ceiling in the National Museum and presumably we will have all the problems and expense of installing the reporting, translating, press and public facilities in the entrance to the museum.  I protest very strongly against that.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur entirely with Deputy Kelly's views on the National Museum.  It is a very important cultural institution and I have a great interest in it.  It has served the nation well. We have a duty as public representatives, and the State has a duty, to ensure that the museum fulfils its rightful role.  That is the attitude of the Government and in particular of the Taoiseach who has a major interest in the affairs of the museum.  As the person responsible for <Col N="264" /> the museum he has always shown that interest.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for public works, am responsible for the procurement of property on behalf of the State or any agency of the State.  I must ensure that any organ or agency of the State that requires accommodation must get it as quickly as possible with the least difficulty being caused to any other agency or organ of the State.</P>
      <P>At present, the Commissioners of Public Works are faced with the problem of finding a suitable alternative temporary location for the Seanad, to be used immediately after the summer recess, when the reconstruction work on the present Chamber shall have begun. Unfortunately, the extent of this work means that there is no realistic option but to relocate the Seanad while the work is in progress.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the main requirements are that the temporary chamber should be appropriate for the Upper House of the Oireachtas, that it should be of sufficient size to house all 60 Senators in the normal manner with some further accommodation for the press and public, that it be fitted with loudspeakers and a public address system, that it be secure, or easily rendered so, and that as far as possible it be within the Leinster House precincts. I might also add, and this is something, we all have to be very much aware of, that every effort must be made to keep the cost of relocation to the minimum possible commensurate with the provision of a suitable standard of accommodation, security and equipment, in the new location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the objective of fulfilling this brief the Office of Public Works have looked at a number of different locations, a total of seven in all.  They have discussed these locations with the Seanad Committee on Procedures and Privileges and as there is not one ideal location the matter is still being examined.  I hope that will make the Deputy happy.  Some of the proposed alternative locations suit the Seanad's needs better than others, and one such is the Rotunda, or entrance hall of the <Col N="265" /> National Museum.  I think it true to say that nobody of choice would take any space away from the museum even on a temporary basis such as is now being considered, and similar consideration is being given to the other six locations.  I do not think, however, that it detracts in any way from the National Museum, which is one of our foremost cultural institutions, that the second House of our Legislature, should consider its entrance hall a suitable temporary chamber.  Quite the reverse I would have thought and scarcely an act of &ldquo;cultural vandalism&rdquo; as somebody was quoted as having said in one of the daily papers, and as the Deputy is inferring.  We must remember that the Seanad is enshrined in our Constitution, that it is arguably the second most important organ of State and that any domocracy worth its salt must respect it and provide for its legitimate and quite modest accommodation needs whether they be temporary or permanent.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised that Deputy Kelly, a constitutional lawyer, should seem to demean or downgrade the importance of the role of the Seanad.  It must be borne in mind also that if the Seanad should decide to move to the museum the effect on display space will be quite low as the Rotunda is not used for display purposes.  We all know the museum needs more display space and this will be available when the National Museum takes over the space already allocated to it in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham. I concur with what Deputy Kelly said about various artefacts and geological procurements which need to be on public display.  It is our hope they will be put on permanent public display in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, when the National Museum takes over the space already allotted to it.</P>
    <P>If there is displacement as a result of the relocation of the Seanad Chamber for Senators or any State agency or organ <Col N="266" /> of Government, a comparable provision will be made to ensure that that displacement will be more than adequately met by providing accommodation elsewhere for them.  I will see to that as the person charged with responsibility for providing office accommodation.</P>
    <P>When all the locations have been thoroughly examined in full detail and due consultations have taken place between the Office of Public Works, the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and any other relevant authorities or State agencies directly involved a final decision will be taken on this extremely important issue.  I intend, as the Minister responsible for the procurement of accommodation either permanent or temporary on behalf of the State, to ensure that the enforced relocation of Seanad Éireann will not in any way diminish the role of, downgrade the status of, or disrupt the deliberations of our second most important organ of State, namely Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>A trader who has accumulated large arrears of tax may seek negotiations with the Revenue Commissioners for the clearance of those arrears by phased payment. Provided enforcement action to recover the amounts due has not been initiated, the commissioners would be prepared to consider entering into such negotiations.  Any arrangement which might emerge from the negotiations would be subject to stringent conditions as regards such matters as time span, maintaining payment of current taxes as they fall due as well as concurrently meeting on the agreed dates the instalment payments of arrears and associated statutorily imposed interest charges.</P>

      <P>Under the Garda Building Programme, a total of 37 new stations have been completed and occupied, including new divisional headquarters at Tralee, Galway and Monaghan and new district headquarters at Tallaght, Caherciveen, Nenagh, Belmullet, Carrickmacross, Killarney and Dungarvan and a major extension to Sligo divisional headquarters. Work is also nearing completion on the new district headquarters at Roxboro in Limerick.  Work is either in progress or about to commence on new stations of divisional or district headquarters status <Col N="142" /> at Ennis, Naas, Tuam, Ashbourne, Lucan and Tramore.  Tender documents for the new divisional headquarters at Letterkenny which were issued to selected contractors are due in the next few weeks.  Other large stations for which tenders will be invited in the near future include Mullingar, Shankill, Tipperary, Watercourse Road in Cork city and &mdash; the largest project yet undertaken under the programme &mdash; the new divisional headquarters at Anglesea Street, Cork, to replace Union Quay station.  Large stations at the planning stage include Drogheda, Bandon, Shannon, Kells, Balbriggan, Togher (Cork) and Carlow.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1988, the emphasis on the programme will switch to the smaller rural stations and because of the lower costs involved this will result in a greater number of new stations being provided. At the same time, a continual programme of improvement works is being carried out or is planned for a very large number of Garda stations which were not considered to need replacement.  However, to compile the information about these stations in the form requested by the Deputy would involve an inordinate amount of staff time which could not be justified at present.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Acts provide that entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the conditions that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Questions as to whether a claimant complies with those requirements are determined by deciding officers and appeals officers appointed under the Acts and each case is decided on its merits on the basis of the particular circumstances pertaining to it.  Accordingly it would be a matter for a deciding officer to determine, by reference to the facts of any case, whether or not a particular claimant who is participating in a training course, complies with the availability condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the criteria for determining availability for work the Department, while retaining the right of deciding officers to decide each case on its merits, is always prepared to discuss with interested parties as to whether participation in particular courses could adversely affect title to benefit.  However as a general proposition, it may be taken <Col N="144" /> that persons involved in full time educational or training courses cannot be regarded as fulfilling the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 10 <Col N="145" /> November 1986.  Under the national Jobsearch programme he was offered a place on a Jobsearch course operated by AnCO.  The course concerned does not involve a placement in a clerical position but rather is directed at providing participants with necessary skills, clerical support and facilities to help them with their job-seeking activities.  He refused to participate in the course although it had been explained to him that this would result in his social welfare entitlement being reviewed which could lead to him being disqualified for receipt of benefit for up to six weeks.  The deciding officer who reviewed the case was of the opinion that the explanation tendered by him for his refusal did not constitute good cause and he accordingly disqualified his claim for a period of six weeks from 12 May 1987.</P>
    <P>He appealed against the disqualification and arrangements are being made to have his case determined by an appeals officer at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>Registrars are appointed by the health boards under the general direction of An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar General).</P>
      <P>A Registrar must attend at a known place of business and register births, deaths and marriages occurring within his district, on the information of qualified informants or otherwise as provided by law, in register books supplied for the purpose.  He is also obliged to furnish quarterly returns of all births, deaths and marriages recorded to An tArd-Chláraitheoir and statistical returns to the Central Statistics Office.  He also issues certificates from the register books when required.  At present there are approximately 380 registrars operating 632 registration districts.</P>
      <P>It is the policy where vacancies arise in registration districts to centralise the registration into the bigger towns and, where possible, to have it carried out by trained health board staff already engaged in registration work.  This creates a more efficient and convenient service for the public and is working well.</P>

So far as dental manpower is concerned, the appropriate number of dental officers required for this country is under examination by my Department and the Dental Council.  The Department of Education, together with the Higher Education Authority, has primary responsibility for our medical and dental schools.  The question of the provision of a new Dublin dental hospital as a training facility is, therefore, a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I presume the question refers to the acute hospital sector.  The explanation is that in general the acute public hospitals cater for a higher throughput of more complicated and, consequently, more costly treatment procedures.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that average daily costs in high technology private hospitals such as the Mater and Blackrock Clinic are significantly higher than average daily costs in acute public hospitals.</P>

      <P>The function of the registration authorities under the Registration Acts involves much more than the issue of certificates.  Certificates are issued at central level by the General Register Office and at local level by the health boards in their capacities as Superintendent Registrars. While the overall cost of providing the service outweights the fees received, the imbalance is not of the order suggested. A good number of certificates are required for social welfare purposes and these are issued at a greatly reduced rate. As already pointed out in reply to an earlier question, the fees are kept under regular review with a view, in the longer term, to making the service as self financing as possible.</P>

      <P>Six of the eight health boards have completed preparation of their 1986 annual abstracts of accounts, for audit by the Local Government Auditors, and the remaining two boards will have completed these abstracts during the course of the year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health his views on whether there is duplication in the systems of inspection of food and food premises by his Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food; if such inspection should now be rationalised within one Department, preferably within the Department of Agriculture and Food applying export standards to all produce and outlets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food has a particular responsibility for meat and milk legislation as well as for <Col N="162" /> regulations dealing with cereal and vegetable production and marketing.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health also has a particular responsibility to ensure that food placed on the market for human consumption does not constitute a danger to public health.</P>
      <P>If, where these two responsibilities meet, opportunties arise to improve the systems of inspection then steps are taken to bring about rationalisation.  I am keeping the situation under review.</P>
      <P>Such a step is now being considered in the context of the proposed slaughterhouses Bill.  Conditions in slaughterhouses and the inspection of meat prior to its being placed on sale to the public can perhaps best be carried out by officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food in order to make the best use of available resources and personnel and to bring the situation into line with that already applying in export plants.  Once meat leaves the slaughterhouse however to become an item of sale for human consumption, public health requirements can best be ensured by health personnel who have knowledge of human diseases and infections.</P>
      <P>In addition to clear lines of responsibility, there is close liaison at local level between health board and local authority staff.  Duplication in functions should therefore ordinarily not arise and I do not accept that there is confusion or duplication which would warrant the transfer of functions from my Department to the Department of Agriculture and Food or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
