It is a legislative proposal and it is before the House at present.  I understand that it has to be before the House for 21 days before it becomes an order.  It will be effective from 1 June.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this debate adjourned yesterday evening, I had been outlining the Fine Gael goodwill towards this budget given the circumstances of the election.  In a critical scrutiny of it I felt that the budget was hastily prepared and cobbled together, that it lacked imagination and vision and was gambling on a strategy that would reduce interest rates which might not work in view of the recent developments in the wholesale money market in Dublin and the increased rates of gilts.  I felt very strongly that there had been a degree of electoral dishonesty by the people now in Government relating to the individual insertions in the programme for Government &ldquo;A Better Way Forward&rdquo; and the subsequent package that was in the budget.</P>
      <P>The budget is particularly unfair in its application to the low and middle income groups in relation to the reduction in mortgage tax relief and increased charges at local authority, health service and school transport levels as well as increased costs for VHI and life assurance. I also outlined that the budget arithmetic would be awry by the order of £130 million in terms of the current budget deficit by the end of the year.  I outlined the areas where I felt the wrong estimate had been made.  These are the areas of pay, social welfare, tax, grants, health and the withholding tax.  This morning, therefore, I wish to deal with other aspects of the budget which deserve special attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain aspects of this country's financial problems have been ignored in the budget.  At a time when the overall drift is to improve the public finances, it seems <Col N="2015" /> extraordinary that in the area of massive expenditure, that is the 20 State agencies providing services to industry, training and the whole manpower area, there are 3,400 people employed spending £400 million per annum in grants and administration while there is no analysis of how effective this expenditure is.  In times of very scarce resources they seem to have escaped.  To say that the Kilkenny Design Centre or the Irish Productivity Centre will be self-financing in two years is totally inadequate to deal with the problems in this area.  At later periods during the lifetime of this Government I will outline in detail, as will my party, measures which will give better value for money and provide better services for less money in this area.</P>
    <P>Public sector pay is a basic element of the Government's budgetary strategy.  At present public sector pay accounts for 16 per cent to GNP.  In 1975 the corresponding figure was 10 per cent.  There is no doubt that public sector pay is a major consumer of the resources of the State.  Members of the public service have certain benefits in terms of low PRSI rates and low deductions for pension. There will be a carryover from 1986 to 1987 of the 5 per cent increase in the public sector pay bill with a 2 per cent increase provided for from 1 May.  It is absolutely vital that the Government hold the line on public service pay.  The Government are pursuing the wrong path when they seek to have a consensus on pay.  I am all in favour of dialogue and consultation but the years during which Ireland lost most competitiveness and became more out of line in terms of costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners was when we had national pay agreements.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that in terms of competitiveness this economy can only afford pay increases in those areas where the market can pay for them or where there will be no loss of competitiveness. A free for all is a much more prudent approach in relation to pay whereby a factory by factory approach or a sector by sector approach can be taken.  If a pay norm were set across the board it would <Col N="2016" /> only lead to a major loss of competitiveness for the sectors which simply cannot afford to pay increased claims.  I hope at an early stage the Government will state their intent of allowing a free market position on pay.</P>
    <P>Another area to which the Government should give special attention in relation to restoring growth in the economy is the £4 billion worth of assets which are held by pension funds.  The cash flow of these pension funds is of the order of £400 million per year.  Sixty per cent of this investment is in Government gilts and 10 per cent is abroad.  It is this money which holds the key to unlocking future economic development in this country and one of the early and major priorities of the Government should be to ensure that these pension funds, £4 billion in all, are used to develop the critical areas of manufacturing, tourism and the other growth sectors such as information technology and biotechnology.  I hope at an early stage the Government will try to produce the necessary incentives to develop such an investment strategy which is lacking at present.  At the end of the day, you will not have 2 per cent growth per annum simply because you put it in an election document; it will only be created by new companies doing new things and that will not happen unless the incentives and opportunities are provided. It certainly will not happen in a budget such as this which increases taxation in overall terms by 6.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another area where economic growth can be triggered in the economy is in the semi-State sector.  Semi-State companies are a very important part of the economic apparatus available to the Government to stimulate development.  They account for in the order of 18 per cent of total public sector borrowing.  While in the seventies and early eighties substantial losses accumulated in many of these semi-State companies, over the period of the last Government a substantial improvement was brought about.  The Government have to be prepared to use the resources of State companies as a third sector of the economy and must not get tied up in the ideological log-jam of State only or <Col N="2017" /> private enterprise only.  We should look at the third sector of the economy which is that of joint venture.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some European examples.  We had to listen to a lot of nonsense last night from Deputy McDowell.  He said nobody would be interested in buying a minority stake in State companies.  That is patent nonsense. Royal Dutch Airlines, KLM, are 55 per cent state owned.  Deutsch Lufthansa, West German Airlines, are 82 per cent State owned.  British Sugar sold 24 per cent in 1981.  Associated British Ports sold 49 per cent in 1983.  What we must do in companies such as NET, a small fertiliser company who cannot stand alone, is to allow multinational companies in tandem with the State company to move ahead and develop new markets and new opportunities.</P>
    <P>What the Government should do as a matter of urgency is, through the Department of Finance, to have a review of the semi-State companies.  They should call in the State Merchant Bank and the ICC to carry out an analysis of the State companies who can develop in a joint venture fashion.  If these companies have inadequate equity, are over borrowed and need an injection of equity to improve their financial performance, let that equity come from the private sector as the Government will not be able to provide it.  Instead of starving them of resources, let them develop with an outside input and give them a cold dose of reality.</P>
    <P>To some extent the arguments about Irish Life have clouded the issue.  A lot of nonsense has been spoken about Irish Life.  Some of the shares in Irish Life are not owned by the State.  It is a company which could have shares sold in it.  As of December 1983, its equity was £500,000. The fact that it is mutualised greatly negatives its potential.  I reject the argument that £600 million or £700 million could be raised from Irish Life.  I do not think that is true.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to one of the principles we in Government felt very strongly about.  I was very disappointed <Col N="2018" /> in some of the changes made in this year's budget.  It is a very important principle in politics and in Government that an overall tenet of your administration is that you help people to help themselves. Schemes were introduced by the last Coalition Government such as the enterprise allowance scheme and the housing grants, which facilitated individuals to improve their circumstances, to move from unemployment to self employment and to develop the homes which they owned by providing State incentives.  In this budget the enterprise allowance scheme has been cut by £1.5 million and the housing grants have all been but abolished.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to agriculture because it is of particular significance not only in terms of the rural economy but in terms of its vital exports.  I am very annoyed by the sleight of hand of the Government.  There was no mention prior to the election of the reduction in the VAT refund to farmers from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent.  This will affect all farmers, both large and small, those making losses and those with small turnovers. The rate of VAT refund had been increased over the years to compensate for increased VAT rates on agricultural contracting services, on sprays and other products.  That has now been completely undermined.  I hope the Government will realise that there are only 1,300 farmers registered for VAT and this area needs to be reviewed.  It is most unfair.</P>
    <P>Equally unfair is the decision which has been taken in relation to the farm improvement grants.  A circular was sent out to farmers who had been approved for large grants under the farm improvement programme.  They were told that as and from 25 March if they were over their milk quota they would lose their grant. They received that circular on 30 March. The last day of the production year for milk quotas was 31 March.  They went over their quotas because they were encouraged to do so in the national interest by their creameries.  They now find they are at the loss of those grants. This is totally unfair.  I do not know if it <Col N="2019" /> is illegal and I ask the Minister to review it urgently.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the installation premium not only will cause chaos to applications in the pipeline but will be a very negative act in the overall policy of trying to develop agricultural education and the incentives which would transfer land to younger and more productive farmers. The work of the farm classification office was worthwhile and assisted in developing profiles for smaller farmers in relation to tax on accounts.  They also gave the facility of having a fair basis on which to assess farmers for higher education grants and health benefit entitlements, such as hospital services cards, etc.  It is misguided in the short term to abolish this office.</P>
    <P>The county committees of agriculture are to be effectively abolished.  Because of the cut of £12,500 in their allocation the county committee of agriculture in Wexford cannot hold any more meetings this year.  I hope the Minister will give a direction and that the very small amount of money which is necessary will be made available to enable the committee to continue in existence.</P>
    <P>The decision to include tourism investment projects in the business expansion scheme is well worthwhile but lip service will not be enough to develop that sector.  There is a need to revamp Bord Fáilte to make it a strong authority that can bring together the disparate private and public sector organisations involved in tourism.  Too many people are moving in different directions in the tourism area. Access transport operators are fighting to resolve their own problems and everything from signposting and services provided by the Office of Public Works and and Forestry and Wildlife Service are the responsibility of different groups.  In the private sector companies involved in the hiring of cabin cruisers, hoteliers, publicans and sporting organisations are all doing their own thing.  We need an integrated tourism policy and a strong State agency, not with massive resources but with strong legal resources to pull that product together.  That organisation <Col N="2020" /> should have specific job and wealth creating targets but those targets are not provided for in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government should make up their mind about the local tourism product, whether they intend to strengthen the regional tourism organisations or abolish them.  At present those groups are in no man's land.  The functions should be given back to the county councils and tourism officers appointed or a programme should be prepared for the regional tourism officers.  On the marketing side we need to develop the role of Irish handling agents, those who develop Irish package holidays sold through travel agents in Amsterdam, London and other major centres of population.  Those agents can sell the Irish tourism product and a CTT-type policy of directly assisting Irish handling agents is overdue and necessary.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is very disappointed with the budget.  The Government's response to the construction industry was very poor when one considers what they promised in the election campaign.  It is no harm to recall what Fianna Fáil said they would do for the construction industry during the election campaign.  They told us they would restore a section 23 type incentive to stimulate private sector investment but when they were elected to Government they abolished the modest relief provision under section 29.  In the campaign they told us they would reduce the VAT rates on construction projects from 10 per cent to 5 per cent but that has been ignored in the budget.  They told us they would release, as soon as possible, school, harbour and other projects at present being held in different Departments but that has been forgotten.  Specific promises were made in regard to county roads but they were not honoured. In spite of all the promises made during Private Members' time in the past four years we find that in places like Wexford the road strengthening grant allocated by the previous Government has been suspended.  In fact, this grant was called back two weeks ago.  That is unacceptable. The construction industry has <Col N="2021" /> a strong added-value factor in relation to the use of Irish products and the direct use of Irish labour and while I accept that we will never return to the heady days of the late seventies there is a need for a balanced approach to the construction industry with long-term planning. However, plans in regard to that industry have been thrown out the window.  I hope the Government will see their way to restoring confidence in that sector.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government get their act together with regard to the manufacturing sector.  A priority I would suggest is the early approval of the NBST proposals to set up infrastructure for research and development and science and technology.  In 1984 the NBST submitted to the Government a private and public financing programme to establish companies on the campus of universities and to establish different research units to assist companies.  In the areas of advanced manufacturing technology and biotechnology a £6 million programme was suggested but I have not heard anything about that suggestion.  Other countries in Europe spend 1 per cent of GDP on research and development and on science and technology and there is no doubt that that is where the new jobs will be created.  We must get our act together in regard to those areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government, following on the publication of the document which dealt with industrial performance by the Government in 1986, will provide a loan guarantee scheme, similar to the scheme in the UK, to give the resources to equity starved and under-capitalised small firms anxious to expand.  There is a problem on the export side and large engineering firms cannot get industrial export credit insurance at a reasonable price.  There is a lack of bonding facilities here.  I hope that through CTT or Fóir Teoranta specific policies are developed.  I hope that designation, about which the ESRI and the NESC produced reports, will be brought forward so that counties with the highest rate of unemployment will be earmarked for the highest rate of industrial aid.</P>
    <P>With regard to tax reform, it is interesting <Col N="2022" /> to note that the PAYE take will rise by 9½ per cent as a result of provisions in the budget.  No new initiatives are planned. I would like to see a number of small and inexpensive changes made. Employers who take on new employees should get, as they do in the US, a tax credit against the company's tax liabilities whether it is in the form of a reduction in employers' PRSI, in VAT payments or corporation tax.  Companies should be given credit for two years in the region of £1,000 in the first year and £500 in the second year.  That would be a clear signal to the business community that the Government want them to employ new workers.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on marketing is necessary and lip service from the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, or having his picture printed in the newspapers is not enough.  Special tax facilities should be arranged for marketing personnel who spend more than 60 days abroad.  I would like to see a renewal of the PRSI exemption for new employees which proved successful.  I hope the Government will ensure that specific measures are taken in the marketing area to help establish trading corporations, private and public sector joint ventures, that will provide a selling presence across Europe which small firms cannot afford.  All small firms are finding it hard to survive with very low profit margins.  The IDA estimate a 1 per cent gross rate of return on assets and it is hard for firms with that return to be able to afford an export presence.  Those firms need a vehicle to be able to sell their wares on the export market.  There should be an expansion of the personnel scheme.  We should have trading corporations that will sell wholesale the goods of firms abroad on a commission basis and utilise the diplomatic resources available to the State through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>In my constituency problems have arisen since the Government took office. In the past four years a most expansive house construction programme was embarked on by local authorities.  In my <Col N="2023" /> home town 163 houses were built but it is not envisaged that any houses will be built by the local authorities in Wexford this year other than those already committed. Similarly, there seems to be a goslow on main drainage projects in Enniscorthy and Wexford town.  When I was a Government backbencher.  I was harangued after every budget in regard to money for coastal protection and harbour development at Rosslare but there is not the same appetite for lobbying now.  I should like to warn my Wexford colleagues &mdash; I am disappointed they have no ministerial responsibility &mdash; that I will be pressing them to ensure the necessary resources are allocated.  I specifically asked that the IDA be allowed to acquire the Edermine site in Enniscorthy and that the necessary finance be made available. I hope the proceeds from the national lottery will be used to finance outdoor pursuit centres.  There is one in Shielbeggan and New Ross.  The meeting between the Minister of State for sport and the recent deputation was inconclusive in this respect.  As regards Wexford hospital, on which the Government have a dubious record.  I hope the necessary finances will be made available to ensure that there is early progress with the planned construction there.</P>
    <P>We must create jobs and economic growth.  These jobs must pay for themselves and not be phoney State jobs which will prove a burden on the wealth-creating sector of the economy and will be paid for through high taxation.  We are a small economy.  We have a population of 3 million people.  Ireland accounts for a half per cent of world trade.  We must set an ambitious target of 1 per cent of world trade by 1990.  We must have a strategic plan to do that.  In the short term that involves improving public finances and our competitive position.  More than that it requires pressing the accelerator of the engine of development in the economy. We must single out the sectors of the economy which can grow and develop and those which have suffered deep depression such as the construction <Col N="2024" /> industry.  We must see how standards can be raised in order to improve our exports.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are only one component of an overall economic strategy.  Ireland should be run like a limited company. We should be a Mecca for investment. We must increase our exports.  For example, if we were to sell as much to the West Germans as we do to the Dutch we would create £1 billion of extra trade. There is no reason why we cannot sell more Waterford Glass, Irish liqueur drinks, Guinness or any of our front runner products.  However, it will not happen by itself.  It requires skill and investment.  There is 50 per cent less mobile investment coming into this country for many reasons.  As a result of the international recession many multinationals are restricting themselves to their core business in the US and Japan. We are on the periphery of Europe and other countries are giving the same rates of grants as we were.  We are not as attractive now given that there is an additional 10 per cent transport cost to export out of Ireland.  With labour costs and so on it is now better to invest in Korea, the Far East and Latin American countries.  We must fight harder in an increasingly competitive environment. We must have a cohesive strategy and ensure that entrepreneurs who take risks and mortgage their homes are rewarded. There is nothing in this budget in relation to taxation which would give an incentive to such people.  We must realise there is only one way forward.  We must ensure that those who have the capacity to bring about growth are brought back to Ireland and given an opportunity to expand and develop.</P>
    <P>For too long we have paid lip service to the black economy.  It is my information that on a number of public sector construction projects, in some cases a majority of employees are working and signing on.  We all know about the lump system and different abuses.  We must realise that if we are to reduce taxation and maintain essential services everyone must pay their fair share.  The resolution of this problem lies in the public attitude. There is a very thin line in our history <Col N="2025" /> between civic spirit and being an informer.  We must change attitudes to ensure that abuses are brought to the attention of the State.  This would reduce the level of resentment felt by those who feel they are penally treated.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments have been constructive. I have tried to show through my observation of the last Government that there is more to running a country than improving the public finances.  I welcome the change of heart by Fianna Fáil. In 1980 and 1981 the public sector borrowing requirement jumped to 20.3 per cent of GNP.  It is a pity that happened because we would not have our current pain if such a mistake had not been made.</P>
    <P>There was an element of electoral dishonesty which will result in the people being cynical as far as politicians are concerned. The Taoiseach would not talk about cuts during the election.  As a result the people believed there was an easier and better way.  This budget has proved that the policy of the previous Government in terms of improving the public finances, having a sustained programme for growth and getting better value for money, is the only way forward, and provided the Government stick to that strategy they will continue to have the goodwill of my party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When resources are available it is difficult to decide on their allocation but when they are scarce the difficulty is compounded.  As a newly elected TD it gives me no pleasure to support not just the deployment of fewer funds but the decisions on expenditure cuts.  Yet, this is a challenge that has to be accepted by everyone.  Generally speaking, it is agreed that the finances of this country are in a mess.  In the recent general election the people quite clearly spelled out that they were giving a kiss of death to the Coalition Government who had failed them miserably and they were asking Fianna Fáil to come back to power and set about eradicating the problems. <Col N="2026" /> In my view, the budget must be seen by all concerned people as an extremely positive attempt to tackle the downward spiral of depression into which more and more people were being sucked.</P>
      <P>Ireland has one of the highest levels of public spending in the industrialised world.  Last September the cumulative national debt had risen to 145 per cent of national output.  That compares with a debt of approximately 60 per cent in the EC as a whole.  This exceptional level of public spending must be paid for either by taxation or borrowing.  We know that taxation has reached its limit and, therefore, expenditure has to be contained if we are to progress as a nation.  There is considerable evidence that a high level of Government spending slows down the economy.  During the past 25 years, in OECD countries where government spending accounted for more than half the national output, real incomes grew by just over ½ per cent per annum, whereas real incomes in those economies where government spending accounted for less than a quarter of the national output grew by more than 5 per cent.  We must achieve reductions in expenditure while, at the same time, ensuring that the weaker sections of our society are properly cared for.  It is important that we maintain our record as a caring community but, having said that, it is vital that we bring State spending down to a level that industry can support so that we can continue to make up the deficit. Servicing the debt drives up the cost of money to industry.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have clearly indicated in the budget that they intend to stem the haemorrhage of funds leaving the country by giving a lead in reducing their own expenditure.  The financial markets have been waiting for the signal that the Government will limit their appetite for funds.  Effectively, this means the Government do not intend to compete to the same degree as previously with industry for those scarce funds. Thus, as funds become less scarce it will be easier for industry to borrow and this will affect interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous that the cost of borrowing <Col N="2027" /> is 16 per cent when inflation is less than 4 per cent and the average return on industrial investment by established industries is only 5 per cent.  It is essential that industry should have access to funds at the average EMS interest rates which are almost 6 per cent lower than those in the Irish market.  This would greatly improve our cost effectiveness and thereby increase substantially our ability to sell on foreign markets.  This will allow us also to go a long way to provide a cure for unemployment, and this lies in securing a vigorous and profitable industrial and commercial sector.</P>
    <P>Provided we begin to act rationally, it is feasible to reduce unemployment.  By this I mean that we start to appreciate what is necessary to bring about national prosperity and to set out actively to achieve it.  We will have to pull together and get behind those who wish to create prosperity for all in the generation of employment.  The onus is on Members of this House to set the pace.  The Irish people do not wish to hear the Opposition parties haggling over whose policies were adopted in this budget.  In my view the Government have grasped the nettle and have indicated clearly that they will lead the country out of its present morass. Furthermore, a poll in The Irish Times of 8 April 1987 shows that 57 per cent of the voters accepted that the budget is good for the country, even though they themselves will suffer as a consequence.  This is positive proof the Government have struck the right balance.</P>
    <P>The budget ensures that we maintain our record as a caring and concerned society.  We brought forward the increases in social welfare by 15 weeks, we provided an additional 1,500 places under the social employment scheme, the career guidance teacher service was restored and the Government refused to levy prescription charges.  These measures removed the anti-social features of the proposed Fine Gael budget.  The Government have lead also by example, by cutting their own public expenditure. Special pay increases for Ministers, judges and top civil servants have been <Col N="2028" /> deferred.  The Government have created the climate where they can ask those in secure pensionable employment to accept a pay pause.</P>
    <P>In my view it is commendable that the Government insisted that the ESB and the pigmeat factories should pay £22 million which was owed to the Exchequer. This is a signal to other defaulters that the Government will pursue them vigorously. The cutting of State bureaucracy such as the merging of the Departments of Finance and the Public Service with a redeployment of staff into revenue collection sectors is laudable.</P>
    <P>The stringent budget measures are judiciously spread on those who can afford to pay.  I am pleased this is the case.  Farmers are taxed on exactly the same basis as everyone else in the self-employment sector.  The abolition of the land tax has to be welcomed because it was inequitable.  The cost of collecting the land tax far outweighed the amount of money recouped.  By the same criterion, may I suggest to the Minister that he review the property tax? Farmers who are unregistered for VAT are affected by the reduction in the VAT rate from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent on the prices they sell their produce to VAT registered persons.  VAT in this instant was intended as a compensation mechanism but the reduction means compensation is reduced by almost 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>The removal of grants is noted as particularly serious for the construction industry.  Yet, in net terms the amount of money provided for housing is £386 million compared with £382 million provided in 1986.  Accordingly, we have maintained the State's commitment to this area, and that, I might add, against the irresponsible and reckless manner in which the former Minister for the Environment allowed the cost to the Exchequer grow under the house improvements scheme.  This has had a staggering effect.  We may ask how the Minister for Finance allowed the cost of this scheme to exceed £230 million without shouting? Was it because an election was pending?</P>

      <P>The £5,000 surrender grant, while proving costly to the Exchequer, has served its purpose in that an adequate number of local authority houses are now available.  The social consequences arising from such a grant were beginning to have major reverberations.  Therefore, the rantings of the former Minister for the Environment must be judged on a record of what I term total ineptitude. The corrective measures now being taken by the Government are being forced upon us by the irrational behaviour of the previous administration.  Indeed, from 9 March to the point of leaving office that Minister approved amenity grants totalling £500,000 in the Dublin area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;many of them within his own constituency.  In the present economic climate surely it is only valid to question a grant of £50,000 to a racing pigeon club.</P>
      <P>The construction industry are realistic in that they know the only way they can become secure and profitable again is through a significant fall in interest rates, and this budget is providing the medicine to bring this about.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the £10 daily charge for hospital services has been totally misrepresented.  Deprived people will still have full entitlement and will not be subjected to the £10 charge.  Coinciding with that is the introduction of a low cost scheme under VHI which will cover all those affected by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the re-commencement of a decentralisation programme.  As a Cork Deputy I see my city as one of the first to benefit from the programme.  I regret that this administration were not in power when the national lottery was being sited <Col N="2030" /> in Dublin.  With minimum costs, that is without location costs or staffing problems, we could have based it in a city which would welcome any boost to its economic life.  I feel sure the Taoiseach and the Minister will agree there is an unnatural bias towards Dublin which has experienced a 22 per cent growth while cities like Cork and Waterford have stagnated.</P>
    <P>An area where we might profitably decentralise is that of tax collection.  Outstanding tax collections at present are in the hands of county and city sheriffs.  The collection amounts are paid out to the sheriff, a collection fee or commission is levied and that money is lodged to the sheriff's account.  In many instances, it lies on deposit for six to nine months without reaching the Exchequer.  It might now be time to ask the Minister if the State benefits from the interest accruing on such deposits.</P>
    <P>We should approach tax collection in a more businesslike fashion and cease sending out an endless stream of bills. Surely we should be able to organise staff to collect at local level.  We could use some form of cash bonus for prompt payment and allow the Revenue Commissioners to make deals, for example on interest due as a once off exercise, in order to bring in long outstanding arrears and have a moratorium on that, say, to the end of the year.  By the same token, it will be absolutely necessary to amend legislation to make it impossible for persons to walk away from debts due to the Revenue Commissioners under the 1986 legislation.</P>
    <P>This Government have taken the right steps to get this country on its feet again. I am pleased that yesterday the Taoiseach reiterated that the Government will abide by the decisions taken and resist all the pressures with which they will undoubtedly be faced from the various pressure groups.  That stance will lead to confidence.  Already we have seen that cutting expenditure has had a dramatic effect.  This morning I read in the papers that we are to get that expected drop in interest rates in a short time.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest that cutting expenditure <Col N="2031" /> in itself will not bring growth.  Alert and well trained entrepreneurs will do so. The only means by which the economy can be improved is by successful development of existing wealth creation businesses and the continual creation of new ones.  Therefore, in the long term, the extent to which we can build up a satisfactory and secure economy will depend largely on the number of profitable businesses we can produce that can prosper.</P>
    <P>At a financial level, Ireland is one of the most pro-enterprise nations in the world because the range of fiscal and Government incentives here is enormous. Equally, there are a large number of suppliers of capital to industry in this country.  In the European context we have seen a shortage of enterprise in Ireland relative to the more developed European economies with which we would like to compare ourselves.  Yet there is ample evidence that we are an enterprising people as is clearly demonstrated by the successful Irish business people in the US and elsewhere and by the remarkable developments we have seen over the past decade of Irish owned companies expanding their operations abroad</P>
    <P>We train accountants, engineers and chemists, but do we ever teach the method of thinking that is necessary if one is to establish successful business?  In other words, we are not getting down to the job of producing entrepreneurs from school level.  Business success will not come by accident, and we will have to examine the role of the IDA.  Certainly we will have to encourage the establishment of entrepreneurial training centres at regional level, possibly running in conjunction with regional innovation centres.</P>
    <P>Another area where we can improve is in ensuring that industrial and commercial libraries are made available in all the major towns so that business ideas, market information industrial techniques etc. will be available to those who want to seek them out.  A far greater co-relationship should exist between those libraries and our third level institutions. <Col N="2032" /> In addition, we will have to improve the quality of the training in other areas, especially marketing.  Everybody believes now that growth in our economy and an increase in our employment levels will be the result of extending our markets abroad but if we examine the curriculum we find that languages do not play the role they should play in our school system.  We must ensure that our children have the opportunity to become fluent in at least two languages at a very early stage of their school life and that exchange visits to European countries and so on are encouraged in this regard.</P>
    <P>The policy of advocating wider share ownership in profit related pay is sensible and must be encouraged.  In this budget it is encouraged through the business expansion programme but at the moment the ordinary PAYE worker receives no fiscal incentive to work harder or even to become more committed to his employer.  This could be changed by taxing profit related pay more lightly than fixed wages.  After all, would additional profits not produce additional tax? Businesses also must be encouraged to maximise profits, and perhaps a reduced rate of corporation tax for super profits would encourage businesses to maximise their own efforts.  I am confident that this budget has set the framework for economic recovery and certainly it will have my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend a welcome to the general thrust of the budget.  On a first examination it appears to be making a serious attempt to bring about an improvement in the public finances which have deteriorated during the past number of years to a level where the economic profile of the country is quite appalling.  We have a national debt of the order of £24 billion, which represents about 140 per cent of GNP and a debt servicing cost annually the equivalent of all the PAYE taxes we collect. Any measure, therefore, which within reason will change for the better will have the support of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important also that any criticism <Col N="2033" /> of the budget should be constructive and should be designed to bring about the necessary improvements.  Some scorn has been heaped on Fianna Fáil in relation to their belated conversion to financial rectitude and various comments have been made about the road to Damascus. Fine Gael have been saying that their clothes have been stolen in relation to many of the policy objectives stated in the budget.  While all of this may be true, it is my view and that of my party, that if the measures proposed are in themselves worthwhile they should be supported irrespective of their origin.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many shortcomings in this budget which give rise to serious questions of credibility in terms of the Government's ability of being able to meet the targets they have set themselves. These targets are more easily stated than realisable and in many cases are completely aspirational.  In addition some of the vital ingredients the economy needs are missing from this budget.  The economy needs a stimulus and a prospect for growth which does not appear to be in this budget.  The Government hope that favourable investment terms will be brought about due to falling interest rates as a result of the budget measures.  We all know that fluctuation in interest rates are subject to many factors over which the Government have no control.  Is there an over-reliance on their part that the desired fall will come about?  There is no stimulus in the budget other than the hope that is pinned on an interest rates fall.  The Progressive Democrats considered it essential that the budget should have contained incentive based developmental type policies but these are sadly lacking.  Such developmental policies, we were told during the election campaign, were central to the Government's whole economic strategy yet they have not included any such policies in their budget programme, except by way of many aspirations which I hope they will be able to meet.  The result, therefore, is a book-keeper's budget.  On the one hand it takes hard cutting measures which are necessary in some areas but it is not innovative and is not designed to stimulate growth <Col N="2034" /> in the economy and provide jobs.  This aspect is very disappointing.  While there is some movement in this direction, for example, there has been an extension of the business expansion scheme to include certain export tourism and shipping activities, the measures seem to be very small in themselves.  We will need much more detail and clarification of what they mean.</P>
    <P>Another item which is short on detail but which would have the support of the Progressive Democrats since we have advocated this measure ourselves is the Government's proposal to establish a committee to advise on the setting up of an international financial services centre which would have as one of its main incentives a favourable tax climate.  This is an area where there are real growth prospects and where there will be jobs for many of our graduates.  I, and my party, await with interest further details of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, an area which is totally ignored in the budget is that of privatisation. The House will be aware that our party debated a motion on this subject in Private Members' time during the past two days.  We regard privatisation as central to economic development and an improvement in the appalling economic climate that exists in Ireland.  It is essential that a privatisation programme be implemented.  The proceeds from the sale of shares in semi-State companies should be used to reduce the national debt.  This would have a major effect on the current budget deficit by way of reducing the servicing cost of the national debt which annually costs the equivalent of all the PAYE taxes collected.  The Government, therefore, should now evaluate and draw up a list of those State and semi-State companies and assets which would be suitable and viable for the disposal of some or all of their shares.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been ignored in the budget is that of tax reform.  The Minister told us that the Government are in favour of self assessment, that they will give it a priority: But what does that mean?  When will they commence implementation of the self-assessment <Col N="2035" /> system which works effectively in other countries?  This system has to be contrasted with the actual system existing at present where it is alleged that £650 million is outstanding in unpaid taxes. The Government are now setting up a task force which will comprise 25 people who will be deployed from other areas within the public service.  Their target this year is to collect £10 million of the £650 million outstanding.</P>
    <P>Personal taxation in the budget has increased, in my estimation, by 14 per cent.  This is a huge disincentive to people who work.  It discourages enterprise and people with initiative from becoming involved in projects if that level of taxation is to apply and if taxation generally is to increase.  The additional taxation arises in several ways, from, for example, no adjustment in tax bands, an increase in the health levy from 1 per cent to 1¼ per cent, a raising on the ceiling on PRSI and health contributions and, of course a reduction of 10 per cent in the mortgage interest relief.  All of these increase substantially the personal tax burden.  The 10 per cent reduction in mortgage relief is probably the thin end of the wedge; next year it may be increased further. This measure together with other measures in the budget affect greatly the construction industry.  That industry has been given much reason for concern.</P>
    <P>The reaction to the budget from the construction industry is predictable.  It had been led to believe the budget would contain proposals which would give some hope; in fact, it did the reverse.  Over the past few days we had three out of four housing grants being abolished and the amazing spectacle of the necessary U-turn by the Government in this regard. This is an indication of the state of confusion in the Government ranks which creates a feeling of unease about their ability to maintain their budget strategy.</P>
    <P>While it applies to professions outside the construction industry, the withholding tax on professional fees has a particular relevance to architects and engineers and will have a very adverse effect on many professional practices.  It <Col N="2036" /> will greatly disrupt cash flow within such practices, particularly where partners are in receipt of a salary which is provided out of income.  This measure is earmarked to bring in £25 million this year and is identical to VAT at point of entry in so far as it brings forward into the current tax year receipts which in normal circumstances would not arise until next year.</P>
    <P>The one positive thing that can be said about this measure is that it may bring out of the black economy some undeclared sources of publicly funded self-employed income.  It may have the effect of weeding out that area to some extent.  Would the Minister explain if, in withholding the income tax relating to the professional services involved, it is also his intention to withhold the VAt related component of each payment?</P>
    <P>The construction industry is a very important one in our economy in that it is, or certainly was, a very large employer.  The workforce has been depleted by something like 15,000 people over the past few years.  Stimulation of this sector gives rise to a large and immediate increase in employment.  This is the expectation of that industry, particularly from a Fianna Fáil Government. The industry has the great and worthwhile advantage of using native material. Whatever can be done to stimulate this sector should be done, but the measures outlined in the budget will have the reverse effect.</P>
    <P>We do not disagree fundamentally with the measures taken in the budget but the construction industry can be helped in a way which will benefit it and the economy. Construction is not necessarily an end in itself.  We recognise that it must be market led.  There is a huge amount of work crying out to be done in the whole area of infrastructural development which this budget has overlooked completely.  Incentive based schemes to encourage private enterprise, including financial institutions and private investors, to enter into joint ventures with local authorities for the provision of roads, toll bridges, water and drainage schemes and so forth must be brought <Col N="2037" /> forward.  There is generous grant-aid available from the EC, also, for these projects.  In any event, this is an area in which the Government must be innovative. It is one where there is a real opportunity for creating immediate employment and stimulating a sector which has suffered very badly over the past five years.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to some of the budget specifics, or in many cases more properly, unspecifics.  There is a total in unspecified savings on the current side amounting to £26.22 million.  These savings are all additional to the Fine Gael January 1987 budget, items which the Government apparently found during the past few weeks and which, incredibly, both Fine Gael and the same Department officials could not find last January.  The reasons for my misgivings are based on the way in which the Government indicate that they will make these savings.  Under the heading of Education they say they will make a saving of £5.25 million made up as follows: £1.1 million VEC savings through &ldquo;greater efficiencies to be achieved in the running of all the VECs&rdquo;. There is £2.65 million saved on third level education which is going to be achieved &ldquo;on the basis of greater efficiencies in the running of higher education authority institutions.&rdquo;  Also £½ million is to be saved on community and comprehensive schools, again due to efficiencies in the running of these schools.  There is to be a further saving of £1 million in regional and technological colleges due to a greater efficiency in running these colleges. At a stroke the Government say they will save over £5 million through what they have described as more efficient and more economic running of these institutions.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Agriculture, the Government intend to save £4 million more than Fine Gael, through savings in bodies such as ACOT.  The savings in the Department of Labour are put at £2½ million additional savings, made up of £1 million in AnCO and the YEA schemes which will be achieved through a reduction in overhead costs in both those bodies.  The enterprise allowance scheme <Col N="2038" /> has an unspecified saving of £1½ million and again it is stated that &ldquo;it is expected to arise in this year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are additional savings in Industry and Commerce totalling in excess of £2 million, spread over CTT, IIRS and so forth.  In each case, again, the budget simply describes the achievement as arising from savings being increased.  This is all very laudatory, but the question is: are they based on reality, given that only two months prior to this the same savings could not be found by the outgoing Government and the officials of the various Departments?</P>
    <P>As far as the Department of Health is concerned, in The Principal Features of the Budget, explanatory tables, under the heading of Recruitment, the original 1987 Fine Gael saving was shown as £3.4 million.  The revised saving is now £14.4 million, so there is a net additional saving of £11 million here.  This, apparently, is to be achieved through no new recruitment. Key vacancies will be filled by redeployment or by promotion, according to the Budget Statement.  This must be viewed in the context of extra personnel having to be deployed in the health service to administer the hospital out-patient charges, the increased hospital charges announced in the budget.  The position is that the Government are cutting back £11 million which they found within the space of a few months by way of savings through eliminating the necessity for recruitment while, at the same time, introducing a provision which will require administrative personnel to ensure that it is implemented.  We wish them well in their endeavours.  The total amount of savings in unspecified areas amounts to £26.22 million.  There must be concern as to whether it is possible at all to effect that level of saving given its very aspirational base.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare there is a commitment in the budget to clamp down on abuses.  We welcome that commitment. The Government have not specified exactly how they intend going about this.  They say the measures they intend taking will effect a saving of £4 <Col N="2039" /> million.  The Progressive Democrats have advocated the introduction of a national identity card, as obtains in many other European countries.  Such a card would help to regulate welfare payments and eliminate abuse.  Its issuance would also have other beneficial effects, such as the control of under-age drinking and so on.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the budget to establish an intensive job search programme which it is contended will save £11.5 million, by interviewing 150,000 people for the National Manpower Service. That is really a measure to control dole abuse rather than to create jobs and should be called such.  The programme is praiseworthy but we would draw that distinction.  Inadequate though it may be we welcome the fact that the 3 per cent increase in social welfare payments is being brought forward to July from November.  The only way people can be helped to break out of the poverty trap is by the generation of economic activity and the creation of more jobs.  That must be the aim of any Government.  There is nothing in this budget to generate confidence that that will be achieved by this Government.  Naturally, our obligation to the less well-off in our society is paramount. Consequently we welcome the implementation of those increases from July next.</P>
    <P>Then there is the travellers' allowance restriction designed to save £20 million, whereby a person must prove that they have been outside the jurisdiction of the State for 48 hours in order to qualify for the allowance.  This is designed to correct a serious problem for people living in the northern counties.  However, the measure may not be workable for a number of reasons, not least whether it is contrary to EC regulations.  Indeed, it may lead to an increase in the incidence of smuggling. For example, will any extra personnel be recruited to administer this provision? The whole reason for its introduction has more to do with the differentials in prices, levels of tax and costs generally in the Republic.  That is the area that needs to be tackled more fundamentally.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the amount <Col N="2040" /> required for public service pay in the coming year will be £2.813 million, a reduction of approximately £27 million on the Fine Gael estimate.  That figure is based on there being no extra pay after the payment of the final 2 per cent of the current round.  The pre-conditions to meeting this target are an embargo on recruitment, with few exceptions, a ban on all special awards and a complete pay freeze.  The Progressive Democrats support these measures.  We trust the Government will not weaken in their resolve and will not yield to pressure groups who undoubtedly will mount a campaign on this whole issue in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Another major area where savings have been effected in the budget is that of funding of local authorities.  For example, the rates support grant is being cut by £30 million.  In addition £12 million is being cut from the local authority housing programme. There is also a recruitment freeze and a £3 million cut on sanitary services and other smaller cuts.  It is obvious that local authorities will have to introduce charges for many of the services they provide.  The Fianna Fáil attitude to date, which certainly formed the base on which they fought the 1985 local elections, has been that local charges should be abolished.  Given the constraints on our economy Fianna Fáil have found themselves having to take a U-turn in this respect.  However we support them because, in this case, it is being done for the right reasons.</P>
    <P>The Government have no mandate for the measures detailed in this budget. During the recent general election campaign they deliberately clouded debate on the need for responsibility in Government and for taking tough measures. Through their slogan &ldquo;There is a Better Way&rdquo; they suggested there were soft options available.  Now that they have assumed office they have learned the facts and have introduced a budget not by any means along the lines they had indicated in that election campaign.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the budget is in the right direction.  I have outlined my major reservations with regard to the <Col N="2041" /> Government's ability to implement the cuts and savings they have said they will effect.  We will support the budget but we shall be vigilant in coming months to ascertain if any slippage occurs.  My fear is that we shall not have long to wait.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the substance of my contribution I should like to make a couple of comments on what previous speakers have said.  When in the House for part of Deputy Yates' speech I heard him talk about the necessity for creating jobs.  All parties in the House are agreed that this is fundamental to the economic strategy demanded of any Government in office at present.  Deputy Yates went on to say that jobs had to be real jobs, not phoney jobs.  That sentiment would command general support in this House.  Where I would take issue with him is in his implications that the very successful job creating programme of the last 1977-1981 Fianna Fáil government were involved in that area.  Here I should like to quote from the NESC report &mdash;<i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i>&mdash; to indicate how successful that Government were in the creation of real jobs at that time.  It is my memory, and it is a happy one, that the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald &mdash; now a Member of the European Parliament &mdash; had to go to Britain to endeavour to recruit people for jobs created in manufacturing industry at that time.  On page 40 of that NESC report we read, under the heading Industrial Employment:</P>
      <P>Within the industrial sector manufacturing employment fell by 39,000 between 1980 and 1985 compared with an increase of 19,000 over the previous five years.</P>
      <P>That is an indication that what we are talking about now, what we were talking about then and what we were creating then were real not phoney jobs as is often mentioned by political party propagandists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates is a thoughtful contributor <Col N="2042" /> to the debates in this House.  He is responsible and does not make wild statements.  I agree with his statement that there should be sectoral development in our economy and that high interest rates cause suffering among people who have already borrowed at low rates of interest.  They are now paying rates much higher than they thought they would pay when they originally made their investment.  That is the general thrust of this budget and it seems to be the general thrust of the contributions I have heard in this budget debate.  We know there are variables and factors that impact on this whole area of interest rates which we do not control but it is our purpose and our hope that by this strategy we will bring down interest rates, will encourage investment, relieve the hardship of people who have already borrowed money and thus start to stimulate the economy.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the points made by Deputy O'Malley, I disagreed totally with him when he indicated to the House that there was no developmental element in our policy, particularly in our policy as indicated in the budget.  I have been appointed Minister for Tourism and Transport and we intend to concentrate heavily on a developmental policy in tourism.  Already, as the Deputy mentioned, the business expansion scheme is being applied as it was not applied before to the export tourism area and the details will be spelled out in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We also have strong policies with regard to the development of the food business, with regard to developments in technology and in relation to the financial services area.  The whole area of financial services has for some time been the subject of attention by Fianna Fáil.  I also refer to what has been said with regard to proposals in the budget to deal with the problem in the Border areas.  It is not quite accurate to say we are confining ourselves to deal with the Border areas of the country because the conditions there have had ramifications in the south and the west, which areas have also suffered a financial haemorrhage.  Petrol prices play a big part in attracting people <Col N="2043" /> across the Border and when they are there they purchase goods and materials which are often cheaper and better value at home.  There is a psychological element in it and some of the media have been hyping up the advantages of such shopping to the detriment of our economy.  I accept the implications of the statement about prices and in the future we will concentrate on getting some of these significant prices down.  I am pleased with what has been started by this Government. I have met people in modest sized businesses in towns all over the Border area and Deputies from all sides of this House are on the record of this House in agreeing with me that they are in penury as a result of what has been happening. In so far as these provisions in the budget will stop the pilgrimages to spend money and will bring back some business to people who have worked for the development of their businesses but who have been totally defeated through no fault of their own I welcome them and I think that any fair-minded Member of this House will do likewise.  There is a better way.  There is a development way and we are on that way.  In general we have got support from the public for what we have proposed in the budget and for what we intend to do.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget.  The budget demonstrates this Government's determination and willingness to tackle the serious problems that face our nation. I propose to deal with some general issues arising from the budget before commenting on the tourism and transport sectors for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Budget Statement delivered by my colleague the Minister for Finance last week shows this Government's clear commitment to improving the public finances and to strengthening the economy. Improving the public finances without the corollary of strengthening the economy and aiding development would make no appeal to me whatsoever.  It underlines the importance of greater discipline in public expenditure and the need to reduce borrowing.  From a <Col N="2044" /> macro-economic perspective there is general agreement that the balance we struck in the budget is the right one.  It would be counter-productive to have produced a budget which had a major deflationary impact on the economy.</P>
    <P>The strategy of the previous Government very much concentrated on getting the finances right but forgot the corollary I have just mentioned of developing the economy alongside.  On the other hand, an artificial boost to the economy might have short-term benefits.  Here we have the old Keynesian argument raising its head: any benefits would be transient and our already severe economic problems in the medium to long-term would be exacerbated.</P>
    <P>Some critics of the budget have suggested that any cuts in public expenditure are damaging to the economy.  There are positive benefits to be gained from curbing public expenditure not only in so far as it affects interest rates and investment decisions but also in so far as it affects resource allocations within the economy. Greater efficiency in the use of our scarce resources, accompanied by sectoral policies which are directed towards enhancing the competitiveness of the economy can and will have a much more positive effect on our economic development.  As far as I recall Deputy Yates made the same point when he was speaking.</P>
    <P>Government expenditure policies and regulatory programmes will in future have as a prime focus the development of the various sectors of the economy. The policies and programmes will need to be shaped in ways which will contribute to economic growth, wealth and employment creation, and a general improvement in overall national welfare.  One without the other is of no interest to me or to any thinking person charged with responsibility for dealing with the serious economic problems that prevail in the country at present.  It is difficult to get the balance right as between our public expenditure policies and our sectoral development policies, but we are confident we can do so.  In this regard we are determined to ensure that our scarce <Col N="2045" /> resources are used to achieve the objectives I have just outlined.  I should emphasise in this regard that whether these resources should be in public or private ownership is a matter for pragmatic rather than ideological decision.  That point has been made often enough in this House by me and by other members of my party.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the most critical prerequisite for developing successful enterprises is the creation of a positive business environment that encourages efficiency and increased competition in productive activities.  This requires a shift in the role of Government from any tendency to over intervention in day-to-day activities of enterprises to one of removing impediments to sectoral development.  Accordingly, the Government will be concentrating their main effort on areas of the economy with particular development potential &mdash; I say this in the context of the contributions of Deputy Yates and Deputy O'Malley &mdash; within a framework of consistent fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies that will create an economic and business climate conducive to confidence and enterprise.</P>
    <P>That leads me to discuss my own area of responsibility, namely tourism and transport where, I can assure this House, the resources allocated to my Department will be used in a way which will enhance the growth potential of the economy. Deputies will be aware that the new Department of Tourism and Transport combine the tourism functions of the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry with the transport functions of the former Department of Communications.  There has been some confusion in the minds of the public in that regard and I am glad to have the opportunity to clear it up.  I understand somebody quoted the Minister for Energy and Communications as substituting for me in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that this new title. Minister for Communications?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we hope it is now clarified for the public in general and for the Members of this House.  The rationale behind this amalgamation of functions is the Government's firm belief that an efficient and user oriented transport sector is essential for the development of a dynamic tourism industry.  Competitive access transport costs are of critical importance in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Government's identification of the tourism sector as one which can make a significant contribution to the growth and development of our economy is based on the tremendous potential for this industry as evidenced by its growth in the past and forecasts for the future.  Experts currently project a doubling in the world tourism market by the year 2000.  It can be seen from these statistics that there is tremendous potential for growth.  These experts are also of the view that, at least until the end of the century, Europe will remain the greatest single focal point of world travel.</P>
      <P>Tourism is by far the most important export service in the Irish economy.  In 1986, foreign tourism revenue, including carrier receipts, was an estimated £680 million, while domestic tourism earnings were approximately £127 million.  That was not a good year but 1985 was an exceptionally good year particularly for the American market.  The main reason was that the dollar was exceptionally strong and visitors from the United States of America got exceptionally good value for their money in that year.  Direct employment in the industry is estimated to be of the order of 40,000 while total employment benefits are probably closer to 80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our first priority must be to regain ground lost over the past few years relative to our main competitors in the tourist industry internationally.  For example, in the years 1980 to 1984, tourism receipts for European countries of the Organisation <Col N="2047" /> for Economic Co-operation and Development grew by 21 per cent in real terms.  Irish tourism receipts, during the same period, showed a decline of 5 per cent in real terms.  That is pretty horrific. A comparison of relative performances in different markets is quite interesting.</P>
    <P>Air passenger traffic from the UK to the EC, excluding Ireland, grew by over 46 per cent in the years 1980 to 1985, inclusive.  During this period there was a decline of the order of 9 per cent in the number of cross-channel air passengers to Ireland.  Similarly, our performance in attracting visitors from North America has been equally disappointing.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, within the context of the Government's overall budgetary objectives, considerable progress can be made in revitalising the tourism industry through properly directed sectoral policies. As Minister responsible for the sector, my basic mission will be to provide a regulatory framework within which the tourism industry can grow and develop. This framework will comprise the objectives of achieving significant increases in tourist traffic and earnings through improving the tourist product, its marketing, and I stress marketing, and the cost competitiveness of the industry.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure a coherent approach to the development of the industry my immediate priority is to draw up a coherent development plan with which all operators in the industry can identify. It will focus on the following areas: (1) creating an efficient administrative structure to maximise the effectiveness of public and private contributions to tourism developments; (2) identifying the markets, and the segments within those markets, which show the greatest potential demand for the type of tourism product which can be offered in this country over the next decade; (3) developing and up-grading these products to meet market requirements; (4) determining the most effective promotional stance for Irish tourism in these markets and redeploying marketing resources accordingly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> I wish to refer to the mission to Washington in the St. Patrick's Day period. Publicity for our tourist industry by such exercises as the Taoiseach took part in at that time could not be purchased by our budget.  It is important for the House to realise that and to realise that everyone who visits a country such as the United States from which we hope to attract more tourists has a potential to be an advertiser for our tourist industry and has an opportunity to invite individuals to visit this country.</P>
    <P>I will be implementing targeted policies aimed at developing and enhancing the tourism strengths and attractions of our country, in addition to policies directed at forcefully and effectively marketing these attractions.  I am calling on every citizen to aid in that effort.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the need to protect and enhance Ireland's natural and built environment which are essentially our key strengths.  Such concern is especially appropriate in this year which has been designated European Year of the Environment.  There is a crucial role here for the range of public agencies whose activities affect the tourism industry.  I am thinking specifically of key Government Departments such as my own, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works; State agencies, such as Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and SFADCo and local authorities who have critical statutory responsibilities and powers in the area of physical planning and environmental protection.  I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food has already made an input into that area with a view to celebrating the European Year of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Long before the general level of consciousness with regard to the environment had been raised, Bord Fáilte did a great deal sponsoring the Tidy Towns Competition which has impacted very favourably on the towns and villages in Ireland, and I hope that competition continues to do so.  The people who wantonly or carelessly pollute what are strong attractions in our natural environment can expect that my Department will <Col N="2049" /> pursue them, irrespective of special interests or special pleading.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for the tourism sector, my task will be to ensure that a greater priority is given to the protection and enhancement of Ireland's invaluable scenic and natural amenities as well as our wealth of archaeological, architectural, literary and historical heritage. From a tourism point of view, we have not even begun to exploit the potential which exists under each of those headings. The Yeats Summer School has been going for years but it was never thought of as a tourist aid or as being connected with tourism.  Yet, this has been a very successful school and has attracted visitors from all over the world.  The same opportunities exist for many other towns, such as Sligo, which have strong literary connections with various authors and artists who have achieved international celebrity status.  I am suggesting that the people in those communities could exploit their opportunities in that regard. These are our basic tourism strengths and I am convinced that by implementing strong policies in these areas, we will tap the latent potential for growth in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>This will mean far greater co-ordination of the activities of all State agencies whose operations affect the tourism sector than has previously been the case. We need to ensure a consistency of policies aimed at the objectives outlined above.  A single Department of Tourism and Transport is a significant move towards this co-ordination, and further policy co-ordination structures will be put in place.  In this context I have asked my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, to examine immediately existing co-ordination mechanisms like the InterDepartmental Policy Co-Ordination Committee on Tourism and the Publicity Promotion Co-Ordination Committee to see in what way their potential can be fully realised.</P>
    <P>To complement this policy emphasis we need to market and promote this country's strengths more effectively.  I will be initiating discussions with Bord Fáilte <Col N="2050" /> with a view to ensuring that their organisational structures reflect the new emphasis on product development and on concentrating promotional resources on specific, targeted markets.  At regional level, I will be placing particular emphasis on the crucial role to be played by the regional tourism organisations in developing tourism products and encouraging local involvement in this process.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that there is an urgent need to reappraise our promotional and marketing approach.  We must respond to the needs of today's tourists. In our pre-election document we gave a commitment to determine the most effective marketing position for Ireland in the world of tourism and to implement a more aggressive and forceful promotional effort in our main markets. There is now sufficient evidence, both from the recent study sponsored by the Irish Hotels' Federation and the consultancy currently being carried out for my Department on the effectiveness of State spending on tourism, to feel confident that these markets will continue to be the United Kingdom, the United States of America and mainland Europe, especially France and West Germany. However, there is also evidence emerging of a need to take a more targeted approach in the marketing of Ireland and to expand beyond the generalist tourist market on which we have been concentrating to date.</P>
    <P>The add-on tourists from Japan should merit careful consideration, particularly as they are coming in increasing numbers to Europe.  If we could add on to their London, Paris or Rome runs, we would be gaining a great deal.  We should also counter-attack in up-market areas &mdash; Spain, Italy and Greece &mdash; where our citizens spend a good deal of tourist money at the moment.</P>
    <P>The modern tourist is much more activity conscious than in the past.  If we are going to get a significant share of this growing segment of the market, it is imperative that we now identify the activities we in Ireland can offer as an enjoyable and satisfying basis for holidays.</P>

      <P>How long have I, because I have lost a good deal of time?</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have already proven that there is an appreciable market for golfing and angling holidays in Ireland.  Latest research available to my Department shows that there are other markets for special interest products, such as health tourism, special agricultural tourism, educational tourism &mdash; local groups should study the potential of filling schools, particularly boarding schools, which are empty during the summer by providing recreational and educational courses &mdash; cultural, scientific and sporting tourism to which we in Ireland have not yet given any real consideration.  Of course, the rugby internationals and the all-Ireland finals bring in many tourists, particularly from the United States but we have not done it scientifically and exhaustively.  There is great potential in those areas to attract visitors to this country. These specialist products present new opportunities for expansion to the Irish tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we also need to maintain our position in the traditional generalist tourist markets.  I will be asking Bord Fáilte to explore ways in which we can increase our share of multi-destination <Col N="2053" /> tourists to Europe from markets like the United States, Japan and Australia.  I have mentioned already that the add-on from major centres in Europe could be quite significant and could impact quite strongly on our industry.  If we are to expand the industry and significantly increase market share then we must look to the growing specialist segment of our main markets.  One thing we should shut up about is our weather because our weather is no better or worse than it is in many areas which never mention weather in the context of tourism.</P>
    <P>We must consider the matter of investment in the upgrading and expansion of our tourism amenities and infrastructure which is of paramount importance in our efforts to attract increased numbers. While Bord Fáilte's capital budget is down on last year's level, I am confident that the board's accommodation and amenity development grant schemes will continue to stimulate the industry's efforts to improve quality in these areas and to bring on stream new and worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>However, if we are to realise the full potential of Irish tourism it is not good enough to continue to rely on traditional segments of the market.  As I have already said, to grow, the industry needs to expand into specialist markets and to package and organise the products which these markets require.  I will be asking Bord Fáilte to deploy their resources in order to reflect the priority which must be given to the development of a new and more extensive range of products.</P>
    <P>Although Bord Fáilte will have a key role in stimulating and co-ordinating development activity, a more active involvement from a number of interest groups at local level is also required.  That is what I have been harping on in any <i>obiter dicta</i> I have made since the debate started.  Bord Fáilte can provide valuable leadership, advice and expertise. However, the success of this new shift in strategy will depend on the response and support of all those involved directly in the industry, as well as those indirectly involved, who benefit from tourism spend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> In this context, I envisage the main tasks of the regional tourism organisations in the plan for product development to be threefold: (1) to elicit the support and co-ordination to the industry at local level, including the encouragement of appropriate investment; (2) to assess the resources and potential within their respective regions for developing products for which Bord Fáilte have identified market demand; and (3) to stimulate local clubs and specialist associations to contribute to the process and provision of specialist products. These groups are, in many cases, in a unique position to assist in the co-ordination of specialist activities.  They have local knowledge of the scope for particular activities and contacts with their foreign counterparts, especially in our main markets.  Local initiative and enterprise will be a critical element in the strategy to put growth back into the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>As a major new incentive towards stimulating increased private investment in the tourism product, the Government have, as promised in their pre-election manifesto, decided to extend the business expansion scheme to strictly defined export tourism activities.  I referred to this at the start of my speech when I commented on Deputy O'Malley's statement that we did not have developmental policies as promised.  The precise details of the scheme are still being worked out but it is our intention to ensure that investment is channelled into those facilities and amenities already indicated which will yield the greatest return in tourist numbers and revenue, thus generating additional employment in the tourist sector.  I also want to inform the House of additional funds which should become available for tourism development in the Border counties and in County Sligo.  The Board of the International Fund for Ireland have given a clear indication that they will provide support for suitable tourism related projects. Through the consultative mechanisms provided for in the operation of the fund, my Department have advised <Col N="2055" /> the board of the fund of suitable tourism development schemes which could be adopted, reflecting the emphasis on product development.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is also the likelihood of funding for tourism being available from the last stage of the European Regional Development Fund Special Border Areas Programme for tourism and crafts, with the emphasis on the first first five years plan from that fund.  I am examining the position, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, so as to maximise our take from the fund without putting any extra burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am confident, however, that money from these funds will be available for tourism projects.  The emphasis in my Department, in so far as they can influence our advice in relation to these funds, will be on revenue generating projects which make a positive net value added contribution to the economy and have significant potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>In line with increased development of new specialist tourism products, there will have to be a redeployment of resources for the marketing of special interest holidays.  I am confident that increased resources targeted at particular, well defined, special interest groups will prove cost effective in boosting the numbers of such holidaymakers to Ireland.  I am sure that if the ingenuity of various groups was properly exercised in this regard it would have a significant impact on the numbers coming to this country.  In my own country there is the attraction of Henry James, a cult figure in the United States in literary circles, whose family came from Bailieborough. I could multiply that example all over the country, each county has its famous people to boast about.  People are interested in every detail of the lives of cult figures and this could be exploited.  Anywhere that Mark Twain sat down to smoke a pipe in the United States is commemorated and the Americans are very anxious to point it out to you.  We have an embarrassment of riches in this regard waiting to be exploited.  Special interest <Col N="2056" /> groups will also be instrumental in encouraging Irish people to holiday at home rather than going abroad for these activities.</P>
    <P>I will be asking Bord Fáilte to look at the potential for selected marketing activities, such as direct mail marketing and certain co-operative efforts, to which it would be in the interest of those engaged in the industry to contribute. The recently introduced Bord Fáilte hotel brand marketing scheme is the kind of development I will be encouraging in future.  There is no doubt that the industry will have to come closer to the marketplace, to heighten sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of modern tourists.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that our appeal needs to be further extended in high income groups, especially in the non-ethnic sectors of the UK and American markets. We spend a great deal of money in Spain so we should make an effort to get Spanish tourists to come here.  The same applies to Greece and other areas in which Irish people spend their holidays.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism activity from abroad, I should like to mention the activities of CIE Tours International Incorporated, which were specifically set up to attract foreign tourists to Ireland. This company specialise in package holidays and play a vital role overseas in marketing Ireland as a tourist destination. They also act as agents for CIE in promoting and selling contracts for rail, sea and air tours in Ireland.  The company's activities involve the operation of 35 luxury touring coaches and the generation of business for car hire from Shannon, for river cruises, and for self-catering and farmhouse holidays.</P>
    <P>Over one million brochures are distributed annually by CIE Tours in the USA, Britain, West Germany, France, Australia and New Zealand.  Despite their best efforts in 1986, the company did not achieve their targets but, as we all know, the tourist industry throughout Europe last year had to cope with problems beyond their control, including the fact that a very powerful personage advised Americans not to holiday in <Col N="2057" /> Europe.  It is only fair to give credit to CIE Tours for the very special efforts they made last year.  The company hope that 1987 will be much more satisfactory and rewarding.  I was in Killarney recently, no small town as far as tourism is concerned, and hoteliers complimented the new approach by Iarnród Éireann to the internal tourist industry. They are ready and anxious to co-operate with hoteliers in promotion projects and have done so already.  I comment on that because, for some reason, the hoteliers were surprised at the open, helpful and co-operative spirit they found in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>Because of the severe financial constraints, of which by now the House is fully aware, Bord Fáilte, in common with a number of State agencies, have had their operating budget reduced for 1987. This reduction, devised by the previous Government and reluctantly confirmed by this one, cannot be construed as implying any lack of commitment by the Government to the development of tourism. One thing which was very perturbing was that the Book of Estimates which was published in January of this year gave a tourism outturn for 1986 which covered only ten months of that year. The tourism brief changed from Deputy Bruton to Deputy Kavanagh after two months of the year, but the outturn figures were only given for two months. That was cut which made it even worse than it would normally have been.  This reduction, devised as I say but accepted, does not apply any lack of commitment. I hope I have indicated this to the House in clear terms.  Within the broad outline of the development plan for tourism which I have outlined today, I am confident that Bord Fáilte will be able to absorb the reduction and yet enhance the effectiveness of their promotion, both in the domestic and foreign markets.  Without exceeding the total net allocations for my Department, I shall be searching for any penny which can be used for tourism promotion and development.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is our aim to ensure that there is an effective and co-ordinated approach to promotional spending by all <Col N="2058" /> State agencies involved in encouraging traffic to Ireland so as to avoid any wasteful duplication of public funds.  As the House will be aware, the previous Government commissioned Craig Gardner-Price Waterhouse, the international consultants, to examine the effectiveness of all directly tourism-related expenditure. This consultancy is still working. The consultants' general brief is to examine how best public money should be devoted to the promotion of increased tourism to Ireland.  Their terms of reference were drafted as widely as possible to encapsulate all areas of State expenditure impinging on tourism.  Their findings and recommendations will obviously have a contribution to make to the implementation of the development plan.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to commend to the House the extension of the business expansion scheme to export tourism.  I have referred to this twice.  Full details of this scheme will be published in the Finance Bill.  However, the announcement of this scheme and the Government's determination to keep down inflation and interest rates will create the right climate for investment by the industry in the type of products which I am satisfied will bring increased numbers of tourists to our country.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to consider the transport dimension of my responsibilities.  I would like to assure the House that I will be making every effort to ensure that the regulatory framework for transport will be compatible with the national objective of improving the competitiveness of the economy as a whole.  That framework will be directed at developing reliable, speedy and economic access to our export markets &mdash; as you know tourism is our strongest invisible export &mdash; as well as inward access to the country for goods and tourists.</P>
    <P>The essential elements of sectoral policies for transport will be developed in a plan for the sector which I have asked my Department to prepare as a matter of urgency.  I am determined to have a consistent framework for the management and development of the transport sector <Col N="2059" /> to ensure that our transport resources fulfil a constructive and efficient role in Ireland's economic development.  Within this sectoral framework I am also determined to ensure that the transport State bodies for which I have direct responsibility will be efficient and profitable.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I would like to refer to some specific aspects of the two access transport modes &mdash; air and sea transport. In doing so, I cannot emphasis strongly enough this Government's commitment to improving access transport to Ireland and to securing more competitive access transport costs.</P>
    <P>As regard the air transport sector, the pace of change has been quite remarkable in recent years.  Notwithstanding the challenges and uncertainties that are emerging from recent developments, I welcome the prospect of greater competition in international aviation as a healthy development.  For too long there have been excessive controls and rigidities in this market &mdash; and I am not talking merely in a national context.  We must break away from the traditional mould of regulation and create a more competitive air transport system and establish new links where such are required.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that I will be continuing with the work undertaken in recent years to see new opportunities created for Irish carriers, the results of which give cause for great optimism.  The most significant development in Irish aviation in recent years has been on the Dublin-London routes where record levels in passenger numbers have been recorded. The new low fares policy has been of benefit to all the carriers alike.  The inauguration of new services out of Ireland from Connaught Airport has also proved quite a success.</P>
    <P>My Department have been assessing the impact on our economy of the results on the Dublin-London route.  While a certain number of judgmental assumptions have had to be made, the preliminary results indicate that there was little if any positive impact on the economy in 1986 arising from these changes. This essentially occurred because the new <Col N="2060" /> low fares initially stimulated a greater growth in out bound traffic.  As the initiatives so far were dictated from the Irish side the results were of immediate impact in the Irish originating market.</P>
    <P>However, there are new marketing initiatives now being undertaken by the carriers to maximise low fares for the inbound tourist and business traveller.  We should reap the benefits of these initiatives in the current tourist season.  My overall assessment of developments on this front is that in the long term greater competition in international aviation will enhance our prospects for tourism growth.</P>
    <P>I would also at this stage like to compliment the B &amp; I on the very imaginative package which they have devised for developing inward traffic from the UK market.  I will be present in London tomorrow evening at their launch of this initiative.</P>
    <P>While favourable conditions for generating extra tourism traffic are now present in the UK market, I am less than happy with the position in respect of continental Europe.  The scope for tourism generation from the Continent to Ireland is extensive but development of this market is being impeded by a number of factors and, in particular, by the cost of access transport.  Ireland's proportion of the French and German tourism markets is of the order of 1 per cent only.  Clearly the whole tourism sector with its downstream activities would get a significant boost if a greater volume of European traffic came here.</P>
    <P>I know my predecessor had a number of concerns in this front for some time and he intervened on a number of occasions to refuse promotional air fare increases from the French and Italian markets in particular.  It is clear, however, that the absolute level of existing promotional air fares remains to high.  In recent days I have asked the chairman of Aer Lingus to tell me what action they propose to take to help to create more competitive fares into Ireland.  In many cases the level of <Col N="2061" /> incoming fares is not in any way competitive with similar type fares over similar distances to markets such as England and Scotland.  I will also be looking to Aer Lingus to make a positive and effective contribution to meeting the Government's goals for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a review within my Department of our charter policy on the Continent to Ireland.  At the moment there are few inbound charter programmes &mdash; and I referred earlier to a counter attack in a different way &mdash; and these are primarily on routes on which little or no scheduled services operate.</P>
    <P>This is against the general European trend where charter traffic is the main means of transport for tourists.  More substantial charter programmes would not only lower the cost of travel to Ireland but within themselves provide a competitive stimulus to existing scheduled service operations.  The review of policy which I have ordered will seek in particular to identify ways and means of facilitating from a regulatory perspective the development of more extensive charter programmes to Ireland.  I should add that as part of that review my Department will be consulting with Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and private carriers.</P>
    <P>Aside from these domestic initiatives, I am happy to say that Ireland has been to the forefront in seeking a more competitive air transport system within the EC and I should like to use this occasion to advise the House of the present state of plans in this area.  At the latest EC Transport Council on 23 and 24 March last, I made it clear that it was a stated policy priority of the new Irish Government to generate additional tourist traffic to Ireland and that one of the ways in which this could be achieved is through the adoption of measures to liberalise air transport in a Community context.</P>
    <P>At the council, I referred specifically to two priority areas.  The first of these was fares, and I am happy to report that the council made substantial progress in agreeing more flexible arrangements in this area.  I also made it clear that liberalisation in the area of market access was of critical importance to Ireland. <Col N="2062" /> Potential growth in all sectors of the economy &mdash; from industry through trade to tourism &mdash; is directly related to the perceived proximity of Ireland to the heartland of the Community.  This can be achieved through an expansion of the network of air links to and from Ireland and through creating the opportunities for a profitable expansion of air services.</P>
    <P>I emphasised at the council that any package of air transport measures designed to promote additional competition in intra-Community air services would have to make some provision for fifth freedom rights in the market access area.  I cannot over emphasise this.  Over the coming months, I will be seeking measures of liberalisation, which will not only promote competition on routes to and from Ireland, but will also provide commercial opportunities for the development of additional routes.  I will accordingly be launching a diplomatic offensive in Community capitals so as to secure support for a substantial air transport package.  In the light of ongoing Commission pressure, the Council of Transport Ministers is likely to agree the first stage of a common air transport policy for the Community by 30 June next, when the Belgian Presidency ends.</P>
    <P>This process will culminate in the completion of the internal market within the Community by 1992, which is the <i>terminus ad quem.</i> Clearly, in the coming years the structure of the existing air transport system in Europe, as we know it, will undergo significant change and I am hoping that Ireland, as a peripheral member state, will be able to benefit from greater competition in the air transport area.  I intend to keep the House advised from time to time of progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to recent developments in the B &amp; I.  This company now faces major difficulties.  Their restructuring, which was approved by the previous Government in February 1986, and which was designed to restore the company to profitability in 1987, has failed in that objective.  Significant losses are projected for 1987 and subsequent years and it is clear that drastic action <Col N="2063" /> will be required if the company are to secure their future.  It is also clear to me that solutions to the company's difficulties will have to be generated within the company.  Exchequer consideration alone allow for no other solution.  The B &amp; I board submitted further major restructuring proposals to my predecessor in late December 1986.  Within the past few days, the board have revised their proposals to take account of the effects of the recent strikes and other developments.  I will be bringing all options for the company's future before Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would emphasise that the resumption of Ireland's economic growth depends critically on achieving increased efficiency from existing resources and future investment, through greater emphasis on market mechanisms and competitive forces.  Resources available to the Government are likely to be limited for the next few years and they will be looking more to the private sector to provide initiative and drive to develop our economy and its constituent sectors. We have started and will continue to provide the environment and the incentives for it to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The single most important achievement of this budget is that it has at long last brought about in this House, and hopefully throughout the country, the realisation and the now almost universal political consensus that our economy is in fact going through a grave crisis.  One would have thought, from examining the party manifestoes, <Col N="2064" /> particularly those of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, before the recent general election that that consensus would not have been possible.  It has been a very hard won consensus.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and, collectively, the Cabinet seem to accept that the scale of our national debt thereatens our economic survival as a country, and that that in turn threatens our democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt that the sheer effort in servicing the debt is almost destroying our capacity to provide a rational and good Government in this country.  The significance of the appointment in the past week of the former Secretary of the Department of Defence to be Secretary of the Department of Finance and thus in charge of the management of our national debt has been overlooked.  I wish Mr. Somers well in his new role, in what one might refer to as his return to the Department of Finance, in that critical and very onerous job of managing the national debt of £24.5 billion which has arisen from various Government contributions during the past two decades, since 1973 to be exact.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the conversion of Fianna Fáil is of historic importance.  Unless one goes back to the almost non-comparative period of the early fifties I do not recall a Fianna Fáil Party who have had to go back to their grass roots to explain economic reality to their own cumann, to their own Dáil ceantar and to their own supporters.  Particularly since 1975, for 12 years now, that party have sustained themselves on a false diet that if they were there, everything would be all right and there would be no problems in terms of the political promises outlined in their manifestoes.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that there has not been a whimper or a whim of a reference on the part of Fianna Fáil in relation to the budget, to the manifesto and particularly to the programme for national recovery which was entitled &ldquo;There is a Better Way&rdquo;.  Indeed, there is a far better way but it is not that way.  That programme is now redundant, thank God, but it is important to refer to it very briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> The Fianna Fáil Party went through the country in a very lacklustre way in a major effort to convince the electorate that two-thirds of taxpayers would pay at no more than the standard rate.  That should be remembered.  It is not happening this year nor is it likely to happen next year.  It will be a very long time before two-thirds of the taxpayers are paying at no more than the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Equally, there was the assurance of selective tax reductions which would create economic activity and which would be largely self financing.  That false promise has also been discarded.  I am glad that it has been discarded and I commend Fianna Fáil for this examination of conscience and the Cabinet for having decided that that was not on.  There were two other major promises in the document which went into every home.  One was the promise to modify DIRT in order to remove inequities for those not liable. That idea has been discarded.</P>
    <P>Finally, they wanted to bring back some of the £1.5 billion they say left the country last year but that promise has been discarded because the Taoiseach yesterday confessed, rather abjectly, that he did not know where the £1.5 billion was.  He told us that an examination was being carried out in the Department of Finance to find the black hole through which the £1.5 billion has disappeared. Needless to say that was a piece of political imagery because of the policies followed by the National Coalition of which I was a member.  That piece of false imagery is now proving to have been a mirage.  That £1.5 billion is largely the monetary transactions of multinational companies who engage in their trade in foreign currencies.  They transfer their currencies using the transfer pricing mechanism on import invoices and export credits, something we all keep very quite about.  That has a profound effect on added value and money passing through the banking system.  A large part of that figure can be directly attributed to our trade mechanisms.  Admittedly there is some hot money around but I do not think it amounts to any more than a couple of hundred million pounds at any <Col N="2066" /> one time.  That figure is a far cry from the great prospect held out by the Fianna Fáil Leader that if he was in office by sheer political charisma he would get the money back into the country.  That imagery, that very attractive mirage has moved into the desert and as the Cabinet go through the hot desert the mirage moves further away.</P>
    <P>We should be thankful that that mirage has gone because the House can settle down to dealing with the position as it is.  At cumann and after-Mass meetings when sobriety hits the members before they change to stronger brew political reality will now return.  We should be grateful that the PDs have discarded their promise to cut income tax on a phased basis over five years to 25 per cent.  That rabbit with three legs and no tail ran around the constituencies, particularly in the yuppie belt areas where people have heavy mortgages and young families, during the election campaign.  The PD vibrancy, with their Alf Garnett type of reaction to social welfare, managed to garner together 14 or 15 per cent of the vote on the basis of that political mirage which, thankfully, has now been discarded. I received election literature from that excellent Deputy, Deputy Anne Colley, who represents the constituency where I live, and the first promise in it was a reduction in the basic tax rate to 25 per cent over five years.  That has gone out the door.  They promised the abolition of PRSI, health contributions and the youth levy for employees but that has gone for a Burton also.  Why? It has gone because the analysis by the PDs has not held water.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the authors of the most recent book on politics that when in Government we did not play cards.  We had a lot of hard work to do up to 20 January.  Those outside the Cabinet room may have been playing cards but I can assure everybody that those inside had a lot of hard work to do. On 3 November we spent a long time considering the public expenditure, reduction proposals put forward by the PDs because we felt it would be a valuable <Col N="2067" /> exercise by the Government.  We wanted to clear our minds of that type of nonsense.  The PD proposals in three areas were wrong by £551 million.  They could not analyse the position in regard to public service pay or take into consideration the fact that public service pay would increase by about £200 million in 1987.  They were not able to take into consideration the fact that there would be a carry-over into 1987 of £100 million extra for social welfare arising out of the increase in rates in 1986.  The PDs failed to appreciate that the Central Fund requirement increased because of the cost of servicing the additional debt incurred in 1986 and that that would amount to no less than £125 million for 1986-87.  They are fairly hefty sums of money but they were ignored by the PDs because they felt they had to show that they had sufficient money, about £800 million or £900, to commence the reduction in income tax.  Thankfully, Deputy O'Malley who is a realist at heart despite his tax populism and suggestions of irrelevant expenditure reductions, has come in from the cold into the hot kitchen of reality.  He knows he can no longer get away with codding the electorate in that way in the hope of gaining a few cheap votes but at the expense of other parties and more reputable candidates.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we have discarded all the talk about privatisation.  Thankfully in Private Members' time, Members are limited in the number of times they can raise a particular issue and because of that we will not hear anything more about privatisation for six months. Deputy O'Malley assured us that if we sold off the forests of the nation £23 million would be available from pension funds.  However, at the end of an intensive examination by the previous Government, confirmed by the present Government, a figure of about £3 million from leasing, sales and so on has emerged. The Progressive Democrats suggested the deregulation of all social welfare schemes.  For example, they proposed that we should cut training courses in AnCO and YEA and that we should <Col N="2068" /> merge the AnCO-YEA structures.  They proposed that we should reduce the input to training courses by CERT and abolish the employment incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats wanted to cut the social employment scheme not from £70 to £60 but by 30 per cent.  They said we would save no less than £47.425 million &mdash; massive savings which could be given back to the people through reduced taxation.  That is the great cry of the Progressive Democrats.  At the other end of the scale the people cry: &ldquo;For God's sake give us back our money; we will decide what we will do with it&rdquo;.  Needless to say that fails to take into account the social upheaval which would be caused in the social services and the economy &ldquo;Give us back our money&rdquo; is the cry of society.  It is becoming more sectional, more vicious and preoccupied with self. Everything is assessed by a what is in it for me attitude.  When talking to journalists what you can see clicking like a cash register is how this will affect me.  If it affects him badly the budget will be a bad one.</P>
    <P>No-one is immune from this preoccupation with self.  There is less regard now in society for those who have no jobs, those who mentally handicapped or physically handicapped.  One in every ten people will suffer mental breakdown or mental depression.  They are the weak and disregarded.  The attitude now is, if you can get away with it without paying for it, fine and to hell with everybody else.  That Alf Garnett political philosophy must be overcome.  We must fight it.  We must be a responsible democracy prepared to spend a lot of money on education and a great deal of resources in providing health and social welfare services and support services in order to be a civilised society.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have examined their consciences and are now, so to speak, back on the rails to a certain extent.  Last night that party were reduced to requesting privatisation of the cleaning services.  They wanted to bring a private cleaning service, for example, into the Department of the Taoiseach <Col N="2069" /> and declare the cleaners there redundant. If we did so, hey presto, we would be implementing the policies of the Progressive Democrats.  There would be a rising tide of entrepreneurs and every one would thank Deputy O'Malley.  They want us to rent more office accommodation from all those wonderful entrepreneurs who have a glut of empty offices &mdash; at knock down prices presumably. There is no need for such a policy.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy MacSharry succumbed to temptation and announced obliquely over the weekend that he is thinking of transferring some civil servants to Sligo.  That came as a shock to the Civil Service and to the people of Sligo.  It is a total nonsense because if £500,000 was spent on Fax machines and computers there would be no need to transfer any civil servants.  However, this country is so preoccupied with political provincialism that civil servants must be transferred depending on the change of Government, from Dublin to Sligo, Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Cavan, Dublin to Castlebar or Dublin to Athlone.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is a false political promise and totally unreal.  As Minister for Social Welfare I had many costings carried out and it was estimated that the minimum expenditure in that area would be from £35 million to £45 million.  It would be wasted expenditure.  There is no need to indulge in mythical decentralisation, apart from massaging the political provincialism with which our country has been sorely afflicted.  It is as if there cannot be a Cabinet unless every region has a Minister and every county has a Minister of State, that a county suffers a sense of monumental deprivation unless it has a ministerial car travelling around it.  It is political provincialism of a rather odious and unnecessary kind.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government are facing this crisis.  We must be thankful that their minority standing has forced them to adopt a more responsible approach to public expenditure.  That is to be welcomed. One aspect which infuriates me is the myths which are being developed by the right wing parties in relation to <Col N="2070" /> our social and economic problems.  We have denigrated the state of our economy to the extent that it is now affecting our interest rates, our creditworthiness and investment and business confidence.  The excessive gloom and doom generated throughout four years by Fianna Fáil aided and abetted by the Progressive Democrats, did much to depress business confidence here.  We have a major public expenditure crisis but not necessarily an economic crisis.  The constant denigration of our affairs has helped to keep interest rates high and encouraged some growth in the black economy.  One effect of the exaggeration of the problems in our economy has been that the foreign media have taken up the line put forward by so many politicians and political commentators. Having sold ourselves short we whinge when the foreign media take up our attitude and report it.  Our economy by and large still has some major strengths.  We have succeeded in reducing inflation to a considerable extent. Inflation is now running at 3½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a tremendous reduction in inflation over the past five years.  We must recall that five or six years ago we had grave doubts about our capacity to sustain any kind of economic development because of our inflation rate of 21 per cent.  This was during the period of the last Fianna Fáil administration.  We succeeded in reducing <Col N="2071" /> inflation.  It was not just a governmental effort.  A major effort was made by the country as a whole to reduce inflation to little more that 3½ per cent. We have become so used to low inflation that there is little interest or comment when prices are reduced or maintained at the same level.  Consumers at large would have had a better appreciation of this if the National Prices Commission had not been abolished.  I make no bones about the fact that I was opposed to the abolition of the NPC.  It was a very foolish decision by the Government to abolish the NPC.  In many areas, particularly in the retail and distributive trade areas, the lack of supervisory control by the NPC led to a higher level of inflation in retail prices than we need necessarily have had in the past two to three years.  I hope the role of the National Prices Commission will be revived by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the near future.</P>
      <P>The good balance between our exports and imports is another very satisfactory feature of our economy.  We should be very proud of our excellent balance of trade.  In 1986 we had the highest ever trade surplus of £757 million.  That was a singularly beneficial achievement by our economy.  This trend continued in the first two months of 1987 and our trade exports continued to exceed imports by a considerable amount.  In addition, in 1985 there was a trade surplus over the whole year.  Previous to this Ireland normally had a deficit of merchandise trade. This significant and real improvement in the economy received almost no recognition in the past 12 months.  I recall seeing many newspaper reports on massive trade surpluses in minor paragraphs on the inside pages.  A couple of weeks ago we had a major surplus again and for once it got a banner newspaper headline. The previous 13 consecutive trade surpluses were not reported.  I checked back through the papers and they were ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An excellent trade balance is of great economic strength to our country.  This should be recognised and should be used <Col N="2072" /> in presenting our economy to commentators at home and abroad.  Similarly, we have been lectured for months on the prospect of an IMF takeover of the economy.  That is not true and there is no such prospect of that happening.  It is extremely damaging to the economy to threaten that it might happen.  We have a high borrowing requirement on our central fund at present, but I do not think we should berate ourselves into alleging, quite wrongly, that we are a kind of Third World banana republic.  I use that pejorative term for want of a better way of expressing it.  We are not a Third World banana republic.  Our creditworthiness, as of this week, in the financial newspapers and in the financial markets stands among the top 25 nations of the world. We should be proud of that.  This is a great economic strength in our economy.</P>
    <P>We have been lectured also by some expatriate Irish people that we should follow the example of other economies such as the United States or the United Kingdom.  This example should not be held up to Irish people to that extent. The United States had a record balance of payments deficit for the last quarter of last year.  The US moved ahead of Brazil in the level of Government debt.  The level of Government debt in the United States was at $220 billion in 1986.  They are not in that great a shape.  Indeed, I would question those who berate us for not taking similar monetarist policy initiatives to those of the United States. Equally, the United Kingdom have swallowed up the major part of their North Sea oil revenues with virtually no long term economic benefit to the British economy.  The monetrist policies followed for the best part of half a decade have done great damage to the British economy.  We should not seek to emulate Britain, contrary to the advice we get from Irish persons living abroad.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the tax situation I want to refer to the Taoiseach's contribution yesterday in relation to the health services.  I am no longer the Labour Party spokesman on Health. Deputy Brendan Howlin is our spokes-person. There is one aspect of the <Col N="2073" /> Taoiseach's statement that I cannot let go unchallenged as it has been repeated in an effort, so to speak, to put a retrospective smear on some of the work I had done in Government.  As reported at column 866, Volume 371 of the Official Report of 31 March the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I would be very impressed by Deputy Desmond's remarks but for the fact that he allowed the health boards to go into debt by over £50 million last year.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach repeated the charge in the House that the health boards had been allowed to incur a £50 million overdraft to the end of 1986.  Secondly, and more inappropriately and in some respects libellously, a statement was made, I very much regret, by Mr. Gerald Barry, the political correspondent of <i>The Sunday Tribune </i> on 5 April.  He said:</P>
    <P>Ministers say the sums were very substantial &mdash; one indicated that it was in excess of £30 million &mdash; and the 1987 estimates contained no provision for paying the money back.  Current cabinet members also claim that this was done without any sanction being sought or given to Mr. Desmond by the Department of Finance, a procedure they describe as improper if not illegal.</P>
    <P>I take the greatest exception to that statement in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and to the fact that a reputable political correspondent should report a statement of that nature, because he knows from a cursory examination of the statutory position that that allegation simply is not true.  I am glad that a member of the health board is present.  I quote from section 33 of the Health Act, 1970:</P>
    <P>(1)A health board may borrow money subject to any conditions specified by the Minister and in accordance with any directions given by him.</P>
    <P>That is the section and the Minister is the Minister for Health.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>(2)Borrowing under this section may <Col N="2074" /> be effected in any manner which the health board consider suitable, including, in particular, by way of mortgage, drawing of bills of exchange, issue of stock or bonds, temporary loan or overdraft.</P>
    <P>(3)A loan under this section and the interest or dividends thereon may be secured on the revenues, funds or property of the health board.</P>
    <P>That is the relevant statutory provision. Furthermore, when a statement of that nature is made, which in the case of the Taoiseach's £50 million is entirely wrong and in the case of Mr. Barry's article is equally wrong, it is a reflection on the accounting officer of the Department of Health, the Secretary of the Department of Health.  It is a reflection of impropriety on the assistant secretary in charge of finance in the Department of Health.  As public servants the reputations of these people must be protected.  Under no circumstances were unauthorised overdrafts committed or given to the health boards by me or anybody else.  That kind of statement made to get out from under the current lack of resources in the Health Estimate for 1987 is totally improper and, if I may say so, libellous. it should be corrected.  That correction may well be made now.  I hope it will.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when allocations are made by the Department of Health to all the health boards there is a very clear indication given in relation to the question of borrowing.  I quote from section 17, the final paragraph, of the Letters of Allocation:</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Health Act, 1970, deals with the borrowing powers of health boards.  It is important to note that approval will not be given to increases in overdraft levels which reflect excessives on the approved allocation. When applications are being submitted for sanction to the incurring of overdraft it will be necessary to indicate the separate amounts required in overdraft accommodation related to revenue expenditure, capital services, supplementary welfare allowances and <Col N="2075" /> outstanding balances due to the board in respect of earlier years.</P>
    <P>That is a very clear directive given by the Department to the health boards and it adheres to the letter of the law.  It is not my fault that my predecessor, the late Deputy Erskine Childers, believed that members of health boards would behave as gentlemen.  There is no provision in this section requiring that the borrowings should also be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.  It is entirely the statutory authority of the Minister for Health, not the concurring authority of the Minister for Finance.  The Department of Finance may be upset about that.  They may feel that they would wish to have the Act amended.  If they do, that is their business. Meanwhile, it is quite wrong to suggest that the Minister for Health is acting improperly in any way in that regard.  I want to put that on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>On 4 December last when I spoke on the Health Estimate I said, and I quote from the Official Report, column 1576:</P>
    <P>Statements made regarding an impending cash crisis in the health services are totally unfounded and in fact as of last Thursday the combined overdrafts of all health boards was £12 million as compared with £24 million in the first week of January 1986.</P>
    <P>I made that statement when bringing in a Supplementary Estimate and to my knowledge the total combined overdraft sought by the health boards at the end of 1986 was about £20 million which was precisely in line with the amount of money sought on 1 January 1986, that was, £24 million.  Before that it was around £15 million.  Therefore, it is wrong to suggest that I had deliberately allowed overruns to occur, and the statement made by Deputy Haughey in relation to the £50 million is wholly incorrect.  I regret that this matter should have been raised in this manner by either current Cabinet Ministers or anybody advising them.</P>
    <P>Let me make one covering point on all of this.  While the health boards must, of <Col N="2076" /> course, get approval in relation to their overdraft accommodation &mdash; which they might not necessarily take up and that is quite a common occurrence particularly in the month of December &mdash; there is no difference in this regard between a health board and a local authority where a county council seek an overdraft.  This attempt at a smear on the work I have done is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Voluntary hospitals do not require the approval of the Department of Health, or anybody else, for that matter, to raise the overdraft because they are not part of the statutory control system in the Department of Health.  If, say, the Mater Hospital wants to raise in the month of December a £2 million overdraft, they go to the bank.  They do not come to the Department of Health.  If they come to the Department of Health in the month of January saying that they have raised £2 million and are now looking for the money the invariable reaction from the Department is, &ldquo;That is your problem. You get a budget and you are a public voluntary hospital.  You are not subject to statutory control.&rdquo;  When I suggested here that there was a great need to bring in a system of registration for such hospitals and to bring them closer to the public accountability area I was assailed by Fianna Fáil, by Deputy Haughey and by Deputy O'Hanlon who alleged that I was trying to destroy voluntary hospitals by trying to impose budgetary constraints on them.  We cannot have it one way and look to have it another way.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to a couple of other aspects in relation to the budget. One is the rather glossed over statement by the Minister that the proposal by the former Government to bring in a system of entitlement, under social welfare, to dental and optical benefits is to be implemented in October.  I have grave reservations about the prospects for the success of that scheme.  The scheme as proposed is enormously popular.  Spouses many of whom are women working at home, feel they should have an entitlement to an extension of social welfare treatment benefits on their husband's insurance.  There is a real problem here <Col N="2077" /> in that if national resources are available for any such scheme we have to examine the way in which the money should be spent.</P>
    <P>There is a crying need to spend more money on the dental and optical needs of children in national schools.  Currently they do not get a comprehensive benefit. They need treatment.  We have a large number of persons institutionalised throughout the country whose dental and optical care needs are not met.  We have many people who are physically and mentally handicapped who cannot get dental and optical care because the money is not provided in the budget.  We have a huge number of children between 12 and 16 years of age whose teeth and eyes need particular care but there is no money in the budget for that care either.  We have a large number of medical card holders on very low income who cannot get dental and optical care except by waiting for months on end perhaps six, 12 or 18 months before they can benefit.</P>
    <P>To propose a universal extension of the social welfare dental and optical benefit scheme while those critical needs are almost totally unmet is, in my view, to have our priorities turned backwards.  I have always had the view that if very little money is available for social programmes it should be spent in accordance with established necessary priorities.  While some people would benefit from the decision to extend treatment benefits &mdash; and the spouse can be male or female &mdash; a large number of citizens would not benefit from that decision, and they are in far greater need.</P>
    <P>Equally, in relation to social welfare there is no increase this year and this has passed almost unnoticed.  There has been very little about it.  There is no increase in child benefit rates this year.  Child benefit is frozen for 1987.  The sum of £15.05 for the first five children and the £21 for the sixth and subsequent child in frozen for 1986-87.  That is a retrograde step because that money goes overwhelmingly to women at home caring for children. Very often the child benefit is the only money they get.  I was very pleased to introduce that benefit and I regret that <Col N="2078" /> the £3½ million which should have been spent on child benefit this year has not been spent.</P>
    <P>On the question of taxation I deplore the Government's decision to abolish the farm assessment office.  That office had enormous potential.  It provided the first comprehensive updating of our greatest national asset, after our people, our land. We know that it is about 150 years since the last survey was carried out and the farm assessment office was updating this on a professional basis.  This is a scandal. I could take an excellent man in agriculture to the offices around the country to show him where we spent, £8,000 and £10,000 on mapping equipment all of which is now going to be thrown out. We have spent millions of pounds on computerisation, on professional mapping equipment, expensive equipment.</P>
    <P>Almost one third of the work has been done and it has shown up some amazing anomalies.  We even have greyhounds owning land.  We have relatives who are dead and buried who still own the land. This is of critical importance because the families concerned might not qualify for higher education grants, medical cards or non-contributory old age pensions.  It has thrown up some fascinating information. The farm assessment office is to be abandoned &mdash; the work of which could indeed be a very reliable gauge of entitlements to education, environment, health and social welfare benefits &mdash; because the Fianna Fáil Party have decided to revert to notional income assessment.</P>
    <P>It could provide, as well, a major benefit in relation to classifying individual farmers in areas under the disadvantaged areas scheme and we could have the complete picture, for the first time in the history of the State with the master maps available at county council level.  These master maps would give us a complete picture of the up-to-date occupancy of every acre of agricultural land.  That is one aspect of decentralisation which I would have supported.  That decision is a retrograde step and it will prove almost impossible to bring in an alternative system.  When the IFA get working on the alternative system now proposed, and <Col N="2079" /> by the time they are finished with the Fianna Fáil Party, there will not be a new system in operation.</P>
    <P>We still have a total imbalance between taxation and the allocation of resources.  I depart from the Government's strategy in this budget because the poor, the unemployed, the sick and the handicapped did not create the crisis in public expenditure.  They are affected by the budget and it must not be the policy of this Government, or any Government, that the disadvantaged in society should pay the price of economic recovery.  A policy which reduces unemployment benefit &mdash; now you need nine months stamps to qualify for unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit is cut by half &mdash; is a retrograde step.  There has been partial abolition of the disability benefit.  What happens to people who have eight months stamps if they are not eligible for benefit? Do they go to the health board and queue up for an interview on a means test basis for supplementary welfare which will be substantially below the level of flat rate benefit?  That claim will have to be examined and will not be paid in advance. They are the people who are hit in this budget.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the public ward charges and there is glorious confusion in that regard.  In respect of a 15 year old child a medical card holder will not have to pay the £10 charge, but a non medical card holder, £2.00 over the limit, will have to pay the £10 charge in respect of a seven week old child.  These anomalies, which are inevitable with such charges, are fundamentally regressive and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I hold the view that those who are not paying their fair share of taxation must be made to do so.  That includes a substantial number of the self-employed and I am not anti-self employed.  Anybody who opens up any kind of industry on his or her own and works at it personally deserves the highest of praise and maximum support. The anti self-employed feeling in the country is wrong.  However, there is a <Col N="2080" /> substantial number of self-employed who are evading and avoiding paying tax which should be paid.</P>
    <P>I must question the amount of money being paid in direct State support to the farming community.  It is wrong that we should be paying at the moment £25 million in children's allowances to the farming community with no question of tax because they are not liable in terms of the £100 tax allowance and they cannot have a contra-liability.  It is wrong we should pay £172 million in non-contributory old age pensions and non-contributory widows' pensions to people who made no contribution whatsoever during their lifetime, unlike any other insured worker who must pay 7½ per cent of his or her wages throughout his or her lifetime, with the employer having to pay 12½ per cent.  That requires fundamental revision.</P>
    <P>We give to the farming community also a £120 million grant and we finish up with an imbalance.  Heaven knows, the farming community have had three particularly bad years of weather recently, but we must get a fine summer some time.  We must, on the law of averages, get a fine summer this year and farm incomes will improve.  School transport for farmers' children is provided free.  I add the 100,000 medical cards in the agricultural community based on income assessment which it is almost impossible to check or to determine. Some counties have as many as 58 or 60 per cent of the total population on the medical card scheme.  These anomalies must be righted.  It is not so much that the country as a whole is grossly overtaxed, but rather that the entire burden of repairing the public finances is falling on the PAYE sector and on people of relatively low income.  The tax net must be reformed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have been given an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  There are many other reforms I should like to see brought in; for example, there is no reason employers should not pay the first eight or nine weeks of disability benefit. That would be of enormous help in terms of the structural change with regard to <Col N="2081" /> social welfare but we shall come to those matters another day.  The Labour Party will have many proposals to make in the years ahead.  We shall make them on an entirely constructive basis, it is hoped in accordance with the consensus of policy which may yet emerge in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>That we are going to have restrictions and cutbacks as a result of this budget I am sure but that we shall have a fine summer after this budget I am not so sure.  At any rate, I think there has been very broad acceptance of this budget and the general thrust of it not alone by people in this House but by the public generally.  It shows there is an awareness of the acute difficulties facing the country at present and, in particular, that the national finances must be got in order. We have for some considerable time being living beyond our means and many sectors of the community have suffered disproportionately because of the difficult financial situation into which we have run.  A fresh start has been made in this budget and we shall see a degree of optimism returning.  We can look positively to the future that an environment will be created in which the economy generally can progress.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to the agricultural industry, in 1987 we will have an improvement in the situation.  Over the past few years, due to weather difficulties and various changes, CAP incomes declined.  The Central Bank has forecast an increase in farm incomes of about 7 per cent this year.  While there is little prospect of an expansion in cattle and milk output, there should be an expansion in the sheep area and some recovery, I would hope, in the cereals area.  The prospect of more rapid growth in international trade should also benefit agricultural exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, over the past number of years a series of efforts has been made to reform the CAP.  In many ways the policy has been a victim of its own success; in particular, the productivity <Col N="2082" /> aspirations set out in the Treaty of Rome have been too well achieved under the CAP support mechanisms and, as everybody knows, surpluses exist in many traditional product areas.  This, coupled with budgetary pressures and weak market demand worldwide, has led to the Community adopting not alone a restrictive price policy but also measures to dilute the traditional support mechanisms on which our producers have tended to rely.  In addition, due to the shortage of funds, the Community has introduced rules aimed at keeping the growth in expenditure on agriculture within the limits of its own resources. Despite such decisions, the Common Agricultural Policy remains in some difficulties, with stocks in a number of areas exceptionally high, expenditure exceeding the budget discipline rules and production continuing to grow.  That is why the Commission price proposals for 1987-88 seek to continue the process of restricting prices and weakening intervention, including that for cereals.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of Irish policy towards reform of the CAP has been one of recognition that in order to ensure the long-term viability of the policy some changes in the market support systems are necessary.  However, it will continue to be absolutely necessary to convince the Commission and other member states of our particular vulnerability to cutbacks in the operation of the common agricultural policy market support mechanism. Again, as Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, has been meeting with his counterparts in the European capitals in order to make the Irish position clear to them.  He has been stressing the need to ensure that farm incomes in Ireland are fully protected, that any adjustment in the CAP avoid weakening our major agriculture and food sector and that full allowance is made for the adverse and disproportionate impact on Ireland of the measures already taken in regard to milk and beef.  The Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, is also stressing the necessity for adequate Community measures <Col N="2083" /> to improve agricultural structures and to encourage rural development generally, including the necessity for a satisfactory level for Community financing.</P>
    <P>This year's budget includes some £347 million gross, that is £190 million net, in the Vote for Agriculture.  On the face of it, this allocation seems a severe reduction on 1986, when the gross expenditure was £390 million, that is £262 million net.  However, the main factors giving rise to that reduction are the elimination of food subsidies, constituting a saving of £15 million, non-recurring expenditure of some £18 million on weather damage relief measures, lower market intervention costs of some £10 million and increased receipts of £30 million, including once-off additional receipts from the EC in respect of disadvantaged areas schemes and the farm modernisation scheme.  Taking these factors into account, the gap between 1987 voted expenditure on Agriculture and that in 1986 is much smaller.  Given the very difficult financial position and the general severity of the budget agriculture has fared reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Of course the amount in the Vote represents a portion only of the total amount spent on agriculture and food.  For 1986 the overall sum expended was £1,580 million, including £626 million of expenditure fully funded by the EC in respect of agricultural support measures and approximately £567 million borrowed by the Department for intervention purchases, mainly of beef and butter.</P>
    <P>I come now to disease eradication.  As Deputies will be aware, there has been much comment on our efforts, or perhaps on our lack of progress, in relation to disease eradication over the past 25 years.  All have agreed that we must make a new start and maintain a consistent effort over the next few years to put an end to the stop-go approach to the elimination of disease.  That is why the Government have allocated £30 million to disease eradication schemes in 1987, with £13.5 million being set aside for testing.  The objective is to put the TB eradication programme back on course <Col N="2084" /> and to maintain a constant effort in relation to the elimination of that disease over the next few years.  No time is being lost in setting up the arrangements for a new round of testing which will begin on 25 April.  Our programme will involve a comprehensive monitoring of herds in all counties and special testing programmes in badly affected areas.  While all counties will benefit, we will be paying particular attention to a number of areas, in particular, County Longford, which has the highest level of disease in Ireland and also west Cork which has many advantages, as Deputies will know, but which, in relation to TB is a black spot.  Therefore, we shall be paying particular attention to that area.</P>
    <P>As for brucellosis I am pleased to say that the number of infected herds is now below 50.  Experience in other countries confirms our view that it would be a grave mistake, and in the long-term costly to farmers, to relax our efforts in relation to brucellosis.  In 1987, we shall continue to monitor closely the national herd by blood testing and milk ring tests and to depopulate infected herds, where appropriate. Our aim is to bring about a further substantial reduction in disease levels by the end of the round.</P>
    <P>Turning now to payment of livestock grants, the position is that £63.6 million is provided to cover payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In addition to these headage payments, the Department of Agriculture and Food are also responsible for the payment of various premiums from EC funds which are outside the ambit of the Vote.  These include the existing suckler cow, calf and ewe premium schemes and the new special beef premium scheme which came into effect earlier this week.  It is estimated that the EC premium payments this year will amount to £112 million and that the total of headage and premium payments &mdash; combined for sheep and cattle &mdash; will amount to £175 million.  Some £65 million relates to sheep and the balance of £110 million to cattle.  By any standard these are very substantial sums.  The various schemes provide worthwhile incentives <Col N="2085" /> to farmers in all parts of the country to expand herd and flock numbers.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I should like to point out that the various headage and premium grants payable on suckler cows enable farmers in the more severely handicapped areas to receive approximately £133 for a beef cow and calf this year, those in the less-severely handicapped areas £114 and, elsewhere in the country £44.  I have to say it is disappointing to record that, despite the introduction of the £70 beef cow grant in disadvantaged areas last year, beef cow numbers did not increase.  The expansion of the suckler herd and the development of the beef sector in general are important factors in the future development of agricultural industry.  Again, as Deputies will be aware, in the past decade this herd has declined very substantially.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment ACOT on their intensive advisory programmes aimed at reversing this trend and increasing the beef cow herd.  I should like also to compliment An Foras Talúntais for their work at Grange and Dunsany and CBF for their work in the area of beef marketing.  I was in attendance yesterday at an open day at Grange where there is some tremendous work being done.  I would hope that the beef sector of the agricultural industry would benefit very substantially from this work. I am hopeful that the attractive incentives available, coupled with the advisory services input, will show positive results, particulary in disadvantaged areas where three out of four beef cow herds in the country are located.  A very modest target of one extra beef cow in each of the 45,000 beef cow herds in disadvantaged areas would boost the national beef herd by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>As already announced, composite cattle headage premium application forms will be posted to all herd owners next month.  These will enable farmers to apply for the EC beef premium scheme valued at £14.70 per eligible animal. Special arrangements are being made to deal with eligible animals sold since Monday 6 April.  Department staff are now in attendance at marts and meat <Col N="2086" /> factories to deal with beef premium applications relating to sales of eligible animals up to 13 June.  The arrangements being made are designed to ensure payment of the premium on the maximum number of eligible cattle in 1987.  It is estimated that the new premium will be paid on 2 million cattle which will represent almost £30 million to cattle producers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the disadvantaged areas generally the position has been made clear by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the course of the budget debate. I do not wish to go over that ground again.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that new measures for agricultural structures were recently decided by the Council of Ministers. These are wide-ranging proposals aimed at assisting farmers in less-favoured areas to adjust to the consequences of the restrictive prices policy. While it is too early to say what will be the precise form of these measures we can go along with the general thrust of many of the ideas emerging.  However, proposals of this nature can lead to difficulties for individual member states, particularly those like ours with budgetary problems.</P>
    <P>A climate is emerging within the EC which could favour the emergence of national income aids.  This will need to be closely monitored.  While we are receptive to any steps which will help to solve the structural problems of the Community, naturally, we shall have to take a long, hard look at any proposals that might have adverse effects on us.  Of particular concern will be the method of financing any income aids.  Obviously weaker member states could not possibly afford to pay such aids without a specially high level of Community financing.  Furthermore, it is necessary to guard against any movement in the direction of re-nationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>While Exchequer funding for livestock improvement schemes has had to be reduced this year the programme of genetic improvement should continue to be effective.  At a time of tighter margins for farmers the necessity for breed improvement <Col N="2087" /> and superior genetic quality remains as important as heretofore.  The livestock breeding programme operates in association with and with the full co-operation of various interests in the industry, such as A1 organisations, breed societies and individual farmers.  This will continue but, of necessity, with a greater proportion of the cost being borne by the industry.  It is not altogether unreasonable for direct beneficiaries to contribute an increasing share at times of stringency in the public finances.  Accordingly, the grants for pig progeny testing and payment to A1 stations for bull progeny testing are being terminated.</P>
    <P>The purchase of rams for sale at reduced prices is being ended and a start is being made on phasing out the milk recording subsidy.  These measures are designed to save £300,000 this year.  The livestock programmes for breeding improvement will, of course, continue but with a greater proportion of the cost being borne by the industry.</P>
    <P>Both AFT and ACOT have had to bear their share of overall budgetary restrictions. However, it is the Government's objective that, within the tighter allocations that can currently be made available, these bodies will continue to play their essential roles on a cost-effective basis in forwarding the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to research, AFT are responding to the new challenges posed by the changing circumstances deriving from Community policies.  The recent reorientation of AFT's research programmes places emphasis on aspects of particular importance in this regard. Among these may be mentioned, an intensification of work on food technology, focusing especially on cost-efficiency and higher quality of product, development of new products or processes and the all important marketing aspect.  Special attention is also being given to the key areas of biotechnology application, alternative farm enterprises, and use of information technology in accelerating the dissemination of research findings.  At the same time work <Col N="2088" /> on raising efficiency levels in established areas such as beef and dairying will continue.</P>
    <P>In the case of ACOT, the current situation demands that within the financial disciplines imposed by present circumstances, the advisory and training services must be concentrated on the raising of technical and economic levels of the farm workforce.  In particular it will be the aim to maintain the momentum built up in recent years in the education and training of our young farmers.  Particular emphasis will, therefore, continue to be placed on the Certificate in Farming Programme in which ACOT has made such impressive progress in recent years, with well over 3,000 young farmers currently pursuing the three year course.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have been changed to give a new emphasis to the food area.  This indicates the high priority the Government are giving to the food industry in their general approach to economic development.  Secondly, it is designed to highlight an important change in the way we look at the food industry.  Up to now, we have tended to concentrate on developing agriculture at farm level and we have done this reasonbly successfully.  The Government will, of course, continue to encourage the development of primary agriculture in terms of increased output and improved efficiency but we will be placing increased emphasis on marketing and processing.  In effect, to use the jargon currently in vogue, we will be encouraging the food industry to adopt a market-led approach.</P>
    <P>In essence, the difference between the new approach and that adopted in the past is that we will encourage a greater orientation on the part of those involved in the food industry towards the needs of the marketplace, which should be reflected back to the producer.  What is required is an integrated approach from the consumer right back to the producer so that we can produce high quality products at the right price and the right time as demanded by the market.  The consumer will be the important person.  We will try <Col N="2089" /> to eliminate any weak links in the chain from the farmer to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Despite its contribution to the economy, the food industry has by no means achieved its full potential in terms of value-added or employment.  The policy of this Government is to bring about the environment which will make it possible to exploit this potential to the maximum extent possible.  The current level of interest rates is a serious disincentive to investment in productive enterprise, not just in the food industry but in industry generally.  One of the central objectives of the budget is to effect a reduction in interest rates and this should have a beneficial effect on developments in the food industry.  I will encourage the food industry to diversify away from bulk commodities which were generally designed for intervention and to get into consumer products which have a much higher value-added and employment content.</P>
    <P>Given certain advantages we enjoy in the production of food I am disappointed that we have not already translated these into advantages in the marketplace, particularly in the form of consumer products.  However, it is not yet too late to effect an improvement in this area and the market-led approval which is to be adopted by this Government is designed to facilitate this.  Our image as a good food island will have to be emphasised much more in market strategy.  I will also place strong emphasis on quality.  Quality will have to underpin the whole programme for the food industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some Irish food products are perceived to be of poor quality and are discounted on export markets. Some of the reasons for this may be related to historical prejudices or bad practices in the past, but the reality is that there can also be objective reasons for the discounting.  We simply cannot afford to lose valuable export earnings by allowing this situation to continue.  I want to see Ireland established as a producer of pure high quality food products, produced naturally in a relatively pollution-free environment.  Both CBF and CTT will be placing strong emphasis on this in <Col N="2090" /> their efforts to promote Irish food on export markets.</P>
    <P>Recent initiatives such as the reintroduction of FEOGA grants for the modernisation of plant and equipment will give added impetus to our strategy and our programme for the development of the food industry.  We will have £140 million invested in the modernisation of food plant and equipment over the next five years.  I also draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that there are very substantial and generous research and development grants available to the food industry.  I am disappointed with the uptake of those grants.  We cannot stand still with traditional products.  Consumer tastes and preferences are continually changing.  Products in the food area become redundant in a relatively short time.  My door is always open to people in the industry who are not taking up the very generous grant-aid available.  The FEOGA grant-aid available is up to 75 per cent and in the present restrictive financial climate they are very generous terms.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues which will improve our image as a good food producing country.  Very shortly we will have the slaughter house Bill in relation to pigmeat processing and this should raise standards.  I hope before the end of the year we will have at least four plants in the pigmeat area brought up to the most rigorous internationally recognised standards and, in particular, up to the standards demanded by the US Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>We can look forward with optimism to the decline in prices at farm level which occurred over the past couple of seasons because of weather conditions being reversed in a better economic environment. We hope that the increased impetus on consumer oriented and tailor made products which will receive the premium prices on supermarket shelves will not alone put more money into farmers pockets, into industry and into marketing, but that it will also create very badly needed jobs in the various sectors.</P>
    <P>In the development of the agricultural <Col N="2091" /> industry this Government will have a fundamental and radical re-examination of the general attitude of previous Governments over the past 50 years who put emphasis on encouraging agricultural production, greater efficiencies at production level and increased output which led to products for which there was not a market and created an embarrassing surplus to the extent that it cost the taxpayers of the Community and this country generally, enormous sums of money to dispose of those products.  We will create conditions where raw material produced by Irish farmers will find their niche in the marketplace of the world and from which all sectors of the industry will find remunerative reward.</P>

      <P>The reply is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in <Col N="2092" /> the Official Report.  Information on the quantity of fish dumped relates only to those species of fish covered by EC market support arrangements.</P>
      <P>Dumping of fish is, of course, only one of the methods used in disposing of fish withdrawn from the market under the market support system of the European Community's Common Fisheries Policy. Fishermen's producers' organisations have been urged by my Department to avoid dumping where possible and to dispose of the surplus fish for fishmeal or animal feed.  As can be seen from the statement, there has been a considerable reduction in the amount of fish dumped since 1985 and I shall continue to press the relevant bodies to ensure that this trend continues in future.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there should be no dumping of fish? Will he say what steps are being taken to prevent any further dumping?  Does he agree there is an absolute necessity for a fish processing factory to avoid this situation arising again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we should endeavour to keep the amount of fish being dumped to the very minimum. There are difficulties encountered at times especially when small amounts of fish are landed in isolated areas where it might not be economical to transport it for processing or to fishmeal plants.  I have drawn the attention of the producer organisations to the need to ensure that in so far as is possible there will be no dumping of fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases the amounts of fish are very small and may not even be suitable for human consumption.  In the past much of it has been put into fishmeal plants for use as fishmeal.  I will endeavour to ensure that any fish that can be utilised will be used.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 10 together.  Immediately on assuming office I directed that a thorough review be carried out by my Department on the use of TBT and related anti-fouling paints and their effect on the aquatic environment.</P>
      <P>Arising from that review I decided, as announced on 3 April, to use the powers available to me under the Fisheries Acts to impose controls on the use of these substances.  I now wish to inform the House that yesterday I signed a by-law giving effect to that decision.  The relevant by-law prohibits the use of TBT and related anti-fouling paints on the majority of boats and other structures in our waters.  I am satisfied that this measure will afford adequate protection to our aquatic environment against these dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to have made a limited declaration in regard to ships and structures on which TBT may not be used.  We all know the position at this stage.  Studies have been carried out on TBT in the UK and the US.  The US have taken great steps with their Navy to have it removed and banned totally.  Is it the Minister's intention to have the use of TBT banned totally in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The exclusion which was made relates to the hulls of aluminium alloy whose overall length is more than 25 metres.  There are very few of these boats in use.  The position is similar in <Col N="2095" /> France.  When they imposed a ban they did not impose the ban on aluminium hulls because of the corrosive effect of the other non-toxic anti-pollutant paints. It is a very minor exclusion and does not apply here because we have very few of these type of boats.  In regard to the total ban, the Department of Agriculture are at present reviewing the position in relation to European Community regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not justify what we do by what people have or have not achieved in other countries.  This is possibly &mdash; as has been stated by some of the world's experts &mdash; the most lethal substance ever unleashed into the environment and it will have horrendous consequences if it is not controlled.  I would like to impress this fact upon the Minister and urge him to look at the possibility of having this substance totally banned in Irish waters as soon as possible because of the long-term consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will draw the Deputy's attention to the by-law which is very comprehensive and which covers most of the areas he has in mind.  The only exclusion is this minor one in relation to aluminium hulls in excess of 25 metres.  Such boats are few and far between in this country. In relation to the total ban, that is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and I will draw their attention to it.  In accordance with the European Communities Classification Regulations, 1985, an examination is under way and it may be possible to ban the sale of anti-fouling components.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to have fishery boards utilise fishery areas to their full potential?  If there are such derelict areas, would it be his intention to acquire them under section 37 of the 1980 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation fishery boards have statutory obligations to develop inland fisheries and most of the boards have undertaken a survey of the catchments within their regions.  Earlier this year the Central Fisheries Board published a documented strategy for the development of fisheries indicating a very wide range of initiatives which could be taken in inland fisheries.  That report is being studied by my Department.  I will bring the Deputy's views to the notice of the board and impress upon them the desirability of organising within their regions the development to the maximum potential of inland fisheries, especially areas which are not being fully utilised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This report dealt with salmon fishing and showed that 57 per cent of revenue from the salmon fishing industry came from anglers who only accounted for about 4½ per cent of the catch.  Is it the Minister's intention, as regards fishermen drift netting with monofilament nets, that the law should be upheld in this regard?  Does he intend putting sufficient resources at the disposal <Col N="2097" /> of the fisheries boards to ensure this happens and to protect the other end of the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement of regulations and the possible changes in regard to monofilament netting are the subject of a review initiated by my predecessor. At this stage I will not make any comment because we still have not got the final report of that review committee.  As regards drift netting, we give notice that we will not tolerate the illegal activities which have been taking place in recent times.  We strongly believe in the enforcement of the fisheries regulations and conservation measures and every effort will be made to stop any illegal and indiscriminate fishing.</P>

      <P>The development of Clogher Head as a fishery harbour is on the priority list of harbour development works of my Department.  The present position is that a feasibility study of the project has been completed by the Louth County Council's consultant engineers. This study has recently been received in my Department where it is being examined with a view to settling a final plan. Before a decision can be taken, the plan will have to be costed and economically appraised.  As it will be some considerable time before work on this project could commence, provision has not been made for it in the 1987 Capital Programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will make a statement on the damage to marine life along the Cork coast arising from the sinking of the <i>Kowloon Bridge;</i> and the plans, if any, he has to assist fishermen in the area, for loss of earnings and increased costs arising from the sinking of the vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of legal actions being prepared by my Department and the possibility of similar actions by private interests I believe it would be inappropriate to make a definitive statement on the extent of the damage at this stage. It is as yet in any event too early to assess the full consequences for marine life.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Wildlife Section of the Department of Energy have been monitoring the situation and while I understand that marine life along the coast has been affected by the oil pollution, the greatest damage appears to have been suffered by bird life and fauna and flora on the shoreline.  There has been inconvenience to local fishermen and some fish and nets have I understand been oiled.</P>
      <P>As regards claims for damages, I would see it in the first instance as a matter for private interests to pursue their claim directly with the insurers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

Further, in view of the fact that the Wildlife Section of the Department has become involved in monitoring the situation, is the Minister in a position to tell us what damage and destruction have been caused to wildlife as a result of the seepage from the <i>Kowloon Bridge?</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give a brief update on the exact position of the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> particularly the ongoing risk of further oil spillages, <i>vis-à-vis</i> their effect on marine life and fishermen? Would the Department be prepared to give help to the private groups he referred to, particularly the environmental groups and those concerned with the protection of sea birds etc., in compiling their claims <Col N="2100" /> for the insurers?  They are having considerable difficulty in tracing the source to which claims should be made and I respectfully request the Minister to help in the co-ordination of such claims even though I accept that they are not the direct responsibility of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary concern of the Department of the Marine has been to have any oil in the vessel removed and safely disposed of.  In that regard, a number of consultants have been contacted by the Department who are at present arranging a contract with one of them to advise on the best method of removing the oil as soon as the weather permits.  The consultant was chosen from a number of firms suggested by the European Community from which we sought and have been given co-operation and advice on how best to deal with the matter.  As I said, it is our immediate priority to have a thorough examination carried out on the structure with the best possible advice available to determine the best method of removing any oil which may be on board.  I assure the Deputy that the keenest interest is being taken in this matter by my Department and the Department of the Environment and that every effort will be made to ensure, in so far as it is possible to do so, that the matter is given the utmost attention and dealt with as effectively and quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would reply to the second part of the question in view of the difficulties experienced by the various voluntary groups in processing their claims to the insurers.  In view of the fact that all these voluntary groups have now exhausted their funds in doing their primary job in protecting wildlife and the environment generally, does the Minister agree that the Department of the Marine should co-ordinate and process all these claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited the scheme recently and met many people, organisations and bodies who have been involved in this <Col N="2101" /> matter.  I wish to compliment and pay tribute to the many volunteers who offered assistance to Government Departments and agencies after the disaster. We will certainly give every assistance possible but the question of compensation is premature at this stage because the matter needs to be finalised before we know the full extent of what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the reduced catches and increased costs to fishermen, what specific action is the Minister taking to help in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that claims have already been lodged on behalf of the fishermen by their legal representative and it is a matter for them to pursue their claim directly with the insurance companies.  In answer to Deputy Doyle's question, we will assist the fishermen in any way possible but it would be premature to say any more at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the principle rather <Col N="2102" /> than the specific to which I wish to refer. The fishermen and the environmentalists will not be in a position to put money towards chasing insurance claims.  If it comes to that, will the Minister ensure that the Department of the Marine take up the cudgels in the pursuit of these claims?  Well and good if they go through in the ordinary way and are processed easily but it is beginning to look as if there could be difficulties in processing them. The money has run out and I ask the Minister to ensure that it will not be a limiting factor in the processing of these claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Bonamia was tentatively diagnosed in an oyster sample at the Fisheries Research Centre, Abbotstown, Castleknock, County Dublin, on the afternoon of Friday, 20 March 1987.  During that weekend further samples were taken to a laboratory outside the country where the diagnosis was confirmed.</P>
      <P>I made an order on Wednesday, 25 March 1987, banning the importation of oysters and the movement of oysters other than for direct human consumption and an intensive sampling programme was immediately put into operation by my Department.  Up to yesterday samples had been received from 21 areas and 12 of these samples had been tested and found to be negative.</P>
      <P>There is a fish pathologist working at the Fisheries Research Centre with support staff of three technicians who specialise in fish pathology.  In general, the staffing level at the Fisheries Research Centre is sufficient to cope with foreseeable problems.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for the introduction of a compensation system for losses to oyster producers affected by the ban on the movement of oysters.  Fish farming, in common with all other businesses, carries certain risks.  I do not see it as a function of my Department to provide schemes of compensation for losses that may be incurred by fish farmers as a result of the introduction of measures designed to minimise such losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that one fish pathologist is employed at the Fisheries Research Centre but is he aware that the pathologist is leaving tomorrow?  What has he done to replace him?  Does he feel that the staffing level at Abbotstown is adequate to cope with what can only be termed a disaster?  What are the Minister's plans to ensure that the sampling which is now necessary because of the unfortunate disease, bonamia, which has affected flat oysters, will be done at a rate which will ensure that any further <Col N="2104" /> outbreaks will be detected before there is a further spread of the disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mrs. Daly Mrs. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>From the samples we have taken to date, we are satisfied that the disease has not spread.  In relation to the first part of Deputy Doyle's question, I am aware that the pathologist proposes to leave the Department shortly but arrangements have been made with the Department of Agriculture and Food to have services available to deal with any problem which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that another histopathologist is replacing the man leaving the FRC tomorrow?  Is he also saying that one is sufficient for this detailed and specific kind of work?  At the moment it is necessary to process between 70 and 100 samples per month from all the sites around the country and one man is able to deal with only 150 oyster samples a day.  Staff also have to be employed to open the oysters and to process them for sampling, apart from the histopathologist who is necessary to read the results.  The fishing industry, particularly the aquaculture industry, insist that they have been telling the Department for nearly a decade that they were understaffed and would be unable to cope if a disaster should stike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In fact, we had meetings with them this afternoon and they are totally satisfied with the action which was taken in this instance and with the action which was taken by me in imposing a ban on the movement of oysters.  As a result of the discussions <Col N="2105" /> which are currently taking place in my Department it may be possible to make some amendments which will ease the pressure on the producers.  The priority in my Department is to ensure that we get the disease under control and we avoid its spread to other areas outside of the area where it was detected.  We are satisfied that we can do this and we are getting back-up from the Department of Agriculture and Food and, if it is necessary to get some further assistance, we will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that somebody is about to take up the position in Abbotstown.  I would like to know when that person is due to take up his new duties and whether he will be capable of dealing with the bonamia disease.  One needs to be highly specialised in order to deal with this disease.  My understanding is that the person who is there at present is the only person in this country capable of dealing with that disease.  The Minister has mentioned moving somebody from another Department.  I would like to know whether that person is qualified to deal specifically with this disease as it is the area of greatest concern at present? He may well be capable of dealing with other areas.  On my priority question, will the Minister introduce legislation dealing not alone with the importation of oysters but the movement of oysters within the country?  This has been the principal cause of the spread of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now, I am satisfied <Col N="2106" /> that the legislation in place is adequate. The record shows that we have been able to contain the disease within the area where it was first identified.  We are also satisfied that we are in a position to deal with the problem but if that is not the case we will have to seek alternative assistance.  As the Deputy will be aware, and I said this in my reply, that for confirmation of the disease we had to send the samples outside the country and that meant a delay of a day or two.  Now, that the problem is under control and the association are satisfied that we have got it under control, there is a possibility of relaxing the controls I introduced.  If that is possible, we will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave figures of samples they have in their possession but it is my understanding and belief that that is a very small number of samples. The reason for this is that the people concerned have not got enough resources to gather in enough samples.  While the figure might be relative in terms of the numbers which have been collected and tested, in the overall picture there are two major problems.  There are not enough resources to collect enough samples and there are not enough resources at the Abbotstown laboratory to conduct efficient and speedy research in a short space of time.  Will the Minister take action in future to cope with these disasters if they arise?</P>

I am satisfied from the information I have that the resources are adequate, but if there are shortcomings we will endeavour to rectify them.</P>

      <P>I hope you will allow me <Col N="2107" /> to ask three or four questions.  Can the Minister confirm whether a histo-pathologist is being appointed to replace the man who is leaving the Fisheries Research Centre tomorrow?  I know staff are being appointed but I want to know the qualifications of the man who is being appointed to replace the only pathologist working there at present.  Does the Minister consider that one such qualified person is sufficient, given the particular difficulties we have at present?  Can the Minister tell the House under what Act was the Order banning the movement of oysters around the country made?  Is he satisfied that it will hold up?  What plans exactly has he, as requested by the Deputy who put down the question, to review the legislation?  Will he introduce new enabling legislation or will he amend the 1980 Act particularly with a view to allowing licensing which is essential for the industry at present and which the industry have been demanding for many years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to review the issue of compensation in view of his response to our questions.  Is the Minister aware that in the UK the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries have a compensation programme? Is the Minister aware that if stock is destroyed by order of that Ministry the fishermen, or the farmers as they prefer to call themselves, are compensated particularly if there is more than 10 per cent infection as we have in Cork Harbour?  We have a provision in our legislation to deal with such a matter in that compensation is paid for reactor cattle.  Will the Minister consider introducing a similar type of compensation programme for our farmers and fishermen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into that suggestion to see if it will be possible to introduce such a programme but I do not think we should get involved in the question of compensation.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta are actively promoting the development of aquaculture in accordance with a multiannual guidance programme submitted to the EC by my Department.  I will have a copy of this programme sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A multiannual guidance programme covering the next five years is in course of preparation and will provide a sound basis for the continued development of aquaculture.</P>
      <P>With a view to stimulating this development, priority is being given to the issue of aquaculture licences in the 14 areas which have been designated to date.  In addition, a list of areas where designation procedures will commence during 1987 is currently being prepared.</P>
      <P>Mariculture research is at present in a fragmented state and badly needs coordination. This will be achieved through the early establishment of a marine research and technology institute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news that the Minister intends to establish a marine research and technology institute.  In view of the potential of the industry I should like to know if the Minister agrees that its growth will largely depend on research and development.  Will the Minister ensure that there will be adequate resources to carry out research and development so that the industry can achieve its full potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's views.  In recognition of the absence of an adequate research and development programme we decided to establish a marine research and technology institute. <Col N="2112" /> I appreciate the importance of the industry but we must develop it in a way that will be of benefit to the community.  This area has suffered from the fragmentation of research up to now.  I hope the institute we propose to establish will bring together the various agencies, organisations, the universities and others involved in the development of aquaculture and marine research under the umbrella of one research institute.  We are preparing plans for that institute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to appoint an interim board or institute to carry on until the necessary legislation is put through the Oireachtas.  It may be possible to do that pretty quickly.  I hope that under that interim arrangement it will be possible to bring together the various strands of activity in the area of research which are at present fragmented and working towards different objectives.  Such an interim board will operate pending the enactment of legislation that will put a firm statutory body in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has been the practice to hold public inquiries in the different areas before designation orders are made.

I am satisfied that <Col N="2113" /> adequate opportunity is given to the various interests to put forward their observations at those public inquiries.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the establishment of the new Department of the Marine it is my intention to review the functions of the various State agencies under the aegis of the Department.  However An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will continue to engage in market promotion, both home and export, and in the case of the export market it will operate in close co-operation with Córas Tráchtála.  The board will of course operate in accordance with the policies laid down by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's stated priority &mdash; as quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 April &mdash; to increase efficiency and dispense with duplication in BIM, I should like him to tell us how there will be increased efficiency and no duplication if he proposes to have CTT, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Roinn na Mara involved in that area of the fishing industry? We will have three State agencies rather than one dabbling in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The framework for the new Department of the Marine was contained in the document the Deputy referred to earlier.  One of the handicaps in the <Col N="2114" /> development of our marine resources has been the fragmentation of research and lack of a Department with responsibility for fisheries.  We have identified the marine economy as an area with potential. That area has suffered in the past through fragmentation and, in some cases, overlapping and a waste of human and financial resources.  The purpose of establishing the Department of the Marine was to avoid what the Deputy referred to.  It is our wish to ensure that the fragmentation that has damaged the prospects of development of the industry will be avoided and that we will have a co-ordinated approach to the marine economy.  The Deputy should bear in mind that we have been operating for just three weeks.  We will proceed with establishing the structures we consider essential for the proper exploitation of the magnificent marine resources we have, something that has not been done before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand how we will have increased efficiency and less duplication &mdash; I laud that as one of the Minister's priorities &mdash; if three State bodies, CTT, BIM and Roinn na Mara will have a role in the whole area of the market promotion and trade development of our fishing industry. Will the Minister elaborate on his new found faith in BIM's export marketing ability?  Part of Fianna Fáil's proposals maintain that the industry was basically weak in their export marketing strategy.  I would be delighted if there was efficiency and less duplication in this area.  It has been neglected for many years.  How will this come about if another tier of bureaucracy is added to the equation?  Who relates to whom? Who is the boss, apart from the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is losing sight of what I said in my reply.  The whole purpose behind the establishment of this Department is to avoid unnecessary duplication. In some cases eight or nine different Departments were operating but there was no overall umbrella Department. We will review the various State <Col N="2115" /> agencies which have been engaged in different activities to ensure we avoid the duplication and fragmentation which has damaged the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that we all welcome the establishment of the Department of the Marine.  If all the Departments are to be absorbed into the Department of the Marine and yet remain autonomous in their own areas it simply will not work.  Does the Minister intend to review the rules and regulations of the other organisations and alter them accordingly so that the operation will run under one Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is early days to make decisions.  We are looking at the various organisations to see how it will be possible to streamline their activities and get the desired results.  Various proposals have been put forward.  For example, in the area of finance for fishing boats and shipping finance it has been suggested it might be more advantageous to have a restructured financial agency.  These matters are under discussion and I am not prepared to go further at this stage.  It would not be advantageous to string along the different sections and knot them up together.  The way forward is to ensure that we have a co-ordinated approach, through the new Department of the Marine, towards marine economy <Col N="2116" /> to enable us to exploit to the full the revenue and jobs which will be generated. We are an island nation, yet for the last 50 years the industry has not been developed to its maximum potential.</P>

      <P>While in respect of some species our catches fall short of the quotas allocated, there is pressure on certain species, mainly mackerel, herring and hake.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to assure the House that in view of the fact that it was his good self who in 1982 agreed our slice of the cake &mdash; 4.6 per cent of the TAC &mdash; we can expect him to press aggressively for a substantial increase in the quota in the years he will be in office.  I wish him well in his office for however long those years may be.  On what grounds can we be assured that, since the Minister agreed to the 4.6 per cent, he can go back with an apparent change of mind and make a case that will really stand up for an increase in our percentage of the TAC?</P>

Does he agree that the benefit we will get from the ten year structures plan will depend on our TAC?  What proposals has he to ensure we will get a reasonable and fairer share of the TAC than is now the case?</P>

      <P>There are substantial quotas available at present which have not been taken up.  In 1985 the cod quota was 11,520 tonnes.  Our catch was 8,057 tonnes.  In relation to whiting, our quota in 1985 was 17,800 tonnes and the catch was 10,094 tonnes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take action on this. There are certain species which are not the subject of quotas but if quotas are introduced in the future our quota will depend on the effort we make in fishing those species now.  I am talking about blue whiting, horse mackerel, ling and other species.  There are adequate areas for us to concern ourselves with immediately where it is possible to increase our catches and increase the revenue for fishermen and the economy by a vigorous attempt to take the quotas at present available for us.</P>
      <P>On the second point mackerel and herring are the subject of very tight restrictions and we believe that it is possible to make a case for an increase in those.  This is why we are going to Brussels to meet the Commissioner next week.  We intend to invite the Commissioner over here to see our industry and its stage of development, and to endeavour to fight to the limit to ensure that we get increase in these areas.  It would not be fair at this stage to pre-empt our discussions with the Commissioner and the possibility of having him over here to see in what way we can increase our catches in these areas.  At this time we will endeavour to the limit of our ability to ensure adequate quotas for the industry here to enable it to expand and develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the plans, if any, he has submitted or will be submitting to ensure Ireland gains maximum advantage from the EC over the next ten years from the structural measures for the fishing industry which have been drawn up by the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this regulation, each member state is required to submit a multi-annual guidance programme in respect of the proposed development of its fishing industry and subsequent applications for grant-aid will be considered in the context of this programme.  At present, the Irish multi-annual guidance programme is in course of preparation and I can assure the Deputy that the <Col N="2120" /> scope of this programme will be such as to allow for the continued development of the Irish fishing industry and the maximum benefit for Irish applicants under the scheme in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is tied up with the last one.  Will the Minister agree with me that to gain maximum advantage from the new structures plan and for our multi-annual guidance plan or programme that we have to submit by the end of April, we would need an increased quota to have any real effect for the industry here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we be looking for laying up premiums and grants rather than grants for fleet investment and for exploratory fishing?  Without an increase in our percentage of the TAC it would be for laying up.  We will be looking for support from the Minister under the structures planned rather than for development for our ports and new fishing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.  The items I would see as priority would be fleet development, mariculture projects to enable us to develop our mariculture industry and ensure that it gets off properly, processing development because, the Deputy will be aware, at present there is adequate scope for futher secondary processing which would increase greatly the value of the catch and of our exports, and the whole infrastructural development which is essential for the development of a modern fishing industry. If we are to utilise some of the species which at present are not the subject of quota where there is no question whatever of any restrictions being placed on us at Community level, then we can use some of the resources of this structures policy to enable us to prepare for that. In talking about utilising species which are at present not the subject of quota and where there is potential for development, some of which I have mentioned <Col N="2121" /> already, I am also talking about the question of the quota which is available to us such as cod and whiting which I have indicated.  There are others as well which are the subject of quota and where at present we are not taking our quota. Some of the investment in these areas would enable the industry to take the full quota available to them under the present arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government prepared to invest up to 25 per cent as will be required of them to obtain the 40 per cent grant that will be available in Europe for fleet investment, particularly for investing in the non-quota species?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time we are in the course of preparation of this programme and we will take the Deputy's view on that into account.  In my view up to now we have not availed fully of the benefits available to us in the Community.  Our intention in the future will be to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from Community funding for the development of an industry here which we have not been getting up to now.  During the term when the Deputy's party were in Government we had the second lowest uptake from the moneys available in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>How can we gain maximum advantage from the structures plan unless we match the European money with money here, from the Irish Government, as will be necessary?  Will we be taking the line that we will be opting for laying up premiums and grants for selling our tonnage outside the EC area?  If we are investing either in exploratory waters or in new fleet we will have to match that investment by at least 25 per cent of the money from this country. How will we get that maximum advantage unless we are prepared to put that money up front?</P>

      <P>When the percentage was much lower in the past four years the Deputy's Government in office did not utilise the money that was available.  In <Col N="2122" /> fact, during the last year of their term in office the percentage uptake of the Community funding was one of the lowest ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that at present many agencies engage in this activity, for instance, the Central Fisheries Board, the Salmon Research Trust, Údarás na Gaeltachta, BIM, the universities and areas under the Department. One of the handicaps to the development of our marine research and technology has been the lack of co-ordination, overlapping and in some cases duplication.  The whole purpose of the institute is to avoid that and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the overall development of our marine research and technology.  Legislation will be required before the institute can be formally established. Many issues must be taken into account before we get that legislation through here, but my intention will be perhaps to establish an interim board of some kind to enable the work to get under way as soon as possible pending enactment of the necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give this House any guarantee on this?  Much as we all welcome, in principle at any rate, the establishment of a marine research and technology institute which, indeed, is long overdue, could the Minister give some guarantee that it will not be top heavy with administrators and just another monolith?  Is he aware that ten years ago the proportion of primary workers to administrators in the whole area of R and D in support services for the fishing industry was 3:1 and it is now 3:10, three primary workers to 10 administrators? Will this continue or will we have more people back at the actual research and development which is what is needed from this new research institute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Our intention will be to keep administration to the very minimum, bearing in mind that there are various bodies and institutions at present engaged in this type of activity and that they have been working up to now mainly individually, on their own, without any overall co-ordinated approach.  The rationale behind the establishment of the institute is to co-ordinate the activities of <Col N="2124" /> the various agencies and bodies that have been involved in this area so as to get the maximum benefit in the whole research area.</P>
      <P>At this stage, and pending the enactment of legislation, it is not possible to give the Deputy an indication but the general thrust and approach would be to avoid duplication and fragmentation and to keep administration to the minimum but, at the same time, to ensure that the research institute will work efficiently, effectively and quickly to undertake the work which is so essential for the development of the marine economy at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is early days yet and we must be, and indeed will be, reasonable.  Has the Minister any time scale or projection for having this institute take effect?  When would he expect it to be <i>in situ</i> and up and running, as it were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As an interim measure, I am satisfied that within a very short time, within a few months, work can get under way.  As the Deputy will be aware, some work has already been done by a task force which was established by the previous Minister with responsibility for industry.  They have already issued an interim and detailed report setting out their ideas, having studied the situation very carefully as to how such an institute might be organised.  I am not saying that is the one that will form the framework and basis for our institute but it is a very detailed document which has raised very important issues and certainly it is a basis on which some action could be taken.  It is my intention that we have this institute in place at the very earliest opportunity so that it can get on with its work.  We do not have to await the legislation which will be necessary formally to establish the institute.  We can get work under way almost immediately and this is my intention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Government's proposals in regard to ratification, following the Supreme Court decision on the Single European Act, these will be put forward as soon as we have had an opportunity of considering the terms of the judgment. The Dáil and Seanad will be recalled, if necessary, to consider as a matter of urgency, any proposals for legislation. Deputies will be aware of the difficulties in this respect due to the fact that Members of the present Seanad cease to hold office on Monday, 13 April, at 12 midnight.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am very glad that the gravity of the situation is fully recognised.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the annoyance and frustration which have been expressed over a number of months in Europe at Ireland's delay in ratifying this Act?  There will likely be a further outburst now.  In these circumstances, could it be regarded as a matter of the most extreme urgency that this situation be rectified and that a referendum be held on the 30th day after the passing of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas?  I would hope, that the Bill could be passed perhaps by next Monday. Would the Taoiseach consider that it would be possible to have a Bill through this House, say, by Saturday next and considered by the Seanad on Monday before that House is dissolved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate and agree with the Deputy about the gravity of the situation.  I would remind the House that on 9 December 1986, when the Dáil was debating the issue of ratifying the Single European Act I stated, referring to the previous Government:</P>
      <P>The Government are apparently prepared to take a chance.  That is their decision, but it is a very casual attitude to adopt on a matter of very great importance and significance.  Surely a far better and wiser course would have been to hold a referendum earlier this year and put the matter beyond doubt or challenge.</P>
      <P>That is what I said when the debate was taking place in this House last year. Unfortunately, my fears in that regard have now come to pass.  I would suggest to Deputy O'Malley that perhaps the best thing would be for himself and myself to meet tomorrow as I have suggested, when we could discuss the issues which arise.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that we should be very careful about rushing into a referendum which would, in the nature of things, be very hastily organised while the wording on which we would be asked to vote would be, presumably, very hastily put together?  The people in 1972 already decided the limits and responsibilities which we were offering to the EC.  In these circumstances, does he not agree that it would be more appropriate to seek renegotiation of the Single European Act, rather than tampering any further with our Constitution in this regard?</P>

In view not alone of the difficulties for this country but for 11 other member states of the European Community would the Taoiseach not agree, notwithstanding the desirability of getting all its technical aspects right, that it is a matter of the utmost urgency?

We have <Col N="2129" /> already, of course, formed some preliminary views about the different aspects of the judgment.  It is a complex matter and our process of examination is still going ahead.  I hope to be able to convey more information to the party leaders when I meet them tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the Constitution is the fundamental, legal basis of all our laws in this State, and governs the laws both within the State and our relationships with other states externally.  I am sure he will agree also that any hasty move to change that would require fairly detailed and long discussion as to its implications which may not be immediately obvious in a rushed debate? For that reason, would he agree further that any question of rushing a Bill through this House arranging for a referendum would not arise, that there should be time given both to debate in this House and outside it on the implications of whatever steps are being taken?</P>

      <P>I had said before Question Time that I had wanted to address three areas, one, that of defence and foreign affairs, another, that of financial control, in particular the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and, third, the Department of the Environment Estimate for the coming year, to which I should like to refer as my party spokesman on urban renewal.</P>
      <P>I will deal with them in that order.  The budget for the coming year on supply services amounts to £260 million for the Department of Defence, plus £41 million for Army Pensions and £24 million for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It seems to me that we should be considering on what basis our neutrality is founded.  This has been well argued by others, most notably by the late Fergus FitzGerald who wrote in an unpublished article:</P>
      <P>Neutrality requires defence. Defence requires a deterrent force.  A deterrent force costs money &mdash; a lot of money if we decide to go it alone.  At present Ireland is not willing to finance such a deterrent.  Ireland should abandon the pretence of neutrality, or face the consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>An unpublished essay of the late Fergus FitzGerald.  It seems to me we should be considering at present on what basis our neutrality is formed and what are its tenets.  Have we ever properly debated our neutrality?  The last debate in this House which even touched on the subject was in March 1981, if my recollection is correct.  That was a debate on the post-summit meeting attended by the then Taoiseach.  Even then only party Front Bench spokesmen contributed, but <Col N="2148" /> there was not a full debate on our neutrality.</P>
      <P>A former Minister for External Affairs in a Coalition Government, Seán McBride, and a former Minister for External Affairs in a Fianna Fáil Government, Frank Aiken, both indicated clearly that Irish neutrality is based on one thing, that is partition.  It seems to me extraordinary in this day and age that those statements should be allowed stand as the definition of our neutrality.</P>
      <P>In his book <i>A Singular Stance</i> Patrick Keatinge says and I quote:</P>
      <P>...neutrality, like any other doctrine ...should be subject to critical analysis.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that any time anybody has tried to raise the question of Irish neutrality or of defence, they are either shouted down or made out to be some sort of oddballs who are challenging the independence of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An ill-defined neutrality which does not have central tenets, which cannot be easily defended &mdash; because nobody understands those tenets or on what they are based &mdash; is not neutrality at all.  It is time this House set time aside to debate the whole question of Irish neutrality. Indeed it is time this House established a full foreign affairs committee so that we should consider that and other important matters, so that we, as a Parliament and a country, would have a policy which is soundly based, which has been discussed and is understood by all concerned. Almost all of our former Heads of Government, some who held senior positions in Government, can be quoted as clearly indicating that we would depart from neutrality in certain circumstances. There are two such circumstances which come to mind immediately, one being the defence of the European Community. Can we expect other countries, parents of children of other States, to send their children out to defend the European Community if it comes under attack while we sit firmly on the fence?  I do not think that is a realistic expectation.  Equally, can we expect the parents of Dutch, Belgian or French children to go out and <Col N="2149" /> fight to protect the Community under attack while we sit firmly on the fence? We cannot do that.  The essence of neutrality is being uninvolved in wars between other states.  This has a strict legal basis in the Fifth and Thirteenth Hague Conventions of 1907.  There seems to be a view here that there is some connection between neutralism and pacifism. There is no such connection.  Many of the members of the neutral and non-aligned group are huge exporters of parts, machinery and weapons, used for defence purposes.</P>
    <P>We must define the circumstances in which we intend to remain neutral.  Could we remain neutral in these days of fast communication if there was a repeat of the holocaust in which six million Jewish men and women and children and others were sent painfully to their deaths?  If such a thing recurred, in the name of common humanity we would have a duty to defend those at risk.  We owe it to our European neighbours to define precisely where we stand on the question of neutrality. Irish participation at the Stockholm Conference is co-ordinated through the European Political Co-operation Group, whereas the other neutral countries are represented through the neutral and non-aligned group.  That must seem peculiar to the other European countries.</P>
    <P>The only reason given on record for our remaining neutral is partition.  If partition ended we would no longer be neutral was said by Mr. Aiken, as Minister for External Affairs and by Mr. Seán McBride.  Is that still true?  It is time we defined and debated our neutrality.  If we decide to remain neutral we should consider whether we have to provide in the Estimates of the Department of Defence to defend that neutrality.  In 1982 it was estimated it would cost £500 million to defend our neutrality.  That Estimate was calculated by a former senior Army officer.  The entire budget for the Department of Defence at that time was something of the order of one-third of that.  The position remains the same.  We must ask ourselves if we are serious about neutrality, do we have a policy and, if so, what?  We should look <Col N="2150" /> at the departmental Estimates when considering whether or not we should depart from our neutrality.</P>
    <P>In relation to the control of the public finances those who were members of the Committee of Public Accounts will know that the legislation governing the Comptroller and Auditor General is of 19th century origin.  There are two other short Acts to update that legislation for the sake of the creation of Saorstat Éireann dated 1922 and 1923.  Apart from that the only mention of the Comptroller and Auditor General is in the 1937 Constitution which appoints the Comptroller and Auditor General not as an officer of the Executive but as what could be described as being an officer of this House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is independent, akin to a High Court judge, whose job is to audit and control the funds of the State.  Yet, since the foundation of the State we have not seen fit to update his powers of control and audit.  That reflects very badly on this House.  Neither have we seen fit to update the powers of the Committee of Public Accounts, although the Taoiseach in reply to me a few days ago said he was giving consideration to this.  In Great Britain they set up a review committee in the early 1980s which translated into the National Audit Act of 1983 which gave powers to the Public Accounts Committee in the UK and to the Comptroller and Auditor General and set up a basis of constant review of audit procedures in that Parliament along the lines of the Canadian principle.  Some members of the Committee of Public Accounts went on one of these famous junkets to see the Canadian committee, because the Canadian Parliament have one of the most advanced systems of audit in the world. They have an Auditor General who has a great degree of independence, who has the power to carry out not just programmed audits but value for money audits and who has the power to call in outside firms of accountants to assist him in auditing the accounts of the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>It is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts to get involved in <Col N="2151" /> policy but it is their function to carry out an audit.  The Committee should be more of a watchdog than a bloodhound.  Policy is a matter for this House and the Government of the day.  The Committee of Public Accounts have great powers to summon persons and records but they do not have the facility or the terms of reference or the back-up to carry out proper value for money audits on State expenditure.  They should have that power.  Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditors General's Act should be updated to give him modern powers of audit.  The reports of local government auditors who audit the accounts of health boards and local authorities should be automatically available to the Committee of Public Accounts and if they decide to call in somebody from the EHB or from Donegal County Council to examine an area of expenditure they should be free to do so.  The Committee, in theory, have that power but they do not have the support and goodwill and the supporting legislation to carry out that sort of audit. Yet, the gross expenditure on supply services alone this year is £9,923 million and that does not include capital expenditure. If one were to gross all State spending one would probably find that the State spends something in the region of from £12,000 million to £15,000 million per year.</P>
    <P>If the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General were to have the power to chase any incorrect expenditure of funds, sizeable amounts of public spending could be saved for the taxpayer.  Of the figure of £15,000 million, 5 per cent would be £750 million and 1 per cent would be £150 million.  Can any Member of the House say there is not at least 1 per cent waste in public spending?  Would a 5 per cent waste figure be an exaggeration?  With such savings we could reduce income tax by one-third or abolish the current budget deficit in less than three years.  People may think that is an exaggeration but it is not.  This is something which must be pursued.  The starting place is to update the powers of the Committee of Public <Col N="2152" /> Accounts and the legislation governing that Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General so as to give him the tools to do the work and to carry out a modern audit.</P>
    <P>On a random sample basis of audit the Comptroller and Auditor General has come up with some frightening situations leaving aside the philoprogenitive lady who claimed children's allowance for 83 children, the installation of heating systems in houses which cost over £13,000 which were built for public servants and the fact that the State had a contract to purchase two ships for £10 million but bought one ship for £12 million.  Those are just random samples.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has not the power, the staff or the legislation to carry out anything more than a random sample. Those things stand out like a sore thumb. Deputy Foley, as outgoing chairman of the Commitee of Public Accounts, and other members of that commitee know that every Government Department on which the Comptroller and Auditor General reports can give examples like this no matter who is in Government.  What would the position be if the Comptroller and Auditor General had the power and the facility to pursue indepth auditing within Government Departments or to carry out value for money audits?</P>
    <P>If the State contracts to buy two ships for £10 million and only buys one ship for £12 million the Comptroller and Auditor General can only bring this fact to the attention of the committee.  He cannot say whether or not the ship was worth £12 million.  It might have been worth only £500,000, £1 million or £3 million. He does not have the power to say whether it was value for money.  We are being pilloried morning, noon and night by all our constituents because of the high rate of VAT, PAYE and everything else to pay for public expenditure.  We cut public expenditure by cutting the amounts available in each of the supply services.  It is time we started thinking in terms of value for taxpayer's punts.  The House will accept that you do not spend other people's money as carefully as you spend your own.  If you happen to be in <Col N="2153" /> a position where you are spending large sums of money, perhaps up to £15,000 million of taxpayers' money, you will not be as careful as you would be when spending your own money.  The audit function is essential and should be considered.  It would be of great benefit to the House, the public finances and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In table 4 of the Principle Features of the Budget circulated by the Minister there is a heading: How Current Expenditure Will Be Allocated and Financed in 1987.  On one side it shows how current expenditure will be financed.  It includes borrowing, customs and excise duties, capital taxes, stamp duties, income tax, corporation tax, VAT and so on.  It shows a total income of £8,417 million.  On the other side it shows a gross expenditure throughout the Departments of £9,923 million.  Deducted from that are supply services receipts amounting to £1,506 million.  They are the same as appropriations-in-aid which are received by each Government Department.  For instance, if the Department of Forestry sell a State forest or a Government Department sell a piece of machinery or a service, the income which goes directly to the Department is an appropriation-in-aid, a supply services receipt, and is deducted from the departmental Estimate. Only the net Estimates for that Department are brought before the House.</P>
    <P>The total amount received by Departments is £1,506 million.  It is greater than the borrowing for 1987 which is estimated at £1,200 million.  It is greater than the excise duties for the entire year estimated at £1,449 million.  It is about 60 per cent of the entire receipts from income tax, £2,722 million.  It is almost equal to what we get in value-added tax for the year at £1,631 million.  Yet it is simply included as a deduction on the expenditure side rather than having a heading on its own on the receipt side, which it should have. We should examine that area as a possible revenue earner.  Who checks whether this £1,506 million income to these Departments represents value for money?  Who checks whether whatever services or products are given in return for those <Col N="2154" /> receipts, perhaps it is licences in some cases, are value for money?  It does not indicate that supply services receipts are taken seriously when they are simply inserted as a deduction on the expenditure side rather than a receipt on the receipt side where they can be compared annually as a percentage of the total expenditure as are customs and excise duties, capital taxes, income tax, corporation tax and VAT.  That should be done.  There may be an opportunity to raise funds for the State in this area where I suspect there is undercharging at present and the State probably does not get value for money.</P>
    <P>As spokesman on urban renewal I will have more than a passing interest in the Department of the Environment in the coming year or two.  The revised Estimate for that Department for this year is over £865 million.  A provision of £100 million was made by the outgoing Government for special amenity projects.  Most of that has been suspended in the Dublin area. That is being very shortsighted.  We are abolishing grants which have a great employment potential in order to bring forward social welfare payments and in order to refund land tax.  It is a very worthy objective to bring forward social welfare payments.  I am sure every Member of the House is sorry that we cannot bring them forward to 1 April. About £2,200 million is spent by the Department of Social Welfare, the biggest spending Department of the State by far.  There can be little doubt that there is wasteful spending in that Department. Would it not be possible for the Comptroller and Auditor General to look at the duplication and replication in that Department and to cut out the wasteful spending.  Then let us give an increase to those who are in need of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Some people in receipt of social welfare do very badly.  For instance, single men or women living alone on unemployment assistance do extremely badly because it is very hard to live on £37 or £38 a week and pay for food, light and heat.  I would like it if we could give these people increases and the way to do that would be to cut out the wasteful expenditure <Col N="2155" /> in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There is a lot said about unmarried mothers.  In the age we are living in there are very few families, in the extended family sense, who do not have some knowledge or association with this trend. There is a great tolerance in society for these people, but where there are five, six, seven, eight or nine children, should we not be asking ourselves where are these unmarried fathers?  What are their responsibilities to these children?  They simply walk away from them.  We should look at unmarried fathers and see what their responsibilities are.  Does anybody ask these men if they are willing to make a contribution to the upkeep of these children?  Surely these men do not think they can walk away from their responsibilities and have the hard pressed taxpayers &mdash; who have children to rear, mortgages to pay, and who are finding it hard to make ends meet &mdash; pay taxes to fund the unmarried fathers' responsibilities? Some thought should be given to the role of unmarried fathers.  If people know they will be pursued for maintenance, many of them will be much more responsible.  Members of this House will have sympathy for people who are in difficulties, but we should be looking at the responsibility of unmarried fathers. This is an area on which we should get some statistics.</P>
    <P>If we were to find savings in the area of social welfare by cutting out wasteful spending, we could then continue to fund the special amenity projects which have been suspended.  We could continue with the home improvements grants for which £100 million was provided in the Estimates by the outgoing Government. These projects give grants to people who get work done by registered employers, who have their tax liabilities up to date, and who give employment.  It is ironic that at a time when there are 250,000 people unemployed we are taking funds out of an area which creates employment to spend in an area which does not help employment.  This is another area which needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> I note that the provision in the Estimates for travelling people is not greatly increased.  We have many forms of apartheid operating within our community, one being the employed <i>versus</i> the unemployed. There are 250,000 people on the public service payroll who have no rights, who have been priced out of their jobs because the employers cannot afford the increases which have been granted, and who have no work and no future.  Travelling people are another group who suffer from a form of apartheid.  The travelling people should be treated as adults. They have to take responsibility for themselves. There are indications that in some areas they do not do that.  This question needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>This is a small country with a population of 3.5 million.  There are enough people in this House to know exactly what the problems are.  We should have a parliamentary policy on the travelling people.  Many of them want to be settled and in some cases they want temporary settlement on halting sites but local communities will not have them.  Each of us comes under pressure when there is any question of settling travelling people in our constituencies.  We must have a fair, reasonable and reasoned policy on the travelling people.  Their rights and responsibilities need to be defined, set down and implemented but just as firmly we must define the rights and responsibilities of the settled community, once Parliament makes up its mind on what is fair and reasonable.  This is an area to which we should address our attention.</P>
    <P>If we look at our capital city we see a great deal of urban blight &mdash; City Quay, Clanbrassil Street, Mountjoy Square and so on.  This is not a party political issue or a controversial issue.  It is not an issue about which Fianna Fáil know more than Fine Gael.  It is not an issue on which the left or the right can take greatly differing stances on an economic basis, but it is an issue which has not been addressed on a cross-party basis.  A great deal of research has been done on the need for environmental improvements, particularly by An Foras Forbartha but very little has been done of a formal nature, and certainly <Col N="2157" /> not by this House, on urban renewal. Any money spent on urban renewal could be recouped by what we could save on the Department of Justice Estimate &mdash; on crime and vandalism &mdash; because when people see blighted sites they presume nobody owns them and they vandalise them.  We have a duty to have a policy on urban renewal which will rule out blight in our cities.  I believe this could be funded also by increased tourism.  The city of Dublin, as well as other beautiful cities such as Cork and Limerick, could be made a great tourist attraction if a little money was provided.  What about water cascades on the River Liffey or the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal, which are greatly underused?  What about the use of proper public lighting?  A great deal of expenditure would not be needed to carry out improvements in these areas and there is even the possibility that they might be self-financing through increased numbers of tourists.</P>
    <P>As regards wider urban renewal policy, what this House needs is a committee of the House.  I honestly believe the committees in the last Dáil worked extremely well.  The Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, the sub-committee on motor insurance costs, the Committee of Public Accounts, the Committee on Public Expenditure and the Committee on Marital Breakdown all did a very good job.  I want to see these committees resurrected, but I particularly want a committee of the House on urban renewal.  As I said, I do not see this as a controversial issue, and I do not think it will cause any problems across party lines.  It need not necessarily cost a lot of money but it could be funded by a reduction in crime and vandalism and an increase in tourism.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few concluding points on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  We must look at the question of local government audits.  The larger committees of the local authorities should be encouraged to appoint public accounts committees or finance committees to review, at an early date after the end of the financial year &mdash; I am not talking about one or two years later &mdash; the <Col N="2158" /> report of the local government auditor on the audit of the previous 12 months expenditure.  That would be very useful and worthwhile.  Local government audit reports should be sent to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Further reform in the area of local government administration and representation is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I do not know the present status of Dublin County Council.  Are the three local authorities which were meant to come out of that in full swing?  I suspect they are not.  Some local authorities, particularly in the Dublin region, have become unwieldy.  Dublin Corporation have 52 members; they are turning into a mini-parliament who debate everything and get nothing done.  Increasingly they are a political forum, although individual councillors do a lot for their constituents on a macro basis.  However, councillors spend very little time concentrating on or debating policies for, say, Dublin city, the one with which I am most familiar.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, there are electoral areas of four councillors and it should be possible to cede statutory committee status to them, to have them serviced by an official of the city or county council with whom they work and to allow them, in turn, to give statutory rights of consultation to registered bodies such as local residents' associations so that there would be a working, local democracy on issues.  That is not the case at present although the outgoing Government promised a second Bill on reorganisation of local government. That is long overdue and I hope the Government will introduce proposals in this regard as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope we will find it possible to carry out a tighter audit of public finances because it is a very worthy objective.  I also hope that the incoming Committee of Public Accounts will soon be appointed so that they can get on with their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget and I congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Government on facing up to the serious issues facing the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will give a new sense of <Col N="2159" /> direction to the economy and I am pleased that this is the first priority.  One must accept that conditions are extremely difficult.  People were worried over the past four years because the economy was on a downward trend.  They did not have confidence in legislators to stop this trend.  However, the stand taken by the Government in the budget has instilled confidence as the message is simple &mdash; the Government will deliver and are prepared to take whatever steps are needed to right the finances of the State, which have been in disarray for many years. The cost of servicing the national debt must be tackled.  The pre-Christmas report of the National Economic and Social Council states very clearly that, unless the balances in the public finances are resolved, we will face a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>This budget lays down a framework and plan and indicates the road we must take.  It has set very ambitious targets and if they succeed, which I believe they can, it could be the start of an uplift in the economy.  If this is to happen, interest rates must fall shortly and the first to benefit from this will be the Government and the business sector.</P>
    <P>Another factor which is catered for in the budget is to contain the level of public expenditure and to reduce our dependence on borrowing.  The Government are taking courageous and radical meassures to encourage and foster economic growth and recovery.  In this way they have shown that they are taking essential steps to create jobs, which has not been the case over the past four years.  One can see that the budget contains a range of measures designed to confront our greatest challenge, unemployment.  This will provide the basis for recovery which, I hope, will create more jobs.  If these measures are to succeed, our priority must be to restore confidence in the economy and I am satisfied that the budget will do this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement of the job search programme to assist the long term unemployed in their efforts to seek training and employment.  This will <Col N="2160" /> involve the National Manpower Service and AnCO and is the response needed to provide assistance to the long term unemployed, many of whom have been out of work for many years.  Over 80 per cent of those on the register have been unemployed for more than 12 months.  I hope the agencies involved will complete the interviews as soon as possible and, in so doing, restore confidence to the unemployed by advising them as to what is available.  I also hope that these interviews will not be rushed and that people will be given a certain amount of encouragement. I understand that 29 programmes in different ranges of schemes are available, not all straightforward, and it is in this respect that the interviewers will be helpful.  Over 40,000 National Manpower Service scheme opportunities have been earmarked for unemployed people.  In addition, 12,000 job search places will be made available during the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>During the recent election campaign and long before that, it was brought home to me by many unemployed people that they felt let down by many agencies.  The proposals in the budget will redress that situation and will restore confidence to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available in October 1986 show that more than 100,000 persons were unemployed for more than 12 months.  Four years previously, in October 1982, the figure was 49,418, which means that the figure has doubled.  Long term, unemployed married people with families have many domestic and social problems but they have now been given a ray of hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The national lottery launched within the past few weeks is proving very successful as a revenue earning operation.  I should like to see a percentage of this funding made available to many sporting organisations and I understand that this will be the case.  I am referring in particular to the Cappenlea outdoor education centre in Kerry which may be forced to close within the next few weeks due to lack of funding.  Ten people are employed in this centre, including a manager, eight instructors and a caretaker. <Col N="2161" /> They work as a team and each of them puts in many hours outside their normal times.  The overall cost of running this centre is just under £100,000.  Revenue at the centre in 1985 amounted to £20,000.  In 1986 it was £30,000 and the target for 1987 is £40,000, which they are confident of achieving.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the centre worked for 8,500 hours broken down as follows: school usage accounted for 52 per cent, youth groups accounted for 32 per cent and the adult groups accounted for 16 per cent. This involved a total of 4,590 people utilising the centre in 1986.  A feature of the centre is the number of youth clubs from the North taking part in courses and I am sure it has helped to cement relationships on a North-South basis. Prior to Christmas, Cappanalea had received a commitment from Cospóir for £60,000.  This had the approval of the then Coalition Government but that has now been withdrawn.  For this reason, I would like to see a commitment given for national lottery assistance for this worthwhile project.  I would also like to see local authorities in future years benefit as a result of the national lottery and in so doing becoming involved at local level in the administration of the lottery.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision and commitment for housing in the budget for the current year of £386 million compared with £382 million in 1986.  Under the present financial constraints, this is a very positive commitment.  The budget also confirms the Government's commitment to the weaker sections of our community by bringing forward the social welfare increases from November to July.  The refusal of the Government to levy prescription charges and the restoration of career guidance teachers is in direct contrast with the anti-social features of the Fine Gael budget.</P>
    <P>The Government have set the pattern by cutting public expenditure.  They have deferred pay increases for Minister's, TD's, judges, and top civil servants.  This sets the climate where they can ask those in sound, secure, pensionable employment to accept a pay pause.  The move against the ESB and the pig meat factories <Col N="2162" /> has resulted in the payment of £22 million which was owed to the Exchequer.  It is also an indication to other defaulters that this Government mean business.  <i>The Irish Times</i> poll published this week showing that 57 per cent of voters accepted that the budget is good for the country even though they expect their standards to fall confirms that the Government are on the right course.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in tourism. As I see it, the greatest potential and the easiest way forward for creating employment is through tourism.  This can be done at very little cost in comparison to industrial development, tourism of its nature being spread throughout the country. The small units would in future be less likely to lose through economic pressures and would be more likely to survive. The economic and employment base of tourism is more even and of a more permanent nature in comparison to heavy industry.  Tourism is practically 100 per cent dependent on home-produced raw material with a high level of labour-added value.</P>
    <P>The most disappointing feature of tourism at present is the lack of marketing by Bord Fáilte.  I hope the Government will bring it home to Bord Fáilte that the No. 1 priority as far as tourism is concerned is marketing.  Tourism has got to be developed in a natural way, thus helping the local environment.  The amenities and facilities provided benefit both the local people and the visitors.  We already have a number of natural products which in many countries are at a premium, mainly beaches, water sports, golf, fishing and the areas rich in culture.  We have some of the top championship golf courses in the world which could not survive without the tourism contribution but yet are much used and appreciated by many local people.  In the same way, our culture in general and entertainment, including the entertainers, can derive support and a direct contribution from the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>I suggest that with very little help and effort the tourism industry could eliminate the job losses which already have been created.  This should automatically <Col N="2163" /> reduce our unemployment and the industry would then be set for growth, creating new jobs. In the short term, it would be the quickest and most effective method of solving the unemployment problem. Therefore, with our own efforts, given a little extra help from the Government and tourism interests, such as Bord Fáilte, great potential lies in the tourist industry.  I was disappointed to hear that Bord Fáilte have indicated to the regional boards that there are going to be substantial cutbacks this year, in some cases up to 30 per cent or 40 per cent.  This cannot be accepted.  I appeal to the Government to increase the funding.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the point made by Deputy Mitchell in relation to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I agree with his sentiments. There is no doubt that updating the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General is long overdue.  As a member of that committee for the past six years and as chairman for the last four, many problems with various offices were brought to our notice and all the Comptroller and Auditor General could do was to bring those problems to our notice.  For this reason, these powers have to be updated, as does the legislation. Deputy Mitchell mentioned the current position in Canada where they have the most advanced type of auditing, especially value for money auditing. Any savings made through this particular office would be worth while.  At this stage, I would like to congratulate Mr. P. L. McDonnell, the Comptroller and Auditor General, on the tremendous work he and his staff have been doing over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied and so are many people outside this House that this budget is the first step along the road to national recovery.  It is also appreciated that strong decisions had to be taken and it was further accepted that there are no instant solutions to the many problems facing the country.  Only good can come out of this budget as it opens up new avenues for growth which will lead to job <Col N="2164" /> creation and create a climate of confidence which will encourage a return of capital into the country.  Co-operation all around is the keynote to the success of the budget.</P>

      <P>I did not come into the House prepared but nevertheless I listened with interest to what has been said.  There has been a wide-ranging discussion on the budget.  I am totally dismayed and disappointed by the budget. It offers no hope to the people we all claim to be concerned about, the young people of this country.  In one fell swoop it has abolished the house improvement grants and the new house grant which gave so much hope to young people to either improve an old house or to build a new one.  It also failed to offer any hope in the employment sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the speakers on the far side.  I was totally disillusioned until the previous speaker, Deputy Foley, mentioned that he saw some hope in the remarks made by Deputy Mitchell in regard to the allocations for the tourist board.  He acknowledged that the cutbacks were far from acceptable.  Therefore, there is some ray of hope that the message is getting across to the backbenchers on the Government side that there is total dismay among the public. When we come back after the Easter recess, I hope the message which they seem to have been shielded from, that the people are frustrated, angry and disillusioned at the turn-about which has taken place as regards the promises which <Col N="2165" /> were given by the party now in Government during the election campaign, will have sunk in.  It is not good to promise the people something and when elected to Government to break that promise. What has happened will not enhance our political system because people take a poor view of broken promises.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to pay headage grants in the newly designated areas because they are of vital importance to the farming community.  He should reintroduce the £5,000 installation grant for young farmers.  That grant proved of great assistance to young farmers who were taking over a holding from their parents.  Many young men are anxious to purchase land from their fathers but they cannot afford to do so since the £5,000 grant was abolished.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Government backbenchers when they return to their constituencies will discover that the people are angry at the health cuts and at the decision to introduce a £10 charge for hospital stay.  That is a savage charge and it does not take into consideration the ability of people to pay.  The Government should accept the proposal by Fine Gael to introduce a prescription charge which would be a better way to raise money.  I accept there is a need to raise money and to eliminate abuses but the £10 charge is not the way to do that.  The prescription charge would have eliminated a lot of abuses.  Some people abused that system because they did not have to make a contribution.  Many people would have second thoughts if they had to pay £1 for each prescription.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance.  Members opposite may disagree with certain elements of the budget but they must remember that the <Col N="2166" /> public accept that such a budget was necessary as a foundation stone to right the wrongs imposed on the economy in recent years.  There is a general acceptance by most parties in the House that the Minister for Finance took the only action open to him if the country was to achieve economic development on the scale necessary to improve conditions here.  It is important that members of political parties, the social partners and the community work together to achieve economic development.</P>
    <P>Many of us do not accept the results of opinion polls because of the small number of people interviewed but it was gratifying for the Government, and those who support the budget, to discover that according to the opinion poll published yesterday a majority of those interviewed accept that the action taken by the Minister for Finance was correct.  I doubt if that occurred before.  It may be said that polls were not conducted to test public reaction to a previous budget but what we learned from yesterday's poll was that the people accept the direction outlined in the budget.</P>
    <P>For too long we have had programmes, plans, building and rebuilding, ways forward and proposals contained in many other documents but in the budget the Government took the necessary decisions to deal with the economic state of the country.  The budget is the way to steer the ship of State to recovery.  Certain areas of it are highlighted by different groups and described as severe but I respectfully ask those groups, or individuals, to accept the temporary discomfort or displeasure in the interest of the common good.  Ireland and its people are a corporate body and we are being given an opportunity to ensure that we do not allow our sectional or personal interests to interfere with the development of our economy.  We should not have individuals or groups applying pressure.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, there can be no going back from this budget; from now on we will be moving forward.  The important thing for that movement forward <Col N="2167" /> is that we should move together. Nobody should contemplate doing anything that will move us off the course that has been chartered by the Minister for Finance.  I propose to enumerate the different areas of budgetary control and so on but I do not propose to indicate one as a priority over another.  It would be inconsistent to embark on such a course.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter which is a very important one for the area concerned.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in to deal with it and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment. This is his first official duty in the House.</P>
      <P>Drung national school is situated about midway between the towns of Cavan and Cootehill.  There are 92 pupils on the roll at present.  The building is a pre-fabricated structure which is in a deplorable state.  It is positively dangerous for the pupils as I will prove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as the sixties the need for a new school in this area was conceded as being extremely urgent.  In March 1969 <Col N="2168" /> the present pre-fabricated structure was declared open.  After a few years this structure began to show signs of wearing down and giving trouble.  In May 1980 the Department recognised that the only way to solve this problem was to build a conventional type school there.  In 1980 approval was given in principle for a new school in Drung but the road has been both rocky and difficult for the committee of management.</P>
    <P>The committee of management have behaved impeccably all along and have done everything required of them in the manner in which it should have been done.  They got approval from the Office of Public Works for a site which was available.  They set about acquiring the site but ran into legal difficulties which took some time to sort out.  When the legal difficulties were dealt with they applied for planning permission.  The planning permission was refused by the county council and on the advice of the Office of Public Works the committee appealed that decision.  An Bord Pleanála upheld the decision of the county council and the refusal was confirmed.  The management committee, again acting on the advice of the Office of Public Works, proceeded to acquire a new site.  Again it took some time to deal with the formalities and on this occasion planning permission was granted.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the pre-fabricated schoolrooms had deteriorated further and a parents committee did everything they could to encourage and expedite the building of a new school.  In the years between 1980 and 1984 the prefabricated building had become extremely unsuitable as a school.  I can summarise it by saying that the structure was attacked by the rains from overhead and the rats from beneath.  It had become a rat infested building to such an extent that the teachers could not leave any thing edible or destructible in the building overnight and had to take such things home.  The parents' committee and the board of management did everything they could to get the matter expedited in the Department of Education and the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> The matter was raised here by the present Minister for Communications, Deputy Wilson, on the Adjournment of this House on 30 October 1986.  As I want to give some of my time to Deputy Boylan, I will not take up the time of the House, by reading the account of that Adjournment debate, but let me give credit to Deputy Wilson and say that he made a very strong case, having visited the school and seen for himself.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Education was Deputy Enda Kenny, and when Deputy Wilson concluded his case Deputy Kenny said, as reported at column 1132 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Wilson and to the Ceann Comhairle that I am very sympathetic to the plea of building the new national school at Drung as soon as is humanly possible.  The very poor accommodation there has been adequately documented and certainly gives rise to justified fears and concerns on the part of the parents.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that Deputy Kenny met a deputation after which he acted and acted quickly.  Tenders were invited in December 1986 and the closing date for receiving them was 31 January 1987.  Tenders came in and I understand that satisfactory tenders are available but no satisfactory evidence has been produced to the people of the locality who are so concerned that the building will start.</P>
    <P>Since then two extraordinary things have happened.  An accidental fire occurred in the school about a month ago.  I am told it was caused by a faulty electrical wire or switch and that the down rain had something to do with the igniting of the wire which caused the fire. Happily, no personal injuries were caused, but great general injury or even death could have been caused.  In desperation since then the parents' committee have withdrawn their children, not fully but for three days each week for the past two weeks.  Deputy Wilson said he does not approve of strikes in schools.  I do not approve of strikes at all but schools are the last places where strikes should take place.  Those two extraordinary <Col N="2170" /> things have happened since this matter was raised previously.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister for Education not very long ago.  When I heard about this fire I was approached and I wrote to the Minister on 25 March acquainting her of the position and asking her for an assurance that the building would go on. I regret to say that I did not get an acknowledgment.  I am sure she has been quite busy, but this is an urgent and important matter.  Now I want the Minister of State at the Department of Education to tell me that he has already accepted a tender and is entering into a contract.  If he cannot tell me that, I want him to give an assurance that that will be done immediately.  Since the budget came in and with all the talk about further cutbacks of millions of pounds in the Department of Education the parents in this locality are very worried and annoyed.  They are entitled to have the matter clarified before the Easter recess. That is what I want the Minister to do today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague here in thanking you, Sir, for giving us the opportunity to raise this very serious problem in the House, and I thank the Minister of State for coming in here to listen to our case.  Starting out as a new Deputy I do not intend to raise trivial matters in the House, but this is a serious matter that will have to be dealt with immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a school of 97 children and the parents are concerned.  This is a rural community who are seeking nothing more or less than their rights.  They have acted with great responsibility and restraint.  This has been an ongoing saga for the past nine years.  We have a school that is totally unsuitable healthwise.  I believe that if a health inspector called out to this school it would be condemned as unsuitable for human habitation. There is no question about that because, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out rightly, the rains pour in.  There was a <Col N="2171" /> time when a few basins around the schoolrooms caught the rain water.  That does not happen anymore.  Rats have invaded the place and I am not exaggerating when I say that the parents of some of the children suggested that cats be brought in to keep the rats away. When this was done, believe it or not, the cats ran away with fear because the rats are as large as the cats.  Those are facts which are hard to believe in 1987.</P>
    <P>For that reason the parents have decided on a course of action that they do not want to pursue, of taking their children out of that school on three days a week.  This is the parents' last resort.  I want to make it clear that the teachers are in attendance on the five days.  Every other effort has failed.  The parents have written and sought that deputations be received.  They want Deputy Fitzpatrick and me to bring away from here today a clear message from the Minister that a tender has been accepted and that work will commence.  If they can be guaranteed that work will start on the new school immediately those children will be sent back and will put up with those conditions for a further six or eight months. However, those parents believe that if the matter drags on and work does not start soon, we will be into a further winter of annoyance and nuisance and a school that cannot be properly heated under those conditions.  That is why I felt it important to stay here this evening to put this matter before the House.</P>
    <P>Again, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I beg the Minister not to put the matter on the long finger any more. It has been there for long enough.  The parents and teachers are concerned. They are a community seeking nothing more nor less than their rights.  I hope the Minister of State will have a good message for us to bring back to the people of Drung this evening.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Boylan and you, Sir, for your good wishes and I hope that I can perform as well in this task as my predecessors have done, including your good self.  I would be happy with my performance if it should be like that.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the serious situation that exists with regard to Drung national school and I would like to thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for bringing it to the attention of the House.  There is a long history with regard to this school commencing with the formal application for grant aid for the erection of a new three-teacher school building at Drung, County Cavan, which came to my Department in May 1980.  In October of that year my colleague, Deputy Wilson, then Minister for Education, gave approval in principle to the chairman for the replacement of the existing prefabricated classrooms.  The question arose, however, of the provision by the school authorities of a site for the new building.  The school authorities had indicated that a site was available and this was subsequently inspected by the Commissioners of Public Works who indicated that a plot of about three acres was on offer from the school authorities, of which one and a half acres could be made available for school use.  Towards the end of 1981 a specific one and a half acre portion of the three acre field was chosen as suitable for school building and the preparation of preliminary drawings was commenced by the commissioners' architectural staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile it was necessary for my Department to enter into correspondence with the school authorities to establish that the title to the site for the proposed new school was satisfactory. This was done early in 1982. It transpired in July 1982 that the title furnished was not satisfactory and correspondence between the solicitors concerned ensued.  It was not until November 1982 that my Department received a certificate from the Chief State Solicitor that the title question had been satisfactorily resolved and this opened the way for the further stages of architectural planning <Col N="2173" /> under the rules for national schools to be put in train.</P>
    <P>My Department then wrote to the school chairman indicating their approval for the sketch plans for the projected new school and furnishing cost estimates with a view to reaching agreement on a satisfactory level of local contribution.  Agreement on the local contribution issue was reached by December 1982, when my Department formally sanctioned a grant for the project.</P>
    <P>On my Department's instruction, the Commissioners of Public Works then commenced the planning of the project in detail.  During the course of 1983, however, the commissioners reported that difficulties had been encountered by the school authorities in relation to local authority planning permission and these difficulties came to a head in November 1984 when the commissioners reported to my Department that a fresh site had had to be chosen.  That, in turn, necessitated a fresh title investigation by the Chief State Solicitor.  My Department in October, 1984, were advised by the Chief State Solicitor that he had received sufficient assurances as to the title to the new site.  This, again, opened the way for the architectural planning process on the main school project to be resumed.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, my Department, in response to reports on the condition of the existing school building, indicated to the school authorities that they were prepared to sanction a substantial grant towards the replacement of some of the prefabricated classrooms pending the construction of the new school.  In the event, this offer was declined and the school indicated that it would prefer to make do with the improvement of the existing accommodation.  My Department subsequently sanctioned a fresh grant for improvements and some work has been done in that regard.  It is, of course, accepted that the school agreed to this measure in the interests of saving what they considered to be necessary expenditure and of expediting the allocation of capital for the new school project.</P>
    <P>The new school project has now <Col N="2174" /> reached the stage where tenders have been invited and received in the Department. The examination of the tenders is proceeding satisfactorily and I have asked that the examination be concluded at the earliest possible date.  I might add that there had been some delay with regard to the examination of tenders because of the fact that some tenders had been found not to be satisfactory.  The local contribution will then be collected from the school authorities and arrangements will be made for the placing of a contract.</P>
    <P>All those delays which took place between 1980 and the end of 1986 were not caused by the Department of Education. It is clear from what I have said that many of those delays were as a result of difficulties with regard to the site to be used, with regard to the title to the site and planning permission for the site.  A number of changes has been necessary and, consequently, that has caused the delay which we all accept has been far too long.  However, I would emphasise that those delays were mainly due to site difficulties.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the recent fire raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick, my Department were not formally notified of the recent fire at the school. However, my Department's officials have been recently in communication with the chairman of the Board of Management concerning the fire and he has informed them that, having got the services of the fire officer and a qualified electrician, he is now satisfied that the electrical system at the school is satisfactory. I hope the parents will see fit to have the children in school on a full time basis.  The chairman informs us that he has also had repairs carried out to the roof of the school building.  Notwithstanding that I have given instructions that a technical officer of my Department should visit the school without delay and report on its present condition and I will communicate with the Deputy when his report is to hand.</P>
    <P>I accept that a delay has been caused but I am quite satisfied that there has been no delay since the deputation met with my predecessor, Deputy Kenny. <Col N="2175" /> Tenders were sought immediately.  They were requested to be returned in the minimum possible time.  Consideration of those tenders has received the full attention of the officers concerned in my Department.  Examination of the tenders is proceeding with the utmost urgency and we hope to have that examination concluded at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in regard to the fire it is a case of once bitten, twice shy?  Will he agree it would be difficult to persuade the parents to run the risk in the school having regard to that fire?  Does the Minister also appreciate that the local contribution is available and can be sent immediately he says he wants it?  Will he give the same assurance regarding the balance of the money?  Can he tell the parents of Drung that the money necessary to build the school, over and above the local contribution, is available in his Department and that the contracts will be checked?  This is going on now since 1 February.  Will he put a date on it?  Above all, will he give an assurance that the money is there and that there is no question of putting the matter on the long finger?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that the money is there to commence the project just as soon as consideration of the tenders has been concluded.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that at such a vital time, when consideration of the tenders is having final attention, it is absolutely important that this job be done properly.  Progress is not at all slow, seeing that the tenders have been in the Department for little over a month.  There have been difficulties, in that some of the first tenders which would have got the job did not meet the Department's requirements. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be foolhardy of the Department and would be probably the cause of much more serious delays were we to take any snap decisions which would cause this <Col N="2176" /> project to be delayed during the construction stages.  It is vital that we have a careful examination of those tenders and when we make our final decision, which I can safely say will be in the very near future, that we will make the correct decision.  The officials are proceeding with consideration of the tenders as a matter of urgency.  I cannot give an exact date, but certainly would hope that in the near future we would be able to proceed with the placing of a contract.  I want to reassure the Deputies concerned that the money has been made available by my Government so that this project can commence.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to county council pension, the taxpayer is in receipt of a social welfare widow's pension.  This pension is paid gross and it is standard practice to collect the tax attributable to it by restricting the tax-free allowances under PAYE by the amount of that pension.</P>
      <P>The estimated restriction in respect of the social welfare pension which was taken into account in the taxpayer's certificate of tax-free allowance for 1987-88, has been found to be excessive.  An amended certificate incorporating the correct restriction, by reference to this year's budget proposals, will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.  This will result in a higher allowance being available for use against the taxpayer's local authority pension.  Any tax over-deducted from that pension since 6 April 1987 will be refunded by the county council on operation of the amended certificate.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of invalidity pension from 21 June 1984.  Up to 28 May 1986 he was paid invalidity pension at the rate appropriate to a married man with two qualified children.  The daughter of the person concerned was committed to prison on 9 May 1986.  As an increase of pension is not payable in respect of a person serving a prison sentence the rate of pension of the person concerned was reduced accordingly. The person concerned notified the Department on 7 January 1987 that his daughter had been released from prison but did not give the exact date of release. On her release she spent some time in England.</P>
      <P>An inspector of the Department called on the person concerned to determine the definite date she resumed residence in the household.  This information was not made available and the inspector has been requested to call again.</P>
      <P>When this information is received any arrears of pension that may be due will be paid without delay.  Any increase of pension in respect of this child may only be paid to 11 March 1987 when she reached the age of 18.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the equality provisions on 20 November 1986, the person concerned is being paid invalidity pension at the rate of £67.60 that is £47.10 personal rate; £10.50 in respect of one qualified child and a transitional alleviating payment of £10.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has now indicated to the Department that his wife has not been earning in excess of £50 per week.  He has been requested to return his £10 pension book in order that the full adult dependant allowance can be restored to him from 20 November 1986.</P>

      <P>This is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The board have informed me that they accept that improved accommodation for the ambulance station at Wexford General Hospital is necessary.  However, this is only one item among many other competing demands which the board is considering in the light of the financial resources available.</P>
