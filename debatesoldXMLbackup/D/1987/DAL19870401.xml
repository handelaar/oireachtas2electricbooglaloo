      <P>Before I make this announcement I should like to assure the House that it is purely of a technical nature.</P>
      <P>I beg leave to announce, for the information of the Dáil:</P>
      <P>(1)  that the Government, on 31 March 1987 made Orders:</P>
      <P>(a)  transferring to the Minister for the Marine and the Department of the Marine, respectively, ministerial functions and departmental administration in relation to the Marine &mdash; not including B &amp; I &mdash; from the Minister for Communications and the Department of Communications;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  transferring to the Minister <Col N="946" /> for Tourism and Transport and to the Department of Tourism and Transport, respectively, ministerial functions and departmental administration in relation to non-marine transport functions &mdash; but including B &amp; I &mdash; from the Minister for Communications and the Department of Communications;</P>
    <P>(c)  transferring to the Minister for the Marine and to the Department of the Marine, respectively, ministerial functions and departmental administration in relation to Arramara Teoranta from the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Department of the Gaeltacht;</P>
    <P>(d)  transferring to the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Department of Tourism and Transport, respectively, ministerial functions and departmental administration in relation to the traffic development activities &mdash; tourism and aviation activities &mdash; of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Department of Industry and Commerce;</P>
    <P>(e)  transferring to the Minister for Tourism and Transport and to the Department of Tourism and Transport, respectively, ministerial functions and departmental administration in relation to tourism from the Minister for the Marine and the Department of the Marine;</P>
    <P>(f)  transferring to the Minister for Energy and to the Department of Energy, respectively, ministerial functions and departmental administration in relation to forestry and wildlife from the Minister for the Marine and the Department of the Marine; and</P>
    <P>(g)  altering the name and title of the Minister for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, respectively, to Minister for Agriculture <Col N="947" /> and Food and Department of Agriculture and Food;</P>
    <P>(2)  that, on 31 March 1987 in exercise of the powers conferred on me by section (4) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1946, I</P>
    <P>(a)  terminated the assignment of the Department of Tourism and Transport to Deputy Ray Mac-Sharry and assigned that Department to Deputy John P. Wilson with effect from that date; and</P>
    <P>(b)  terminated the assignment of the Department of Communications to Deputy John P. Wilson and assigned that Department to Deputy Ray Burke with effect from that date;</P>
    <P>(3)  that, on the same date, I accepted the resignations of Deputy Michael Smith and Deputy Denis Lyons from office as Ministers of State at the Department of the Marine; and</P>
    <P>(4)  that, on the same date, the Government appointed Deputy Michael Smith to be Minister of State at the Department of Energy, with special responsibility for forestry, and Deputy Denis Lyons to be Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, with special responsibility for tourism.</P>
    <P>I realise that these may sound a bit confusing.  I am sure, Sir, that with your permission if any Member of the Dáil should wish to advert to them, discuss them or criticise them in any way it could be done during the budget debate perhaps.</P>

      <P>It is not agreed.  At this stage I wish to inform the Taoiseach that we are not agreeing to the Order of Business because we object to the manner in which it is proposed to conduct the business of the House today.  The proposal to take all Stages of the Bill is outrageous, as I informed the Taoiseach yesterday.  We are proposing to make fundamental changes to the Health Act, 1970, and I believe that in doing so we should give the House an opportunity to debate the matter fully.  Not only am I confident that many Members of the Opposition would wish to speak on fundamental changes in health policy but I assume that many Deputies supporting the Government would want to make a contribution in relation to the Health Act.  It appears that only one speaker from each party will have an opportunity to speak.  Perhaps some will not get the opportunity to speak.  Consequently, we are objecting.  There are major changes to be made in relation to health regulations and contributions and health charges coupled with substantial reductions in the Health Estimates.  On that basis the House should have the opportunity to discuss these in greater detail.  It is just not good enough that a Bill which was circulated last night is to be put through the House in a very short period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support <Col N="950" /> Deputy Spring.  We, also have expressed our disagreement with the Order of Business as set out for today and in particular with the three and a half hours to deal with the major change in the health charges. While there is an increased contribution, there are reduced services. Three and a half hours is totally inadequate for this House to discuss such a major change, one that will have such effects on people's lives.  We already expressed our disagreement but the Order of Business still shows that this must be dealt with between 7 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. this evening.  We cannot understand why all the time from 5 p.m. on Thursday until the following Tuesday is for some reason sacrosanct and cannot be used for the purposes of debate.  There is ample time tomorrow and Friday for discussion if the time is given.  We have asked that the time available for debate be extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the difficulties which Deputy Spring and Deputy Mac Giolla have in this regard. However, I feel there is no alternative but to proceed as we suggest.  The whole process of the budget and the administration are up against deadlines.  It is now 1 April and this legislation must go through immediately if we are to adhere to our budgetary arithmetic.  All I can suggest by way of alleviation is that in the budget debate Deputies will of course have full and complete opportunities to discuss all these proposals and this legislation.</P>

In <Col N="951" /> respect of the question that Nos. 5 and 6 be taken together for the purposes of debate and shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Health, can I ask the House if that is agreed?  Agreed.  In regard to the latter section of the proposal, that proceedings on all stages of No. 3 shall commence not later than 7 p.m. and shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 10.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Health, is that agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if he has any comment to make on the very distinct possibility that one of his budgetary actions yesterday will see this country being brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities?  I refer specifically to the measures he has taken in relation to travellers' allowances. Since there is a doubt over that and, therefore, there must be a doubt over the revenue that will come from it, is there any point in proceeding with discussion of that matter in the budget debate since we may very well find&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I moved the adjournment of the debate last evening.  In accordance with precedent in this debate this is not to be taken as an indication that I would speak first this morning.  Indeed your predecessor, Sir, had the same discussion with the present Taoiseach a couple of years ago.  My colleague, Deputy J. Bruton, will be taking up the slot at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the economic and financial situation facing a Government in Ireland in 1987 is one requiring fairly serious remedial measures to be taken with a view to reducing public spending so that the debt level which has been constantly mounting in recent years be decelerated in its ascent and ultimately the point reached where the national debt would be reduced.  Furthermore, by reducing the pressure of Government borrowing on the domestic market, by reducing Government spending, conditions could be created in which interest rates could be reduced.</P>
      <P>I have been very struck in recent hours at the alacrity with which Fianna Fáil spokesmen have referred to the need to reduce Government borrowing in order to bring down interest rates.  I have a faint recollection of the present Taoiseach, when on this side of the House, describing measures and ideas of that kind as monetarist.  The suggestion that Government borrowing could influence interest rates was castigated by the Taoiseach as monetarism, sometimes indeed with the additional spice of the adjective Thatcherite, referring to it as Thatcherite monetarism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may not have used the adjective but he certainly used the noun monetarism.  I remember him referring on frequent occasions to the monetarist policies of the then Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of procedure. The Deputy should not make that sort of mistake.  I do not use terms like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will acknowledge the Taoiseach's correction in regard to the adjective Thatcherite &mdash; perhaps there were some of his colleagues who used <Col N="958" /> that adjective.  My recollection in associating that particular adjective with the Taoiseach may be faulty but certainly I recollect him frequently castigating, in his majesterial fashion, as he saw it, the monetarism of the then Government.  I am glad that while neither side of the House ever embraced monetarism as a policy, as far as the effect of Government borrowing on interest rates is concerned, at least the party opposite have seen the sense of what we have been saying for some time, that it is imperative that Government borrowing and spending be reduced so that interest rates can be brought down, so that there can be an increase in productive activity and in job creation on a self-sustaining basis.</P>
      <P>I draw considerable satisfaction from the fact that these arguments which were insisted upon forcibly both in this House prior to the dissolution of the last Dáil and in the four weeks of the election campaign by this party have now been adopted, belatedly but with a new found enthusiasm by the party opposite.  That is welcome.  It is one thing to be able to convert one's own supporters to one's ideas, but it is an even greater achievement to be able to convert one's opponents to one's ideas.  That is the achievement we can speak of on this occasion.</P>
      <P>We have converted the Fianna Fáil Party, lock, stock and barrel to the ideas we were putting forward as far as the economy is concerned.  I do not say that in a carping sense, but in recognition of an achievement, in the sense that at least a consensus has been achieved on certain fundamental economic relationships. However, that being said, I have to make some quite severe criticisms of the budget under three headings.  These relate to the areas in which this budget diverges substantially from the budget proposals put forward by the outgoing Government on 20 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most but not all of the ways in which the previous budget has been changed, it has been changed for the worse.  There are three areas in which these changes for the worse have occurred.  First, this budget represents an increase in income <Col N="959" /> tax and a reduction in the take home pay of workers.  That is something against which the outgoing Government set their face.  We decided at the very outset of our consideration of the 1987 budget in October that we would not allow increases in income tax to occur.  Fianna Fáil in modifying our budget have gone for an increase in income tax.  I refer to the reduction in the mortgage interest tax relief which is an increase in the income tax burden for vast numbers of families. That is something we said we would not do but Fianna Fáil have decided to go for this increase.</P>
    <P>Contrast that performance by Fianna Fáil in increasing income tax with the promise they made before the election. A Fianna Fáil advertisement prior to the election ran as follows: &ldquo;Working hard and overtaxed?&rdquo;  On the advertisement was also a very fetching picture of two worried looking people.  If they were worried before the election they will certainly be a great deal more worried now having read the Fianna Fáil proposals to further increase the income tax burden although they pretended they would reduce that burden if they obtained the support of the people.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil advertisement which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 February 1987 promised a number of things, one of which was &ldquo;A rapid reduction in the tax burden&rdquo;.  What have we got?  We have not got a rapid reduction but an increase in the tax burden for any income tax payer who happens to have a mortgage. That is directly contrary to the policy of the outgoing Government who said at the outset that, whatever we did in making economies, we would not make them by increasing the income tax burden.  That is where we in our budget are distinguishable from the party opposite.  They were prepared to contemplate a further increase in income tax. We disagree with that.</P>
    <P>We also have had, in the course of the justification of the health charge for those in hospital, the argument put forward by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, that people should not really worry about the £10 charge because there will <Col N="960" /> be a VHI scheme available if people want to be covered against having to pay the charge.  As any Member of the House knows, VHI contributions are collected in the form of a deduction from the weekly or monthly pay cheque.  In addition to having to pay more tax because mortgage interest relief has been reduced, the average taxpayer to be covered against the eventuality of going into hospital will have to pay a further level of VHI and have a further deduction from his pay cheque.  This is a budget which is in favour of more income tax from the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The second area in which I criticise this budget is that many of the figures that have been put in, either for increases in revenue or for savings as a result of measures being taken to reduce spending are, to say the least, dubious and unlikely to be achieved.  I fear that in a few months time, because of the dubious and speculative nature of some of the economies and/or revenue increases put into the budget arithmetic, which enables the rather favourable figure for the deficit to emerge, this budget will begin to unravel at the seams and some of the seemingly sound measures contained in it will prove to be miasmas, to be mirages which disappear at the touch.  I intend to give specifics as to the figures which underlie this budget which are dubious.  I do not say that all of the figures will not be achieved.  Undoubtedly some will be achieved, but there is approximately £104.7 million worth of dubious savings or increases in revenue contained in this budget.  I propose to give details.</P>
    <P>The third area in which I criticise this budget is in regard to a number of specific changes that have been made in comparison with the budget of the outgoing Government.  This budget is against employment creation and the wider dispersal of ownership of shares to employees and the community in general. It is against economic democracy. The specifics in regard to this are as follows. The National Development Corporation are a body established by the Government to provide investment funds for productive industry in Ireland, not <Col N="961" /> grants, not free handouts, but investment funds from which the taxpayer would receive a return in the form of a capital gain or a dividend.</P>
    <P>The provision for the National Development Corporation, or NATCORP as it is now known, has been so cut in this budget as to represent the extinction of the National Development Corporation.  A cut of £3 million has been imposed and I believe the corporation will have considerable difficulty in surviving in the face of that substantial cut in the resources available to them.  The last area in which a Government concerned with employment should be making economies is in the area of equity investment by the State in productive industry.  I can understand cuts being made in grants and services of various kinds, but where the Government are investing in a firm of proven profitability &mdash; and there is no doubt that the National Development Corporation are extremely cautious in assessing projects &mdash; that is not an area in which economies should have been made.  That, to my mind, represents an anti-employment bias in the budget.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a number of other changes have been made which are contrary to the best interests of employment creation in Ireland.  The cutting out of the house improvement grants will depress employment significantly in the construction industry.  I know many people will say that the idea of giving State funds to people who have a house already to add on an extension might be giving them something they do not need but I have to contest that argument.  Figures show that for every £1 spent by the State under that scheme an additional £2 is spent by the private individual on the extension or other improvement to his house.  That makes this form of State expenditure on construction far better value, for example, than Government spending on hospital or school building or any other building where anything between 90 per cent and 100 per cent of the cost is met by the taxpayer and there are very few additional resources brought in from outside. <Col N="962" /> Expenditure on house improvements achieves three times as much additional construction activity, in terms of pounds and pence, as that actually expended by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Given that there are large numbers of people unemployed in this area, and that house improvements make it less likely that people will have to seek rehousing from the State as local authority tenants, I believe this was, and would have remained if it had been continued, a scheme that was good value for money in terms of employment creation, of improving and conserving the housing stock so that we did not have to renew it at greater public expense in the years ahead, and in reducing the pressure on local authorities for new house buildings.  An economy in this area is anti-employment and should not have been made.</P>
    <P>I want also to criticise the Government for withdrawing an important tax concession contained in the outgoing Government's budgetary proposals in regard to wider share ownership.  Under the provisions of the outgoing Government's budget, a special tax concession was being made available to anybody retiring from a firm to be given, as part of their lump sum on retirement or other gratuity shares in the company in which they had been working.  This was a valuable tax concession in two ways.  It would increase the number of people who would be shareholders in Irish business, and give them economic democracy and widen the interests of the productive sector in the community but more important, from a human and social point of view, it would enable people who were retiring to retain an interest in the place in which they had spent a large part of their lives.  Instead of being invitees to the annual company reunion, they would be shareholders who had some standing in the company.  Unfortunately that tax concession, which would have promoted considerable growth in the number of Irish people owning shares in productive business, has been dropped by the Government.  That is contrary to economic democracy.</P>
    <P>I also criticise the Government's <Col N="963" /> decision not to go ahead with the outgoing Government's proposals for the disposal of their shares in Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta, the former Great Southern Hotels.  The opportunity provided by the outgoing Government's proposals to bring outside capital into those very important hotels would have been good for tourism, in that it would have given those hotels an important boost in investment terms to do a better job in attracting tourists to Ireland, and if the shares had been floated on the Stock Exchange, it would have provided an opportunity for many people to become shareholders in a new Irish company. Further it would have brought in substantial funds to the Government which could have been used to reduce the national debt.  In abandoning that valuable proposal the Government have shown a lack of moral courage.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that before the last election the Leader of the Opposition, now Taoiseach, assured the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there would be no sale of State assets.  That promise, given under pressure prior to the election, was a foolish promise.  This modest start with Ostlanna Iompair Éireann in disposing of shares in this company would have given an opportunity to test the market, to look at the difficulties and examine the problems in regard to such shares so that additional capital could be brought in by the sale of certain assets to be invested elsewhere or fixed by the State to reduce debt.  Instead of going ahead with this proposal, the Government decided to drop it.  That was a foolish decision.  It was an opportunity lost, an opportunity which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, would I imagine like to have seen taken, but obviously his counsel did not prevail at the Cabinet table and the apostles of caution, the apostles of not offending any particular vested interest, prevailed over a more sensible outlook which I speculate would have been his if his counsel had been taken.</P>
    <P>I regret also the abandonment by the Government of the previous Government's <Col N="964" /> proposal to give Córas Tráchtála the responsibility for marketing Irish fish overseas.  BIM, who currently have responsibility for marketing Irish fish, have one overseas office in Paris.  One overseas office is not a sufficient basis on which to sell Irish fish across the world. The outgoing Government in their proposals stated that CTT, who have a network of offices in all continents, should be given the responsibility for selling Irish fish products.  That would have been a much more sensible way of ensuring the achievement of the export potential of this most important under-utilised Irish resource, namely, fish.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about catching and processing fish if one cannot sell them.  The most sensible way of providing for the effective selling of Irish fish throughout the world, not just in the environs of Paris, would have been, as the previous Government proposed, to give responsibility for fish marketing overseas to CTT.  That decision has also been reversed by the present Government under pressure, I am sure from vested interests, in BIM who obviously got the ear of some Government member and said it would not be good for the corporate image of BIM to have CTT taking over this function.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, is talking about the appointment of consultants to tell him how to rationalise State bodies.  When he had a proposal before him &mdash; to transfer responsibility for fish marketing from BIM to CTT &mdash; his colleagues funked the opportunity to do something sensible and to make a rationalisation that would have been good for the Irish fishing industry.  I regret that this change has been made.  Likewise, I regret the apparent abandonment of the decision to require the Kilkenny Design Workshops and the Irish Productivity Centre to become self-financing entities.  That decision appears to have been dropped from the Principal Features of the Budget.  Perhaps that is still the case but it does not appear in the Principal Features of the Budget as it did appear in the principal features of a previous one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> From an agricultural point of view the changes in regard to farmer taxation this year are not wise.  The proposal of the outgoing Government was for a land tax which would raise about £9 million this year.  It would not matter if the farmer produced more as he would not pay any more land tax.  The proposal of the Government is different.  They do not want a tax on land; they want a tax on production.  They want to cut the VAT refund to farmers.  Therefore, the more the farmer produces the more he will suffer from the cut in the VAT refund which is the policy of the Government whereas if he produced more under the land tax he would have been unaffected in terms of his tax bill.</P>
    <P>As far as smaller farmers are concerned the abandonment of the land or farm tax will result in a large amount of money being used unproductively in fees to accountants validating farm accounts submitted for income tax purposes.  The farm tax proposal would have exempted farmers with an adjusted acreage of less than 80 acres from being involved in having accounts validated.  They would have simply paid the money which they might otherwise have paid to accountants direct to the Revenue where it could be used to reduce the Government's debt or to finance various services.  Instead that money will now be paid, and perhaps more, to accountants.  This budget was not designed to please the accountancy profession but one of its results in this case will be to give the accountancy profession lots of unproductive work signing, validating and checking accounts when the same money could have been sent directly by the farmer in the form of a cheque for farm tax to the Revenue without involving this useless expenditure of time and money.  That is also a regrettable change.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the £5,000 grant for people vacating local authority houses will prove to be very false economy.  For a mere £5,000 the State was able to obtain possession of a local authority house which cost approximately £30,000 or £40,000 to build.  With that grant now <Col N="966" /> gone if people are to be provided with houses on the local authority housing lists, the State will have to spend between £30,000 and £40,000 on building a new house because houses will no longer be released to the local authorities by tenants under the £5,000 scheme.  Therefore, instead of paying £5,000 for a new house for somebody on the housing list, the taxpayers will now under this Fianna Fáil budget find themselves paying between £30,000 and £40,000 for a new house. Admittedly, that will not be felt this year, but it certainly will be felt next year and the year after.  Looking at some of the rather dubious figures contained in the budget I wonder whether the party opposite are worried about next year, or the year after, because some of the measures they are undertaking are storing up problems for 1988.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other individual items that I might criticise but I said I would give details of the areas in the budget, amounting to approximately £104.7 million, where I contend the figures underlying the budgetary arithmetic are dubious.  I am not saying that all of these figures are false but I am simply saying that there is a question mark over each of these figures, a question mark which needs to be removed before one can say with certainty that this is a realistic budget.  Some of the speakers who welcomed the budget yesterday &mdash; and I am sure it was a welcome sincerely meant &mdash; might wish to qualify their welcome on examining the small print which underlies some of the figures.  I would like to draw attention to some of those rather dubious provisions in the budget.</P>
    <P>The first one I wish to draw attention to is in regard to savings of in the region of £4 million in education.  The provision for third level colleges has been cut by £4.5 million instead of the £1.8 million which was the cut proposed by the outgoing Government.  The provision in regard to community and comprehensive schools is cut by £500,000.  The provision in regard to regional technical colleges is cut by £1 million.  How are these cuts to be achieved?  According to the Principal Features of the Budget they are to be <Col N="967" /> achieved by &mdash; wait for it &mdash; this marvellous term &ldquo;greater efficiency&rdquo;.  I remind the House that efficiency is something everybody is in favour of but it is not so easy to find hard money in the short term by measures of that kind.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House, for instance, of the famous Rayner scrutinies in the United Kingdom which were designed to achieve greater efficiency in that administration.  Over a period of six years all the Rayner scrutinies could find by increased efficiency was 0.5 per cent of all public spending.  Yet, in this budget we are asked to believe that at a stroke somewhere in the region of £3 million to £4 million is to be found through greater efficiencies in the third level sector, in the regional technical colleges and in community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>Will one of the efficiencies in the higher education sector be higher fees from students? Can the Minister give me an assurance that the third level institutions will not seek this so-called efficiency by increasing the fees for students because, if they do, they will depart from the provisions of the budget.  Charging students higher fees is not achieving efficiency and if that is what is going to happen the budgetary proposal is not correct in the way it is presented.  The House is entitled to be told what precise efficiencies are involved.</P>
    <P>Likewise there are similar provisions in the area of the health services where, we have been told, greater efficiencies will be found.  I should like to know what precisely are the efficiencies in that area. There is another area of approximately £15 million worth of savings that are, to say the least, speculative.  I refer to the savings under the heading of detection of fraud in the Social Welfare area.  We have been told that a nice round figure of £4 million will be saved by an intensive sustained campaign against dole fraud and abuse.  I would like to know exactly what additional measures will be undertaken in addition to those already in place.  A substantial number of measures were introduced by the previous Government and account had already been taken of <Col N="968" /> the benefits achieved by those measures in the previous figures.  What additional measures will have the effect of saving £4 million?</P>
    <P>I note that £11.5 million is to be found under the intensified job-search programme. That programme is not an original idea initiated by the Government but is an extension on a national basis of a pilot scheme initiated by the previous Government.  I have reason to be doubtful as to whether this full saving will be achieved.  We also have another heroic assumption, that £14.4 million will be saved by no recruitments to the health boards.  What will happen if a vacancy arises in a hospital for a surgeon?  Are the Government saying that a replacement will not be recruited?  Will theatres be left empty because people are not to be recruited?  I note that the Government say that key vacancies &mdash; I presume surgeons will be included in that category &mdash; will be filled by redeployments or promotions but what will happen if there is not another surgeon available?  One cannot promote a nurse or an ambulance driver to become a surgeon in a hospital in the same fashion as one might promote people within an undifferentiated Civil Service.  To have put in £14.4 million in savings in 1987 by not filling vacancies in an areas such as the health services where the skills involved are so narrowly defined, where the facilities in use are so expensive that leaving a post unfilled could be a false economy, is very dubious. We are entitled to much more information than is available on how that large sum is to be found in the health services. I am not saying that I disagree with the idea of a very tight control on the recruitment in health boards and, perhaps, a tighter control than was exercised by the previous Government might be welcome. However, I object to putting in a figure like £14.4 million without giving sufficient evidence of how that saving will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I also have to question £25 million in regard to retention tax on the fees for various professional people on two grounds.  To put that in as a reduction in this year's deficit is potentially misleading <Col N="969" /> because it is a once-off benefit.  Much of the £25 million collected this year will have to be refunded next year.  All the Government are doing is bringing forward tax liability from next year into this year, creating a hole in the tax of 1988. That is misleading, cosmetic accounting of the worst kind and should not be used as a means of reducing this year's deficit in any sense in which that deficit is being used to represent an improvement in the underlying financial position.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that yesterday evening in the debate the Taoiseach conceded that if it was clear that these professionals did not have a tax liability of that kind during 1987 interim refunds might be made.  If that is the case we will not even get the cash flow benefit of the £25 million and that benefit might disappear.  We also have another heroic assumption in that £20 million has been put in as the proceeds to the State from restricting the duty free allowances of people who travel overseas or to Northern Ireland for less than 48 hours.  That is based on the assumption that people who do not go overseas or to Northern Ireland to buy drink or other goods, will buy the drink at home instead. It is my distinct impression that people who go on shopping sprees to Northern Ireland buy items that they would never dream of buying at home or, if they bought them at home, would never buy them in the same quantity.  To assume that we are going to have £20 million more in Excise duty because people from the South who previously bought their whiskey in Northern Ireland will now buy their whiskey in Dundalk is to make an heroic assumption.  It is my view that they will not buy the whiskey at all and will drink some other product, perhaps orange juice instead.  The revenue on orange juice is not the same as the revenue on whiskey.  I do not think the £20 million will be achieved and it is suspicious that such a nice round figure like £20 million has been included.  I do not think there is any calculation or basis behind that figure.</P>
    <P>We also have savings under the heading <Col N="970" /> of public service pay of £13.3 million, from the non-payment of special awards and from the non-filling of vacancies.  In practice it will be necessary, certainly so far as the Civil Service is concerned, to fill many of the vacancies that arise.  We had an example recently of a vacancy arising in the secretaryship of the Department of Finance and I should like to know if we are being told that if Maurice Doyle had deferred his retirement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This individual is a public figure and is now the Governor of the Central Bank.  If Mr. X had postponed his retirement from the Department of Finance for another two or three months are the Government telling us that they would have no Secretary in that Department for the remainder of 1987 and, perhaps, into 1988?  I know they are not and I am sure they will find that they will have to fill many other vacancies that will arise.  As a result it will not be possible to achieve these savings.  While I hope that the Government will be successful in their intention of paying no special increases they may be a little sanguine in the figures they have included in the budget as representing savings that will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another very dubious figure, namely the £10 million that is supposed to be found in arrears of tax as a result of people from the Department of the Public Service being put into a task force and told to tell those fellows in the Revenue how to do their job and collect the money.  The problem as far as the collection of tax is concerned is not that we do not have enough staff but that the law is not being adequately operated.  I do not believe that much can be achieved by bringing in officers from the public service who have no particular experience in the area of tax collection and christening them a &ldquo;task force&rdquo;, although that title gives an immediate impression of activity and industry which is not necessarily commensurate with performance. <Col N="971" /> This task force is to tell Revenue officials who have been working all their lives at tax collection how to do their job.  That this will lead to the nice, round figure of an additional £10 million in tax collected, which would not otherwise be collected, is an heroic assumption. Even if it is true, it is also cosmetic accounting because tax collected this year which would not otherwise have been collected will not be available for collection next year.  Like the £25 million in respect of fees, it is simply a cash flow or cosmetic accounting provision which does not amount to a permanent reduction in the deficit.  That is not to say that further measures to collect tax are not welcome.  I simply do not believe that the figure is one that should be included in relief of the deficit.</P>
    <P>I might conclude by referring to a few other promises made in the Fianna Fáil programme before the election and which have not been fulfilled.  In a Fianna Fáil advertisement on 16 February they promised better care for the old and the sick.  Now if you become sick and go into hospital you have to pay £10 per day. That is the better care promised in the Fianna Fáil advertisement.  They promised on 14 February that selective reductions in indirect taxation would be made where the effect would be to increase economic activity.  That promise has been forgotten.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Bruton's contribution, I am not in any way surprised at his approach to this budget.  I suppose it is only human that there should be a certain element of sour grapes in a contribution by a man who has produced two budgets for this House, neither of which has been passed.  His party preached about how they were going to put the serious financial situation in order <Col N="972" /> and at the same time they produced what they believed was the best that could be achieved in relation to reducing the current budget deficit and public sector borrowing.  Magic figures of 7.4 per cent and 11.8 per cent were tossed around for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>When the first budget of this Government was introduced in this House, naturally there had to be a shock reaction by Deputy Bruton and by the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan, whose display here yesterday I can only describe as a demonstration of belligerent hypocrisy coming from a man and a party who preached about what needed to be done but never had the courage to do it. They knew how necessary it was to rescue this economy but they suffered from the paralysis of analysis and after four years and three months of their Government we ended up with a national debt increased by £12,000 million.  I can understand Deputy Bruton trying to cast some doubt on the validity of the many figures he mentioned.  Individual Ministers will be taking part in this debate and will take the opportunity to answer clearly the questions raised by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>He raised very few questions about my area of responsibility, but I will be only too happy to answer any queries.  He disregards savings from efficiency.  When one looks at the size of current and capital spending in this budget it is evident that any economic management worth its salt would find sufficient savings, not only in the areas pinpointed in the budget but in many other areas.  I am quite certain that Ministers in the previous Government knew full well where the fat and inefficiencies were and where additional productivity could be achieved, but it takes courage and conviction for a Minister in any Department to sort out the unacceptable situations that exist in relation to the spending of money.  It is tough medicine but it has to be administered.  That is the message coming out of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The current budget deficit from the outturn of 1986 was £1,395 million, representing 8.9 per cent of GNP.  The target set by the Minister for Finance in yesterday's budget was £1,200 million, representing 6.9 per cent of GNP.  On total Exchequer borrowing, the outturn for 1986 was £2,145 million, representing 13 per cent of GNP.  The target set by our Minister for Finance yesterday was £1,858 million, representing 10.7 per cent of GNP.  I can understand Deputy Bruton's reaction to the presentation of our budget.  It is not that he denies the thrust of the strategy but he has to put the best face on it from his own political standpoint by casting some sort of doubt on the figures.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Bruton before he leaves the House that I have not abandoned the decision in relation to Kilkenny Design Workshops.  I am proceeding apace with the previous decision because it was a good decision.  I do not scrap good decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was left out of the Principal Features of the Budget, for some reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have read that document.  It may have been left out as compared with the manner in which Deputy Bruton would have put it in, but let me reassure him that the decision to commercialise Kilkenny Design Workshops is proceeding apace.  We have taken additional equity, shown in the Principal Features of the Budget, of £225,000 to ensure the equity base of Kilkenny Design Workshops who are in financial trouble because of the late opening of their operations in London which caused them to miss the tourist business.  They will be set up with a proper equity base and be commercialised within two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the <Col N="974" /> Irish Productivity Centre: they will also be totally commercialised within two years.  As I said, I do not reject any decision with which I agree.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand Deputy Bruton's attitude in relation to the land tax; perhaps he is adopting it for the sake of political manoeuvring.  As a former Minister for Finance he knows as well as I do that the whole area of farmer taxation was not well handled over the past ten or 15 years.  First, a decision was made and then reversed.  We then went in another direction and various Governments have contributed to the situation.  Everybody must realise that the Revenue Commissioners need approximately four to five years to get a proper profile on any sector of commerce, to get a feel for it and to be able to work it out.  However, they never got that opportunity.  We have been consistent in our approach to the land tax but it is an equity principle in any taxation system that the ability to pay must be taken into consideration.  When one looks at the principle involved in the land tax, it is clear that all farmers are expected to pay it irrespective of whether they are married or single, with a large or small family or whether they have borrowed money.  In any event, there will be a big clawback from VAT.</P>
      <P>I can only speculate as to why some farmers are in favour of the land tax but I imagine I would not be too far wrong in suggesting it is because capital allowances which could be written off against profits have now been exhausted.  Such farmers should realise they will be paying a lot less.  For example, an intensive dairy farmer with 120 acres would pay £1,200 under the land tax system but he would have been making significant profits over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton seems to doubt this but I checked it with friends in the accounting profession yesterday &mdash; they may not be friends today &mdash; and, without disclosing confidentiality, I got a nod of approval in relation to my proposals in regard to land tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Of course any Government would love to tackle the penal level of taxation which is caused by high Government expenditure and borrowing.  First, we must stabilise and reduce borrowing which will be the first step in reducing taxation.  We are committed to doing it but this is our first budget after three weeks in office and there was no scope for reducing the level of taxation.  During our term of office we will carry out that commitment because we recognise the system is a total disincentive to work and to investment. Good commercial sense dictates that the level of taxation must be brought down.</P>
    <P>Some speakers said that the removal of the housing grants would cause devastation in the building and construction industry this year.  Grants approved up to 27 March will be paid in full and, therefore, building activity will continue this year.  I do not understand Deputy Bruton's argument because we provided £100 million for these grants in the budget which is exactly the same as the amount provided in the budget of the Coalition. If the amount was not sufficient in that budget, how can the Deputy claim that the building and construction industry will be devastated this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about this year.  It is extremely difficult for a former Minister for Finance, especially when the major part of the budget was drawn up by him, to try to pour cold water on it.  The Deputy's arguments have no sound basis or logic.  He knows as well as I that the level of jobs created by such schemes was very disappointing.  The £200 million provided for home improvement grants did not produce the expected jobs.  Of course, the Department of the Environment totally underestimated the requirements to meet all the applications pouring in day after day and it was irresponsible of the Government to allow the situation to get out of control.  It was deceitful to accept applications from the public when they knew that provision had not been made for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="976" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct, the Minister is making a false statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a false statement. The Minister for the Environment will elaborate on this matter.  In answer to a question on 20 November last in this House it was admitted by the Government that there was a critical situation in relation to these grants and it got worse from then on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £100 million was adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make the same accusation in regard to the underestimation for Health and the Minister for Health will take pleasure in giving the facts of the financial position in Health as we found it.  Why were the health boards allowed a free run in relation to raising overdrafts?  The Minister for Finance did not approve of that course of action but the Minister for Health did. Did the Government take any action in relation to it?  It was excess expenditure which was not taken into account or provided for.  Apart from the overdrafts, there was overspending in the whole area of Health.  We all recall during the election campaign the serious difference of opinion that arose between the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, and the Minister for Finance regarding the correct figures for Health.  I will leave it to the Minister for Health to give the full details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no drop in the level of building activity as a result of the abolition of the housing grants this year. While the £5,000 grant served a specific purpose and was useful, it brought social implications in its wake because the leaders in communities are moving out of their houses and taking full advantage of the incentive to do so.  The local authority housing list is not subject to pressure at the moment; in many areas there is no pressure for such houses.  Why should a Government in their right senses build more local authority houses when there is no pressure on them to do so?  Why should they maintain the grants system <Col N="977" /> the provision for which was totally underestimated? A decision had to be taken to abolish it and try to bring matters back into the realms of reality from which they had been allowed to stray under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I will not use all my time in going back over the empty and fallacious arguments raised here, but there will be plenty of opportunities in the building and construction industry to participate in major infrastructural development throughout this year and they, too, will benefit in a major way by the reduction in interest rates.  The major development of the Custom House Dock site involving something in the region of £250 million will be a major constructional development. Therefore, all is not as bleak as people would like to make it out to be for the building and construction industry.  It is only right and proper and financially prudent that the State should not be the total catalyst in the building and construction industry but rather that private sector funds which are lying idle should be put to work, but they will not be put to work until they are able to earn a return on investment.</P>
    <P>I will leave aside those points and other issues raised but let me mention the area of about £25 million from professional fees or retention tax on professions as a dubious figure.  Approximately £141 million is paid out by the State in professional fees every year.  That is not an over-estimate.  It is a conservative figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cash flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the State operate only on cash flow?  Are the national accounts not presented here every year on an income and expenditure basis?  That is the way the accounts of the nation are presented and that is what cash flow is all about.  Do not try to confuse people who do not seem to understand what you are at.  Cash flow is cash flow. It is money coming into the Exchequer this year and any money coming into the Exchequer this year is part of income and expenditure on which to base national accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="978" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is money taken out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I might disagree with the way national accounts are put together because they do not reflect the true state of the nation's finances but that is what operates and in that context it is legitimate to operate on the basis of income and expenditure.  That is how the system works.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the budget strategy.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind this budget is straightforward.  Society must create wealth before it can be spent.  It was, therefore, necessary to curb public expenditure, while being sensitive to the needs of the weakest sections of our community. A tough budget did not have to be a harsh budget.  Social welfare increases were brought forward to July from November.  Medical card holders are exempt from the new hospital charges, and other cases of genuine hardship will also be looked after in relation to the health charges.</P>
      <P>The control of public expenditure is only a stepping stone.  It is page one of a realistic strategy for growth.  It is the necessary step to removing the most important obstacles to the achievement of the country's growth potential.</P>
      <P>The progress achieved by this budget in the reduction of borrowing has been more rapid than the pre-budget commentators anticipated.  It is a clear signal of this Government's determination to break the trend of low growth and high borrowing.  It provides the basis for renewed confidence and dynamism in this economy.</P>
      <P>The budget strategy is about much more than the removal of the obstacles to growth.  It also puts in place measures to force the pace in achieving that growth.  It is positive for employment. The Jobsearch programme will involve offering 40,000 Manpower scheme opportunities to the long term unemployed. This will facilitate a significant reduction in unemployment.  The budget also provides for an additional 1,500 places in social employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget strategy is positive, too, <Col N="979" /> for high skilled employment and in particular, the fast growing area of financial services.  We have the capacity and the personnel to develop a strong international financial services sector and this potential will be tapped.  We have put in place arrangements for a major international services centre in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition, the budget strategy is positive for interest rates by reducing borrowing and restoring confidence.  It is notable how our determination was already being anticipated in the easing of interest rates last week in Dublin.  A reduction in interest rates benefits all sections of the community &mdash; householder, farmer, builder and industrialist. The fall in interest rates which we can now anticipate will more than compensate for the restrictions on mortgage interest relief announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this strategy is that it retains the positive outlook for prices. The rate of inflation will not rise and we will maintain our advantage relative to inflation in Britain.  It is positive, too, in terms of diverting moneys which are going abroad.  This is being done though the curtailment of duty free allowances and through the removal of obstacles to the flow into the country of moneys earned abroad.  We recognise the serious problems which exist in Border counties resulting in lost sales and jobs.  We are doing something about that.  Indeed, the money that is earned abroad should be attracted home.  Surely it is right and proper that money earned by Irish people abroad on contract, whether in the financial services area, engineering or whatever, rather than ending up in the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, should be brought back into this economy and be put to work for this economy. That is the only sensible approach to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton talked about the tax collection system.  Everybody knows that it is not working efficiently, but this budget is positive in distinguishing the punctual from the tardy taxpayer.  What business could be successfully run with the level of unpaid bills which our tax system experiences?  Measures are now <Col N="980" /> being taken to tackle the collection of tax arrears.  If any business operating today were owed so much money would they rely on just sending out notices through the post to get their money in?  No, they would not.  They would take serious action to improve their cash flow.</P>
    <P>The budget is positive in extending the business expansion scheme to tourism. All are agreed that tourism has potential for additional export earnings and job creation.  This is a positive step to realise some of that potential.  This budget is positive for industrial growth.  The State's role in supporting industrial growth requires a balance to be struck between direct support and the creation of a positive environment.  This budget places priority on tackling aspects of the environment. There is also a need to consider the current institutional arrangements to support industry and the success of approaches in respect of small industry, and of larger indigenous firms.  I also intend, if time permits, to refer to the question of a more effective use of science and technology to promote industrial growth.</P>
    <P>What all these positive features have in common is that they have been introduced while maintaining a strict financial discipline.  We have proved that a budget for growth does not have to be a spending budget.  Rather it is a budget of confidence. There has been curtailment of services and subsidies.  These reductions, however, are based on the view that individual Irish men and women will themselves seize the opportunities for growth in a less hostile environment.  Confidence is difficult to measure.  It has one common characteristic, however, when estimated by forecasters.  Its positive impact is, almost without exception, underestimated by the same forecasters.</P>
    <P>We have heard criticism from the construction industry.  I would like to see a more balanced appraisal as I believe that what is widely accepted as good for the economy must be good for the construction industry.  There are major opportunities for infrastructure development. During this debate my colleagues <Col N="981" /> in Government will give details of opportunities that will exist for private investment to give a boost to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The budget does involve reductions in the levels of State support for industry which were outlined in the Book of Estimates published by the previous Government last January.  For those with tunnel vision these reductions may appear as not being in the interest of industry.  This is a mistaken understanding of the way forward to sustainable industrial growth.</P>
    <P>Here let me refer to the question raised by Deputy Bruton in relation to the cut of £3.3 million in the capital budget of the National Development Corporation. This is the corporation who took four years of the last Government's time to set up, who were supposed to be given £300 million in equity to invest in this economy.  Nevertheless, when they prepared the budget they provided, in the first instance, £20 million and then cut that amount to £10 million.  They scream to high heaven when I take off £3.3 million. I have examined the position with regard to the National Development Corporation. The amount already committed to them is about £3.5 million.  That is not the kiss of death for the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>I will be examining in close detail their approach to the whole situation and what efficient and effective contribution they can make to solving some of the problems and correcting the weaknesses of Irish industry.  They are many and varied in the area of equity participation, better management expertise and export marketing. I see a role for them there.  This is not the kiss of death.  This is realistic and should suffice until we get the opportunity to put them into the niche in which they should be as a support and as an investor in equity of small and medium sized indigenous Irish firms, to try to bring them from that level of development up to the next stage of development. That is positive, not negative. Every support agency under my control will be giving positive support to the development of a better industrial environment and will contribute to the new <Col N="982" /> direction that industrial policy will have to take in the future.</P>
    <P>From a business perspective, the key achievement of this budget is its contribution to the removal of the obstacles to growth and enterprise in our country. It paves the way for a decline in interest rates and this decline will be further aided as the Government's determination to maintain the course charted yesterday is shown in the coming months.  It is a decisive budget which provides the impetus finally to break the spiral of high interest rates, high State borrowing and high tax.  It puts us firmly on the road to national recovery.</P>
    <P>As this is my first address to the House as Minister for Industry and Commerce I would like to put the strategy of this budget in the context of the three main ways the Government can promote a strong and competitive industrial sector. In the first place the Government have a major impact on the environment for industry.  Secondly, the State through its various agencies and other services provides advice to industry.  Thirdly, the State provides financial support to industrial projects.</P>
    <P>In this budget the emphasis has been on the first aspect, that is, improving the environment for industry.  An improved environment is both a necessary and urgent requirement for the promotion of sustainable growth in employment and living standards.  In itself, however, this would not be sufficient so I will also touch on aspects of the advice and the financial support areas.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot legislate for enterprise.  They can, however, create an environment which supports it or which contributes to its suffocation.  Sometimes the obstacles to enterprise may come in the guise of apparent support.  There is a dangerous line of reasoning that industrial growth is directly related to the level of subsidies for industry.  To adopt this approach, however, would be self-defeating. It leads to the vicious cycle of increasing expenditure requiring increased taxation and borrowing and further increasing the need for subsidies to overcome a negative environment for <Col N="983" /> investment and growth.  It would be like taking the view that the patient must always be hospitalised and that the objective is limited to financing the cost of medicines.  We must be much more ambitious.  That is what this budget is about.</P>
    <P>There is a large amount of enterprise in both the public and private sectors which is constrained by the symptoms of the current imbalance in the public finances.  During recent years Irish industry has faced a difficult set of conditions. There has been the positive fact of the major decline in the rate of inflation.  The benefits which could have been expected from this decline were severely reduced, however, by the lack of a similar decline in interest rates.  Current interest rates are now more than 10 per cent above the rate of inflation.  This combined with a lack of confidence in the determination of Governments to tackle the nation's problems has become the single most important block to investment in the growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty for industry has been the volatility in exchange rates.  The movements, in particular against the pound sterling, have had serious implications for the cost competitiveness of the large and relatively labour intensive segment of Irish industry which has a high exposure to competition from UK producers.  It is for these reasons that the strategy for a determined reduction in expenditure and borrowing provides the way forward for economic growth and employment.  It is when we recognise the importance of the environment for industry that the need for cuts which include the levels of direct support for industry becomes fully apparent.</P>
    <P>The impact of the budget will be beneficial for investment not only in terms of facilitating lower interest rates.  It will also provide the other key ingredient for investment which is confidence.  This renewal of confidence together with the more favourable treatment of remittances by expatriates will support an increased flow of investment from abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> An improved environment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to building a stronger industrial sector.  Direct State support for industrial development provides, in the appropriate form, a very worthwhile return to the Irish nation. The reasons support is desirable relate to the structure of existing industry seeking to develop in competition with longer established competitors from overseas and, also, to the value of attracting new projects overseas.  In both of these areas there are basic features of the economy which act as constraints.  It is necessary to develop and innovate with the mechanisms of State support for industry in line with the rapidly changing environment facing Irish industry.  Many of the State agencies were established in very different circumstances and while they have all sought to adapt to changing circumstances it is now desirable that we review the total system in terms of its effectiveness in supporting the achievement of the central objectives of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>This budget has imposed strict expenditure limits on the State industrial support agencies.  As with Irish firms which are exposed to international competition, the agencies will also have to maintain the pressure to constantly streamline their structures and to look for increased productivity. For an agency, an objective of increased productivity would be to have a greater positive impact at less cost to the Exchequer on the growth of Irish industry.  It is a challenge which I am confident the agencies will embrace as consistent with the objective we all share of promoting increased employment and living standards through industrial growth.</P>
    <P>The support system requires radical evaluation.  The recent &ldquo;Review of Industrial Performance 1986&rdquo; published by my Department in the last week or so contained a comprehensive assessment of the state of Irish industry.  It showed a broad outline of the way forward for industrial policies.  I am not setting in train aspects of detailed implementation.  The report outlined the extent and the value of the support which the State provides for <Col N="985" /> industry through its many agencies.  It is clear, however, that the organisation of this support system requires radical evaluation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present institutional arrangements give rise to unnecessary problems of duplication and co-ordination. A survey of the attitudes of senior executives in Irish manufacturing industry, carried out for my Department, showed a concern among industrialists with the overlap between the agencies. Eighty-six per cent of those surveyed agreed that there were too many agencies in the industrial support system.  These views were expressed notwithstanding the general indications in that survey that most industrialists had a very positive attitude towards the services provided by the agencies.</P>
    <P>There are currently some 20 separate institutions involved in supporting industry with a combined staff of more than 3,400.  This large number of public officials represents a valuable benefit to industry, but it must be realised that it is also a cost to the Exchequer and therefore indirectly on industry itself through its impact on the level of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently looking at ways to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the overall system of State support for industrial development. The objectives of this examination are to focus industrial support, for the latter half of this decade and beyond, more efficiently and more effectively in terms of objectives.</P>
    <P>A too narrow view has often been taken of the State's role in industrial development.  It is sometimes equated with grant aid.  Grant aid is only part and oftentimes not the most important instrument of State support.  A large amount of resources is also devoted to advisory and other services.  The importance of these other services is illustrated by the fact that, last year, direct subsidies to industry only accounted for one half of total expenditure on industry.  In addition there are the tax incentives, and, as I have already stressed, the vital importance of the business environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> We must ask whether we are making the best use of the advisory services for industry.  A generous State grant can never substitute for a project properly designed in terms of marketing, technology and other key aspects.  A well designed project, with or without advice from the State agencies, in a suitable environment will be able to raise finance without recourse to the State finance.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to under-estimate the immediate difficulties faced by Irish industry.  Nevertheless, I believe it is necessary constantly to question the extent to which fixed asset grants can be displaced by support for companies seeking to build strengths in marketing and technology, or by equity investment, or even just by good advice.</P>
    <P>The key building block to a strong and growing industrial sector is indigenous Irish industry.  In the past 15 years it is foreign owned firms which have made the largest contribution to the growth in output and exports in the economy.  This country has over-relied on foreign and multinational investment to do the job for it.  We live in a changing world in that regard, in that international investment has now become a scarce commodity.  We are faced with much stiffer competition from many other areas putting up very expensive incentives to try to attract the scarce investment that is around.  That is why it is vital to turn and to examine and build on our own industrial base which will be a far safer and sounder industrial base on which the future of our economy can grow.  At the same time, foreign firms will continue to make a major contribution and it is necessary for the IDA to be continually innovative in winning a large share of new investment for Ireland.  This will not be sufficient to realise our ambitions for growth and employment.  As a priority, we must create the conditions for rapid growth in indigenous Irish firms.</P>
    <P>It is indigenous firms which generate the greatest linkage and other spin-off benefits within the economy.  The identification of their key role is not new.  It was a theme of the Telesis Report in 1982, of the White Paper on Industrial <Col N="987" /> Policy in 1984 and of many other reports. We must not, however, confuse diagnosis with solution.  It is the development of these firms which has posed the greatest difficulties over recent years.</P>
    <P>There are two potential sources of strong indigenous exporting firms &mdash; established medium sized firms and new start-ups or other small firms.  During this year my Department will look at both of these areas in an assessment of how effective current arrangements are and whether there is a need for changes in approach.  There are many who believe that it is large scale multinational investment that can solve our problems.  I would remind these people that it is small industry which is the backbone of the American economy, one of the strongest in the world and that, indeed, it is small industry growing to a certain size in multiple numbers all over the place that can make the greatest and most significant contribution to growth in the future.  My philosophy has always been that the small man of today can be the big man of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The small industry sector has been the only area of industry to record a net growth in employment since the beginning of this decade.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that there is a potential for more output and more employment growth from this segment of industry. While there has been notable growth, this growth has been confined to new start-ups.  The worrying feature is that the new firms created are not continuing to grow and, indeed, there is evidence to indicate that the average employment per project has declined somewhat since the start of this decade.</P>
    <P>It is worth outlining just how comprehensive assistance to small industry can be both for the expansion of existing operations and for start-up situations. Small industry projects can, as for other industry, avail of non-repayable cash grants in all the other areas available to it.</P>
    <P>In addition, small industry projects uniquely have the options of, first, applying for employment grants in lieu of a <Col N="988" /> capital grant for fixed assets and, secondly, for management training grants. The first of these is specifically designed to address the cashflow bottleneck that can be created by the need to devote scarce resources to the acquisition of new equipment, while management training grants will ensure that individual entrepreneurs who have the drive and ability to set up new projects do not falter for lack of the necessary financial, marketing and other expertise so necessary in today's business environment.</P>
    <P>Small industry projects which can also avail of research and development and technology acquisition grants are eligible to participate in the very comprehensive enterprise development programme and can benefit from, <i>inter alia</i>, 10 per cent corporation tax and the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>In summary it is not a lack of will, or indeed of resources, in the State support system that militates against successful development of this sector.  I will return to the question of a new approach to small industry later in the year after my Department have completed a detailed consideration of this area.  This study will look for the factors which will influence a greater proportion of small firms to grow into medium sized firms.  It must also identify conditions whereby a greater proportion of equity investment will take place in small firms.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to ensure that the State system is integrated in its support for individual projects and that those who deliver the services are, in so far as possible, close to small firms in spirit and in geographical terms.  Thus, I will be looking at progress and prospects in the operation of the one-stop-shops of State support.</P>
    <P>The small number of strong indigenous exporting companies is a notable weakness in the Irish industrial base when compared with the structures of other small and strong European economies. In identifying the prospects for growth among medium to large indigenous firms it is necessary, however, to recognise the limited potential for growth of many of the firms involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> Many firms are engaged in activities which do not have significant export potential and are therefore constrained by the limitations of a small domestic market.  Others are still engaged in the low cost segments of manufacturing activity which cannot be defended in the long term against competition from low wage countries.  Many firms do not have either the management capacity or resources for strategic development.</P>
    <P>The company development programme, which was pioneered by the IDA to address this issue, has now been in operation for nearly three years.  The programme involves IDA, in co-operation with other State agencies, particularly CTT and IIRS, working closely with selected companies to help them identify and implement strategic initiatives and programmes.  The programme involves mainly indigenous companies. The CDP is regarded by the IDA as their principal tool to encourage the development of strong internationally competitive indigenous companies.  Fortyfive company development exercises were completed in 1986, bringing to almost 150 the number of companies which have participated in the programme since its introduction.  The operating target for 1987 is that a further 50 companies will be covered.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to examine the effectiveness of the measures currently in place to support the development of strong exporting established firms.  The operation of the company development programme will be an important part of this examination.</P>
    <P>The importance of integrating competitive technology with the needs of industry is well recognised.  The need to upgrade the technological capacity of Irish industry is also evident.  We shall be looking at ways and means of making a detailed evaluation and assessment of how the money spent in various agencies in the area of science and technology and in research and development can be most effectively used to produce the most cost efficient results.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me since <Col N="990" /> becoming Minister, it has not been possible for me with my Minister of State for Science and Technology whom I am glad to see in the House here, to get a full appraisal of the whole area of science and technology and the role this can play in the whole area of industrial growth.  The growth in employment and living standards is crucially dependent on the development of a strong and competitive industrial base.  As a people we strive for prosperity in terms of employment, support for the weaker sections of the community and higher living standards for all.  In just the same way that a business must have a clear goal at which to aim, so must this country compete for prosperity.  This competition takes place on the international stage.</P>
    <P>This budget is the first step along the road to national recovery.  It charts a course which this Government are determined to follow.  Everybody, or almost everybody, knows that there are no instant solutions.  Anybody looking forward to miracles should not be in politics or in business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his appointment and also on a fairly hasty ending there, although he managed to cram quite a bit into the last minute or so.  I watched his performance with great interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us in this House on all sides should welcome the spirit permeating this budget.  Obviously different parties from different standpoints will have reservations about matters of detail but then we always do.  The essence of it is that for the first time in many years a Government have decided to take on the fundamental problems and seek to do something about them.  That is not to say that the budget, from the standpoint of my party, is ideal or that it would be ours were it our task to write it.  Nevertheless the budget now helps to create universally in the country a much clearer approach, based on economic realism, to some of the answers that are necessary if we are to meet the challenge of tackling <Col N="991" /> our economic problems in a fundamental way.</P>
    <P>The sad situation all of us were faced with until the last day or two was the perception by the people, fuelled massively by the Government during the election campaign, that somehow there were soft options and miracles despite what the new Minister for Industry and Commerce has just said.  I recall, with a combination of regret and bemusement, the billboards proclaiming that health cuts would hit the sick, needy and handicapped, and then I look at the budget introduced yesterday. That is a double standard.  There is no doubt but that it can be said that this Government have no mandate whatsoever for what they did yesterday. Nevertheless what they are doing in this budget, in broad terms, is in the national interest and must be welcomed as such and I am somewhat bemused by some of the criticism emanating particularly from the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The budget, as presented, nevertheless seems to me to suffer from all of the hallmarks of an exercise undertaken hastily, which was cobbled together very much as an exercise in arithmetic rather than addressing some of the fundamental problems our party sought to address in our documents published last year.  Those fundamental problems remain.  Therefore the budget, while clearly focusing on the outgoing Government's targets in relation to borrowing and expenditure &mdash; presumably deriving some degree of satisfaction, if not glee, from the fact that those targets have been slightly clipped in this budget &mdash; perhaps missed the fundamental point, that it is not about arithmetic but rather a whole way of doing business, of addressing fundamental imbalances in the role of the State <i>versus</i> other areas of commercial activity which had been allowed to grow up over the year that must be addressed if we want to deal honestly and openly with getting our economy right.  The change of heart that has arisen in Fianna Fáil, the extraordinary somersault which has occurred, I suppose, one would have to chalk up to <Col N="992" /> a combination of political experience and expediency.</P>
    <P>Today all of that is history.  It is today with which we must deal and the parameters today are represented by the budget as presented.  For the first time it is a budget that makes a strong attempt to deal with expenditure and other areas of our economy, a budget which shows a prospect at least of getting through this House.  Nothing else really matters.  I might remind the House that there was not a Fine Gael budget, nor was there going to be a Fine Gael budget like this; there was a Fine Gael set of Estimates and I shall revert to that in a few moments.</P>
    <P>In broad terms the budget is and has to be welcomed by any fair-minded person despite the temptation to which we all succumb now and again to indulge in political point scoring.  There are no free meals and there never were.  I will probably get a bucketful of abuse for saying this but I wonder whether in some areas the budget has gone far enough.  The kind of approaches it has taken in some aspects of its presentation &mdash; indeed some of the comments of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he rushed in to defend the fact that none of the State agencies lost any money for their task of job creation when perhaps they should have &mdash; represent one of the fundamental questions we would pose, namely, whether the plethora of State and semi-State agencies operating as they do at present, loaded with talented people but completely without leadership or clarity of remit, should be allowed to continue in that fashion.</P>
    <P>On fundamental issues the budget has missed the mark.  For example, it has not done anything at all to imbue anyone with any degree of confidence or hope that a serious attempt will be made to deal with the employment crisis.  A vague gesture, a prayer or a hope that interest rates will be reduced and that, therefore, employment will follow is not sufficient for a Government who should be giving leadership.  The area of tax reform, which would bring about some degree of alleviation of the pessimism, gloom and <Col N="993" /> depression out there, should have been incorporated in this budget.  It would have helped everyone to have come a little of the way in facilitating the passage of this budget and its acceptance by the people.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable, but perhaps understandable, to hear inevitably predictable spokespersons for the same range of organisations fighting their corner and theirs alone.  I want to exhort this Government to stand up to every one of those sectional groups, to say that the whole is bigger than any individual group. When I hear people already threatening not to co-operate, people who have no interest beyond their own blinkered interest, then I am encouraged to exhort the Government to do all that is necessary. They can expect, at least from this party, as much co-operation as is possible in the political circumstances presenting themselves in taking on those interest groups provided the greater good of the people is truly what they are about and not appealing to or appeasing any sectional interest.  To that extent the comments of the Government thus far in their short term of office, in the manner in which they faced their day of appointment, their comments and much of the content of the budget are encouraging.</P>
    <P>However, in the area of employment and tax reform there is need for immediate remedial attention.  There is no point in saying to a people increasingly heavily taxed, people who in the budget are being expected to endure an additional income tax burden over last year of 14 per cent, or a figure of £333 million, that no attempt can be made to bring about tax reform.  To those who say: &ldquo;Yes, but how can that be done; would it not need more cuts?&rdquo; with respect, the answer is that we published a comprehensive document setting out how those proposals could and must be funded over a phased programme of four to five years, beginning the process of redressing what is now the most brutal tax regime in Europe.  If that is not attended to there will not be the public will to accept the very severe trickle down effects of this budget, on full employment, which is not yet fully <Col N="994" /> comprehended, and the full economic severity of which will not be experienced for months to come.  The budget speech yesterday was shorter than usual.  There was a relatively superficial presentation of the budget, a budget which had severe and significant cuts.</P>
    <P>The State still has the biggest involvement in our economy compared with any democracy of which we know.  About two thirds of every pound spent is spent by the State.  There is an inability or a lack of will in this House for us to say to some of the rash of State agencies that they are no longer needed, that their work is done or to say to more of them that the time has come to change their terms of reference and to rationalise organisations. That incredible area of consumption still remains, drawing extremely heavily on the public expenditure purse.  The systematic inefficiencies, the wasteful practices, the duplication and the overlapping have not been tackled though they are highlighted every year in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This report shows that Department after Department have incredible instances, not just of the occasional fraud and abuse which will occur from time to time, but of systematic inefficiencies leading to incredible waste.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Government to the fact that in his introduction to this year's report the Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that for the first time, due to his staffing situation he is not now in a position to guarantee a proper audit of what the Government spends of taxpayers' money.  I chaired the Committee on Public Expenditure in this House for four years and week after week we saw examples of inefficiencies.  Nothing has changed.  There is no point in trying to claw in from every corner increasing revenue if we continue to waste it.  It is questionable from any point of view, political, economic and moral, that we should continue to pursue that line. There was not even a gesture in the budget towards remedying that position. Indeed, the only suggestion for increased efficiencies were in areas outside of the <Col N="995" /> direct control of the Government, such as in the VEC's which I know from personal experience are run very efficiently, relatively speaking.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know how we can find £16.2 million in unspecified efficiency cutbacks in the areas mentioned, when under the Government's nose, outlined in 26 different reports from the Committee on Public Expenditure and in reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General, there are examples where tens of millions of pounds are being wasted.  None of this has been tackled because we lack the will to take on those who work in the executive branch closest to ourselves who cocoon us from the real world.  I hope that the cocoon of unreality which gradually enveloped the last Government will not envelope this one and that they remain in touch with the real world of people and commerce, ordinary people with ordinary problems.  We are there to serve the real world, and there are too many of us serving the real world, in this House, in the Civil Service and in the public service.  Unless that is tackled this war will not be won and there is not even a gesture in the budget.</P>
    <P>The only hope in the budget is that all going well interest rates will come down. That remains to be seen.  Undoubtedly there will be some improvement in interest rates but we are not convinced that that will be adequate to deal with the unemployment problem.  That problem was focused on in yesterday's budget by a device which the Minister in his speech this morning referred to in a little more detail than in yesterday's budget statement, that is the search for employment. It is an incredible suggestion that there will be 40,000 manpower scheme opportunities and that they will be provided simply by interviewing the people who are presently unemployed.  Every one of these people is interviewed every week, though perhaps not in detail, when they go to draw their dole.  Probably every one of them has registered with one, two or three different agencies, the Department of Social Welfare, AnCO or the National <Col N="996" /> Manpower Service and all their details are presently on files which in the context of one of the inefficiencies may not even be inter-related.  The Minister said that this will facilitate a significant reduction in unemployment.  That is a lot of nonsense. One cannot create employment by going over the rules again.  What this is about, and it would have been better had the Minister said so clearly, is his perception and perhaps the perception of many in this House that many people are abusing the system and that if they are called in they may not show up or if they do it will be seen that they are not really available for work.  It is a depressing view of the unfortunate people on unemployment assistance or benefit to imply that most of them are cheats.  I know there is abuse and if this helps to stop abuse it cannot be a bad thing, but let us not pretend that it offers some hope to the unemployed.  That was the high point of yesterday's budget in relation to jobs. If that is the high point in relation to jobs creation we have cause to look out.</P>
    <P>The arithmetic was interesting.  The budget provided a degree of one upmanship.  It went beyond the Fine Gael proposals.  Certainly many of the cuts are tough and will be hard to sustain and will cost a lot of people money and will also impose hardship on many others.  One somehow gets the feeling that it is very much an exercise like moving the chairs around on the Titanic but that the ship is on the same course, because the underlying causes of our problems have not been tackled.  It will take fundamental institutional reform, and structural reform of the system of Government to deal with it.  I am not sure that that appetite is there, based on yesterday's budget presentation.  Even if it had been addressed as something that could be done later this year, in perhaps a second budget, one might have said they were thinking along these lines, but that was not said.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note, despite the obvious support for the approach of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, in relation to the commercial area and the general reliance the Government are placing on the private <Col N="997" /> sector by encouraging them with a drop in interest rates, the careful avoidance in the budget of any reference to public ownership or privatisation.  The economic climate has been fundamentally changed in the last six to nine months by virtue of the establishment of the Progressive Democrats.  Privatisation was the dirtiest word possible a year or two ago.  Indeed it is still not a nice word. There are differences between the approach we wish to adopt and privatisation which is basically about auctioning off State assets.  We would not support that.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Government to accept that there is very great potential in joint ventures between Government and private interests in developing areas of State activity, and in re-equipping areas of State activity where at the moment there is not a prospect of getting development and investment over the next number of years.  There seems to be an almost religious barrier about this.  It is not mentioned.  It will inevitably come more and more into focus as the common sense of that approach becomes clear.  I would simply ask the Government who adopted a kind of kneejerk reaction to it during the election campaign, to reconsider. There is just a glimmer that they might be doing so in relation to the sale of some afforestation but there are many other areas where they could raise substantial sums.  One estimate last week from a private sector source suggested £200 million in one area alone, which would help the State and would not lose them control, if that is what it is all about, of that State asset.  It is possible to sell shares and yet not lose control of State assets.  I do not think the State as a corporate entity acting on behalf of all citizens has an automatic right to assume it has to have control because control is exercised on behalf of all.  As far as I am concerned, the State should justify any action it takes.</P>
    <P>The area of public ownership, or privatisation, is one the Government should address.  They seem to have refused absolutely to consider it, but I forecast they will be looking very strongly at it <Col N="998" /> this time next year, if they have not done so before then, and that they will be backing away from yet another election commitment they made when they said in their precipitate, too hasty and ill-judged reaction to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that in no circumstances would that happen.  I am not saying such a measure should be rammed through because there has to be consultation, but consultation does not mean talking until the other person comes round to your point of view.  Consultation means sitting down, listening and then making a decision, even if it does not please everybody. That is another major omission in the underlying strategy of this Government.</P>
    <P>In the area of tax reform it is extremely regrettable that the Government could find no option other than another extremely punitive layer of tax levied on income tax without any glimmer of hope that there would be tax reform.  One line in the Minister's statement referred to the possibility of tax reform; yet an additional £333 million was levied in yesterday's budget.  PAYE workers were hit by mortgage charges, health charge increases and so on.  In an effort to make the arithmetic fit the occasion &mdash; and I agree with Deputy John Bruton in this respect &mdash; these figures seem a little strained.</P>
    <P>There is a doubt about the Government's proposed duty free policy.  I see nothing wrong with it in principle.  In fact, it would not cost me a thought if that concept went out the door because I have often wondered why a certain elite who could afford to travel were entitled to duty free goods but if one could not afford to travel, one was not entitled to them.  I believe this duty free facility has been abused.  I hope the Government's measure works, although I have some doubts about it.  I am told there are doubts about its legality and administrative feasibility. At present it is apparently impossible to stop ordinary smuggling across the Border and I shudder to think what it will take to administer a scheme which expects people to prove they have been more than two days outside this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The £25 million withholding tax on fees is an exercise in doing it with mirrors.  It brings forward money from next year and is very likely simply to be passed on in many cases.  There are some anomalies in the system, because that fee will be levied only if more than half of that person's activities is with the State.  This is extraordinary.  Maybe we will hear more about this in the next day or two.</P>
    <P>The Government owe the House an explanation of this £16.12 million in unspecified extra economies in the VECs, the regional colleges and AnCO. I am familiar with the VECs and the regional colleges and I am sure they will be told to introduce these efficiencies.  In many cases they appear to be strained and their annual estimates have been pared back.  I want to know exactly what these extra economies would involve, or are they simply part of a wish list?</P>
    <P>I doubt the social or economic sense in abolishing one or two of the housing grants schemes.  The construction industry were expecting a great deal more from this Government.  From dialogue prior to the general election they did not expect anything if our party were in a position of influence, because we told them the money was not there, but that is not what every party said.  The Government have some explaining to do in that respect.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the £10 charge for hospital beds.  There is a political mood being engendered in the country which shows that most of us are accepting the inevitability that tough measures need to be taken.  In the rush to toughness this party will not support any measure which would affect the poor.  There is no need for the poor to be affected because they are not the problem.  If some kind of blunt instrument is introduced in this House and nodded through by a House which does not represent poor people but seeks to redress national imbalances and political omissions over the years by using it on people who are inarticulate and under-represented here, they will not have our support, and there is some indication of that in yesterday's budget.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not right that people who <Col N="1000" /> are genuinely ill and need hospitalisation, but who earn a few pounds above the medical card limit, should be so frightened by a charge of £10 per day that they may run the risk of not going into hospital.  Surely we have not sunk to this level.  I am looking for a complex of exemptions but I want the Minister to examine this again so that people who are genuinely unable to pay will not be expected to do so and that those who can pay will.  That is where the abuse is.  We know where the health cutbacks have fallen.  They have not fallen on the consultants, the doctors, the professional staff or even the hospital administration. They have fallen on the nurses and the patients.  Of course, the patients are not organised and nobody rang them yesterday asking for their views on the budget.  As I said, I hope the Government will look again at this proposal.</P>
    <P>I want to take up a point raised in Deputy Noonan's speech yesterday. Over the last week or so my party have been subjected to an unprecedented venomous attack by a number of Fine Gael spokesmen who lectured us on our political lineage, the purpose for which we are in public life, our approach to this budget, our standing on the political spectrum and a variety of other matters.  I am very saddened by that display of hurt, although I understand it.  It is a cry from people who feel very hurt by the recent electoral events and refuse to blame themselves but seek to blame everybody else.  I suggest, with a fair amount of respect, that they should get that out of their system as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>That kind of abuse, coming within hours from the newly appointed Leader of Fine Gael &mdash; not the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; is not the hallmark of a statesman, does nothing to further the national interest and does not augur well for the future.  Deputy Noonan did what I would call the bootboy on it, but we are getting used to that.  However, what I cannot take is the allegation from these gentlemen that the Government have stolen their clothes, the grand larceny reference.  That is a lot of nonsense.  Fine Gael policy is that of the past four aimless <Col N="1001" /> lost years, not a document which was cobbled together as an election programme. I am astonished at how glibly that deceit has been accepted by commentators, that somehow the last four years have been written off.  It takes some neck to come into this House and bleat about hardship cases when both Deputy Dukes and Deputy Noonan &mdash; and indeed the Labour Party who are regularly in the business of lecturing us also &mdash; were members of a Government who over the last two Christmases when there was money lying uncollected, as this Government have already shown, succumbed to clawing back a few lousy pounds from old age pensioners.  They also abolished food subsidies for the elderly without compensation.  I do not mind that if that is the policy but what I will not take is being lectured and being told that we are on the right &mdash; whatever that means.</P>
    <P>In our modest attempts to bring a degree of economic realism into the debate in the past six to nine months we produced documents.</P>

Therefore, let us cut out this nonsense and this continuous attack which is not helping anyone but which convinces us we are getting to many people in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new leader of Fine Gael was Minister for Finance for a number of years. In his budget of 1983 he made a number of comments about what he was going to do and it is in the context of how well he achieved the targets he put forward that we should now judge his approach to this budget.  I am not going to stay too long on this but it is worth putting this point on the record lest there be the assumption that one side of the House had it right all along and that suddenly Fianna Fáil whipped it from under their noses.  In his Budget Statement of 9 February 1983 <Col N="1002" /> Deputy Dukes said, and I quote from Column 1473 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The Government are totally committed to changes in taxation over the next few years which will result in a demonstrably fairer system.  The specific taxation measures in today's budget will bear witness to this commitment.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>My principal contribution to this process will be to see that procedures relating to public expenditure and taxation are updated and that Dáil Éireann is better informed on expenditure developments.</P>
    <P>I also intend to introduce reforms aimed at streamlining the Government accounting system.</P>
    <P>In 1984, he introduced another budget and at Column 801 of the Official Report of 25 January he said:</P>
    <P>There is a long way to go before we can claim that we have solved the problems in the public finances, or fully set the economy on the path of growth in employment and output which we all wish to see.  But we have made a resolute beginning and within the space of a year the results are already starting to appear.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We must continue with our programme of greater discipline in public expenditure; we must continue in our determination to reduce borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, and we must continue on the path towards the elimination of the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>In conclusion he said:</P>
    <P>This budget will keep us on course towards improving the public finances and strengthening the economy.</P>
    <P>In 1985, Deputy Dukes in introducing his budget said at column 1073 of the Official Report of 30 January:</P>
    <P>This year's budget is designed to bring us towards the objectives set out in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  It is part of the three-year <Col N="1003" /> policy framework set out in that plan.</P>
    <P>He said reform of the taxation system was needed and went on to say:</P>
    <P>Today's budget measures will ensure that developments in the public finances will be in line with the targets set out in the national plan.</P>

      <P>I believe that today's budget will have a positive effect on economic behaviour which is not immediately measurable but which will add substantially to the growth potential of the economy.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify any of these effects, and the budget arithmetic makes no allowances for them. Nevertheless, they could add up to a useful further impetus for expansion.</P>

His cumulative budgetary strategy has brought this country to the verge of an economic crisis.  I am not saying he did not do his best and I am not saying the Government did not try.  Perhaps they were hamstrung.  All I am asking is that they do not hypocritically lecture others. Let them get on with the job of building up what is clearly an extremely demoralised organisation and remedying in whatever way they can the hurt they have endured and which is obviously venting itself in the kind of spleen to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>That is not to say we have had not this from other Members of the House.  One does not expect a great deal from The Workers' Party.  They can be against everything all of the time.  The same is true of the Independents.  They can vote against anything which requires political courage.  The Labour Party ran away from the budgetary process and did not even try.  The previous Government discovered all of this a few months before the inevitable general election and after three or four years of bringing in the kind of budgets I referred to in the comments I made earlier.</P>
    <P>This budget is not perfect.  It is not the budget we would have introduced.  We would have aimed at the fundamental reforms we spoke about.  We certainly would have introduced a four or five year tax reform programme whatever it cost and however it was to be done.  We have shown how that was to be costed.  We certainly would have introduced rationalisation among State and semi-State bodies because that, too, is essential.  We all know it.  We certainly would have endeavoured in a number of ways to tackle the unemployment crisis.  We would have used a twin approach by the State to ensure that the mechanisms which it uses in a corporate way are focused on key areas of the economy from where it is clear the jobs can come. These are the areas the Taoiseach focused on when he appointed Ministers of State to deal with horticulture, marketing and so on, areas where it is clear <Col N="1005" /> there is going to be a return on investment.</P>
    <P>However, that implies you cannot continue to spend the same amounts of money in every other area.  The problem has been a lack of courage to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to anybody.  That would have been part of our budget.  It would have been part of our budget to introduce employee share-holding in State and semi-State agencies wherever possible.  It is time to revert to ownership of State assets by the people. In the first instance I am talking about workers in semi-State bodies owning shares in those agencies.  There is no point in pretending that the people own these assets by virtue of their being lodged in the hands of the State.  Quite often a citizen will not even get a reply from one of those bodies.  Such a proposal would have been part of our budget but there was no reference to it by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of tax evasion, and the tax system generally, including farmer tax, I hope that the new simple profile form approach the Minister is introducing will be put in operation simultaneously with the ending of the land tax.  If that does not happen we will continue to see the spectre of the farming community getting away with murder. There is no denying that.  It is an absolute injustice that a shop assistant working for a few pounds per week in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway is taxed to the hilt while substantial farmers are not paying any tax.  That is wrong.  The policy of my party is taxation by accounts but that is not to allow a lacuna of a year or two to develop between the abolition of one tax and the introduction of another system. That should not happen.</P>
    <P>Ultimately this is all about creating the conditions in our economy which will allow people to believe in themselves again, to believe that there is a point to working, that there is a point to investing and putting new ideas into practice in terms of small businesses, investing and re-equipping larger businesses and so on. That is not occurring now and instead people are taking the emigrant ship.  The budget seems to create a framework in <Col N="1006" /> which a stop is being put to rampant uncontrolled expenditure in every Government Department.  Despite all the promises made not one Government Department over the last four or five years had less money to spend in one year than it had in the previous year.  That is not controlling public expenditure.  The budget seems to create a climate in the public service in which there will not be pay increases or vacancies created although I remain to be convinced about the latter.  It is preposterous, obviously, to draw a blanket negative right across the board particularly in regard to certain key areas such as security and medicine. I presume there will be exemptions in regard to certain key areas but they were not spelled out yesterday.  In the area of public expenditure the budget seemed to say that there will not be any further easy rides, that the honeymoon is over.</P>
    <P>There is a need to get a climate in which jobs will be created, a need for institutional reform here and in the way Government operates.  What an area of challenge for anybody willing to take it up, a huge sprawling bureaucracy extending its tentacles into every activity of citizens? A person who runs a small shop told me that he has to complete 60 different forms annually.  That is incredible and we have to deal with it.  I hope that in future budgets the Government will tackle those areas.  If they do that in a fundamental way they will have our support.  From our point of view we wish them success in at least beginning the task.  The budget is not perfect from our point of view but at least it represents a beginning and is better than has been done for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what has been said on the budget and I welcome the broad support given to it.  While that support has not been total nevertheless it is unusual for a Government to have been given the amount of support that they have been given in this instance.  That is to be welcomed.  I agree with some of the points made by Deputy Keating.  It has been said that the argument about <Col N="1007" /> interest rates was thrown in to be the solution to all ills but that was not the philosophy outlined by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  In the budget our priority is to try to restore confidence in this damaged economy of ours as quickly as possible.  We are seeking to open new opportunites for employment and to achieve that objective we must encourage investment.  In order to do that we must bring down interest rates, something that will have the effect of encouraging capital back into the economy.  If we are to make any progress that is an essential precondition. Yesterday the Government demonstrated emphatically their determination to improve the budgetary position and reduce spending.  There were no give-aways or concessions and our whole strategy was to turn the economy around rather than satisfy the wishes of individual interest groups.  I am glad that that is in line with the thinking of Members of the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Keating that we face a major challenge.  All Members in recent years have referred to the necessity to control expenditure and to make savings but nobody has done anything about it.  Such proposals have always merited a line in the speech of the Minister for Finance on budget day but, for example, in the past four years the national debt doubled.  Yesterday we saw the first real sign by any Government in the past ten years that they proposed to take harsh measures in the interest of the country.  We are trying to make the country a better place to live in, to give our people a better quality of life and some prospects for the future.  It would have been nice for the Government to say that after three weeks in control they were able to reduce Government expenditure, were in a position to control the current budget deficit, the public capital programme and public sector borrowing while at the same time being able to introduce a number of incentives, handouts or grants to reduce unemployment but that was not possible.  Needless to say that was considered.  In that regard I cannot do any better than Deputies <Col N="1008" /> Bruton and Keating did in their contributions. It was not possible to embark on such a programme because of our financial position.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise the Government for not adopting certain measures but at the end of the day after all the tightening of belts, cutbacks and savings we will still be borrowing more than £1,800 million. That is a figure people should bear in mind.  Responsible people will see that in the last few weeks we have tried to call a halt, to bring in controls and to get it across to people that the gravy train has arrived at the final station.  We must look for areas of real growth and encourage investment back into the country.  We must convince people in the commercial sector that it is worth their while risking investing money here.  Very few in the past four years have even thought about investing their hard earned money here because of the level of interest rates. They will not invest it until they are convinced that the Government are prepared to live by the figures outlined in the budget.  In the past Ministers may have attempted to bring in a tight budget but they allowed the figures to overrun left, right and centre.  We will have failed if we allow that to happen.  We must stick firmly by the figures and indicate to the financial world that we have stabilised our money markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The submission which was lodged with the European Commission on 4 February 1987 is concerned solely with the reclassification of all the existing less severely handicapped areas as well as areas where mountain <Col N="1011" /> sheep headage grants are paid to more severely handicapped status.  While we are pressing to have these proposals approved, the final outcome will largely depend on the attitude adopted by the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>As regards extension to the disadvantaged areas, no application has been made to the European Commission and this process will take a considerable time to bring to fruition, given the detailed field survey work involved.  The position in each of the different areas throughout the country will be most carefully considered in this review.</P>
      <P>No funding was committed in the Estimates for 1987 by the previous administration to cover the costs of reclassification which must be fully met by the Government in the first year.  In this situation, it was not possible to make the necessary provision for the additional headage payments in this year's budget. However, I can assure the House that this does not deter me from pressing ahead with the Irish case for reclassification of areas with the EC Commission and the groundwork for extensions to the disadvantaged areas.  I am most anxious to have both these matters finalised so that the accruing benefits can be enjoyed by Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now stating categorically that he is refusing to follow the procedures which were followed in previous years when Supplementary Estimates were introduced to cover any extension or reclassification. This did not necessarily involve extra money since it might have involved savings in other areas.  That was the procedure last year and in previous years and I am very disappointed that the Minister has now indicated he is not prepared to follow that procedure in the current year. Am I correct in saying that a very substantial amount of additional land is involved?  Can the Minister give the number of acres involved by way of reclassification of less severely handicapped areas to severely handicapped areas?  Can he also tell me the number of extra acres for which we applied in relation to the reclassification of mountain sheep grazing land?</P>

      <P>Regarding the first question, the likelihood of any funds becoming payable this year would be very remote in any event because of the fact that the Government only submitted the application on 4 February for redesignation from less severely handicapped to severely handicapped.  The Deputy must be aware that full examination of this proposal by the Commission takes a very considerable time.  It is very unlikely that they would have completed that examination before the end of this year. Accordingly the question of funding in 1987 does not arise.  On the second question, the amount involved in the extension of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas would be of the order of 85,000 hectares.</P>

Will the Minister undertake to use his best endeavours to have a favourable decision in Brussels expedited?

To my knowledge, such an application was lodged on 16 January last along with other areas.  It had the goodwill of Brussels but it needed the commitment of our Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that to his knowledge an application was made in January regarding these areas.  I do not know the source of the Deputy's knowledge, particularly as he was not a Member of the House at that stage, but I have said the application was made on 4 February.  I take it the Deputy will accept that as a fact.  I have assured the Deputy that while that was done very late in the day I have already, in my constant contacts with the Commission, reminded it of the urgency of dealing with that <Col N="1017" /> application.  I have also made the Commission aware of the fact that as soon as I can bring in an application for the extension of areas I wish to have it dealt with quickly as well.  The Deputy made statements in good faith which have been published in local newspapers but as far as I know they are not in accordance with the facts.</P>

Is that correct? Secondly, in relation to the extension, does the Minister accept that there is a provision in the directive which permits increases in the less favoured areas and that on that basis a detailed review had to take place here so that we could submit the 85,000 hectares involved in filling such 1.5 per cent provision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 9, 14, 23 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community milk cessation scheme was established to buy up 2 per cent of the national quota, approximately 22.6 million gallons with effect from 1 April 1987 and a further 1 per cent, about 11.3 million gallons, from 1 April 1988.  The quotas bought up are abolished and are <Col N="1024" /> not available for re-distribution.  Under the scheme producers receive compensation payments at the rate of approximately 23 pence per gallon over seven years in return for the surrender of their quotas and their undertaking to cease milk production.  The first stage of the scheme to obtain the 2 per cent reduction has been completed.  The scheme was well oversubscribed with the total applied for amounting to 44.4 million gallons or almost double the 22.6 million gallons required to achieve the 2 per cent restriction in quotas.  Under the Community regulations at present the excess milk can be brought up only if the State makes the compensation payments to the producers who are surrendering their quotas.</P>
    <P>No Exchequer funds are available to buy up the excess milk offered under the cessation scheme and the industry is not prepared to provide funds for such a scheme unless it can operate so that there is no loss of quota from one co-op or dairy to another.  This is not at present allowed under the Community regulations.</P>
    <P>In response to Irish requests the EC Commission brought forward some time ago a proposal to amend the regulations which would enable new entrants and other special category farmers to purchase permanent quotas available within their co-operative areas as a result of other producers ceasing production.  As a result of a decision by the Court of Justice of the Community certain legal difficulties have arisen in regard to this proposal and the matter is now being examined further by the Commission. My Department have recently discussed the legal problem with the Commission and I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the second stage of the cessation scheme under which a further 11.3 million gallons of milk are to be bought have not yet been finalised.  I will be making an announcement in the matter shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that there is a golden opportunity <Col N="1025" /> here with applications for 22 million gallons of surplus milk and that every effort must be made to ensure that arrangements are made so that the 22 million gallons can be made available to those in need?  Even if there are legal or financial problems surely it is not beyond the competence of the Minister to enter into discussions with the co-ops, the financial institutions, the farming organisations and the EC so as to overcome those financial and legal problems.  Does he not accept that that is the challenge he must face in relation to those 22 million gallons of milk and that every effort must now be made to set up such a procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the matter is one of considerable importance and that every attention must be given to it.  The Deputy will be aware from the reply I have given that the first stage of the scheme terminates today.  I regret that.  It might have been possible, had extensions been sought in advance, to perhaps extend the first stage of the scheme but that did not prove feasible in the time available to me.  Any extension of the date would have been required to have been notified a considerable time ago, certainly not since the change of administration.  I am sorry that in the time available to me it was not possible to have the first stage date extended.  I wish it were possible.  However, I assure the Deputy that I will take account of all he has mentioned.  I am anxious to ensure, as I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House are, too, that we maximise as much as possible the productive capacity of those who would wish to opt into the scheme to take up what is being made available by those who opt out of the scheme.  That is my priority as I know it is the priority of those who put down the question.  I very much regret that, as the scheme terminates its first stage today, it is beyond the bounds of my capacity or authority as Minister for Agriculture to have it extended.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the applicants for the first scheme were selected on a lottery system and that <Col N="1026" /> a number of disappointed unsuccessful applicants now hope that their application will be considered in the 11.3 million gallon milk scheme?  Is it possible that they can be facilitated?</P>

      <P>I want to give every priority to those who made application for surplus milk under the first scheme and who were unsuccessful.  I will give every priority to them in consideration of the second stage in particular having regard to their productive capacity.  That is what we all want to achieve in the national interest.  The Commission had clearly indicated well in advance to the previous administration what the time limit was and how it must be applied.  I was bound by that and I had no opportunity of changing what might have been changed earlier.  I wish I had that opportunity.</P>

      <P>My concern is for young farmers who are at present producing milk and who are anxious to increase their quota.  This quota is available for people who were not successful in their application for the cessation scheme.  Will the Minister make arrangements to release the quota and in doing so put a price on the gallon of milk?  If it became freely available, large farmers would outbid smaller farmers.  There is still a place for the small family farm in the dairy industry.  I think the Minister will agree that if we are to raise cattle numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will people at the top of the current list have to apply again for the cessation scheme towards the end of the year or will the present applications that are in the Department be sufficient for the extra 1 per cent?

Will he guarantee the House that he will hold on to the excess milk offered under the cessation scheme until he has a restructuring package in place, to allow the younger and perhaps more efficient farmers who have indicated their willingness to stay in milk production to get a permanent quota or extra quota where that is needed, rather than return the excess milk offered during the cessation scheme to those dairy farmers who have indicated their unwillingness to continue?</P>
      <P>Would he also agree that he must concentrate production in areas of greatest natural advantage and thereby concentrate it in the areas where we have efficient producers?  Has he any plans to revise the distribution of the national quota bearing that in mind, and to allow extra quotas to the areas and the co-ops where there is a demand for production and there is efficient production in terms of cow numbers, rather than concentrating it in the areas where obviously the land and other factors militate against efficient dairy production?

I am very anxious to ensure within that framework that we use our quotas to the advantage of the efficient producer but also to maintain and support family farm income in <Col N="1029" /> all areas.  It would be appropriate for me to say that our only criteria will be those who produce most efficiently in the milk belts, if you call them that.  We must take account, quite properly, as mentioned by the European Commissioner, of the social aspects of agriculture, particularly in our country.  I want to ensure that a fair balance is struck in respect of the more severely handicapped areas of the west generally.  We hope that the decisions we take will encourage maximum production in every respect within the existing quotas that have been determined.</P>

Secondly, would he exempt all farmers with up to 30,000 gallons quota from any reduction in their quota and would he bring some order into the sale of quotas which are now making the ridiculously high price of 25p to 30p per <Col N="1030" /> gallon, militating against the small producers who are unable to pay this price? Would he agree that the large dairies and people in the manufacturing business are allowing only larger farmers to get their quotas, which militates against the smaller producers.

I am glad to note that the Minister mentioned the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  There is at the moment this extraordinary anomaly whereby one farmer decides to apply for the milk cessation scheme and for one reason or other changes his mind and finds that he cannot opt out, whereas in the very same co-op area somebody who applies is told that there is an over-supply.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a sizeable number of farmers applied under the provisions of the milk cessation scheme at a time when the quotas were being purchased at 14p per gallon.? Unfortunately those applications were not sent to the Department but rather withheld by the creameries because they were hoping to become involved in the distribution of this quota.  As a result, when the price increased to 22p per gallon those applications were submitted but many were late and many farmers who had applied, say in October, have been omitted because their applications were not forwarded by the relevant creameries. What plans has the Minister to deal with those people?  Furthermore, would he agree that the reallocation of the additional 22 million gallons applied for was held up because of legal difficulties with the Commission?  Did he not inform the House, when he answered the question, that discussions were in train with <Col N="1034" /> the Commission in regard to these legal difficulties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware this Government attach special importance to the development of the food industry.  This is highlighted by the widening of the functions of the Department of Agriculture and Food to include food and the establishment of two special offices of the food industry and horticulture represented by my two colleagues here.  The House will be aware also that the Taoiseach announced this morning the redesignation of my responsibility as Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>In approaching the problems of agriculture and food production, import substitution will be an important element.  I should point out, however, that a number of reports in recent years have concluded that a small proportion only of our food imports can be replaced by home production and that we should concentrate on those areas where import substitution is most practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have identified horticulture as the main sector where success can be achieved.  The new Minister of State will concentrate on implementing Government policy for the development of horticulture so that the industry may <Col N="1035" /> increase its share of the home market and, in time, develop exports.  A particular challenge is the replacement of the 36,000 tonnes of frozen potato chips imported into this country last year.  I am pleased to say that the Industrial Development Authority have recently approved a grant-aid package for an £18 million investment project for the production here of 30,000 tonnes of frozen potato chips for the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>My Department operate a number of schemes to improve the production and marketing of potatoes and vegetables. There is, however, an urgent need for greater co-ordination within these sectors to meet modern market requirements with emphasis on providing well-presented high quality produce in continuous supply all the year round.</P>
    <P>In the food area generally, the IDA continue to seek out opportunities for import substitution to bring to the attention of firms in the food industry.  Substantial grants are available from the IDA for projects aimed at import substitution and many of these also qualify for further grant-aid from FEOGA under Regulation 355/77.  In this connection, I announced last week a £15 million EEC aid package for the pigmeat industry over the next three years.  This package will help to finance the rationalisation programme for pigmeat slaughterhouses, which is designed to make the industry more competitive on both the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, EEC rules governing free trade limit the action Governments can take to restrict food imports.  However, these same rules enable us to export large quantities of food to other countries.  In 1986, our export earnings, including transfers from the European Community in respect of market support measures and so on exceeded £3 billion compared with imports of just under £1 billion.  While everything possible within EEC rules will be done to help Irish industry to compete with imports, in the final analysis import substitution will be achieved only if those <Col N="1036" /> in the industry are able to compete successfully with imports in such areas as price, quality and delivery performance.</P>
    <P>I might add that my two colleagues who have responsibility in respect of the food and horticulture sector will have a major role to play in this area.  Because this question overlaps into those areas on this occasion I am dealing with it, but the Deputy's question relates to matters in respect of which my two colleagues will have specific responsibility in the future.</P>

Furthermore, would he agree, particularly in major urban areas, that it is not merely a question of the availability of high quality goods at a reasonable price but also a question of the marketing strategy on the part of his Department?  Will the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the Department for Industry and Commerce, become involved in a high-powered marketing campaign in urban areas to draw housewives attention to the need to concentrate on purchasing Irish goods which is sometimes overlooked?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the issues she raised are <Col N="1037" /> far-reaching, of fundamental importance and could raise a number of issues to which I could not reply in detail in the course of a parliamentary reply.  That being said let me assure the Deputy that these matters are already being addressed by way of liaison between myself and my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so as to co-ordinate the functions, some of which operate under the aegis of the IDA at present and which will be transferred to my Department. Second, the market analysis of the kind to which the Deputy referred will be a major function of the new responsibility of my Department along with my two colleagues.  I agree it is an important matter.  The Deputy will also agree that while she is concerned initially with import substitution, and that the two go hand in hand, penetrating export markets is the best way of creating the base for domestic outlets as well.  I sympathise with the Deputy's case and it will be a fundamental priority of our departmental role henceforth.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I should like to wish the Minister and his two colleagues well, particularly the two junior Ministers in their new role.  The question I want to pose relates to food imports.  Approximately three years ago in this House the question of horticultural imports, especially their processing, was raised and, because it was raised in the House, received widespread media coverage which seemed to have the desired results.  At present we have approximately 1,000 tonnes of frozen peas in our cold stores while at the same time being the victims of what I consider to be dumped products from the United Kingdom, products being offloaded on us because of a temporary over-supply there.  I would like my colleague in the opposite benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food the proposals he has in relation to animal disease eradication and in particular the 1987 round of tuberculosis testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to disease eradication is to restore the impetus to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme which was lost following the reduction in funding for the scheme in 1986.  With this objective in view the next round of testing, comprising a monitor of the national herd coupled with special programmes for badly affected areas, will begin on 21 April.</P>
      <P>In the case of brucellosis my intention is to preserve and build on the substantial progress made towards eradication in recent years, so that we may achieve our ultimate goal of final eradication in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the manner in which the scheme is presently operated or does he see a case for significant changes in the management and operation of the scheme, particularly the TB eradication scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could be satisfied with the manner in which the scheme operated considering the expenditure so far committed and the fact that while the incidence of bovine TB has been drastically reduced we are still faced <Col N="1039" /> with the fact that we have not reached the desirable target.  Everybody involved acknowledges that the most important thing is to have a comprehensive multi-annual programme.  It appeared that the programme was being launched in 1985 as part of a three year comprehensive attack on this disease, but unfortunately the estimates for last year were not nearly adequate to maintain the very considerable progress made.  For that reason it is my intention as far as possible that there will no longer be a stop-go approach to bovine TB.  This is why I will shortly introduce a motion here to enable me to increase the levies to include the scheme, which simply make up the funds that would have been provided by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept, in the light of his last comment about increasing the levies, that there will be far more resistance which may not be overcome or may best be overcome by having a greater farmer involvement in the planning and operation of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that there would be farmers involved, whether directly or through organisations, in the planning and operation of the scheme.  It is a matter for co-operation between the farmers, the veterinary profession and the Department.  In the reorganisation of the management of the scheme those elements will be taken into account.  In case there is any doubt about my reference to levies, the purpose of the motion I will bring before the House is to raise the same amount of money by way of levy as the outgoing administration were planning to raise, but because it will come into operation later than was originally envisaged in view of the election and the consequent delay there will have to be some slight increase in the amount of that levy.</P>

      <P>We will talk about <Col N="1040" /> the money when the motion comes before the House but at the moment I am more interested in better value for money.  Bearing in mind what the Minister said, would he see any case for some form of independent authority to run the scheme, taking into account the present huge costs of the administration of the scheme?  I understand that there are about 1,400 civil servants involved in the administration and that the administration costs here are approximately twice the level of administration costs in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, the levy element has increased substantially. The running costs of the scheme this year will be approximately £30 million and the farmers' contribution by way of levy will be £19.4 million, almost two-thirds of the total cost.  For that reason there are a number of priorities that will have to be considered in the review of the scheme that will take place. We will examine its effectiveness, its management and we will minimise where possible the commitment from the taxpayer's money which has been a very consistent element.  We will have a full analysis of the success of the scheme in various areas.  To do that it will be necessary to have a complete round this year and that is why the extra funding is required.  I hope in the course of the year by checks and analyses that will be conducted to get the information which will enable us to draw up a more comprehensive programme somewhere in the second half of this year.  In the meantime I will have discussions with the farm organisations, the professionals and all concerned to ensure the development of that kind of programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not have been morning or bedtime reading for the Deputy during the course of the election campaign but our programme indicated very clearly that it is our policy to establish a land authority.  Clearly that policy remains.  The Deputy will acknowledge that it would be asking the impossible to expect the outlays of that right now after such a short while in Government.  As the outgoing Government decided to dissolve the Land Commission and legislation was prepared and has been awaiting Government approval and circulation for some years, I am anxious to ensure that no such delay will occur in our case.  The necessary legislation to transfer functions was not circulated and we have waited more than two years for this to happen.  I want to assure the Deputy that we will approach this matter with great urgency.  This commission was abolished in 1984 but we did not have any legislation to give real effect to what the Government did.</P>

Can the Minister say at this stage and in the light of that commitment if the Land Commission will be <Col N="1043" /> abolished?  If the answer is in the affirmative, what would be the scope and scale of the land authority referred to in the Fianna Fáil programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the consequences of a decision taken by the outgoing administration in 1985 was to transfer the bulk of the Land Commission inspectorate to the farm tax office.  That seriously affected any programme for land restructuring.  The bulk of the Land Commission staff were transferred to an office which produced a gross income of about £2 million.  Now that has been terminated, we will be able to reallocate those people to their proper professional functions and ensure that the land authority and their policies will be given effect as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy tried to bring before the last Government proposals in respect of land restructuring, but apparently they did not accept his proposals.  I would be happy to receive submissions from him, and to act more efficiently on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The range of facilities and incentives available to the food industry for research and development is quite considerable. Grants of up to 50 per cent, subject to a maximum of £250,000 per project, are available from the IDA towards the costs of researching and developing new products or manufacturing processes.  In addition to these grants, firms who wish to establish their own in-house research and development facilities can also qualify for grant-aid from the IDA towards the capital costs involved, subject to a maximum of £150,000, and up to £15,000 <Col N="1044" /> to cover the cost of salaries and travel expenses and to assist companies to undertake studies necessary to identify new markets and new products.</P>
      <P>State assistance towards research and development is also available from An Foras Talúntais, IIRS, SFADCo and the universities, especially UCC.  All of these research facilities and services are available to the food industry for confidential product and process development.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the level of funding available to the food industry for product development is adequate.  I am disappointed, however, with the industry's response to IDA grants and the State research facilities, especially those at AFT and UCC, which are very much under-utilised.  I urge food processing firms to devote more resources to product development and to avail of these incentives and facilities to the maximum extent possible.  This is essential for the success of Government policy which is designed to encourage the food industry to move away from commodity products into high quality consumer type products, which have a much greater value-added and employment content.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the report but the reality is that for 1986 only 7 per cent of all research and development grants approved by the IDA were taken up by the food industry.  There appears to be a reluctance by that industry to take up the grants and assistance available.  As I said, I am disappointed with that because we need to get away from commodity products and on to consumer orientated products which have much greater job potential.  The Government are assisting and encouraging the <Col N="1045" /> industry to avail of these grants but there are risks involved in new product development and the industry appear to be reluctant to take those risks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are committed to taking the necessary measures to halt the haemorrhage of the loss of jobs.  After four years of high taxes, high unemployment and high emigration, this Government have framed a budget containing a range of measures specifically designed to confront our single greatest <Col N="1091" /> challenge &mdash; the problem of unemployment. The implementation of these measures will provide the basis for a recovery which will start to create more jobs.</P>
      <P>Before lunch I was trying to explain to Deputy Bruton and Deputy Keating that it was impossible to discuss these two measures together.  I said our priority is to restore confidence in the economy and to open new opportunities for employment. To achieve this objective we must improve investment, reduce interest rates and encourage capital flows into the economy.  It is naive for anybody to argue that all this can be done in a short three week period.</P>
      <P>This budget represents the essential starting point for economic recovery.  The Government recognise that unemployment reflects our economy's failure to adjust to the circumstances and opportunities of today.  Unemployment represents, in terms of both its social and economic cost, a burden which we cannot continue to bear.  Determined and concerted action is required, using every means at our disposal, in order to tackle the problem.  The success of the measures outlined in the budget yesterday, especially those directed to tackling unemployment, will ultimately depend on the understanding and support of the community as a whole, on the responsiveness of the administrative machinery, and especially on the efforts of employers and trade unions at local level.  The only complete and satisfactory solution to unemployment is the creation of jobs.  It is clear that new jobs will not materialise unless all the resources of the community are mobilised in a positive and co-ordinated way harnessing the talents, skills, creativity and energy in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are determined to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the modest improvement in economic conditions abroad, particularly within the major markets of the EC and elsewhere, in order to achieve faster rates of growth and employment.  These objectives call for improved competitiveness and the progressive introduction of <Col N="1092" /> necessary changes to expand our share of freer and more efficient markets.</P>
    <P>Our labour market policies will have to be directed to achieving higher rates of job creation as distinct from simply preserving existing employment.  The Government have identified the scope for improvement.  They now call for a contribution from everyone involved, even where that means difficult or uncomfortable change, not least for the majority who have jobs.  They aim to enhance the job prospects of the unemployed and socially disadvantaged so as to prevent their total exclusion from participating in economic activity.</P>
    <P>These goals cannot be achieved without concerted action and effort on behalf of all interest groups in society, but particularly trade unions and employers as well as the Government.</P>
    <P>Economic life today entails a faster and continual process of change.  Technical and technological change usually helps to improve productivity and income. However, it can also impose severe social costs on individual workers and communities.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Government to see that burdens and gains are equitably shared with particular reference to those at the end of the jobs queue and in greater need.  Special measures have now become necessary to provide for the needs of the unemployed and those whose jobs are most at risk.  The fact is that the longer people are out of work the harder it is for them to get back into active life in the labour market.  Despite the safety net which these provide, there will always be vulnerable categories who lose their jobs and whose restoration to active occupation is a difficult and challenging process.  Income maintenance schemes can help but they are not enough.  It is better, therefore, that prevention measures, such as adult retraining and further education, should be provided.</P>
    <P>The scale of the unemployment problem with which we are now confronted as a nation is daunting.  At the end of February there was a total of 252,500 <Col N="1093" /> persons on the live register, corresponding to an unemployment rate of 19.4 per cent.  Over the past four years registered unemployed has increased by well over 100,000 to the stage where unemployment now exceeds a quarter of a million.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment has continued to increase as a proportion of total unemployment.  The Government's announcement of a major reorientation of the activity of the manpower agencies in the form of a Jobsearch programme for 150,000 unemployed persons is a measure of the kind of response which is needed to provide assistance to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Some of the points made on the job search programme this morning were totally negative.  This programme is an effort to assist those who are unemployed for a year or more.  These people feel that they have been neglected by the agencies and feel that society and the administrative machinery of the State care little for them.  They have continually put forward to all of us in this House that the system has an obligation at least to be interested in their needs and to assist them.</P>
    <P>In the job search programme we have highlighted all the agencies which can help these people.  If there are people on the live register who should not be there they are breaking the law but the purpose of the programme, and what I hope it will do, is to give the long-term unemployed an opportunity to be properly interviewed in a professional way by the National Manpower Service who will be geared to handle this task between 1 May and 31 December.  The purpose of this programme is to try to assist and advise people and to show them the wide range of schemes which are available.</P>
    <P>Many Members in this House are not fully aware of the range of schemes that are available.  There are 29 very detailed programmes, some are complex, some are straightforward, some have complicated guidelines and others have very simple ones.  The long-term unemployed, many of whom we met during the recent campaign, and who have not for years <Col N="1094" /> been interviewed by the National Manpower Service, have a right to be brought in not just for a 30 second interview but for a detailed interview.  There the options which are available to anyone on the live register will be pointed out to them and the National Manpower Service will tell them about the considerable training and employment scheme opportunities which are available.  To say that is anything other than a positive move is incorrect and ignores the views of the long-term unemployed.  They wish to know what is going on and they wish to be assisted and helped.</P>
    <P>The one example I have often used, including when in Opposition in this House, is that if you happen to be a person who cannot write a letter of application, who cannot spell well and who happens to have the wrong address &mdash; which occurs when you happen to write to certain employers &mdash; you require assistance and advice.  A properly organised National Manpower Service are able to give that help.  Under the job search programme 40,000 places in the various training schemes will be kept for the long-term unemployed.  Twelve thousand places will be kept on special job search courses, including also the enterprise allowance scheme, the employment incentive scheme, the social employment scheme, the teamwork scheme and the work experience programme.  The AnCO programmes specialise in areas such as computer training and they will help people to obtain jobs.  There are also the CERT and Youth Employment Agency schemes.</P>
    <P>No one in this House can truthfully tell me that all those schemes are known to the long-term unemployed and that they know how to get on these courses.  The fact is they do not.  Perhaps they should know and perhaps it is all written down somewhere for them but under the job search programme these schemes will be explained to them in detail and they will be given advice on how to register for these courses.  Forty thousand places on these training schemes will be held for the long-term unemployed this year and a further 12,000 places are being held for <Col N="1095" /> those taken in on special training courses who will be shown how they can assist themselves.</P>
    <P>According to the latest figures available in October 1986, in excess of 100,000 persons were unemployed for more than 12 months.  This compares with the long-term unemployment figure of 49,418 in October 1982.  The incidence of long-term unemployment is far more widespread among the older age groups, those over 25, than among the youth.  In round figures, about 80,000 people over the age of 25 have now been unemployed for at least a year.  When allowance is made for the fact that many of them are married people with families to support, it is obvious that in their case the social and economic side effects of unemployment will impinge on a much wider group.  At the end of February, there was a total of 76,899 persons under 25 on the live register, or 30.5 per cent of total unemployment. The youth share of the live register has generally remained constant over the past few years, at around 30 per cent.  Since the start of 1982, youth unemployment has increased by over 80 per cent from a January 1982 level of 41,700.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that long-term unemployment cannot be treated in isolation from the solution to the overall unemployment problem.  It must be recognised, however, that the long-term unemployed experience particular difficulties. Even in a situation of increasing labour demand such disadvantages are still likely to persist.</P>
    <P>The longer people are unemployed the more rusty they are likely to get about work habits, their motivation becomes undermined and they are likely to become less confident about their ability to compete for a job.  In fact, such people are unlikely to find jobs simply by applying. Their experience of failure in finding jobs can lead to a loss of self-esteem and can result in depression and a too-ready acceptance of unemployment as a trap in which they have got caught.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme announced <Col N="1096" /> in the budget is designed to tackle headon the problems of chronic unemployment which keep some people out of the active workforce for months rather than weeks.  The limited schemes which were run in a number of locations have shown that it is possible to help the long-term unemployed to obtain a fairer share of the available jobs and training and temporary employment.  The Government have taken a bold step by extending the programme to the entire country and targetting it at a total of 150,000 people currently on the live register.  As part of the programme all of these unemployed people will be offered one-to-one counselling interviews and guidance on how to improve their job finding techniques.</P>
    <P>The participants in the programme will be able to avail of a minimum of 40,000 job opportunities which have been reserved for them between now and the end of this year across the range of schemes provided by the manpower agencies.  An additional 12,000 persons will be given places on special job search courses between 1 May and 31 December of this year.</P>
    <P>The manpower agencies are gearing themselves up to undertake this important task.  The staff of the manpower agencies have already shown their energy and commitment in developing a wide range of new schemes to assist the unemployed in recent years.  I would like to pay a special tribute to the staff of the National Manpower Service which now provides the main gateway to opportunities on special employment and training schemes.  I am convinced that they will respond positively to the new challenge. Personal interviewing will transform the target figure of 150,000 unemployed persons from a collection of statistics and files into people.  When the faces behind the files turn up for interview they will undoubtedly reveal a range of skills and experiences which could lead in a number of directions.</P>
    <P>By directing that the resources of the manpower agencies should be immediately concentrated on a major programme of assistance to 150,000 <Col N="1097" /> unemployed persons, the Government have made it clear that they are not prepared to await the enactment of the National Employment and Training Bill to see that these resources are used effectively. The challenge faces us now.  The active measures being taken from today &mdash; only three weeks after we came into office &mdash; show clearly the kind of general policy direction the new authority will be expected to pursue.</P>
    <P>The pivotal role which the National Manpower Service are being given in assisting the Department of Social Welfare also reflects the positive way in which the National Economic and Social Council viewed the significance of their contribution as the focal point in identifying, classifying and placing persons in the context of the range of special programmes now in existence.  The National Economic and Social Council correctly recognised that the era has ended in which the placement service could afford to adopt an arms length approach towards the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Inevitably it follows that the operational links between the manpower agencies and the Department of Social Welfare will be strengthened as part of this radical new programme.  It is also inevitable that the majority of the clientele of the NMS will now come from among the registered unemployed and that it must increase its awareness and sensitivity towards the problems of the group which it is assisting.  The additional resources necessary to carry out the nation-wide job-search process will be made available by redeployment of staff to the Department of Social Welfare from other areas in the Civil Service and by the re-allocation of resources within the Department of Labour and its manpower offices.</P>
    <P>Long term unemployment becomes a massive handicap in the search for jobs. Employers will often show a preference for candidates with recent work records. Already the experience of the pilot schemes conducted to date has shown that the knowledge and skills imparted were significant for the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> The feedback from the pilot schemes also showed that what those who went through the programme valued most was the motivation they received from the courses and the encouragement they got to undertake intensive job seeking activities.  In addition to those who went on to find employment, quite a number of participants on the pilot schemes opted for places on suitable training courses with AnCO or expressed an interest in the various other special employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced that action on this scale is needed to restore the morale and self-respect of many of those who have been without a job for several years.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware the National Employment and Training Authority Bill, 1986 which was designed to give legislative effect to a number of decisions contained in the White Paper on Manpower Policy lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil in January last.  In the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill it was clear that there was a large measure of agreement for the White Paper and the principles underpinning the Bill itself. In order to ensure the most efficient and effective delivery of manpower programmes and schemes it is necessary to provide an integrated service by bringing together, as far as possible, the various manpower agencies into a single body. In the present economic situation it is essential that our scarce resources are developed and used to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>The House will recall, however, that certain reservations were strongly voiced about a number of features of the National Employment and Training Authority Bill particularly in relation to the relationship of CERT to the proposed Authority.  I accept that in view of CERT's particularly close association and involvement with the tourism sector &mdash; which has been identified by the Government as an area with substantial potential for employment growth &mdash; there may be a case for allowing CERT to retain its distinctive identity.  Just how <Col N="1099" /> this can best be achieved is under consideration at present.  I have been reviewing the position and will make a decision on the matter shortly.  I intend to press ahead with the reintroduction of the National Employment and Training Authority Bill to the Dáil after Easter.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that in our Programme for Government particular emphasis was placed on the need for regionalisation of manpower services to make them more responsive to local requirements.  It is my intention to see that the new authority will be structured in such a way as to ensure that there is a strong regional bias in the organisation and delivery of its services to the public.</P>
    <P>It is now timely to have a radical rethink about how to make the integration of manpower services more effective at local and regional level.  What I have in mind is not simply the rationalisation of the existing manpower agencies or ensuring closer collaboration between them and the education system and the administration of social welfare at local level.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at other means of improving the relationship between the manpower services and their clients. I intend to explore the extent to which scope exists for improvements in flexibility so as to deal with the variety of client needs.  I also intend to look to the scope for innovation in regard to our delivery systems and services and to a greater degree of devolution of decision-making. Obviously, the plans for the development of the National Employment and Training Authority will reflect the Government's policy on the devolution and decentralisation of decision making.</P>
    <P>Very often community groups have demonstrated valuable creativity in developing ideas of job creation and temporary employment.  Such groups also have the capacity to generate resources at the very level where unemployment and its consequences are most visible and where the commitment to action is most urgently needed.</P>
    <P>Our support services in the manpower field must be ready to respond to the <Col N="1100" /> challenges and opportunities in local employment initiatives.  We must guard against any danger that these administrative services might act as gatekeepers rather than as stimulus agents where local projects are concerned.  Looking at the experience of many of the community based programmes and the success of the social employment scheme, I think that we can go much further in harnessing the potential of community-based organisations as vehicles even for operational purposes such as delivering services.</P>
    <P>I have been struck by a new positive approach towards direct action to assist the unemployed which is being adopted by some trade unions at national level and by many trade councils at local and regional level.  In my view the most notable of these new developments is the special jobs fund established by the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland in 1985 to assist the unemployed on the basis of a levy imposed for a three year period. Already it has assisted a number of projects throughout the country including the recently established Ballymun Unemployment Centre. I fully appreciate that there has been a history of extensive involvement on the part of trade unions in the work of the manpower agencies. In fact the co-operative and constructive approach taken by the trade unions by and large towards the development of the social employment scheme grew out of their favourable experience of involvement at national and local level with AnCO's community youth training programme. In the case of the social employment scheme trade union co-operation has been forthcoming in resolving many practical problems and in ensuring the successful integration of worth-while projects involving work which would not otherwise have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Schemes like SES and Teamwork have also been used by groups in many cases composed of local trade union activists to support drop-in centres geared to offering an open-ended commitment of support to the unemployed for as long as it takes them to find a job.  Youth Employment Agency grants have also been made available through the Irish <Col N="1101" /> Congress of Trade Unions to assist the establishment of centres for the unemployed people administered by trades councils in a number of urban centres.</P>
    <P>I see the Government's job search programme as a complementary initiative and as another means of helping unemployed people to find jobs for themselves.</P>
    <P>An essential element in the job search programme announced in the budget is the recognition that the unemployed do not constitute a homogereous group. Irish case studies point to a variety of factors which can be identified in addition to the normal categories such as age and duration of unemployment.  Other important indicators include economic and social characteristics such as local rates of long-term unemployment, the level of services and facilities available in the community, previous employment histories, accommodation etc.  The existence of such a critical variety of factors highlights the need for carefully targeted measures rather than responses based on crude classifications.  A strategy based on flexible and cost effective measures will go further in helping those worst hit by unemployment and will improve their chances of getting back into work.</P>
    <P>The Government are confident that, with the benefit of coaching in job-seeking techniques, some of the participants in the programme will secure employment. This should help to equalise the job chances of all those looking for work by equipping those on the programme with the same job-seeking skills and techniques as those who, up to now, have been socially and educationally more advantaged.</P>
    <P>The various schemes operated by my Department will continue to have an important role in their own right in the fight against unemployment.  While some schemes provide worth-while temporary employment and work experience, other schemes like the employment incentive scheme and the enterprise scheme will help maximise the employment impact of an improving economic situation.</P>
    <P>The funds originally provided for the SES would have limited average participation in the scheme to about 7,900 <Col N="1102" /> persons.  As a result of the changes announced in the budget it will now be possible to put a further 1,500 long-term unemployed people back to work under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The SES is now widely recognised as a very worthwhile scheme which breaks the cycle of long-term unemployment while, at the same time, improving the local environment or enhancing the provision of voluntary services.  We have no shortage of worthwhile projects awaiting the green light so I expect the extra 1,500 places to be taken up quickly.</P>
    <P>The enterprise scheme has been helping unemployed people to become self-employed by giving them a weekly payment in lieu of unemployment payments. The funds allocated for the scheme will mean that we can help about 80 people a week to become entrepreneurs provided they come up with worthwhile projects. This could mean about 3,000 new small businesses between now and the end of the year with the help of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme encourages employers to take on extra workers by giving them generous wage grants.  Last year employers notified about 10,000 recruitments under the scheme to the National Manpower Service and we would expect at least a similar number this year.</P>
    <P>Teamwork provides grants to community and voluntary bodies for the temporary employment of young unemployed people on projects of value to the community.  The scheme is aimed primarily at those unemployed for six months or more.  Close on £6 million has been provided for this scheme in 1987. This will mean that about 2,500 young people could participate on Teamwork projects.</P>
    <P>I have previously emphasised my commitment to greater employee involvement at the workplace and in the running of enterprises.  I propose to press on with the enactment of the Bill to extend arrangements for worker participation in the public sector which is now with the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Bill has two main purposes.  It provides for the development of worker <Col N="1103" /> participation below the level of the board in a broad range of State enterprises at the request of a majority of employees. The Bill also provides for the appointment of worker directors in three further State enterprises &mdash; Aer Rianta, An Foras Forbartha and the National Rehabilitation Board.  The Bill had reached Committee Stage when the Dáil dissolved.  It is my intention to seek restoration of this Bill to the agenda of the incoming Seanad.  In the meantime I hope to be able to consider the views of all the interests concerned with a view to proceeding with the Bill in both Houses over the coming months.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to proceed as soon as possible with the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Bill, which lapsed with the 24th Dáil.  Work on oil rigs is notoriously hazardous.  The Bill will facilitate the proper regulation of health and safety standards for offshore installation workers.  Exploration installations have been operating in Irish waters for over 15 years and the Kinsale Head gas field came on stream in 1978.</P>
    <P>The safety of the workers in the industry has been governed by a condition in licences issued by the Minister for Energy, requiring the companies concerned to comply with the requirements set down in a document entitled <i>Safety Instructions for Offshore Petroleum Operations</i> issued by my Department. So far these arrangements have operated satisfactorily but it is highly desirable that they should be placed on a statutory footing as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned in recent years about the delay in bringing forward legislative proposals and an apparent uncertainty which affected some proposals as soon as they were unveiled.  My approach will be to select a number of practical and sensible measures which will safeguard the welfare of workers without raising any obstacles to flexibility or the expansion of jobs.</P>
    <P>In the general area of safety and health at work, it is my intention to give early legislative effect to the main recommendations of the Commission on Safety, <Col N="1104" /> Health and Welfare at Work &mdash; the Barrington Commission.  This is a comprehensive reform measure and will involve a &ldquo;framework&rdquo; approach to legislation. I have asked my Department, in liaison with the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health, to give priority to the completion of their work on the drafting of the legislation which will extend legislative protection to all employers, workers and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I intend also to give priority to incorporating into domestic law European Community standards on precautions in the use of lead and asbestos and to introducing legal controls on liquefied petroleum gas.</P>
    <P>The primary emphasis in the Government's programme is on creating economic growth.  One of the factors which has a key role to play in ensuring conditions which will facilitate the attainment of this objective is a good industrial relations environment.  As a small open economy many of the factors influencing our economic performance are outside our direct control but industrial relations is one area which we can influence.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government have shown that they are prepared to help set the framework for the nation's efforts. The Government have already stated their intention to create a forum in which the social partners can negotiate the terms of a national plan for recovery.  The reform of industrial relations practices could be an important element in this approach to consensus planning.</P>
    <P>Employment creation in this country depends also to a considerable degree on our ability to continue to attract foreign investment in the face of increasing competition for this investment.  Foreign investment is highly mobile.  Large companies are not interested in the historical, structural or cultural reasons for our industrial relations problems.  In looking at the overall industrial environment they are only interested in the effect of these problems on their business.  Will delivery dates be missed?  Will orders be lost?  Will return on investment be reduced?  If they are not happy with the answers to these <Col N="1105" /> questions they can choose not to locate here or not to increase existing investment.</P>
    <P>Good industrial relations cannot be legislated into existence.  It is primarily the responsibility of those actively involved in the day-to-day operation of negotiations and industrial relations practices to contribute to the creation of an environment in which existing firms are more likely to expand employment and new firms are more likely to be established. Our aim is to involve the social partners directly in planning the route to recovery and in ensuring that this team approach is also extended right through to the development of greater co-operation in the workplace.</P>
    <P>With regard to my own sphere of responsibility for labour affairs, I intend to have meetings with the representatives of employer and trade union bodies, as well as other interests associated with the work of my Department in the coming weeks so as to be able to draw on their constructive contributions in shaping my own programme of work in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me wish the Minister for Labour well in his portfolio.  As the youngest member of the former Cabinet, I will be keeping an eye on him. Perhaps he should reconsider his decision to retain the office of Lord Mayor.  I remember in 1981 and 1982 the strenuous objections by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition to members of the Labour Party and our partners in Government remaining in office in local authorities and corporations.  I know that each of the portfolios which Deputy Ahern, as Minister for Labour and as Lord Mayor of Dublin, holds are onerous and very distinguished offices.  It would be in the best interests of both that he should consider his position and do his duty to this House.  That is not said in any personal way.  I know the Deputy understands that, but I know that in the past it was a precedent in this House that Members, on being appointed to Cabinet, resigned from local authorities and corporations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget was introduced quite <Col N="1106" /> briefly yesterday by the Minister for Finance. The details will unfold over the next couple of weeks, it will take a considerable period of time for them to do so and it will not be clear until then how savage a document the budget is.  It will also become clear that a massive con trick was perpetrated on the Members of the House and on the public generally by the Minister's presentation yesterday which was perhaps the briefest budget introduction in the history of the State.  It would have been more appropriate perhaps if he had delivered the speech today, April Fools' Day, because it certainly was a massive hoax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like interrupting Deputies but I am sure that, when Deputy Spring realises what he said in referring to the budget as a con trick, he will realise that it does not do justice to himself, to Government generally or to the reasons for having discussions of this nature.  I suggest that perhaps there is a more appropriate term which could be used by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an area into which I do not delve too often and, therefore, I am short of terminology in that regard. What was presented yesterday by the Minister for Finance in a strong and stern manner was a misleading document in relation to being a solution to our economic problems.  Does that pass the acid test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inference that a Minister in any Government would be anxious to mislead the House.  On reflection, I assume that a former Minister would have regard for the feelings of others in relation to remarks of this kind.  I am formally putting to the former Minister and Leader of the Labour Party that, generally speaking, we should be careful to avoid phrases of the kind used by him. However, I will not interrupt the Deputy any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I <Col N="1107" /> accept your guidelines.  However, I wish to direct your attention to some of the speeches made from the Opposition benches in post budget days for the past four years.</P>
      <P>The budget which the Minister presented on behalf of the Government was based on three fundamental principles and he said that one of them was the need for a special focus on unemployment. That statement must either be a typing error or a wrong statement by the Minister because the rest of his speech concentrated directly on driving people out of jobs.  It could only have been written with a view to creating a special focus on unemployment.  Throughout the brief speech there are gaps, unfinished sentences, details not filled in and, indeed, many Members of the House had to wait for this morning's newspapers to find details not included in the speech or in the Principal Features of the Budget.  They were reserved for the press briefings which were given away from the scrutiny of the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to focus on some of these areas but first I want to lodge my protest in the strongest possible manner about the way in which the whole budget process is being rammed through the House today and tomorrow.  The Government propose to make a huge number of cuts in the living standards of the poor sections of the community in the social welfare area and to make their situation even worse by charging for basic, essential health services.  The changes they propose would be illegal if they did not change the law and, therefore, the Government propose to introduce two new Bills, today and tomorrow, to carry out some of the most fundamental changes we have ever seen in these areas and ram them through the House in a very short period.  The Seanad will sit on Friday to pass the legislation so that it can be signed by the President before the weekend.  The only reason for the haste and the rush in relation to these matters is so that they can be introduced by Monday next.  It is a scandal, anti-democratic and a flagrant abuse of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> What is as bad &mdash; if not worse &mdash; is the fact that this cannot be done without the co-operation of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats and it appears that both these parties have given their consent to allow this to happen today and tomorrow.  Even if Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats agree with the proposed cuts and with the measures in health and social welfare being put through the House without adequate debate and the opportunity to highlight how mean and petty the cuts are, there should not have been agreement to allow them to go through the House so quickly. I suggest the only reason they are agreeing to curtail debate is that they obviously agree with the cuts although they are afraid to take responsibility for them. They believe that, by allowing them to be rammed through in this way, nobody will notice the role they played and that the impact of the cuts will be obscured by the publicity for the whole budget. People who act like that do not deserve to be called an Opposition in the House.</P>
    <P>The cuts in health and social welfare are among the most savage attacks on the poorer sections of our community that we have ever seen.  The rights workers have paid for over many years in social welfare are being taken away at the stroke of a pen.  From next Monday, people who begin a period of unemployment will know what it is like to live in the year of the poor law.  People who become unemployed are being told in the budget that it is their own fault and that they will have to pay for losing their jobs by being deprived of benefits to which they are entitled.  They will probably be told by some Members of this House that it is good for them to be without work and to do without, that it will give them an extra incentive to look for alternative work.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that poverty is good for anyone.  The hardship which the Government will inflict on the unemployed from next Monday is shameful.  It will also be compounded by an assault on their dignity which will take the form of a new and sinister job search programme which was not clarified by the Minister for <Col N="1109" /> Labour in his contribution to the debate. One of the massive gaps in the speech of the Minister for Finance to which I referred earlier was in this area.  You could search and re-search the Minister's speech without finding the true meaning of the Jobsearch programme.  It was not until he was questioned by the press last night that he admitted the centre will be an effort to find what he regards as malingerers and deprive them of any benefit, thereby effecting a spurious reduction on the live register.</P>
    <P>I and every Member of this House should be asking the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Social Welfare how this is to be done.  If one can believe what one reads, 150,000 unemployed people are going to be interviewed during the remainder of this year in the 40 Manpower centres, and they are to be offered one of the 40,000 places.  I am not sure whether we should call these places jobs, placements, positions or training courses. By my calculations that means 4,200 unemployed people being called in during each working week, 22 in each centre on every working day.  Have the Government and the Ministers concerned in particular studied the details and implications of what this means? Obviously, no extra staff resource is being made available to find the people, to carry out the interviewing or to find the jobs.  Presumably they are to be given an option.  Manpower will tell them that they have been unemployed long enough, something which most people on the live register hardly need to be told because they are well aware of it, and that they must now go to work at whatever job may be designated or face the alternatives.</P>
    <P>What will those jobs be?  Will they be what the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, who now supports this scheme, once sneeringly referred to as &ldquo;pulling nettles in our graveyards&rdquo;?  Will they be local jobs?  Will the unemployed have to travel?  Will there be a rate of pay or will it be subject to the Minister's whim?  Will they be asked to fill vacancies in essential services which cannot be filled otherwise because of the total embargo <Col N="1110" /> introduced yesterday by the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>What will happen to people who do not believe that they should be asked to do jobs for which they have no training, skills or background?  What will happen if they are ill when summoned to an interview? Will the prospective employers involved have any say in relation to selection, assignment, suitability or any other essential issue?  Above all, where are these 40,000 jobs to come from?  Why can the Government not tell us the truth about this scheme?</P>
    <P>I suggest that Members of this House, particularly those who have been involved in public life for many years and doing their clinics on a regular basis, are well aware of &mdash; most Members of this House will have attempted to impress this on employers &mdash; the necessity of taking on extra people, of starting schemes to try to encourage people and communities, but where are these jobs to come from?  I and, indeed, the Labour Party will be pursuing relentlessly both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour in relation to these jobs on a weekly basis, on the basis that as of next week they are going to have to interview 4,200 people, and we will be asking what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>It is rather ironic that two-and-a-half years ago when the former Minister for Labour introduced the social employment scheme, if I recollect correctly, and I think I do on this occasion, it was derided at the time by the Opposition benches as a &ldquo;make work&rdquo; scheme.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected.  I am glad to hear that the scheme was supported by the then spokesperson on Labour.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Jobsearch programme, there is a calculated and deliberate attempt to frighten unemployed people.  By its operation it will serve to remove the last shred of dignity left to people who are without work.  The summons from the Manpower offices will come to be seen as yet another threat, thereby changing for all time the role Manpower have been playing and are supposed to play and the perception that should be attached to the Manpower offices.  Turning Manpower into Big Brother may have its Orwellian overtones, but there are definite Cromwellian similarities as well and perhaps the cry for 1987 shall be &ldquo;To Hell or to Manpower&rdquo;. If so, it will be a matter of great shame for everyone involved.</P>
      <P>The notion arising out of yesterday's finance speech that there are 40,000 available jobs is rather pitiful.  As I said, we have all been involved in working to create jobs, to get job placements for people and to ensure that people are given the dignity of work.  However, the direction of yesterday's budget, its impact and the effect it will have on jobs and job creation in the economy, rather than creating 40,000 jobs, will go in the other direction.  Fewer jobs will be a able in two months' or four months' time than at present exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perhaps the most deflationary budget we have had in years, certainly in the past five years.  It is taking millions of pounds out of the economy and this can only have a disastrous effect on employment. A good deal of the money that has been taken away has been taken from the poor.  Apart from the moral issues this raises, which are very profound, money taken away from the poor is money that would have been spent on home produced goods.  In terms of real jobs there is not one single specific job creation measure in this budget.  The massive reduction in the public capital programme will have a disastrous effect on <Col N="1112" /> the building industry which the Opposition party bleated about during the last four years and to which they have made over the years detailed and specific promises and, God knows, we in Government had to listen to long playing records from the construction industry about the fact that if Fianna Fáil were in power the problems of that industry would be over.</P>
    <P>The absence of any tax relief will reduce the disposable income available to families, the PAYE sector.  This will depress demand further and lead to more unemployment.  The increase in the tax take from, generally speaking, the PAYE sector is the largest that most Members of this House can recall.  It will amount to almost four times the rate of inflation. The impact on jobs of this approach will be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, not only is this budget going to do absolutely nothing positive about jobs, it will have an enormous negative effect.  This is an extraordinary outcome from a Government who campaigned for four weeks about growth and development.  The only growth possible as a consequence of this budget is the growth in the hardship that thousands of people are suffering already, and the only development possible is the development of deeper and deeper divisions between those in our society who have and those who have not.</P>
    <P>The great irony is that the Government have adopted willy-nilly the philosophy of the Fine Gael element of the previous Government.  The arguments now being made by Government Ministers are practically the same as those which they denounced with passion on our television screens a few weeks ago.  Now the only claim they make is the one that the Fine Gael members of the previous Government made constantly, that their proposals would create jobs by the simple route of driving down interest rates through cutting Government borrowing. This theory remains to be tested, certainly in this country.  In Britain we have seen examples of how this theory was meant to work and has been working.  In Britain they say that the incentive to work has been restored there and the level of <Col N="1113" /> Government borrowing has been driven down.  The result is that the numbers out of work have reached historic proportions and the country has been divided into two societies as never before.</P>
    <P>I do not believe nor I think does any Member of this House believe that this is what Ireland needs for the eighties. Even if interest rates fall rapidly in this country by as much as five per cent they will still be at much the same level as they were 12 months ago, and there is very little evidence that those much lower interest rates of private sector investment had anything like the level we need to solve our economic problems.  As the Fianna Fáil Party admitted during the election campaign, what we need as a basis for solving some of our economic problems is a consensus about how our problems must be tackled, and that consensus must be generated among the groups and interests who can contribute to growth and fairness.  It must be generated not by making concessions across the board but by recognising and channelling the contribution they can make. One of the largest sectors that can make such a contribution is an efficient and dynamic public service.</P>
    <P>How do the Government respond at the first occasion possible to this challenge? They can identify the challenge. They launch an attack on the public sector the likes of which we have not seen before.  It is unprecedented in its severity and its lack of fairness.  It may be quite popular in certain circles to talk about cutting public service pay but it is based on a misconception and on some mischievous propaganda.  The public service are regularly and routinely described as underworked and overpaid but this is a totally untrue picture of the realities of the public service.  Less than one-third of the public servants earn more than £11,000 per annum.  Less than five per cent earn more than £20,000 a year.  I will give an example of some of the very basic levels of salary that people in the public service survive on.  For instance, about 90 people in the Taoiseach's Department, out of a staff complement of 150, take home £120 a week or less.  I will <Col N="1114" /> bring these figures to the attention of the many critics of the public service.  There is no good reason why people such as those I have given examples of should be the only ones in the community who are forced to forego any wage increase in 1987.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party already committed themselves to amicably resolving &mdash; that was the expression used by them &mdash; the teachers' outstanding grievance over their special pay award.  How are they going to do that within the parameters of a pay freeze?  The House is entitled to know what proposals the Government and the Minister for Education have in this regard.  How will they live up to all the promises they made to interest groups throughout the community, many of whom are paid from the public purse?  Perhaps some of those promises may be easily forgotten when a Government start facing up to the serious economic problems.  It is worth recalling so that we maintain the realities and focus on the problems in front of us in this House.  Some of the promises which were made glibly and offhandedly in the last number of months by the Fianna Fáil spokespersons were basically along the following lines.  There would be £200 million for the construction industry; there would be relief in the region of £300 million for farmers.  We also heard at Question Time today a sum of £50 million will probably not be forthcoming for disadvantaged areas if there is re-classification in 1987.  There were to be major reductions in VAT along the lines of self-financing cuts which is practically a myth; there was to be the abolition of the deposit interest retention tax which was later downgraded to a review &mdash; we would now be inquiring as to what is happening with that review.  There was to be the abolition of local charges, the abolition of residential property tax, a reduction in the top rate of tax from 58 per cent to 50 per cent and two-thirds of the taxpayers were going to be put on the standard rate of tax.  These are the sort of promises, a political shopping bag, that were made in the last number of weeks. It is a sad cry from what we were treated <Col N="1115" /> to in this House yesterday.  It is no harm reminding Members of the House and the public generally of what was on the television screens and what was on the table less than six weeks ago.  There is hardly a table left at all after yesterday.</P>
    <P>There have already been rigorous controls over public service numbers in the past number of years.  I will be submitting to the House that any further cuts will be counter-productive.  It is hard to see how further cutbacks can be effected without drastically impairing the health service, essential local authority and education services and security.  The cutbacks envisaged here, even if they can be operated, will have a disastrous effect on the quality of life, an effect that will not be fully appreciated until the services which have possibly been taken for granted by many members of the community begin to disappear.</P>
    <P>We should not be under any illusion in relation to the package which was unfolded yesterday and which will be unfolding on a gradual basis in the next couple of weeks.  Local authorities will get notification of their allocations, many of which had been directed before 10 March but which were put on a total freeze since Friday of last week.  There will be a requirement in regard to the local authorities &mdash; I am not sure if the same will apply to the health boards &mdash; that a redirection be given in relation to allocations and permitted expenditures for 1987.  That will have to be given as a matter of urgency because at present there is practically a total freeze on local authority work and expenditures.</P>
    <P>One of the hidden features of the Minister's speech yesterday is the cut of £30 million in the revenue available to local authorities.  This will bite very hard on the work of local authorities and the maintenance and services provided by them during the coming 12 months.  I would be very surprised if that type of cut did not result in job losses.  I suspect that is the only recourse that will be available to the managers and the accountants in the local authorities when they are trying to put their budgets together for <Col N="1116" /> the remainder of this year.  It is a strange cut by a party who campaigned so vigorously both at local and national level in relation to the local charges for the past four years.  One of the options is that they can reintroduce charges at twice the rate that ever existed previously. Another is that they can begin the process of laying off about 4,000 local authority workers.  As the details of this cut filter through the effects will be absolutely disastrous. It will have an enormous impact on local communities all over the country.</P>
    <P>I suspect there are very few Deputies in the House today who have not received queries or contact in relation to the massive scale of cutbacks in relation to home improvement grants, new house grants and grants available to local authority tenants who are trying to better themselves. From contact with my own party members and looking at the newspapers today, I can honestly say that the phone lines are jammed in the Department of the Environment today.  Any Minister who can stand before the House and retrospectively cut entitlements in this area is not acting in a very just manner. Many thousands of young couples and single people with the intention of getting married have been working very hard to put together the basic cost of housing. They have calculated the money required on the basis of the grants available to them.  Some people, those aspiring to move from local authority houses to new houses which they will build themselves, now have a shortfall of £7,250 in their calculations.</P>
    <P>There is no possible way that these people, most of whom are working for meagre and low salaries, will ever be able to provide the housing which they had intended providing.  Many of these people will have sent in their applications over two months ago and signed contracts, subject to loan approval, for the acquisition of housing and this will now go by the board.  It is quite unjust and I shall be appealing to the Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to have it reviewed. Notice should have been given to persons <Col N="1117" /> who were intent on purchasing housing because of the impact this will have.</P>
    <P>I am quite concerned about the impact of this measure on the building industry because it will have an adverse effect on house starts and house sales, certainly in the coming weeks.  However, I am more concerned about the fact that many thousands of people who were in a position to house themselves, to take themselves off local authority housing lists, to provide housing from their own resources, will not be in a position to do so. Members of the Fianna Fáil back benches and of the other parties in this House should also put it to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment that this facility should be restored to give some justice and equity to the many applicants for these housing grants.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, many small builders throughout the country will be seriously affected.  From my own experience, many people who had been unemployed heretofore, many who had been, in fact, in the black economy, were quite happy to come into the legitimate economy, to register for VAT and income tax when these grant schemes were introduced with the prerequisite that people had to be registered.  For once, I believe we had been making a positive step towards eliminating the advantage to small builders working in the black economy as against registered regular builders.  Now, at one stroke of the pen that has all been set at nought.  It will affect the builders, the small builders in particular, and the aspiring young couples who were hoping to house themselves.  There was an incentive and it is one that in justice and humanity you cannot remove &mdash; and remove retrospectively.  It was particularly insidious to remove it from a date prior to yesterday's speech.  One could understand if for some reason, given the state of the public finances, notice were given that these would be scaled down from a certain date forward, and if the Minister for Finance were to say that where contracts were signed they would be acknowledged and the grants would be paid.  For people who have signed <Col N="1118" /> contracts, many two or three months ago, to be given this blow was a very sad day's work indeed.</P>
    <P>Likewise, in the health area the effect will be detrimental.  The health boards and health agencies as we head into the month of April, have not been informed of their individual and reduced allocations for 1987.  Because of that and until that is done, the full impact of the health cuts proposed by the Fine Gael Government as of 20 January and largely contained in this budget is as yet wholly unappreciated by the public at large or, indeed, by those who work in the health services.  The 1987 Estimate for health boards, for the voluntary hospitals and other agencies such as for the mentally handicapped, was cut by £40 million.  In addition, the GMS medical card scheme was cut by £30 million.  All these agencies involved are three months into their expenditure for 1987.  They are entitled to know their allocations, in accordance with the long established practice in the Department of Health, immediately following publication of the Book of Estimates. In the past the health boards have always been informed before the start of the year.</P>
    <P>The publication of individual allocations will make apparent in the starkest of terms the precise reality that each hospital and health board programme faces and the precise impact of the cuts decided upon.  It will be absolutely horrendous. These cuts cannot be realised without ward and hospital closures, without great increases in waiting list numbers, without job losses.  I know from my own experience that for certain operative treatments which are required at present by constituents of mine there is already a waiting list of 12 months in hospitals in Cork.  I suspect this is now about to be doubled by virtue of the cuts in the funds available to these hospitals and, indeed, to the Southern Health Board.  I presume the same will apply right across the board with the other health boards as well. Obviously there will be job losses and to that must be added the obvious antisocial decision not to replace any staff who leave.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> Perhaps worst of all is a matter which needs the attention of this House because it will be debated at some length here this afternoon when this debate is adjourned to enable Deputies to focus on the new regulations and the amendments to the 1970 Health Act.  In terms of impact on ordinary people the most severe effect will follow the new charges being imposed.  The outpatient charge of £10 is perhaps something that we all have been expecting for some time.  The silence of Fianna Fáil on the subject during the election campaign was perhaps testimony to their intentions.  However, the £10 charge per day for maintenance must shock even the most hard hearted of Fianna Fáil supporters.  I am glad to hear echoes of shock from those on the right who sit on my left.  These are people who advocate cutting public expenditure, rolling back the State and who use all these grand global expressions which hurt when one comes down to implementing them.  This £10 charge per day will be extracted from people who are already perilously close to the poverty line.  Now we are penalising people in this way because they are ill, or have had an accident. I do not know how the Minister for Finance, and in turn, the Minister for Health can justify this charge to this House this evening.  How can we regard ourselves as a civilised society and yet impose a charge of this nature?</P>
    <P>The staff who will operate this charge will obviously be placed under intolerable pressure by the new impositions, in addition to the already onerous burdens which the cutbacks will mean.  I would not be at all surprised if the staffs of our medical institutions refused to operate this new scheme.  I also would not be surprised if the persons of whom this charge will be demanded will not pay, because I do not believe they should be asked to pay it.  It is quite an immoral charge.  All we need to have is an example of a low wage earner who is £2, £5 or £10 over the eligibility qualification for a medical card and a person on a salary of about £120 or £130 per week who has to spend seven days in hospital.  In effect, it will cost the <Col N="1120" /> greater part of that person's salary.  It does not make sense in relation to what we have been trying to achieve here and the services we have been trying to supply.  I certainly am not aware of people going to hospital for the sake of going to hospital.  There is, perhaps, an anomaly in the VHI scheme whereby treatment is not covered unless people spend a night in hospital.  That should be rectified by the Department of Health to encourage treatment on the same day.  Certainly that does not apply to non-VHI, non-medical card people because hospital is not a place anybody wants to be.</P>
    <P>Something that has not been highlighted to date in relation to this budget, which is also a mean and low aspect of it and which to the best of my knowledge remains uncontested by the other right wing parties in this House, is the proposal to remove over £7.5 million from overseas development aid.  There is a grotesque irony about the amount, in question when one considers that, in the past 12 months, the Irish people voluntarily gave £7 million to Live Aid.  Now the Irish Government in effect are taking it all back.  We must ask ourselves: have we become so inward-looking, as a society, that we are prepared to cut back on the paltry amount of money devoted each year to assistance to the Third World Whatever our problems at home, and they are many, there can be no excuse for taking out those problems on people who are, as we all know, literally starving. I believe this proposal would cause horror and shame among people who believe that ours is a Christian, caring society.  There is little in this budget which would make anyone believe there is a Government here interested in developing a caring society.  What is more sad &mdash; and perhaps is not surprising in some ways &mdash; is that there are very few Deputies in this House who are prepared to stand up and fight this trend.  The actions of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, particularly with regard to their abstention on votes so far, is a sad reflection of how much the sterile, divisive attractions of right wing economics have taken hold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> An aspect of this budget which perhaps bodes ill for the long-term consequences for this country is the diminution in capital taxes coupled with the abolition of the land tax.  From my discussions with small farmers &mdash; and I will attempt at various times to defend small farmers because large farmers have adequate defence mechanisms &mdash; they certainly had no objections to the land tax.  I believe what was involved was reasonable as was the basis of calculation.  Given the diminution and decrease in capital taxes here from 1965 to date Fianna Fáil are being consistent. There was their abolition of the wealth tax back in 1977 and now their abolition of the land tax.  How they can stand in this House, how many of their rural backbenchers can stand in this House, and defend actions like the abolition of wealth tax of some years ago and that of land tax as of last evening, and claim to represent working people or the PAYE sector, is something I cannot understand.  It is rather tragic.  I am not one to quote from the bishops too often but it would be worth putting on the record that in their 1977 Pastoral the bishops said that justice does not happen, that it has to be willed, worked for and built into legislation.  They said that only a combination of moral commitment to justice and political commitment to the legislation and the structures of justice would create a just society.  They went on to say that the Christian must keep insisting that property, wealth, profits, jobs and incomes are not absolute rights but carry with them weighty moral and social responsibilities.  We should keep those comments in front of us because there was no attempt in yesterday's budget to establish equity in the tax system or to place on the owners of property and wealth, on those making profits on those in jobs, a social and moral responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress the notion that the budget constitutes a starting point, that it is a preliminary and essential clearing of the ground.  I should like to <Col N="1122" /> welcome also the historic consensus achieved in this House on the direction in which we need to go.  In itself the budget does not constitute a recipe for growth nor does it pretend to.  Rather is it the essential precursor of that recipe, a recipe we are fully determined to provide. Nobody should be in any doubt after yesterday's budget of our commitment to cook the omelette, as it were, that that commitment is as strong as our readiness and courage to break the eggs.</P>
      <P>Inevitably this budget contains cutbacks but we do not make the mistake of thinking that, in themselves, cutbacks can promote growth.  Cutbacks constitute only a prelude to such growth.  I should like to assure the House that we have not changed in the smallest degree our firm conviction that real growth in the economy and in particular export-led, market-driven growth constitutes the only way in which to get the country back on some sort of stable course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget has sent an unmistakable message to the financial world and that of industry in general.  The message is simple: the new Government mean business, they will deliver and will do whatever needs to be done to gain control of the State's finances which have been in disarray now for some years, and put some firm direction into our economic affairs.  The significance of that message is that it should remove, once and for all, the uncertainty that has paralysed our economic activity for the past year at least, if not longer.  We are told repeatedly from all sides of the house that what the world of business hates most is uncertainty, above all that created by doubts of whether the political will exists to put hard decisions into effect.  One only has to speak with anybody who has been engaged in business for some years past to get that message loud and clear.  They have doubted the existence of such political will.  After yesterday they will not doubt the existence of that political will again.  Surely there can no longer be any doubt in anyone's mind as to the existence of that political will today.  It is for that reason I particularly welcomed the <Col N="1123" /> consensus arrived at in the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>This budget was designed to restore confidence among those whose actions are most directly connected with our ability to create more wealth in our economy. Already there have been indications that the budget is having that highly desirable effect.  I might quote just one example of this early reaction &mdash; and it is an early one only &mdash; in referring to the comment in <i>The Irish Times</i> today by the Investment Manager of Abbey Life Assurance, a major insurance company when he said:</P>
    <P>Yesterday's budget in my view marks the first serious attempt to come to grips with the problems of the public finances in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>That is a fair description.  I am confident from my soundings that it is a view shared widely, particularly in the business community.</P>
    <P>I was pleased also to note the favourable reaction today to the budget by the Irish Exporters' Association in respect of whom I have some direct responsibility and links.  For exporters particularly I do not need to tell the House that lower interest rates are a major concern.  As most people now know and accept fully, bringing about lower interest rates is the keystone of the budget strategy.  What is also crucial for exporters is the certainty of exchange rate stability within the EMS.  The budgetary provisions have provided effective reassurance in that regard.  Exporters need certainty of exchange rate stability.  Lower interest rates will lead to that certainty in exchange rate stability and significantly boost exports in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to use this occasion, my first opportunity to speak to the House as Minister of State with responsibility for the exporting area, to assure all our exporters that this budget framework is but a first step in a radically new approach to the task of developing and promoting Irish exports.  It is true that in the budget provisions CTT have suffered a cutback, albeit a small cutback, in their allocation. <Col N="1124" /> That is a good illustration of the paramount need to effect economies right through the system.  CTT who deal largely with the private sector, I am happy to say, are prepared to give a lead, to accept that cutback and run a slimmer, tighter, more efficient organisation.  They are prepared to lead by example.  The small cutback does not reflect any dilution in our commitment to exports, nor does it represent any dilution in our conviction that we must export more and very quickly indeed.  What it does is demonstrate that we do not believe there is an automatic linkage between how much is spent in getting exports and how much we get in the way of results.  In this year and in the years ahead we will be looking for considerably more effective export promotion because we are determined to spend a smaller amount of money more effectively.  What exporters need is more effort focused on the right corners in the right places.  What they do not need is to have money thrown at them as has been the case to some extent in the past.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State for this area I stress that the days of regarding CTT as a soft touch are over for good.  From now on CTT will be highly selective in those people whom they help.  They will help those and only those who want to be helped and who are prepared to approach the business of exporting in a businesslike manner, including the development of strategic marketing plans for their export activity.  For those people, and only those, our aim will be to make CTT even more effective as a business partner, not as a soft touch.  It is on those people we will focus the limited resources available to CTT and in doing so I am confident we will get a far better pay-off than has been the case up to now.  The relationship between CTT and export companies will in the future be a more businesslike approach.  I will be looking for a much closer relationship between the money the State pays in and definite measurable results.  Where it is appropriate we will expect export companies to pay for some of the services they receive from the State.  Some of these companies are well able to pay for those services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> We have a good record over the years in the promotion of exports but the time has now come to spring clean our systems and give them a new clarity of vision that is fully appropriate to the conditions we face today and the conditions we will be facing in the years immediately ahead. Within a matter of weeks I will be bringing before the House what was originally intended as a routine Bill relating to CTT. I propose to take that opportunity to begin the process of restructuring our export effort and redefining the role of the State and State agencies.  I will shortly submit to the Government my proposals in this area and while this is not the occasion on which to go into them in great detail there are a few broad comments I would like to make to the House today.</P>
    <P>We need to look closely at the way the private and public sectors can work together in developing a policy on exports.  In the past there has been too rigid a division between those two elements in the mixture.  One result has been proposals from the State side that failed to take off either because they were ineffectively communicated or because they were not really appropriate to the needs of the marketplace.  What I want to see from now on is considerably more teamwork between the public and private sectors in the approach to exports.  This problem is too big, too urgent, for any of us to waste resources through not getting our act together or through not acting together.  We want a much greater concentration by everybody at every level on the development of exports as one of our most important national tasks.  A further example is the need for strategic marketing in the export area.  By strategic I mean as opposed to the short-term reaction, to one-off opportunities or sudden orders that we have put too much effort into many times in the past.  Businesses have to develop that strategic view and I will be looking for that from them, in leading the export drive.  On the State side, we have to support their moves in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is a major shift of emphasis needed here which has already been recognised by most of the sectors in this <Col N="1126" /> area and I will be concerned to give considerably more impetus to that shift in the weeks ahead.  We need new ideas and new approaches in the promotion and development of Irish exports.  For instance, I am particularly attracted by the way the Japanese approach exporting through their export trading houses. These trading houses, which are basically private sector concerns, specialise in the export market function and have provided a most effective outlet for many companies that would be far too small to penetrate a wide range of world markets. I am excited by this example and am determined that we shall take what we can from it and apply it to the benefit of our own export effort.  I will be looking closely at that in the weeks ahead and we will have some proposals in that regard. I am not at all interested in the idea of State trading houses, except possibly in the case of dealing with centrally planned economies such as China.  The Japanese model I am examining is a private sector model and that is how it should be.  What we need to decide is whether that model has something to offer us and, if so, what we need to do to facilitate this development here.  I am interested also in hearing the marketplace view on this approach and I would like to invite those concerned to let us have their views on the suggestion of Japanese-type export trading houses led by the private sector.  I hope we can move quickly with ideas like that although there is a lot of work to be done yet.</P>
    <P>With regard to trade representation abroad, Deputies will know that the Government are committed to the more effective use of our diplomatic missions in the development of trade.  We must aim to have a trade attaché with all the appropriate support in every diplomatic mission.  In the short term, however, we must aim to put trade attachés into missions where there is the greatest immediate opportunity.  In this, as in export marketing generally, it makes sense to focus our efforts on key areas rather than spreading ourselves around too thinly and widely, with the consequent loss of effort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Another trend to which I wish to add impetus is the increasing emphasis on the export of services.  In the years ahead what we will have to offer the world with a competitive edge will be, I believe in the service areas, especially in what is loosely termed the knowledge based industries. The employment potential of export services is particularly important because they offer suitable outlets for the talents of our highly educated population.  This is an area in which the public sector, too has potential.  The State agencies are the repository of considerable talent and experience and many of them are successfully exporting that know-how around the world.  I have already begun to encourage the further development of these activities in the public sector.  I will be seeking greater effort from those already engaged in it and a commitment to begin exporting from those who have not already done so.</P>
    <P>There are very few State agencies which do not have some potential for exporting their services.  There are 27 or 28 commercial semi-State companies which between them have a turnover of £3 billion to £4 billion, and I see no reason that those commercial organisations cannot achieve a somewhat similar result abroad and earn that kind of revenue for this State.  I call on semi-State companies to actively seek opportunities abroad and, as it were, bring home the bacon.  If they can do it at home they can do it abroad.  Some of them have dominated the home market so much that they need to earn foreign revenue if they are to continue to grow.  I invite them to look at the world markets to see if they can achieve exports.  I believe they have not been as successful in this area in the past as they should have been.  The office of trade and marketing will ensure that the gates are open if they want to do it now or in the future.  I ask them to do this today.  The budget has given them a lead.</P>
    <P>In the service sector financial services is an area where there is a once-off opportunity to develop.  Now is the time to create a niche for Ireland in financial circles.  If we lose this opportunity it will <Col N="1128" /> be gone forever.  We already have some of the conditions necessary to get into this business and we have to identify what we lack and seek to create those conditions. I look forward to some progress in that area.</P>
    <P>I am stressing the vital importance of the concept of marketing our products abroad.  I am pleased the Government recognised the importance of marketing as a concept, because for the first time ever the title &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; has been assigned to a Department and a Minister of State, and the office of trade and marketing is being established to take responsibility for leading that export drive and reorganising the structures so that that export drive can work.</P>
    <P>I am in the process of reorganising the trade division within the Department of Industry and Commerce so that I can have a marketing unit which would separate the trade functions from the marketing functions, thus giving a new impetus to the business of marketing. That will be a useful reorganisational element and will allow us to bring forward marketing proposals much more quickly.</P>
    <P>I want to speak to Irish firms and Irish industry generally.  One of the difficulties for this country selling abroad is that about two thirds of all our exports come from the multinationals.  These firms are welcome because they provide very good employment but indigenous firms are lagging behind.  I am a little distressed to see that many indigenous firms are not interested enough in exporting.  They seem to be production orientated.  That means that many manufacturers came into this business because they knew how to make and design a particular product but it was only later they realised that the biggest job was not making the product but selling it.  It should be said again and again to Irish manufacturers and would be entrepreneurs that if they cannot sell their product they should think twice before they make it.  First they should find the market to sell their wares or services and then make the product.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the production orientation nature of Irish industry today. The biggest single challenge facing our <Col N="1129" /> industry is to turn it from a production led sector to a marketing led sector so that manufacturers can find the market and then produce the goods the market wants.  We cannot force goods on an unwilling market.  That basic philosophy will permeate my time in the office of trade and marketing and is a message I will sell hopefully for some years throughout the country so that we can lift our sights and provide a better standard of living for all.</P>
    <P>The Government do not have any option in terms of growth other than export led growth.  Gone are the days when the Government could get growth by pump priming, by reflating or by just borrowing and using that money to activate a consumer group.  The day has arrived when the only way we can get economic growth is through export led growth.  I am very conscious of the fact that a large part of the budgetary strategy and the economic policy of this Government will fall to the office of trade and marketing to assist and lead the export drive to earn more foreign revenue.</P>
    <P>This budget is a first step to create the right framework, and I invite Irish industry to see it in those terms.  It lays the foundation and industry must take it from there and build on that foundation. The Irish Exporters Association have welcomed this budget.  It is a good budget for exporters because it will reduce interest rates and stabilise exchange rates.  Anything that does that will have the blessing and support of our exporters. That is our lifeline and we have to take very good care of it.</P>
    <P>I am conducting a fundamental examination and review on how the State can best promote exports along the lines I described earlier.  I invite the private sector to become more involved in policy creation.  I am going to the private sector to seek new ideas on how our exporting business can be developed.  I will be looking for advice from marketing people and entrepreneurs and I will be marrying the private sector advice with the advice available from the State offices and other organisations.  I will aggressively follow up and put into action any new policy <Col N="1130" /> idea which will work, whether it comes from this Government, the other side of the House, the associations, or the private or the public sector.  The only criterion I will apply is whether it is for the benefit of this country, and particularly for the benefit of our exporters.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the importance of the service industry in exporting.  We think of exporting as ships leaving the docks carrying crates laden with goods, but it is no longer about that.  There is a lot more to it.  Now we have an opportunity to export services &mdash; people taking aeroplanes and selling their know-how and technical ability.  I hope to foster a great deal more activity in this area in the years ahead.  Exporters are interested in a developmental approach to the economy. As I stressed at the outset, there is no point in having cuts for their own sake.  They have to be cuts which put the foundation down and which lay the basis for future growth which I believe this budget has done.</P>
    <P>The budget has laid down a framework and it has pointed the developmental road forward.  It aims at very courageous targets and if we are able to achieve them, which I believe we are, the economy should start to lift.  The basis for these targets is falling interest rates which should start to move down very soon.  On that point, let me say that falling interest rates are important to three different groups of people.  They are crucial to recovery.  First of all, they are important to the Government.  The Government have a domestic debt of £13 billion and lower interest rates will reduce the variable financing costs of that debt.  Therefore, the Government as an institution will benefit greatly from falling interest rates.</P>
    <P>The business sector will also benefit from falling interest rates.  It is not generally recognised that the manufacturing industry owe the staggering sum of £1.5 billion.  One can imagine what the interest on that sum is.  It is close to £300 million a year.  Therefore before they make any money for their employees or shareholders, the manufacturing industry <Col N="1131" /> have to pay £300 million in interest charges on a debt of about £1.5 billion. Clearly, falling interest rates will take great pressure off the manufacturing industry.  If it does, employment will be created in the manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>That is why I refute the suggestion that the budget has done nothing and will do nothing for employment.  There will be a direct spin off in employment if the interest bill of the manufacturing industry is reduced.  Interest rates in Ireland are 9 per cent above those in Germany; they are 8 per cent above those in the Netherlands; they are some 6 per cent above those in Belgium, and they are over 2 per cent above those in the UK.  Therefore, it is quite clear that employees and the growth of Irish industry have a crucial vested interest in getting these interest rates down.  That is the strategy behind the budget.  Clearly, therefore, the Government and the manufacturing industry will benefit.</P>
    <P>The householder will benefit because, if lower interest rates are achieved by this strategy, as I believe they will, I can see a reduction in interest rates of up to 1.5 per cent, perhaps even 2 per cent, by late summer.  If that happens pressure will be taken off the debt of the manufacturing industry and the Government and, more important, the householder whose mortgage, despite yesterday's hike, should come back to more or less what it was before the budget.  Therefore, I do not think householders need worry unduly for anything more than a few short months.</P>
    <P>Finally, the most positive aspect of the budget is this.  I was interested to hear what Deputy Spring had to say about the national finances.  Some £1.5 billion &mdash; I recall that Deputy Spring was Tánaiste during that time &mdash; left the country in a few short years.  The indications from the Central Bank are that some of those funds are beginning to flow back into the country.  It is hard to put an exact amount on it because, obviously, it would not be called a black hole if it was that quantifiable. From reading some of the Central Bank documentation the indications <Col N="1132" /> are that there is an inflow of funds into the country beginning to happen.  The strategy, I suggest, is beginning to work.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are widely expected to fall and some of them have already begun to fall.  If that happens and the inflow of funds accelerates and the pound remains steady, which I believe it will, and the business sector in particular takes this budget to heart, by midsummer we could see a reawakening in the Irish economy and a move upwards.  I am glad we have taken the first step in that regard.  It is hurting but I think people understand that the benefits can be great if we stay with it.</P>

      <P>I join with you in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and in wishing him every success in his new position.</P>
      <P>In opening my contribution to this debate let me say that I agree with the broad thrust of the budget in so far as its targets are concerned.  That essentially was the basic reason for the very constructive attitude which we adopted to the budget yesterday.  Having said that, I have to say that the manner in which the budget is framed gives rise to very worrying and serious questions and reservations. When one goes through the small print of the budget and assesses the impact of its various measures, it is clear that it will lead to more unemployment and more tax.  Everybody in this House will agree that that is not what is wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the recipe for the national recovery which was spoken about by Fianna Fáil in Opposition and during the election campaign.  I am not one of those who go back to check what was said by the other side in the past and force them to eat their words.  That is a sterile exercise. So many words have been eaten by Fianna Fáil in the past month that they <Col N="1133" /> must be gorged and stuffed at this stage. That is not my approach in speaking to the budget.  I want to be as constructive as I can.</P>
    <P>With regard to interest rates which were referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, I want to say to him that I hope the expectations of the Government will be fully realised.  If interest rates fall, it will be good for the country, business, agriculture, tourism and for the individual.  I wish the Government every success in the realisation of their expectations in this regard.  I hope the Government will not think it unfair of me if I recall the emphasis which both in Government and during the election campaign, we placed on this very objective. That was a central part of our budgetary strategy.  That was the message we tried to get through to the people during the election campaign &mdash; the real need to reduce interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Government have joined the club. Genuinely, I hope that the fall in interest rates which the Government expect will be fully realised.  I was disappointed that the immediate reaction of the market was not a little better and it is my hope it will react more positively in the weeks and months ahead.  I hope we will see the reduction in interest rates which is needed for an improvement in our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the reductions on the capital side as opposed to the reductions on the current side. While I accept the overall need for reductions in borrowing, it seems to me economic sense dictates that those reductions have to be concentrated on the current side.  Most people with basic economic training will find justification for borrowing on the capital side in so far as job opportunities and the development of our economy are concerned.  It would be rare to find an economist who would see any such justification for borrowing on the current side.  If we proceed from that basic position we must raise question marks when we see a considerable reduction in borrowing on the capital side not being fully matched by reductions in borrowing on the current side.  I suggest <Col N="1134" /> to the Government that if they are seriously interested in job creation they should concentrate their attention on reducing the current budget deficit.  Any reduction in borrowing on the capital side must be examined carefully because of the implications for employment.</P>
    <P>In examining the budget package one thing that alarmed me was that there will be more taxation.  The previous Government made it clear that despite the financial problems of the country the answer did not lie in increased direct taxation.  I was disappointed to note that that aspect of our budgetary policy was not followed through by the Minister for Finance.  The additional burdens on the income tax area will result in a 14 per cent higher pay-out by those in the PAYE sector in the current year.  Is that a good thing?  I do not think so and I question the wisdom of imposing such increases in taxation, particularly in the area of direct taxation. That represents a misguided and unfair approach bearing in mind the huge share of the taxation burden being carried by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Those on PAYE will also be affected by the reduction in mortgage relief.  It will mean that those in the PAYE sector will be paying more tax and it will impact on the building industry.  Anything that reduces the incentive for home ownership will impact on that industry and I wonder if that has been fully realised.  On looking through the budget one cannot help wondering if there was a deliberate attempt to cut the socks off the building industry. The previous Government made an effort to improve that industry.  Fianna Fáil may not have agreed with the house improvement grant scheme or the grant to those who surrender local authority houses but they represented a stimulus to the building industry.  Having listened to Fianna Fáil's sustained criticism of our efforts, I wonder how any member of the Government will be able to look any builder, or workers in that industry, straight in the face from now on.  It is clear that many jobs can be created in this area.  It is unfortunate that the stimulus created by the previous Government is to be withdrawn by a series of measures <Col N="1135" /> by the Government.  I doubt if they have considered the serious impact those measures will have on that industry.</P>
    <P>I note that house improvement grants and other benefits were withdrawn.  I wonder if those measures were well thought out.  In the past when schemes were being withdrawn those who had applied before the cessation date were accommodated.  However, it appears that if an application has not been processed due to any delay or because of a deliberate policy by the Government in the past three weeks to hold back letters of sanction, it will not be included in the scheme.  That is most unfair.  Inspectors called to many applicants and they proceeded on the understanding that their application would be approved.  I have no doubt that the Government's nasty decision will lead to a great deal of hardship. I would urge a re-examination to allow those who had applied before the withdrawal of this scheme to be dealt with.  Justice, fairplay and equity dictate that approach and I would ask the Minister to discuss it with his colleagues. Unless that approach is adopted there will be a major setback for individuals who have made building plans for new houses or those in local authority areas who have embarked on plans to hand over their houses and move into the private sector.</P>
    <P>On the question of taxation, the Government should reconsider the decision in relation to deductions from professions.  In the light of the serious constraints on our finances, I will not express outright opposition to the very principle but the manner in which it appears this scheme is to be implemented will cause considerable difficulty and hardship.  It is not a proposal that can be considered as being on &ldquo;all fours&rdquo; with the position in relation to those involved on sub-contractors' certificates.  Many of those who will be affected by this change are themselves major employers who have to carry the expenses of an office, paying their staff and various outgoings. What is proposed here will not amount to a withdrawal tax on income; in effect <Col N="1136" /> it will be a withdrawal tax on turnover. The advantages to the Government from the improved cash flow are obvious but the disadvantages to those affected will also become very obvious.  In many instances this proposal, if implemented in the crude form indicated yesterday, will lead to unemployment in the offices of many of those professionals.  Many of them will have difficulty in surviving.  The proposal should be looked at again in an effort to refine it and ensure that the worst effects are avoided.  I appreciate that there is a clause relating to hardship in the Financial Resolution debated last night, but I do not believe that is the answer to the problem.  If the Government are genuinely seeking an answer, we are quite prepared to co-operate in discussing a reasonable amendment to the proposal.  I am not expressing outright condemnation but I am suggesting that it should be refined so that the worst impact will be removed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that my party are agreed on the particular thrust of this budget from the point of view of the targets set, but during the course of this debate and the debate on the Finance Bill there will have to be a fair amount of teasing out on how those targets are to be achieved.  I am not saying that the Government have no hope of achieving them.  I hope they do but there are many unanswered questions as to how this will be done.  I am worried that some of the figures included in the budgetary arithmetic sound like figures plucked from the air.  Answers are necessary in respect of a sum of £100 million on the current side and it is in the interest of this Government that such answers are provided.</P>
    <P>There is the question of travel allowances. There has not been any full explanation as to how an additional revenue of £20 million will result from this change. I have to question whether this will be so.  The general thinking appears to be that those who have previously been going across the Border and bringing home booze will buy it at home.  It may be that they will stay at home but I question whether they will still buy the same quantity that they bought at duty free prices. <Col N="1137" /> There is also the matter of whether this provision will pass the EC muster.  I do not want to give any judgment but at first glance I can see eyebrows being raised in the Commission at what some will allege to be a restriction on cross-Border trade. I raise that question because I believe the figure of £20 million arising from this provision is suspect.  The same has to be said for a variety of figures in the budget where savings are added in as arising from efficiencies.  Many answers will have to be given in various Departments as to where those savings can be found. Efficiencies were continually sought after by the previous administration in relation to all Departments.  I wish this Government every success in finding them but the House is owed a full explanation on the matter.</P>
    <P>Two other major areas with which I wish to deal are the public service and agriculture.  Since this debate will be adjourned shortly, I will speak after the resumption about my disappointment at the provision for agriculture and the lack of a developmental approach.  There will be a cold, damp hand on the activities of the farming community.  The land tax is to be abolished and this will be a major disappointment to many thousands of farmers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the public service, we were criticised for imposing the embargo on recruitment but we felt it was necessary in initiating the reduction in Civil Service numbers.  We achieved a reduction of almost 10 per cent.  The main criticism was that the embargo was a blunt instrument and we replaced it with the staffing level target approach.  We achieved a reduction but we were able to accommodate areas that clearly needed an extra deployment of personnel.  I wonder about the approach now being adopted.  Let me take, for example, the area of education. There was much talk during the election campaign about the proposals of the outgoing Government in relation to vice-principals and career guidance teachers. Here we seem to have an approach which involves not just a change in the pupil-teacher ratio but a total abandonment <Col N="1138" /> thereof.  Nobody can now be appointed without approval by the relevant Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Rate) Regulations, 1987</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 25th March, 1987.</P>
      <P>Subsections (2) and (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may vary the rate of contribution and the income ceiling which determines the amount payable by an individual in a particular contribution year.  Subsection (5) of section 9 of the Act requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House, which propose to vary the rate as well as the income ceiling, shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1987.</P>
      <P>The income ceiling is at present £14,000 and it is proposed to raise this to £15,000.  It is proposed to vary the rate figure from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the income ceiling has been varied each year in line with increases in average earnings in transportable goods <Col N="1139" /> industries, the rate figure has remained at 1 per cent since the introduction of the income related scheme in April 1979. Unfortunately, the escalating cost of providing health services leaves me with no alternative but to seek additional revenue by means of the proposals now before the House.</P>
    <P>In determining the proposed increase in the income ceiling, I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the latest information available regarding changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The latest recorded information on average weekly earnings in those industries relates to June 1986.  Average weekly earnings in June 1986, were £184.42.  This represents an increase of 6.02 per cent on the June 1985 figure of £173.94.  When this is applied to the current ceiling of £14,000, a new ceiling of £14,843 or, say, £15,000 emerges.  The effect of the increased ceiling is to increase the amount of health contributions payable by persons with incomes in excess of £14,000 per annum. Persons with incomes of £14,000 or less will not be affected by this increase.</P>
    <P>The effect of the variation in the rate figure, taken in conjunction with the increased income ceiling, is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £140 to £187.50, an increase of £47.50 per annum.  While all contributions will be affected by the proposed rate increase, only those with incomes of £15,000 or more will pay the maximum increase of £47.50.  The additional charge on a person with an income of say £10,000 per annum will be £25 per annum or 48 pence per week.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that increasing the rate to 1.25 per cent in conjunction with a rise in the income ceiling to £15,000 will result in an increase in the amount of health contributions to be collected of approximately £23 million in the contribution year 1987-1988.  Of the estimated additional income, about £13 million should arise in the financial year 1987. <Col N="1140" /> The remainder of the additional yield will come in the first quarter of 1988.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of current health contributions from all sectors. Health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from farmers for periods up to 6 April 1984.</P>
    <P>The total amount owed by farmers to health boards at 31 December 1986 stood at £6.4 million.  It is clear that by comparison with the old system under which liability was based on notional income related to rateable valuations, there are more difficulties in collecting contributions from farmers where liability is based on factual assessments of income. While the amount still outstanding is cause for concern there has been an encouraging response in recent years to the efforts of the health boards to collect these arrears.  A total of £1.4 million in health contributions arrears was collected by health boards in 1985.  A further £1.1 million was collected by them in 1986.  Deputies will be aware that health boards can retain these arrears, including any such arrears collected in future years, as additional revenue to be applied to local health service needs.  This arrangement will be of continued benefit to health boards' budgets and farmers who are in dispute with their health boards on issues relating to amounts due should get in touch with the health board on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that, in cases where it is clear that a liability for health contributions exists, all outstanding amounts should be collected as soon as possible. It is clearly unfair that persons who do not honour their obligations in this regard should obtain health services at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free consultants' services.  I am not in a position yet to say what this limit will be.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to make one suggestion to the House.  We will shortly have ample opportunity to discuss fully the charges for in-patient and outpatient health services which were announced in the budget.  Consequently, <Col N="1141" /> I suggest that discussions on the motion now before the House should be confined solely to health contribution issues.</P>
    <P>I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat taken aback by the Minister's request not to discuss the wider matters as it has not been the tradition on the debate on this each year.  I looked at the Minister's contribution last year and it was a very wide-ranging debate.  However, I will do my best to confine my remarks to the regulations although I may stray from them at times.</P>
      <P>The reason it is very hard for us to respond to this item in isolation is that we proposed it and, therefore, we consider it a responsible element of the health package proposals for this year. However, the total health package proposals presented to the House yesterday are ones of which we are strongly critical in many aspects.  In responding to the increases last year, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, then Opposition spokesman said that it was worth pointing out that at a time when the level of services was being reduced we were asking people to contribute more.  We are now reducing services to an unprecedented level and the Government are proposing cuts over and above those the Coalition Government had proposed, as well as rejecting some very worthwhile cuts which we had proposed.  At the same time they are attacking people with increased levels of charges.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to separate this debate into neat little packages and one must stray from the regulations.  While we are not opposing the elements proposed here we are strongly critical of many of the other changes, in particular of what will be discussed at more length by my colleague, Deputy Allen, the savage proposal for charges for hospital beds.  I do not understand how this was adopted.  It was rejected by the outgoing Government, it is unnecessary and I cannot believe it will see the light of day and be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charges proposed here are, as the <Col N="1142" /> Minister indicated, in line with common practice.  There is an increase in the income ceiling from £14,000 to £15,000, roughly in line with inflation.  Less common is the increase in the contribution rate of 0.25 per cent which the Minister indicated rightly is related to the escalating level of health costs which in the context of any budget take up is such a huge proportion that they must be looked at very closely.</P>
    <P>We proposed these changes in our budget but we proposed them in the context that there would be no other taxation increase on individuals.  However, the budget in which this proposal is set imposes further taxation measures on people by way of the changes in mortgage interest and of the prospect of their having to either pay charges if they find themselves in hospital or incur the expense of being insured as a preventive measure.  That context is entirely different from the one in which we saw this as a single revenue measure taxation, as Deputy McDowell referred to it yesterday. It is a contribution to the revenue of the State and must be seen in the context of all other demands for revenue. While this charge in itself is acceptable, with so many changes in approach we find the total health package proposal entirely unacceptable, particularly when you cast your mind back two to three weeks and think of the posters that adorned so many hoardings &mdash; I am surprised that some of them still are not there &mdash; and which proclaimed that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outdone the outgoing Government in the cuts he has proposed. He has rejected certain of our proposals, such as the ending of the prescription charges and accepting the one here before us now but he has replaced them with savage cuts in the Estimates for recruitment and staffing with a lopping off of £10 million there.  We will tease out the implications of that later but they will be felt in every hospital and health institution.  We examined that and thought that £3 million was as far as one could go.  I will be interested to hear the <Col N="1143" /> Minister telling us a little more about how he intends to achieve this far greater saving of £10 million to £11 million.  We prefer the public ward charges to the prescription charges.  We believe that the prescription charges measure would impact on people to a far lesser degree because the largest saving in that area would have been on drugs expenditure, not through contributions from individuals. The figure there would have been from £2 million to £3 million.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to confine oneself in talking about this to the narrow area we are concerned about.  I wonder where it is all going.  Is this the beginning of a total change in how we will pay for our health services?  Are we talking about a transformation to the ending of the free hospital service as we know it?  Is this £10 this year to be a greater contribution each year?  Are we looking to an American style health system where either you are on a very inadequate public health system paid for by medical card or in an insurance bracket?  Perhaps there is merit in that but if that is what we are talking about let us look at it up front.  How we are going to make up the package of ways in which we will pay for health services is a major issue.  We find it difficult to accept this because it is such an extraordinary transformation.  We are debating this with a Fianna Fáil Government who all over this country had those posters which suggested that there was a softer way, an easier way, a more pleasant way and that somehow we were the heartless monetarists.  Now they must turn on their own heads all of that criticism, answer all their own arguments and explain to us when we go into further debate later tonight how they can stand over such a changed position or, if they can stand over that &mdash; it is somewhat close to the arguments here &mdash; how they can explain the irresponsibility of their previous decision.</P>
    <P>I am trying to be careful here in saying that we reject not the process of pruning back on the health service because that would not be realistic, but the measures which the Government have chosen, and <Col N="1144" /> we wish to question why they rejected certain of the savings we proposed. Essentially they have taken the soft option, PAYE again.  The Minister mentioned the figures he got in the last two years in relation to farmers.  Will he tell us what figure that leaves outstanding of the charges due to the health boards? Has he any indication of how successful the Revenue Commissioners have been in recent years in bringing in extra amounts from the farmers and the self-employed? Again we must look at the health contributions of the farmers and the self-employed in the context of what this budget has indicated to the PAYE taxpayers, from whom expectations and demands are so much tighter than ever they have been or will be under this Government so far as the farmers are concerned.  With the abolition of the farm tax there will be difficulty in getting out contributions such as these.  The last figure that Deputy Desmond as Minister indicated as their contribution to the health services of the nation was of the order of 0.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I had intended to mention wider areas about the development of the health service in the context of the wider budget but we will leave that until later in the night.  Has the Minister considered the whole mechanism by which we have this cut-off level for contributions?  Perhaps there is an element of inequity here in that those who have most contribute least although they also benefit somewhat less, but not greatly less, and there is a disincentive to work to the point where a person is about to reach the cut-off point. Other factors come into play here.  I will be pressing our own party to look at that closely.  This area should be examined and the whole contribution system reviewed in that context.  Has the Minister considered that at all?</P>
    <P>Most of my other points are wide and not specifically related to this motion so I will leave them for later in the evening. However, I would like to indicate that we are going to accept and support the making of these regulations because they are part of our own proposal, but we do so setting down a clear marker that there <Col N="1145" /> are many elements in the proposed package which we find unacceptable and very savage and clumsy.  We will be pressing the Minister closely on these in the later debate tonight.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy Molloy, let me advise Deputies that there is a very strict time limit to this debate.  The Chair is anxious to facilitate as many Deputies as possible but this can be done only if Members confine themselves to the subject matter of this debate which is health contributions and them only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to the health contributions which are before the House.  I accept that we will be moving on immediately to discuss the other matter, in-patient charges and out-patient charges.  As far as we are concerned, increasing the health levy and the income limit as proposed here will not increase in any way the resources directly available to the health services.  It does not extend or improve the health services for any member of the public.  As has already been stated in the House and by the Minister in previous debates of this kind, it introduces the situation where, while the Minister is proposing increased charges, the actual level of services is being reduced and those who are being brought further into the net will be involved in the proposed additional charges we will debate later.  The health levy is an instrument of taxation.  We cannot get away from that fact.  The regulations proposed by the Minister will increase the tax burden on each individual taxpayer.  The tax burden is already too heavy.  The Progressive Democrats will highlight any proposal to increase the level of personal taxation and this is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health levy is a regressive tax.  It hits the PAYE sector who have no way of escaping from it.  Many of the self-employed sector do not pay it.  As can be seen from the Minister's statement, another section of the community are very heavily in arrears and have unpaid health contributions of up to £6 million. The health contributions are applied to <Col N="1146" /> total income even when that income may be below taxable levels.  There is no equity in that.  It applies very unfairly to a certain section of the community.  It is a hidden tax and is not the solution to the type of problems affecting our economy today.  The real solution must be to deal rigidly with the overall Government spending programme.</P>
    <P>There is a need for fundamental reform in the whole area of Government spending and taxation.  If we succeed in reducing spending we will succeed in reducing taxation and only then will we succeed in starting to create jobs.  Low taxation is the key to job creation.  These orders add an additional £13 million, according to the Minister's latest figures, of direct taxation on the tax paying public.  This amount is part of the total increase in taxation of £473 million which this year's budget adds to the already over-burdened taxpayer.  We are adding an additional burden of £13 million to the contribution of many of the people who are already making a private contribution for health services through the VHI system.  Anything that proposes additional taxation is adding to our economic problems and will lengthen our dole queues.  We see these two orders as a continuation of a policy of high taxation which has led us into our present sorry state and for that reason we will oppose both the orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At long last we have reached a stage in this budget debate where it appears that all the Opposition parties will join together, perhaps for quite different reasons, in opposing the increase of a quarter of 1 per cent.  We are opposing the measure but not because we are afraid to pay taxation.  We differ sharply in that regard from our colleagues. We believe people should pay for services.  We believe that a fair system of taxation can provide resources to pay for the services.  When I was Minister I proposed that health contributions should be increased.  I recall many an acrimonious budget debate when I argued that they should be increased from 1 to 2 per cent to provide an extra <Col N="1147" /> £80 million or £90 million for the health services and saying that in public I would stand over such an increase.  The Minister for Finance of the day did not want to do that because he wanted to perpetuate the belief that you can have a low level of taxation and a high level of social services, a piece of mythology which is rampant in this House but which will be exposed as the months unfold in terms of the budget analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I am opposed to this measure which will yield £13 million this year and which admittedly appears in the appropriation-in-aids of the Department of Health but which simultaneously has been clawed back quite deliberately out of the net Exchequer support of the Estimate, so much so that the Minister for Finance said yesterday that the outturn on the Health Estimate for 1986 was £1,115 million.  He said he was reducing the net provision for 1987 to £1,111 million. Effectively the net Exchequer provision is being reduced by £4 million.  It is far more serious than that because as happened in previous years, despite all the caterwauling of Fianna Fáil, health boards and vested interests in the health services, we managed to have a percentage increase of roughly 3 per cent each year.  Three per cent of the 1986 outturn of £1,115 million would necessitate an extra £33 million net Exchequer support to enable the maintenance of existing services.  Three per cent is the minimum increase and does not take into account any new developments or any new units being financed in the Department of Health.  It just covers the increase in pay and pensions which is 17 per cent of the Health Vote.  Instead we have a net reduction of £4 million on the net Exchequer support.  On top of that today we have an effective taxation imposition of another £13 million by way of health contributions.  The contributions are up, net Exchequer support is down and the overall impact is that the health services are on what one might call a zero-zero budget for 1986 and 1987.  That means a substantial reduction in the delivery of the health services.  For that reason we <Col N="1148" /> cannot support this health contribution proposal.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another matter with the Minister and with the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance notoriously underestimate the yield from health contributions.  The Revenue Commissioners are very conservative people. As I discovered in the four years I was in office our appropriations-in-aid allocation of health contributions was invariably under-forecasted.  That is reflected to some extent today.  The Minister said that the yield from health contribution increases in 1987 will be £13 million.  The Minister for Finance said yesterday that the yield will be £11 million. That is the increase in the rate of contribution from 1 per cent to 1¼ per cent which increases the ceiling figure to £15,000 from 6 April.  That amounts to £2 million which is gold dust in the Department of Health these days.</P>
    <P>As we know the Minister will be savaged in the years ahead over the £10 public ward charge.  That is estimated by the Department of Finance and the Department of Health on a joint agreement basis to yield in the region of £6 million.</P>
    <P>We must consider all the confusion that will be created by new administrative systems, staff being recruited, every hospital admittance being the subject of a comprehensive statement as to status and so on.  All of that will have to be paid for. The £10 charge could be reduced to £7 without any loss in Exchequer support for the Health Vote.  I suppose one must be grateful for small mercies and I know that the Minister for Health will indeed be profoundly grateful for any small mercy he may get in the months ahead as he endeavours to bring in the regulation around mid-year.  I put this matter to him.</P>
    <P>When I had the responsibility and, indeed, the honour of endeavouring to bring in health contributions we made a number of changes.  First, from 6 April 1984, as the Minister confirmed, the responsibility was quite rightly transferred to the Revenue Commissioners who were held responsible and still are for collecting health contributions.  I am <Col N="1149" /> becoming very suspicious about their capacity to collect them at all.  I have some reasonable evidence that the income from health contributions in 1985 and in 1986 may, if anything, proportionately have dropped.  The health board should never have had the responsibility of collecting the health contributions in the first place.  In the final analysis it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, just as in the case of farm tax, to ensure collection.</P>
    <P>As of 14 January last there were total arrears in all levies, including health contributions, youth employment and so on, from the farming sector and the self-employed sector of about £110 million. Five days before we left office, the Minister for Finance sent a letter to the Tánaiste stating the Government were extremely concerned about the matter and that the Revenue Commissioners did accept there were about £110 million arrears of levies due by farmers and the self-employed.  They estimated they would get about £14 million and the then Minister made the very understandable point that he was extremely concerned about the prospect of only £14 million being collected because he regarded this as totally inadequate and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In the case of the farm tax, farmers decided not to accept any liability in relation to that tax.  I gather they have paid out of a £5 million liability only something in the region of £600,000 or £700,000.  You would not even consider that sum in terms of rounding up an Estimate. There will inevitably be the temptation, in respect of the increase in the health contributions from 1 per cent to 1¼ per cent and the income ceilings going up to £15,000, that the farmers will say if Fianna Fáil are as good as them in the future as they now are with regard to farm tax they can forget about paying the health contribution also.  Admittedly, there is a penalty there which I brought in, that anybody turning up in hospital without a paid up contributions certificate will automatically be obliged to pay £100 admission fee into the hospital.  Naturally not all farmers end up in hospital and <Col N="1150" /> they operate on the basis that if they do not become ill then their liability is nil.</P>
    <P>In this budget a section of the community have been let off very lightly.  It is reminiscent of 1978 when rates came off, largely at the behest of the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Jim Gibbons. Then the farm levies came off and the resource tax also.  Rates were subsequently found to be unconstitutional and the notional system was changed. Now the farm tax system is changed and on some bright day in the months ahead there will be unveiled in the Finance Bill a new notional assessment system for farmers which will be emasculated within months, as the IFA lobby get to work on the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and pour into the offices of the members of the Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only up to 7 p.m. to discuss this important matter. Suffice it to say that somebody earning £15,000 a year will be obliged to pay an extra £1 a week.  It will be included in their PAYE amount each week or month.  For a person earning £10,000 that is slightly above average, there will be an extra £25 a year of what is effectively a health levy.  I have no objection to health contributions being increased, if all the money accrues to a normal Health Estimate. However, in this case there is an actual reduction in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my 18 years in the Dáil, I always advocated a payment of this nature so that it could be clearly allocated in the Health Vote.  However, on this occasion it is highly regrettable that I must oppose it because for the very first time in the history of the State we have a Health Estimate which shows an actual 3 per cent reduction.  That of itself on a year-to-year basis means major reduction in the provision of services.  I am glad to see that the Fine Gael Party and the PDs, perhaps for quite different reasons from ours, will oppose this measure also.  They seem to be opposed to taxation but have <Col N="1151" /> no alternatives to propose.  The Labour Party will vote against this measure this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party are opposed to these measures which seek to increase from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent the level of health contributions and to raise the income ceiling on which this is levied from £14,000 to £15,000.  They are particularly opposed to the increase in the levy from 1 to 1.25 per cent as this will affect every taxpayer in the country. It is outrageous to ask people to pay a higher health levy at a time when health services are being cut back, when people are being asked to pay for out-patient services and for each night they may have to spend in hospital.  These charges represent nothing more nor less than a tax on illness.  People are to be penalised financially for being unfortunate enough to become ill.</P>
      <P>Over the years workers have paid the health levy willingly.  For example, a worker on an average income of £10,000 per annum would pay £100 per annum by way of health levy, although the vast majority of them would never visit the out-patient department of a hospital or spend a night in hospital.  Many workers have paid hundreds of thousands of pound in health contributions over the years without ever having visited an outpatients department or spent a night in a hospital bed.  They paid their contributions willingly in the knowledge that, if they were unfortunate enough to become ill and needed to go to hospital, they would be covered for such an eventuality by the contributions they had paid over the years.  They find now that this Government have arbitrarily breached that contract and are intent on introducing charges for out-patient treatment and hospital beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to raise the health levy represents simply an increase in taxation. It must be seen against the crushing burden of taxation the PAYE sector has carried over the years.  Bearing in mind that even those people on relatively low incomes are crippled by taxation, the <Col N="1152" /> average tax being paid by a PAYE worker in 1985 being £2,490 per annum, or almost £50 per week, the Government ensure that that same sector pay a health contribution which is deducted from their wage packets.  Successive Governments have not been so effective in ensuring that other sectors paid their health contributions. There is in the region of £38 million outstanding in uncollected health contributions from the farming and self-employed sectors.  That constitutes more than three times the yield of the proposed increase in the levy.</P>
    <P>I might ask: what action are the Government taking to ensure that that money is collected at present?  I am aware that farmers who want to pay the levy are approaching their health boards &mdash; I understand this has been going on for a long time &mdash; because they have received no demands from the Revenue Commissioners. When replying perhaps the Minister would clarify that point and inform us why no vigorous demands are being issued for these health contributions. Because those demands are not being issued again the burden is being placed on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>In deciding to increase the health levy the Government have taken the easy option, the attitude being to take what they can from workers.  The decision to increase the levy must be viewed against the background of other budgetary provisions which will result in the total income tax take going up from £2,388 million to £2,721 million, an increase of £33 million or approximately 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>We all remember hearing the Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; a few weeks ago saying they would tax everyone including their friends.  There is not much evidence of that in this budget.  For example, there are no new property, capital or corporation taxes, nothing to ensure a more equitable tax system.  On the whole question of health services I should like to quote a statement made by the present Taoiseach in an interview with the <i>Irish Press</i> on 25 September 1984 when he said:</P>
    <P>The health services have been reduced <Col N="1153" /> to dangerously inadequate levels and I think that if it has not happened already people will die because of the unavailability of particular services in certain areas.</P>
    <P>We are also opposing the proposal to increase to £15,000 the income ceiling for contributions.  The Workers' Party believe that ideally there should be no ceiling for contributions, that the health contribution should be levied on all incomes, with everybody then qualifying for free hospital services.  Over the years there has emerged a gap between the ceiling for the health levy and that for qualification for free hospital services. The health increases of this budget represent the most shameful proposals ever advanced by a Fianna Fáil Government. They appear to want to turn the clock back even more so that the quality of health services will be determined by a person's ability to pay.  Human life and health are far too important for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Desmond, I should like to emphasise the reason the Labour Party are opposing these resolutions which would render possible the introduction of health charges of a particular kind and an increase in the levy.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to reflect on the whole question of health policy, on the atmosphere prevailing in discussing this budget and the run-up to it.  Most of those who advocated an emphasis on the fiscal aspects of our economic prospects at present have advanced an argument based on efficiency.  They have argued that there must be an elimination of waste.  Turning to social welfare they argue that there must be an erosion of the disincentive to work, as they see it. Turning to the unemployed, they have changed the unemployment problem into one of labour mobility.  Turning to everyone of the economic and social areas the justifications keep reverting to some kind of norm of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I listened to speakers on these two resolutions, in particular that in relation to health, I began to ask myself: when <Col N="1154" /> did we last have a White Paper on the health services in terms of even conservative criteria?  Are the health services delivering efficiently what taxpayers are paying for, what private contributors are paying for?  The truth is that we did not have a White Paper on health policy for a very long time for a very good reason: some of the best organised vested interests in this country would be totally opposed to such a White Paper and structural review.</P>
    <P>I have had the advantage, if one could call it that, of having been a member of the Western Health Board for many years.  On it I have subjected myself every month to listening to heart-rending speeches from public representatives and professional representatives on the board speaking about what would happen if any services were cut, or if the allocation to the health board was cut, to such an extent that on one occasion, to their horror, I voted with them which could have had the result of the health board being disestablished.  They were appalled by such an outcome, but I proceeded with my education in the public hyprocrisy of health, as it might be called, in those years.</P>
    <P>A White Paper on health, as a background to the resolutions we are now discussing, should reasonably ask what has been the consequence of changing the general medical status in 1972 and what are the consequences of running two health services in a small country like ours, a private system and a public system, not in efficient isolation of one from the other, but a private system purchased by an increment of additional expenditure made possible out of public taxation.  None of the people who benefit from the discriminatory provision of private health care has privately funded the education of a doctor, a laboratory technician, or bought a single instrument for use in the provision of health care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come directly to <Col N="1155" /> those.  We have always had a system that is in one sense public and in another sense can be different but private.  What we have not had is a general health care service which, in every State where the welfare state has been established, has been the basic approach towards health.</P>
      <P>On the question of health charges and on the question of health the NESC in their document <i>Strategy for Development, 1986-1990</i>, document No. 83, published in November 1986 made a comment on the levy, and to cut a long story short they pointed out something that is obvious.  For a start the levy excludes people below a certain level and excludes people above a certain ceiling, so it cannot be regarded as an appropriate revenue gathering mechanism for the provision of health care.  It was found defective by the NESC.  Two other bodies also rattled the concept of health levies as an appropriate mechanism of funding. They were condemned in the report of the Commission on Taxation, and the Commission on Social Welfare said the operation of health levies as a means of funding health care is defective and unacceptable.  What we find in Ireland in this curious atmosphere of people wanting to pay little tax and be able to purchase health care privately from doctors educated by public funding in hospitals and clinics built out of public funding, is that people want to pay little tax and purchase a privileged form of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the effect of raising the levy?  There will be people above the ceiling who will not contribute and there will be people who cannot afford to pay. What we are witnessing is another example of regressive access to and consumption of State services being substituted for adequate taxation and general provision.  People in this country simply have not had the guts to take on the vested interests involved and say: &ldquo;You are either committed to making money out of the sickness industry or you are interested in providing health.&rdquo; I am not condemning all doctors and consultants. I know many are dedicated and the Minister knows many more who are <Col N="1156" /> dedicated, but the fact is that what we have here are charges for the sickness industry.  How does one justify the exclusion of everyone who earns income and pays on a PAYE basis.  They might have imagined that, for the joy of paying openly a significant proportion of their income, they might have been entitled to a general health service, but they are told that they are not.</P>
    <P>Irish doctors will never be asked in this land of all equal republicans to deliver health to everybody because they all pay taxation.  They will be asked: &ldquo;Would you like to work in the public service and you can have a bit of private practice as well? You can hop over from here to there, have a little contract here, a retainer there and a salary here and so forth.&rdquo; The more I sat on the health board and listened to this the more I concluded that it qualified as some of the crassest hyprocrisy that I have ever heard, although I knew we had people deeply committed to an egalitarian provision of health care. Now in an outpatients clinic in a hospital provided out of public taxation where salaries will be provided out of public taxation, people can pay an additional charge.</P>
    <P>One could summarise some of what Deputy Desmond said by saying that for the benefit of healthcare in hospital some people will pay twice.  They will be caught inescapably at the level of income, and then they are supposed to provide out of their post-tax income another sum of money to consume services which would be provided in any civilised country.  Of course we will have people who in the new ethos which now prevails can demonstrate their poverty.  They can flash the medical card and they might be allowed to get the services.</P>

      <P>As there are only two minutes left, I will confine myself to the issues before us. Deputy Flaherty asked how much of the health contribution from the farmers remained uncollected.  The figure at the end of 1986 was £6.4 million.  Deputy Flaherty also asked if we would look at the method of collecting that contribution, and we certainly will.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies raised the question of not being able to collect the total amount due from the self employed, including farmers.  One of the difficulties is that the method of collection from the farmers has changed so often over the years.  First it was under the Poor Law Valuation, then it was under income, then under land tax, and now the land tax is being abolished and farmers will pay their tax in the same way as everybody else, on their profits.</P>

    <P>It is important to remind Deputies opposite that they were in Government over the past four years and that they were responsible for the change in the <Col N="1158" /> taxation system applying to farmers and, therefore, they must take responsibility for the fact that there has been a certain amount of difficulty in collecting revenue due from farmers.  We are looking at the whole question of the health contributions to ensure that everybody who can pay health contributions does so.  The question of the health contributions is an important one in so far as many Deputies admitted that the health services are going through a difficult time.  Finances are scarce.  It is illogical to oppose health contributions and then oppose hospital charges because if we are to provide an adequate level of service &mdash; and we are intent on doing that &mdash; then the money must be found somewhere.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House approve the regulations before it.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the amendment of section 56 of the Health Act, 1970 to enable the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to impose charges in respect of out-patient services as defined in the 1970 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into the details of this short Bill, I would like, first to state why in my view and in the view of the Government such charges should be imposed. The Members of this House, like the population at large, are more than well <Col N="1161" /> aware of the economic restrictions that now face us and the need to prune our expectations in line with what is economically attainable.  The figures show that the cost of providing health services over the last number of years has increased quite dramatically.  Three or four years ago, it became equally clear that the level of resource available to public services generally and specifically to the health services had to be limited and within that limitation it would be necessary to determine priorities to fund the services within the resources approved.  This in general terms was not done.  Substantial overruns amounting to £55 million at year end 1986 were incurred and nothing was done by the previous Government to deal with the situation.  This has exacerbated an already difficult situation.  That leaves us having to fund the health services with that millstone of £55 million around our necks.</P>
    <P>There is no getting away from the fact that the resources available for the health sector for the forseeable future will continue to be limited.  It is no good pretending or believing there is some untapped source that will release funding into the health services at the level of a decade ago.  That is not going to happen. Therefore, in these circumstances the question is, how can the basic components of the health services be kept intact and at the same time live within the funding available?</P>
    <P>This country over the last 20 years or more has been blessed with a standard of health care, by and large comparable with the rest of the western European countries.  The rate of development, the extent of the services, the range of availability has been quite staggering.  Of course, it would be highly desirable that the services in their range and comprehensiveness should continue with the same momentum but this is just not possible.</P>
    <P>Like most other European countries we have been hit by an economic recession of major proportions aggravated by the claimant demands for ever-increasing high technology resource and <Col N="1162" /> services.  No more than even a wealthier European country we cannot meet such demand.  This is not a question of ideology or political philosophy.  This is a question of fact and how we recover from this recession without permanent damage to the basic infrastructure of our society and services is the essential issue at the moment.</P>
    <P>As far as health services are concerned, as I have said it is vital that in this difficult period we ensure that the crucial fabric is preserved.  The options open to us, it must be admitted, are difficult.  The two basic options are that across the board we slash services indiscriminately or we try to maintain essential services to the most needy and require those who can make an additional contribution to do so. I have no doubt that the latter is the correct course to follow.  This is the basis of the Bill before the House.  The Bill seeks to impose on certain categories of people a charge for the provision of out-patient services.  In line with Government policy, the most vulnerable in society will be exempted from the charges.  These are, those who are medical card holders and their dependants, all children who suffer from diseases and disabilities of a permanent or long-term nature and children who require attendance on an out-patient basis in respect of defects which have been noticed at a health examination provided in accordance with the Health Act.  They will be the school medical examinations and those held at child welfare clinics.</P>
    <P>These exemptions, as the House will see, are provided for in this Bill.  In addition, the regulations which are provided for under the Bill will exclude from charges all women in respect of motherhood and infants up to the age of six weeks as already provided for under the 1970 Act.  Also persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of certain infectious diseases prescribed under the Health Act, 1947 will be exempted.  Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards will have the normal discretion which is built into the Health Act to exempt people not included in the list of exemptions I have already mentioned, <Col N="1163" /> where there would be an obvious case of hardship if the charges were imposed. That is an important provision because people may be worried that they will not be able to meet the demand.  In cases of hardship CEOs have permission to waive the out-patient charge.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the purpose of the Bill is to require that those people who can afford to pay for out-patient services, and only those people, should be obliged to contribute to maintaining the structures of the health services rather than simply allow those structures to be futher undermined and possibly permanently damaged.</P>
    <P>It is intended to provided by regulations for a £10 charge for out-patient services but only in respect of the first visit arising in respect of a particular condition.  In other words, return visits in respect of that condition will not be liable for the charge.  A charge of £10 will also be made in respect of attendance at casualty departments.  Virtually everybody with a reasonable knowledge of casualty departments agrees there is considerable misuse of these services.  People attend for conditions or with symptoms which could not be described as accident and emergency. A very considerable number of attendances at casualty departments of hospitals are for conditions which could just as appropriately be provided by a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>There are, I know many reasons people seek such care at casualty departments particularly in urban areas.  Convenience, a comprehensive 24 hour, seven day a week service are major factors.  Another factor is that the service is provided free of charge.  Is it in the present circumstances unreasonable that people who would be liable for the payment of general practitioners if attending at their surgeries, can receive a like service free of charge in a casualty department which is an expensive location for treating conditions which could be equally well treated in the community? Therefore, a charge of £10 will be imposed with, of course, the exemptions I have already mentioned also applying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> In a situation where it is clear that no additional funding can be expected to come from Exchequer sources, the input of moneys raised through charges on those who could be expected to afford them or to be in a position to insure themselves against them is, I believe, justified.</P>
    <P>While not arising from the provisions of the Bill, I should like to take the opportunity of informing the House that I also intend introducing a daily charge for hospital in-patient care.  The appropriate regulations in this regard will be made under existing legislation and will provide for a charge of £10 per day subject to a maximum of £100 in any 12 month period.  This charge is in respect of the patient's maintenance in hospital. Exemptions, which I mentioned in respect of out-patient charges will also apply in the case of in-patient charges &mdash; that is medical card holders and their dependants, maternity patients, certain categories of children, people receiving treatment for infectious diseases.  There will also be the hardship clause I referred to in regard to out-patient charges.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board have been asked to prepare appropriate insurance coverage for the out-patient and in-patient charges which I have outlined this evening with a view to providing cover for those likely to be affected by the charges and to coincide with their introduction.  The charges will be introduced when the VHI scheme is available which I hope will be within the next six weeks.  I envisage that such schemes will be in place very soon and will be quite attractively priced.</P>
    <P>I firmly suggest that the charges I now propose with the exemptions I have outlined are infinitely preferable to charges proposed by the previous Government involving in particular charges for prescriptions for medical card holders, the most vulnerable section of our society. The previous Government intended it to raise £16 million by way of charges to medical card holders on the basis of £1 per item on a prescription up to a limit of £5 per month.  If a patient needed ten items that person would have to pay £10 <Col N="1165" /> per month.  Medical card holders, those on the lowest income in the country, would have to pay that amount of money and, having paid it, could apply to the health boards for a refund of £5 but they would have to wait some time for a refund.  We decided we could not impose the penal charges proposed by the previous Government.  We also decided to restore the rural dispensing scheme under which doctors in rural areas dispensed the drugs for their patients.  The proposal to abolish that scheme was heartless and would have caused undue hardship for many people living in remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>Over the last while, there has been considerable discussion about the future directions of the health services.  There is virtually universal agreement that in the future the emphasis in health care must be on primary health care especially on disease and illness prevention and health promotion and this is part of the Government's policy.  I am absolutely at one with this approach.  The large specialised high-technology hospital can no longer be seen as the focus of a health care service. Deputies will be aware that a few months ago, a major document called <i>Health &mdash; The Wider Dimensions</i> was published which set down in a broad context the main issues in health and pointed to a framework within which services should be provided in the future.  I look forward with considerable interest to the responses to the document which are now being made by a wide range of bodies and organisations.  I would hope that through this consultative process and further discussion, a broad health policy can be agreed within which we can then proceed to develop and refine the specific elements of that policy with emphasis on the prevention of illness and health promotion.  I believe that it is only by this collaborative approach can real change be brought about and the necessary reorientation of perceptions and approach achieved.</P>
    <P>Even though we are going through a period which is very difficult financially this should not cause us to lose sight of the many useful things that can now be <Col N="1166" /> done without necessarily adding to expenditure.</P>
    <P>For example, in the psychiatric service, the changes which are needed in the service have been clearly spelled out.  These changes can bring considerable improvements both to the standard of service which is available to the general community and to the quality of life of the many persons who are now resident in our psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The health boards have been very actively involved in drawing up plans and in starting to bring about change.  The advisory services of my Department have been strengthened and officers of the Department have begun working in close association with health board teams in selecting changes which are necessary and practicable.  I am very pleased with the progress being made by these teams and I am satisfied that they have considerable potential for bringing our psychiatric service up to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>I hope to be able to announce shortly the establishment of an advisory group which will include a representative of the chief executive officers.  This group will monitor changes in the psychiatric service and advise my Department on required action.</P>
    <P>In the field of mental handicap, the advisory service of my Department has also been strengthened recently.  As a result, the Department are becoming more actively involved in guiding changes to a more community-based service in line with modern thinking on the type of service which will be of greatest benefit to mentally handicapped persons and to their families.  The mental handicap service is at present being reviewed by my Department in association with the health boards and the voluntary agencies providing the service, with a view to drawing up more definite guidelines on the type of service we are aiming for.</P>
    <P>The changes which are required in the psychiatric and mental handicap services do require some capital investment but they do not necessarily add to overall revenue expenditure.  We should not lose the opportunity which we now have to <Col N="1167" /> improve the quality of these services. This is an area to which some urgency should now be applied.  It is inevitable that central to this kind of fundamental rethinking of what should be expected of our health service will be the resources that can realistically be expected over the next few years.  It is equally inevitable that those resources will continue to be restricted.  I have already indicated that the raising of moneys through the levying of charges on those able to pay is a justifiable approach to take.  However, I believe that a more comprehensive assessment of how the health service might be funded is essential.  Already I have initiated a study within my Department on the options and alternatives for funding.  I expect to receive an interim report on the matter within the next five or six weeks, together with recommendations as to how we should proceed further.  Without attempting to prejudice the outcome of this study, I would expect that there would be a particular assessment of the role of insurance systems, especially the role of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Since its establishment the VHI has served the country well in providing health insurance for those not otherwise covered by the State-funded services.</P>
    <P>Circumstances quite clearly have changed dramatically since its establishment, particularly the significant extension of publicly funded services made available to the whole population. A comprehensive assessment of the role of the VHI has been going on for some time with the co-operation of the board and I look forward to the outcome.</P>
    <P>The health services are facing a difficult period.  It is consequently incumbent on all to appreciate fully this situation and realise the implications.  It means that many ambitions and expectations cannot be met and that the priorities for the country must be identified and agreed. Within the health services my main priority will be to maintain the essential infrastructure of the service and to protect those most in need and at risk.  To do this requires the co-operation of all <Col N="1168" /> concerned &mdash; those managing the services, those providing them and those receiving them.  In an effort to achieve this co-operation, I will be commencing tomorrow by meeting with the chairmen and the chief executive officers of the health boards.  Clearly there is a difficult time ahead for all health agencies.  But I would expect that there be a full appreciation of the seriousness of the situation and that the measures required to maintain essential services will be put in train without delay and with a full concentration of management resources.</P>
    <P>Before concluding there is one problem I am satisfied that I will have to tackle as a matter of urgency.  During the past three weeks my Cabinet colleagues and I have been preoccupied with the preparation of the budget and I now intend to concentrate on the preparation of an AIDS information programme.  In addition I intend to develop further support information and counselling services with the co-operation of the health boards throughout the country.  The Dáil will be aware of the fact that since the first case was diagnosed in 1982 there have been 18 cases in all diagnosed, but eight of these cases have occurred in the last nine months.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has already been informed of the measures taken by my Department to control the spread of AIDS through blood and blood products, and HIV antibody testing service is now available throughout the country, that the Eastern Health Board held three seminars on AIDS for selected staff from all health boards and that the Health Education Bureau ran a seminar for doctors more recently.  The spread of infection continues to be monitored through the AIDS reporting system and from the virus reference laboratory reports on the total number of positive HIV antibody tests.</P>
    <P>I intend to build on these developments and in addition to concentrate upon the improvement of the sexually transmitted diseases clinics.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This week's budget proposals represent one of the most savage <Col N="1169" /> attacks on the health services by any Government since the foundation of the State.  This Government will go down in history as the first to cut the allocation to the Department of Health.  The reduction in the overall health allocation, coupled with a total embargo on recruitment, has dealt a serious body blow to the health service.  The allocation has been reduced by £8.6 million, made up of £3.5 million on the capital programme and £5 million on non-capital expenditure.  The embargo is biting deeper than our proposals anticipated.  Our three-in-one embargo was estimated to yield a saving of £3.4 million, but this Government's embargo is to yield a saving of £14.4 million.</P>
      <P>The public health charge of £10 per day for non-medical card patients in public wards, together with out-patients' charges, are a savage attack on the most vulnerable sector of the community.  The public ward charges affect people who are most vulnerable, those without a medical card and those who cannot afford VHI cover.  The typical people who will be affected are local authority workers, general operatives in the health services and other persons on minimum wages.  It is tragic that the Minister has decided to impose extra charges to fund the health services rather than attacking the many inefficiencies and defects in the services themselves.  The Minister cannot justify the charges by the introduction of a hardship clause, as he has tried to do tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget has been a savage attack on families who are most vulnerable.  Let us look at a family with a mortgage who are affected by the new hospital charges. If they do not have VHI already they will be forced into joining a scheme which, from the figures I got today, will cost a minimum of £100 per annum.  The reduction of mortgage interest relief could cost up to £200 per annum and the extra one-quarter per cent health contribution, which we dealt with earlier will amount to an increase of £43 per annum. The increase in the ceiling will cost that family a further £150 per annum.  As a result of these proposals the family could <Col N="1170" /> find themselves facing an extra bill of £10 per week.</P>
    <P>The introduction of public ward charges is designed to bring in £6 million this year but it is anti-social and shortsighted. The previous Government proposed certain prescription charges estimated to save £13.5 million.  The Minister knows that £3.5 million of that was coming from the charges themselves and the remainder from a cutback in the use of drugs and visits to doctors for prescriptions. That was a far-seeing proposal because we all know that every house has an excess of drugs in its cupboards.  It was designed to cut back on the over-use of drugs, with which the Minister could not argue.  The announcement in the budget is an attack on sick people and many families will now be unable to afford to be ill.</P>
    <P>We abstained on the vote regarding increases in health contributions but I am now giving a firm indication that when proposals come before the House to introduce charges for in-patients we will be opposing them.  I am clearly signalling my party's intention to vote against such regulations.  Fianna Fáil went into an election with a slogan that they were defending the sick, the handicapped and the elderly but this budget has done quite the opposite.  The Social Welfare Bill was published today but the promise of social welfare payments from 1 July is a hollow one when we see that it will be 24 July before they are implemented, almost a full month after the date set by the Government.  It is another con job.</P>
    <P>Public health expenditure for 1987 will be over £1,100 million.  This spending is divided into six separate health programmes including the community protection programme, under which approximately £22 million will be spent on health education, food hygiene inspections and prevention of infectious diseases. The other programmes are the community health service and the community welfare service.  The community health service have a budget of almost £176 million and the community welfare service have a budget of approximately £106 million.  The psychiatric services <Col N="1171" /> have a budget of £176 million, services for the handicapped amount to £136 million and the general hospitals services spend over £700 million, that is, the service with which we are dealing tonight.  It is obvious from these figures that over half of the money for the public health programme is spent on hospital services.  In other words, the general hospital service absorbs the largest proportion of the total health budget and we must ask ourselves if we are getting value for money.  We should be looking at that area instead of imposing extra charges.  If the Minister did nothing else over the next couple of months he should examine value for money in the health service.</P>
    <P>We should examine in detail the performance of the general hospital services programme before any extra charges are imposed on the public.  The sum of £1,100 million which is spent on health is paid for by the public and it would now seem that we are once again asking the public to put their hands in their pocket to fund the hospital services programme.  There is a grave responsibility on everybody here to ensure that value for money is obtained on behalf of the general public. We should examine the programme in detail and eliminate inefficiencies and wastage in all areas.</P>
    <P>One of the main areas where substantial savings could be made is in the capital programme in which there is a substantial cut this year.  My own experience in the health area to date has been very limited but I did have a brief opportunity to study a number of areas in relation to health through my membership of the Committee on Public Expenditure.  During my time on that committee we examined two specific instances of cost overruns relating to the development of Tralee and Beaumont hospitals.  During the period we investigated the cost overruns, the committee heard suggestions about the abuse of tender procedures in relation to some of the sub-contracts.  It was found that substantial additional works were added to the original brief after the contract stage.  This was in direct contravention of <Col N="1172" /> the regulations set out for capital projects by the Department of Health and the Department of Finance.  Costs for these additional works amounted to close on £2 million.  In that project, the final cost was originally budgeted for £7.6 million but Tralee hospital cost over £25 million. The Department argued that the original budget was too low and maintained that the final cost was still reasonable in relation to the cost per hospital bed. However, the fact remains that the approval was originally given on the basis of the budgeted amount and the final cost was an entirely different amount.  The episode in regard to Tralee hospital indicates that there is very poor public expenditure control and management and it highlights the potential abuse of budget approval procedures.</P>
    <P>In the case of Beaumont hospital, the original tender was £16.77 million based on a measurement contract but this figure was exceeded by £6.4 million.  My impression of that project was that it was rushed through using the plans for Cork hospital as a basis for tenders and making design adjustments as construction proceeded. Again, this was in direct conflict with the procedures laid down by the Department of Health hospital planning office and was definitely not prudent capital project management.</P>
    <P>Substantial savings could be made in these areas by eliminating deficiencies in the overall management and control of the capital project and the two examples I gave justify that statement.  An in-depth analysis must be carried out as to why the running costs of a hospital on an annual basis is now coming close to half its total capital cost.  Investigations must take place in relation to the system of heating, cleaning and maintenance of hospitals. Priority must be given to reducing running and maintenance costs at design and subsequent stages.</P>
    <P>During my time on the Committee on Public Expenditure, I learned that the planning office of the Department of Health is adequate but that the management and boards of the voluntary hospitals and health boards were the <Col N="1173" /> clients in almost all hospital building projects. They can and do make decisions which dramatically affect the cost of hospital building programmes.  These changes ultimately are charged to the Department of Health and, of course, eventually are paid for by the taxpayer. There must be tighter management control of all new capital projects in order to eliminate wastage and to reduce overspending. There is need for a clear development plan for the health services and each year's capital allocation should be part of a planned development.  This development plan must take into consideration the existing private health facilities as part of the national network. We must avoid duplication at all times. Now is the time for a clearly set out development plan for the health services for the next decade indicating the total capital cost in today's terms.  We must ensure that the existing hospital services are made more effective and that the health service as a whole becomes much more community centred.  I go along with Deputy Higgins' contribution earlier tonight that we are long overdue a comprehensive plan for the health services.</P>
    <P>I could talk at length about the cost of catering and housekeeping in our health services and hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to mention the terms of employment of medical consultants in the health sector which were referred to earlier by Deputy Higgins. The annual payroll cost to the Exchequer of the employment of these consultants is about £40 million.  My worry is that the terms of employment in relation to these consultants reduce the Department's ability to run the hospital system efficiently.  It is costing over £700 million. The other major question is whether the terms of the contract give the consultants an incentive to develop &mdash; or overdevelop in many cases &mdash; private practice which in turn affects the quality of service for the public health patients and puts pressure on these patients to seek extra treatment through the private health care system.  My opinion is that the common contract is a disaster.  It does not pinpoint clearly the real role and the responsibility of consultants.  It excludes specifically monitoring of the private practice arrangements which occur in our hospitals and which are funded by moneys from the taxpayer.  The contract and the rules of eligibility for patient care provide an incentive for the use of hospital facilities by the consultants and the development of private consultant practice and as a result have put a heavy financial burden on the State.</P>
      <P>There was a recommendation from the working party who set up the terms of this contract that the contract be reviewed completely after five years.  This review was due last year but to date no review has taken place.</P>

      <P>It did not take place, it is relevant now and I ask the Minister to give some indication as to whether he would enter into negotiations with the IMO immediately on this issue.  As I am sure Deputy Desmond will confirm later, attempts were made by us to enter into negotiation but the IMO resisted.  I am asking now that the Minister pursue the matter with all the power he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to you, a Leas-Cheann <Col N="1176" /> Comhairle, I will shorten my remarks. The most serious point of contention is the consultants' unrestricted right to practice.  The common contract provides the consultant with the unrestricted right to develop a service of private practice. There is a potential conflict of interest for consultants in relation to admissions to hospital in accordance with medical needs and patients eligible for public health service require to go private as a result.  The use of public facilities by consultants for the purpose of private practice can be seriously abused and the greater potential earnings from private practice can divert the time of the consultant from public commitments.  That is taking place.  This week during the radiographers' strike certain serious allegations were made to me, but in the sensitive time that we are going through now that can be left for another day.</P>
    <P>The consultants must be brought into line with the arrangements operating in Britain.  In the British system consultants are obliged to submit certified audited accounts of their earnings and they are restricted to earning 10 per cent of the public income.  Even the most conservative estimates in this country would put the consultants' earnings from private practice at least at ten times that.  Unfortunately, there is no arrangement to monitor the level of private practice consultants in our hospitals and there is a grave possibility of conflict of interest. There is an urgent need at the moment for a strategic plan for hospital services and overall health care.  The FitzGerald report of 1968 outlined a radical plan for hospital reorganisation and the plan of 1975 set up various proposals which were derived from that report.  It is vital that such a plan be developed immediately to ensure that public expenditure is controlled in an organised manner.  I ask the Minister to indicate tonight whether such a plan is in the pipeline or if he has any views on the matter.</P>
    <P>Prevention is cheaper than cure and I ask the Minister to take a greater initiative in relation to disease prevention and to step up his programmes in relation to <Col N="1177" /> the abuse of alcohol and the abuse of diet.</P>
    <P>I will finish in this limited debate by asking the Minister to let us have a comprehensive policy paper on the health services at the earliest possible opportunity. Only through a planned approach to the health service can we alleviate and possibly overcome the problems that affect us all.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of making an Estimate type of speech as Deputy Allen did earlier.  I merely want to deal with the specific that is contained in the Bill before the House.  That is, as the Minister stated, to introduce legislation to provide that by regulation a charge for out-patient services can be made.  In the Minister's speech he indicated some of the contents of the proposed regulation.  He stated that the charge he proposes to introduce by regulation is one of £10 for the first visit arising out of a particular condition. All we have at this stage is the Minister's statement of intent.  We do not have the regulation under which the Minister will do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats support the principle that those who can afford <Col N="1178" /> to pay should be asked to do so.  That is just a broad statement of principle.  It in no way implies general agreement with everything the Government might propose in the line of introducing charges for any particular service, in this case a health service.  We will at all times retain the right to examine very carefully what is contained in the regulation and to adjudicate in each individual case as to whether we felt it would operate fairly and that it would not have any injustices built into it.  We are not absolutely happy with the Bill as presented.  The level of charges which the Minister is speaking about may in some cases be reasonable but in other cases it may not be reasonable. He stated that the chief executive officers of the health boards will have the right to exercise their discretion in cases of hardship.  We have not seen the regulations under which that would operate.</P>
    <P>We will propose an amendment to the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which is before us when we come to Committee Stage.  Because of the short period available for this debate I want to indicate to the Minister at this stage what the main intent of our amendment will be.  It states:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>(d) Every regulation made by the Minister under this section or under section 53 of this Act shall be laid before the Dáil as soon as may be after it is made, but, unless within the next subsequent 21 days on which the Dáil has set after the regulation is laid before it, a resolution confirming the regulation has been passed by the Dáil, the regulation shall stand annulled but without prejudice to the validity of anything done thereunder.</P>
    <P>We are very anxious that the Minister accept that amendment.  We recognise that under the Health Act there is a provision whereby any regulation made by the Minister to introduce these charges could be challenged by a Member of the House but if that Member of the House <Col N="1179" /> is in the Opposition benches his opportunity to do so is very restricted.  In a major change in health policy the House should have full opportunity to discuss the content of the regulation which is introducing the new change.  The only satisfactory way in which the House can have that opportunity is under the proposed amendment from my party.  I ask the Minister to indicate at an early stage whether he will accept this amendment which places the onus upon him to bring the regulation to the House and requires the House to debate it and to decide whether it is for or against the proposed regulation.  Only in that way can the House satisfactorily express its wishes in regard to the content of whatever regulation the Minister makes.</P>
    <P>I am a long time in the House and I have heard sincere Ministers state that such-and-such shall only happen if you accept this Bill.  The Minister will recognise that experience has shown that either Ministers at a later date change their minds or their successors avail of legislation. If this Bill goes through in the form it is in, he, at a later stage, or some other person as Minister could introduce draconian charges for in-patient and out-patient services &mdash; my amendment covers both.  It would be entirely unsatisfactory if the House did not have an opportunity to debate it fully and decide whether it supported it and gave its authority to the introduction of the health regulations.  As the House has made an agreement that this Bill shall pass at 10.30 p.m. and that the only amendment to be accepted is an amendment from the Minister, I recognise that by indicating now the type of amendment we want it will be necessary for the Minister to indicate whether or not he will accept the amendment and put his name to it.  I can assure him that if we get that indication from him we will then be in a position to support the Bill. I make that very clear to him and ask him to be specific on that issue in his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was indicated that only amendments from the <Col N="1180" /> Minister could be accepted, that was providing for a situation where there would not be any other amendments, but now that we have other amendments that falls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get the opportunity we will put that amendment to the House.  There is also the difficulty of the time limit which means that we may not reach Committee Stage at all depending on how many more speakers wish to contribute. I do not want to use up too much time and deprive others from contributing. Having reserved our position on what the proposed regulations might be and wishing to have an opportunity to debate the regulation at a later stage when we see its full content, in principle we have no objection to the idea of charges. We are not indicating that we will support charges in all cases.  They would have to be examined very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance where the Minister is taking upon himself the authority to impose a charge for out-patient care we are very concerned at the practicalities of this and with how it will work.  I understand there have been previous attempts to apply charges for medical services in out-patient departments and casualty departments and these have not been successful.  The charge has been uncollectable. It would be remiss of the House to introduce legislation which would bring the House into disrepute in introducing some form of charge which experience had shown previously was impossible to enforce.  On behalf of my party I ask the Minister tonight to spell out in great detail how exactly these charges are to operate.  The Minister for Finance informed the House yesterday of a very strict embargo on staff employment. It is clear that there will be no new staff allowed to administer these charges.  We are quite well aware, from contacts with those in the medical profession, and from previous experience, that they have refused to handle cash at out-patient and casualty departments.  If the medical or paramedical staff are not prepared to collect the money and issue the receipts it falls to the administrative staff of the <Col N="1181" /> health boards to do so but they are not being allowed any additional staff.  It is difficult to see how the Minister will staff this system, bearing in mind that these departments operate on a 24 hour a day basis.</P>
    <P>Has any estimate been made by the Department of the cost of administering the collection of this £10 charge for the first visit or, indeed, of the £10 charge per day if one is unfortunate enough to be admitted to a hospital?  Where will the staff come from?  According to yesterday's statement no new recruitment will be allowed.  We know how pressed the health services are at present.  It would be helpful if the Minister could give some indication of how the staff were appointed on the previous occasion to collect the lesser charge.  People coming into a casualty department are not thinking of having to pay for the service.  Many come in in an emergency capacity and do not have the cash on them at the time. Many do not carry their medical cards when they arrive at the out-patients' department.  How will the staff establish whether a person is a medical card holder?</P>
    <P>If the person cannot pay at that point, will bills be sent, at 28p a stamp?  We know that in the past health boards issued letter after letter demanding payment of small amounts of money which were never paid.  Unpaid small bills were then sent to solicitors who sought to collect them and charged their own 10 per cent collection fee and we had a whole new bureaucracy with expense being added to the system, to collect a very small sum of money.  One rightly must put the question &mdash; is the Minister really satisfied that the introduction of this charge will prove beneficial to the health services, will bring in a substantial sum of money?  Can he give an assurance that he is not creating another expensive bureaucracy which will use up most of the resources he hopes to obtain from the introduction of such a charge?  How are the staff at the outpatients' departments expected to establish liability?  People can give false medical card numbers, false names and false addresses.  The staff in the health boards <Col N="1182" /> in the different regions have not taken very kindly to this form of charge in the past.  Can the Minister confirm that he is satisfied that what he is proposing now will be viable and workable?</P>
    <P>My amendment refers to the in-patient charges also.  The Minister has indicated that under section 53 of the Act he can apply in-patient charges merely by introducing a regulation which we say should be presented by him to the Dáil for ratification. He says the charge of £10 per day will go only to a maximum of £100 per annum &mdash; I do not know if that refers to the individual or the family.  How can money be collected from somebody who just cannot afford to pay?  The Minister must be well aware of families who are just short of qualifying for a medical card, or of people of very low means who, if they or a member of their family become ill and are in hospital for, say, ten days will not be able to pay the sum of £100 required.  Tens of thousands of families just do not have the money to pay a charge of that kind.  We would be very concerned about the application of such a charge.</P>
    <P>We would be very reluctant to give our support to the charges at that level until we see exactly how they will be applied. Will there be a staging of the cost?  What hardship clauses will apply?  On the surface, as the Minister has presented it, it seems very clear that families who we recognise will just not be able to afford to do so will be expected to pay up to £100.  Again, the Government are introducing a measure which will not operate. They are bringing the whole system into disrepute, going through the whole wasteful procedure of a bureaucracy trying to collect uncollectable money with all the additional cost involved in that.  That raises the question as to whether the whole exercise is worth the amount of money that will be brought in.</P>
    <P>We question the whole area of the cost of administration and of the hardship caused to families expected to pay this charge.  We are not at all happy that such a charge should be introduced at such a level for people whose income is not sufficient to qualify them for a medical <Col N="1183" /> card, many of whom are not in a position to pay VHI.  Those are the very defenceless families.  Those are the PAYE people who are most vulnerable to our taxation system.  They are caught into every type of tax levy and income tax system operated by the State.  These people in the main are the hard core of the body of workers of this country.  We wonder if the Minister is wise in the terms in which he proposes to introduce such regulations. We would reserve our position on the regulations until we see their exact content and what measures the Minister is taking to ensure that there will be no hardship and no attempt to impose a charge on families who would be in difficulty seeking to meet it.</P>
    <P>It is a little unsatisfactory at this stage. We will not give <i>carte blanche</i> to a Bill which allows the Minister the freedom to make regulations which he would not be obliged to bring before this House for ratification.  I hope the Minister clearly understands the position of my party in this matter and that he will indicate very clearly in his reply whether he will accept our amendments.  That will very much determine our attitude to the Bill in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rather disingenuously stated that the introduction of the particular charges was not a question of ideology or political philosophy. That is a rather interesting statement and one I could not help recalling when I listened to Deputy Molloy and also to Deputy Allen.  I would remind Deputy Allen that one of his colleagues said to me in Government that even if we had £600 million a year in oil revenue and even if there were no question of not being able to provide sufficient resources we must still have charges because that is an ideological attitude.  That was said to me and I will give the name privately afterwards.</P>

      <P>The view is that it is <Col N="1184" /> good for the soul, it is good for the body politic, it is good for the patient, it is good that people should take out cash and pay at the point of usage.  That is a very strong ideological viewpoint; it is a political and philosophical viewpoint as well.  On the other hand, I have said to many of my colleagues that I would prefer throughout my lifetime as I earn money to pay a reasonable level of taxation.  Then, using that taxation, when I need the services at the point of casualty, emergency or ill-health. I should be able to avail of those services without having to go through the trauma of having to find the money when my income is totally reduced or when my circumstances are totally changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will indeed.  I stand corrected.  I would ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to convey my concern to Deputy Harney.  I am citing the example of a family with £120 a week, not a princely income by any manner or means, well below the general level of earnings.  In the transportable goods industry the corresponding figure in respect of a male adult industrial worker is £170.  But a woman with a husband and two children living in a local authority house, with an income of £120 per week and paying a local authority rent, say, £10 or £11 a week will not qualify for a medical card.  Even if the husband is spending £9.50 a week on transport to and from his place of work he will not be able to claim that money as expenses in his application for a medical card.  That means that that family earning £120 a week are not eligible for a medical card. But that woman may have to take a bus from Tallaght to bring her 13-year old child into, say, the Adelaide or Meath Hospital.  Before doing so she must go to her general practitioner who may say her child has an acute infection requiring referral to a consultant.  She pays her general practitioner £12 for that piece of medical information and she spends £3 travelling into town and back again on the bus.  In addition to that, when she arrives at the Adelaide they may say: &ldquo;Sorry, before we can see you or permit a non-consultant hospital doctor to see <Col N="1187" /> your child, you must pay £10.&rdquo;  She may never see a consultant, they may be off engaging in private practice where they get £40 per consultation.  So she pays over a minimum of £10 in the out-patients' department for her child to be further examined, probably by a non-consultant hospital doctor, constituting a total outlay of £25.</P>
      <P>Deputies Molloy and Harney say there is no objection in principle to out-patient charges being imposed in respect of those who are able to pay.  I would remind them that under these regulations that woman is deemed to be able to pay.</P>

      <P>In relation to out-patient charges it is proposed to exempt those who are medical card holders and their dependants.  That is certainly generous. If we decided to reverse that policy we would be universally held in contempt by all the other western European countries. Also exempted will be all children who suffer from diseases and disabilities of a permanent and a long term nature.  The interesting thing about that is that if a child over six weeks of age, a healthy child gets a severe burn at home, which is a common cause of childhood emergency, before rushing him to an out-patients or casualty ward the mother or the father will have to go and find £10. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other exemption in relation to children refers to children who require attendance on an out-patient basis in respect of defects which have been noticed at a health examination provided in accordance with the Health Act.  That is the old story.  The Fine Gael Party will be deeply concerned to learn that it was proposed to introduce a charge of £1 in that regard as well.  Without a doubt the PDs would have gone along with that.  I would ask the Minister clarify that situation.  There is no doubt in my mind that under the exigencies of this legislation the mother or father in the case outlined will be obliged to pay the £10. Within subsections (3) and (4) the exemptions are specified and they are only in respect of defects noticed at a health examination pursuant to section 66 which I presume is the school health examination, or a particular examination notified by a public health nurse and those who are suffering from diseases and disabilities of a permanent nature.  Therefore this charge is not an out-patient charge, it is a charge in relation to out-patients and a charge in relation to accidents and emergencies.  It applies across the board.  There was a bit of public misunderstanding that one could differentiate between ordinary out-patient attendances and accident and emergency attendances.  At least the Minister has had the political honesty and the administrative sanity to admit that it applies to <Col N="1190" /> the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel.  I hope the people appreciate that.</P>
    <P>I have dealt to some extent with the ideological reason given but another administrative reason is also given.  The Department of Finance argued incessantly over four years that if we got people to pay £10, then instead of going to out-patients they would go to their GP's and would not be availing of consultant services. As we all know, one does not get access to consultants in an out-patient setting unless one first goes to the GP. The overwhelming majority of busy consultants will say that if one has not got a note from the GP, one should go back and get one and then make an appointment to attend out-patients.  The argument used by the Department of Finance that it would force people to avail of primary care at their GP's does not stand up at all.  It is an agrument which has incessantly been trotted out in favour of out-patient charges.  Another argument used in relation to the casual attendance of people at casualty and emergency clinics, is that people go in because they are lonely, and they attend out-patients clinics on a weekly basis because they can meet people to whom they can talk and there is a bit of warmth and comfort and everybody likes to talk about their health. They clutter up out-patients.  The easiest way to deal with that is to organise an out-patients setting effectively.  Most of our hospitals do not do so.  Most hospitals are badly administered.  It is not the fault of the Department but the fault of the 1970 Health Act when our revered predecessor, Deputy Erskine Childers, believed that everybody would behave like gentlemen and that if one simply devolved the system down everybody would go away and do what they wanted to do and that if you gave money to the health boards the system would be well organised and everybody would work effectively.  As we know life is different.</P>
    <P>If senior consultants were available in the out-patients department and were prepared to say to people who came in that they should not be there at all, that they should see their GP and that they did not propose to treat them, there would be <Col N="1191" /> no problem.  That requires a decision by a senior consultant but what generally happens is that a junior hospital doctor invariably decides that he will not take the responsibility and the person is subjected to at least a minimum series of tests or a multiple series of tests.  Now we have a situation where there is an out-patient attendance charge for such persons. I would ask the Minister what exactly we have by definition of out-patient attendance.  I presume it will include X-ray attendance.  Presumably an X-ray will require a £10 fee and a lab test would presumably attract a £10 charge along with other specialised investigations. I presume those attendances at specialist out-patient clinics will automatically attract a £10 charge.  People should know, they are entitled to know, and there is a great deal of confusion.</P>
    <P>I have never opposed the idea of a non-statutory requirement.  This is rigorously imposed by some hospitals.  The Western Health Board and the North Western Health Board have done this.  On a Sunday afternoon after a hurling or football match fellows with grazed shins and torn ligaments turn up at these hospitals at 5 o'clock in the evening having taken five or six pints and discover they cannot walk.  They want to clutter up and avail of the out-patient services of an accident emergency department.  They want X-rays at 10 o'clock Sunday night and all the other services.  I have no hesitation in charging those people for those services. I believe this can and should be done on a non-statutory basis and the authorities should demand that people pay for dressings, stitching and so on.  As I said, I have no objection to this but I do object to a larger number of people on the margin being statutorily obliged to pay for such services.  It is easy to argue that their case will be decided at the discretion of the chief executive officer of the health board, but we all know how difficult it is to get an administrative decision, and by the time the unfortunate person got a reply in relation to the hardship clause and the £10 charge, he might have died or developed other conditions.  It will be <Col N="1192" /> extremely difficult to administer this provision.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this proposal but I want to discuss how the system will be administered.  How can we administer this system when the Minister for Finance arbitrarily decided to save a further £11 million in the Health Estimate through no recruitment?  In the Principal Features of the Budget it says that vacancies will be filled by redeployment or promotion. The Estimate was then revised in terms of alleged savings up to £14,400,000.  The teaching hospitals and the acute hospitals which will be concerned with the imposition of this charge will receive their allocations from the Department probably next week, but if they are told to build in new systems for the imposition of those charges, we will hear howls of derision about the massive reductions in their budgets.  They will get no increase in 1987 over the 1986 figure.  In other words, in real terms there will be a 3 per cent or a 4 per cent cut in their provision for 1987.  I can hear the hospital staff telling the Minister to get knotted because of these out-patient charges because they do not have any staff to implement this scheme.</P>
    <P>The new £10 in-patient charge will require a very complex administrative system because everybody going into the hospital will have to fill in a complicated application form for exemption, or payment and the patient will have to state whether he or she has a medical card, if she is pregnant, or if he or she has AIDS. No money is being provided to operate this system.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to the £10 charge for in-patient services and said we would receive the appropriate regulations in due course.  But he also said that medical card holders and their dependants, maternity patients and certain categories of children would be exempt.  It appears from that statement that children's hospitals will be liable for the £10 in-patient charge.  Will the staff of Crumlin Hospital, Temple Street Hospital and Harcourt Street Hospital oblige a parent to pay this £10 charge if they bring in a child over six weeks old suffering from a <Col N="1193" /> conventional condition and requiring in-patient treatment?  If so, we should be told.  In the original Government assessment when these charges were being computed it was felt that children up to 16 years of age should have total exemption. If they are not getting total exemption we have to know.</P>
    <P>There would be an uproar if this charge were imposed in maternity hospitals.  It would require an amendment of the 1947 Act if we were to impose this charge where infectious diseases were concerned. If we were to amend that Act I am sure Dr. Noel Browne would write a new book about it.  When the regulations are published we will have a chance to put down a motion asking to have them rescinded.  I presume the Minister will go ahead and introduce the £10 charge for in-patient maintenance services but we must know whether the children's hospitals and the maternity hospitals, as well as the maternity unit in the general hospitals, are exempt.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have been asked to prepare appropriate insurance cover for these out-patient and in-patient charges. It must be pointed out that only one-third of the families in the country are in the VHI scheme.  There is an implicit assumption that the rest of the population are going to join the VHI.  There are 350,000 subscribers to the VHI, mostly those in the upper income group &mdash; category three, those above the £15,000 limit and a substantial number of people in category two are also members.  I am one of these people and I believe a number of self-employed are also covered by the VHI.  I do not know how the VHI will introduce a scheme with proper departmental monitoring because at times it is very difficult to know what is going on in the VHI.</P>
    <P>The Department will want to have an input into the VHI and ensure that where a new scheme is introduced there will be a departmental supervisory role.  As a matter of public policy I appointed a senior officer from the Department of Health to the board of the VHI but, I regret to say, one of the first actions of <Col N="1194" /> this Taoiseach presumably &mdash; unlike the last Cabinet, I understand this Cabinet do what they are told &mdash; was to remove from office, or secure the willing resignation of, the officer concerned and replace him by the former chairman of the VHI.  Once again the Department of Health are reduced to writing to the VHI for data which have to be cross-checked carefully in the Department.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about two things.  First, the VHI are to introduce new schemes. This will be an interesting exercise because we have to prevent a number of things in any new schemes being introduced. I presume the VHI will introduce new schemes, &ldquo;quite attractively priced&rdquo;, to quote the Minister's phrase which I rather like and it is not a departmental phrase.  However attractive they may be we do not want the range of total revenues to the VHI from those new coverages to result in cross-subsidisation of other schemes.  We had to fight a battle with the VHI and with the private interests in Blackrock and in the Mater to prevent cross-subsidisation from the other schemes into the new D and E schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine thoroughly the proposals being brought forward by the VHI because I have no doubt they will advance all sorts of reasons why there should be a general increase in their premium rates and another increase for the new coverage they will introduce.  The VHI could succeed once again in increasing substantially their reserves.  They would love to start building their own hospitals and buying out their own hospitals in a country which cannot even afford to maintain its existing hospital structures, both public and private, which find themselves in great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome warmly the points in the Minister's statement with regard to the mental handicap and psychiatric services. The Department of Health, virtually on their own &mdash; that is not an unfair comment &mdash; have pioneered major innovations and radical reforms in those areas.  I am glad to see that the Department have strengthened their advisory <Col N="1195" /> services in both the psychiatric and mental handicap areas.  That is all to the good.  I am very worried &mdash; and I can appreciate the enormous pressure which must have been brought to bear on the Minister for Health, having fought the battle for four years to maintain the capital programme of the Department &mdash; about the fact that it has now been reduced by £3 million.  The allocation is now down to £57.56 million for 1987. That is a great disappointment to me because it impinges in particular on the development of psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The major proposals with regard to Roscommon will have the support of the Minister of State if he is enlightened. There is nothing more enlightening than being a Minister of State in the Department of Health.  One is enlightened every morning and every evening if one stays there long enough.  This enlightenment can be of great benefit to the soul and of enormous benefit to Roscommon in the process.  I hope that the Minister of State will fight for his allocation out of the £57 million for the development of the psychiatric services in Roscommon and that areas such as Naas will not in any way be deprived in terms of the proposed development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional points made by the Minister for Health in regard to the document entitled &ldquo;Health: The Wider Dimension&rdquo; which was published in the run-up to the general election.  Because of the run-up to the general election that document did not receive the attention of politicians which it richly deserved.  I hope the Minister will provide an opportunity in the months ahead to have that document discussed.  Enough rubbish was discussed by the Committee of Public Expenditure in relation to the Department of Health, with due respect to Deputy Allen and his colleagues, and there were enough hares run around this House in regard to the development of the health services in recent years, mostly initiated on the Fianna Fáil side.  No doubt those days are now over.  I am glad to see the Minister is meeting with the <Col N="1196" /> chairpersons and the CEOs of the health boards.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all being solid and strong Fianna Fáil chairpersons, they will bear with the Minister when he notifies them of their allocations.  If I were in his position I would fear for my life.  They will recoil from the major reductions in allocations which they will have to explain. No doubt being solid Fianna Fáil men, in Cork, Roscommon and Dublin they will explain to the populace at large that the job has to be done and Fianna Fáil propose to do it in terms of what can only be described as serious reductions in our health services.  That fact cannot be glossed over in the framework of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The reductions will be substantial.  This will mean that the on-call services, both accident and emergency, will be reduced. It will mean that hospitals who run an accident and emergency service until midnight or until between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. will cut back on the time available. One will not have the privilege or the opportunity of paying £10 for the service because they will not be able to get into the hospitals as they will be closed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health have reduced expenditure as a proportion of GNP from 8.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent over the past four years.  They are probably the one Department of State which over and above all others curbed, reduced and reshaped the delivery of services. I regret to say that there is a political viewpoint and a Department of Finance viewpoint, which is very disturbing, which regards the health services in 1987 as fair game for another major cut.  This Bill is a watershed in that regard.  The revenue which it is hoped to collect is a miserable £6 million, if we will ever see it.  It will not enhance in any way the quality of the delivery of services.  It will not ensure a return to primary care under our health services.  Once again, it will build up another layer of bureaucracy within our health services.  In the end the people will not have the delivery of the services enhanced in any way.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the Bill.  The Labour Party spokesperson on Health, Deputy Howlin, who is unable to be present will <Col N="1197" /> deal with any further health legislation that comes before the House.  Tonight when dealing with a budget matter it is appropriate that I should be involved. When the Estimate for 1987 is settled and the outturn for this year is seen to be substantially more than the net Exchequer provision we will have another debate in the House.  I should like to sympathise with the Minister and assure him that if he brings forward measures of a constructive and practical nature he will have our total support.  In fact, he may receive more support in his term of office from us than he anticipates.  We regret that we must start our role in Opposition by voting against the measures before us because the Labour Party over the years have made a constructive contribution to the development of our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this legislation for a number of reasons.  The over-all economic situation and prospects were spelt out quite clearly last night by the Minister for Finance. This evening, the Minister for Health has made it perfectly clear what this means in respect of the health services.  I would absolutely agree that the imposition of charges for very selected categories of persons is infinitely better than the alternatives which would include the cutting or restriction of services.  The charges that are being proposed under the Bill for out-patients and the circumstances in which those charges will be applied, I strongly suggest are preferable to the kind of charges which I understand were being suggested by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again the categories of people that will be exempted from these charges.  These are: medical card holders and their dependants; maternity patients; children under six weeks of age; children who suffer from long-term illnesses and disabilities; children referred from school health examinations and clinics and people <Col N="1198" /> receiving treatment for infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>That, the House must agree, is a comprehensive list of exemptions designed specifically to protect the most needy in society.  In particular, I would like to point out that in the imposition of those charges, the provisions in the Health Acts will be applied which allow chief executive officers of health boards to determine that if a person not in these categories clearly would suffer hardship by paying the charges, he may be exempted.  All in all, therefore, I believe that very adequate provision has been made for the most disadvantaged while at the same time providing that those who can pay should make a further contribution to the cost of the services.</P>
    <P>If one considers what precisely is involved in these proposals, I would suggest that they will be seen to be quite reasonable.  I am personally very well aware of the way that the casualty Departments of hospitals are being misused at present.  These departments are being used by people for all kinds of minor ailments and illnesses which are proper for their general practitioners. Yet, these departments which should be seen as catering for emergencies are being diverted by the demand for treatment for non-emergencies.  Obviously, one of the great attractions of using a casualty department is that the service provided is free of charge.  In other words, to an increasing extent, the general practitioner is being by-passed.  If one considers that the charge of £10 which is now being proposed is more or less the level of charge made by a general practitioner, I think it will be accepted that the proposals in respect of casualty services now being proposed, are justified.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would like to point out that the charges proposed will be applied only for the first visit in respect of a particular illness.  The return visits will be free of charge.  In this regard, many Deputies will be aware that in a number of health board areas at present, voluntary contributions are being made by people for these same services but to my <Col N="1199" /> knowledge these contributions are expected for all visits to a consultant or casualty department including return visits.  I have had experience of dealing with the local hospital in Roscommon where an excellent emergency service is provided and, having made 12 visits, I was charged £5 for each visit.  That is an indication that the new charge will represent a reduction on existing charges. In fact, what is being proposed now is a more equitable arrangement and indeed in those health board areas will not come as any surprise or increased burden.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as an indication of the care being taken to make sure that commonsense arrangements will be made, it is the intention that if a person goes to a casualty department and in respect of that visit requires an X-ray or a pathology service, a single charge of £10 will be made covering the treatment provided in those circumstances.  That should clarify the question raised by the former Minister, Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, the worst possible motives will be read into these proposals, but, as I said at the beginning, given the circumstances in which the country finds itself economically at the moment, the charges proposed and the exemptions which will be made, should not pose a significant hardship on any sector of society.  And even for those people who will be required to pay, the Minister has stated that arrangements are being made with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board so that those people can insure themselves against those charges at minimal cost.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask Deputies to consider these proposals from the point of view of the contribution they will make to preserving the essential elements of the health services.  This, it must be agreed has to be the priority in our approach during these very difficult times.  The charges represent less of an imposition than those proposed by the previous Government for prescriptions. In my view had we adopted those proposals the needy in our society would <Col N="1200" /> have suffered severe hardships.  I recommend the Bill to the House and seek the support of Members for the measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias de Rossa Proinsias de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state what is a truism, that the health of the people of the country is one of the most important aspects of the responsibilities of a Government.  It can be taken from that that the basic principle of socialism, whatever about PDism, Fine Gaelism or Fianna Fáilism is that no person should have to pay or be deprived of a service because they do not have the money to pay for it or that the quality or level of the service should be restricted in any way because of a person's inability to pay for it.  It is our contention that the health services should be free at the point of delivery and that those who can afford to pay for the services should do so through their taxes.  The tax system should be in such a comprehensive state that everybody pays to the limit of their capacity so that those who cannot afford to pay for a health service at the point of the delivery, for whatever reason, are not required to do so.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the proposals in the Bill, and in the regulations the Minister proposes to introduce concerning charges for maintenance on a daily basis, and the severe cutbacks in allocations to health boards, represent an attack on the fundamental principles I have outlined. There is no doubt that two types of hospital service operate in the State.  We have one service available to private patients who have the money to pay for it, who can go at will to visit their private consultants and who are assisted by the VHI which, in turn, is subsidised indirectly by the taxpayer.  The public patient who cannot afford the VHI or to pay doctors or for hospital services is treated differently.  They must take their place on queues and waiting lists for a whole variety of services, not just hospital services.  This move by the Government is a deepening and strengthening of that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit puzzled by the Fine Gael spokespersons.  They made very strong speeches against the increase in the <Col N="1201" /> health charges from 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent but they disappeared when the vote was called.  Their spokesman on Health, Deputy Bernard Allen, made great play of the fact that they will oppose the regulations on the charge per day per bed but he was not very clear about what his party will do on this Bill tonight.  Perhaps the next Fine Gael speaker, Deputy Flaherty, will clarify exactly what Fine Gael's attitude is to hospital out-patient charges and daily maintenance charges. If by speech it is intended to convey to the population that Fine Gael oppose these measures, they should also vote against them.  In the previous Dáil a number of Deputies, including the then Deputy Liam Skelly, spoke on numerous occasions against Government policy but went willy nilly into the lobbies in support of the Government.</P>

      <P>I should hate to see the same fate befall any of the present Fine Gael incumbents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen has already said that the proposals in this Bill and the proposed regulations to be made in the future constitute one of the most stringent attacks on the health services perpetrated at any time by any Fianna Fáil Government. They seem anxious to push the trend towards privatising the health services and creating a two-tiered health service, one tier of which is readily available to those who can afford to pay but the second of which provides queues and waiting lists for those who cannot afford to pay.  They seem to be determined to ensure that a person who is ill and poor will not get the best available services.  It is significant that when calls for cuts come from the right it is always the education and welfare services which are the first target.  It is significant that these are the services which are of most concern to the least well off.  I know Fianna Fáil hate being described as being on the right but this legislation places them very firmly in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> Whatever one may say about the dire circumstances of those who are unemployed, it is a growing phenomenon that a large number of people who are employed are on such low wages, perhaps marginally above the various eligibility limits for medical cards and so on, that they are increasingly caught in a poverty trap and liable for payments such as those proposed in this Bill.  There is no doubt that the imposition of these and future charges will cause severe hardship to many families.  Deputy Desmond has already outlined the possibilities for a family in Tallaght who must bring a child to a doctor and then to a hospital, perhaps to be kept over night.  That will be a continuing reality.</P>
    <P>Despite the assurances by the Government that there will be a hardship clause and that people may appeal against charges, people generally are in such fear of getting into debt that rather than face the possibility of going into hospital and not having the money to pay, they will avoid going to hospital and avoid the embarrassment of being asked awkward questions in front of everybody in the waiting room as to whether they can afford the £10 charge.  That is the fear people will have, regardless of the way the system is worked.</P>
    <P>In relation to asthmatics, parents who are themselves asthmatic go without their inhaler drugs in order to provide other items of necessity for the rest of the family.  I know of young people who are asthmatics and cannot get their inhalers if they do not have a medical card.  They do not have the money to buy these inhalers and they are not prepared to go begging for the small amount of money required to keep them alive.</P>
    <P>This imposition of charges for out-patient treatment and maintenance is an attack on the dignity of people.  It will introduce a whole new range of means test at hospital level.  These people generally have enough to put up with in relation to means tests for rents if they happen to live in a local authority house or if they seek supplementary welfare allowance or a medical card.  This will be a further lowering of the dignity of people <Col N="1203" /> who find themselves in unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing is a gradual privatisation of the service.  We are told that the VHI would provide a safety net for people who would find themselves outside the medical card limits but caught for these charges in hospitals.  The Minister said a review was being carried out in relation to the VHI.  I wonder what kind of review it is.  They have moved far away from what was originally intended. They have moved into the area of providing luxury hospitals and services for a small proportion of the population who, because of their high incomes, benefit most from the £30 million subsidy which the State provides indirectly to VHI through the taxation system.  There is definitely a need to review the operations of the VHI to see exactly where they fit into the provision of hospital and other services.  More and more patients are being forced into the VHI because of the continual reduction in the level of public services.</P>
    <P>The VHI are providing and subsidising very exclusive four star luxury accommodation in hospitals for people who should not be receiving subsidised medicine, given the present nature of the system.  I have no objection to people getting luxury treatment in hospital provided the same treatment is available to all patients.  I do not accept that there should be two levels of service, one for the public patient and another for the private patient who can afford that kind of service, which the VHI have assisted in creating.</P>
    <P>If one is to accept the statements of the Minister and of previous Ministers from all sides of the House, there is an urgent need to review and reform our health services.  We must also look very carefully at the way money is spent on these services. It is significant that despite the large amount of money expended on paying consultants, doctors and chemists on a fee per item basis, the new Government have not faced this problem and we are faced with a proposal to charge some of the poorest in society for visiting the <Col N="1204" /> out-patients department in a hospital or who have to spend a few days or weeks in hospital.</P>
    <P>The vested interests in the medical profession must be taken on but I have no faith in the ability of Fianna Fáil to do this.  I do not believe they have the courage or the will to tackle the medical or the pharmaceutical profession or the drugs industry who are taking in hundreds of millions of pounds from the medical services. I am a member of the Eastern Health Board and it only recently came to my notice that when chemists fulfil a prescription for a patient under the GMS they are paid a basic prescription fee and the drugs are sold at a wholesale rate. However, if a person goes to them with a green book &mdash; which denotes long term illness &mdash; the drugs are supplied at the retail rate.  The Eastern Health Board attempted on a number of occasions to switch people from the green book to a medical card to use the resources of the board more efficiently but the chemists' representatives kicked up blue murder. There was no way they would allow a switch from the green book to the medical card for these patients because it would mean a loss to them of the difference between handing out the drugs at the retail price and the wholesale price. That is an anomaly I would have liked to hear the Minister say he would tackle. He did not announce that but he indicated that he expects savings of £8 million in administrative costs and so on.  How does he intend to do that?  Will the travel expenses he expects to save on be those of the consultants or will they relate to the expenses of the unfortunate person who has to go to a hospital for physiotherapy once a week and who cannot get an ambulance or a taxi for this service?</P>
    <P>The introduction of the proposed charges is an attack on the patient rather than on the rip-off in the health services.  There is a failure by the Government to apply themselves to where real savings can be made.  If the Minister tackled the fee per item system for chemists and doctors, the overwhelming control which the consultants seem to have on the medical services and the way in which consultants <Col N="1205" /> appear to have the use of public hospitals provided by taxpayers' money to treat their private patients, he would save far more money and would not only be able to maintain services as they are for public patients but improve them significantly.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party will vote against this Bill.  We have put down two amendments and, as the Progressive Democrats will either abstain or vote for the Bill, we appeal to the Minister to at least exclude children from the proposed charges.  As I understand it, the Minister can make regulations in consultation with the Minister for Finance without coming back to this House.  If the Bill is passed tonight, the House should have the right to examine the regulations which the Minister is bringing in and, in the light of the wisdom of the House, either to refuse to sanction them or to amend them.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to some remarks made by Deputy Desmond who, regrettably, is now absent.  He indicated that Fine Gael were champing at the bit in their attempts to implement not just the £10 per day in-patient charge but even higher charges.  That remark is clearly untrue because Fine Gael had every opportunity, having bade farewell to the Labour Party in highly publicised circumstances, to do exactly what they liked with their own Book of Estimates and budget.  There was no recourse to such a charge.  I also very much object to Deputy Desmond's practice &mdash; in which he is engaging far too often &mdash; of breaking a certain element of confidentiality which is contrary to all the traditions of the House.  You, a Cheann Comhairle, corrected another Deputy in the House for referring to a Member who was not present and there are no members of the former Cabinet here to indicate whether he is telling the truth and to answer the charges he made.  Deputy Desmond should refrain from this practice, although I know his tongue tends to run away with him at times in a colourful and entertaining fashion &mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was seen by many people, on occasion by some Fine Gael backbenchers, as one of the sharpest cutting edges of the last Government who perhaps outdid many of the so-called right wing Fine Gael partners in his excesses.  I find it incredible that he is now turning about in this double-sided fashion and being the spokesman of the poor overnight.

      <P>This Bill gives us the first opportunity to deal in totality with the £10 in-patient charge on which we have very strong views, and we have views about the out-patient charges which I would like the Minister to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it in a nutshell. I support the amendments put down by Deputy Molloy and by The Workers' Party in relation to the laying of the order before this House.  It is important that this should be done.  I ask the Minister to accept that amendment and to include it himself tonight before the Bill is finalised. It is democratically desirable, a very necessary check and a major new departure in the financing of the health services.</P>
      <P>In the implementation of this proposal I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether another group might be looked at favourably and perhaps excluded from the charges.  One of the main purposes behind this was to curb excessive use of highly staffed medical facilities.  Persons referred to out-patient departments by doctors are clearly not in this category and if they are eligible under existing regulations they will have already paid a charge and will have cut down on the feature outlined by Deputy Desmond. Some consideration should be given to whether in those circumstances it would be appropriate to initiate a charge because the treatment is initiated not at the out-patient department but at the point of the doctor who refers them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, if the Minister has time to respond I would like him to indicate what kind of arrangements will be made for the payment of these charges.  This obviously is a very touchy issue, given the nature of out-patient services and the experience of these charges when <Col N="1208" /> implemented previously by the then Minister, Deputy Woods.  The previous charges proved unworkable simply because out-patient departments are oriented totally towards the delivery of emergency services and are particularly unsuited to the management or collection of moneys. How does the Minister propose to organise that?  This provides a very difficult problem for doctors whose main concern is the health and care of patients.  How is that to be married to the need to check? This is obviously a procedural arrangement.</P>
    <P>The question of children was raised by The Workers' Party and they made the valid point that children are referred to hospitals quite regularly and, as I know from direct experience, are much inclined to need medical attention regularly, often for minor ailments.  Many parents will have medical cards but many will not.  There is a tradition of presenting children at hospitals, particularly children's hospitals, where one feels that one gets an expert's attention which may be crucial in the case of a child's health.  We have no objection to the implementation of charges <i>per se</i> and we would not oppose charges in principle.  However, we oppose the proposal to bring in a £10 charge for in-patient services and we will vote against it because this has been a selected budgetary measure put in place of a series of budgetary measures which we had provided as an alternative.</P>
    <P>The main change which the incoming Government made in relation to new savings was the abolition of our proposed saving of £16 million by the implementation of prescription charges.  The major element in that, based on assessments from the Department, related to savings on drugs.  The anticipated revenue from individuals was of the order of £2 million to £3 million out of that proposed saving. The proposed contribution from individuals under this is £6 million.  Furthermore, it is in the context of a very different budget.  It has far greater implications for people than the random payment of £10 at the point where one might want to go to an out-patient department <Col N="1209" /> if one were ill and in need of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>It is not an individual's choice to end up in hospital.  Generally hospitalisation is recommended by a doctor, lasts as long as that doctor considers it necessary and the person then goes home.  He or she has no choice about the length of the hospital stay or of alternative ways of dealing with it other than perhaps to get no treatment.  Therefore, it is very different from the proposal to put charges on out-patients.  For the average hospital stay which is of the order of about ten days, coincidentally, the figure has been set at £100.  Many people have no VHI. If one third of the people have VHI and probably the same percentage have medical cards &mdash; I am not sure of that percentage but Deputy Desmond has the figures &mdash; there is a middle segment who can least afford these charges and will be most hit by them.  The only alternative they will have is to insure themselves, and it is quite clear that that is the Government's intention.  Therefore, the effect will be that the average person must take on an insurance policy which will be an extra tax on him or her.  This budget introduces other taxes that we had not proposed.  We find this charge unacceptable when other savings are available which would have a more acceptable health outcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was louder than anybody else in his criticism of the excessive use of drugs and hospitalisation and he said we were in love with hospitals and medical care.  He said on many occasions here that we spend more time in hospitals and we use more medicines than people in most other jurisdictions.  This is a problem and in so far as out-patient charges may in some way relate to that, we support them.  We do not support in-patient charges and we ask why the Minister did not implement some prescription charges. Even jurisdictions across the water that have a public health service much more complete than ours have implemented such charges for the good of the individuals and to restrain them from excessive recourse to drugs.  We have a practice of overprescribing drugs <Col N="1210" /> here.  The net effect of this approach would be an economy and an improved approach to health.</P>
    <P>Other health areas in the budget worry us very much.  The £10 million in increased savings in the area of recruitment is an example.  The implications of this are difficult to comprehend but, given the demands on the health services and the fact that they have been screaming for so long about a lack of money, this further slicing off was to make up for the fact that the proposal to eliminate prescription charges was abolished.  That saving and the revenue brought in from the hospital in-patient charges combined to make up for that.  That is why we object to both of these measures.  Our proposal to effect a saving in another fashion was far more defensible.</P>
    <P>There are areas in the health service that need expansion.  The Minister in his speech referred to the area of mental handicap, an area which concerns me very much.  I have argued with the outgoing Minister that there is a total lack of provision for services particularly in the north Dublin area and I am sure similar needs exist throughout the country. These excessive, unspecified cuts, with the further £5 million in various efficiency measures that will take place in other Estimates, must leave very little room for manoeuvre.  There was little enough room for manoeuvre anyway but these must make any kind of development virtually impossible.  I wonder how the Minister will be able to honour any of the commendable intent in the latter part of his speech in relation to psychiatric services and services for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the soft option on this.  The most vulnerable people in the PAYE sector, those with the least disposable income, have been hit.  The reason we find this charge, referred to in the Minister's speech, so unacceptable is because there was before him a package of much more acceptable ways of dealing with the revenue problems.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response as to how the Government adopted what was rejected and what was regularly on <Col N="1211" /> the table from the Department of Finance during the years as an option for saving.  This has shocked the people and gives a lie to the matter I referred to earlier, the cynical posters which were put up all over the county and which must if they have any sense of honour, haunt those Members on the benches opposite.</P>
    <P>The health cuts hit the old, the sick and the handicapped.  I do not propose to present that as simplistically as the Government did in their election programme because the issues are much more complex and the problems facing the country are far more real than that. That is why we on this side of the House are trying to maintain a difficult line, which is to support measures to control spending which we consider are necessary in the interest of the public good.  We reserve the right, and we are indicating our intention to act upon that right, to object to specific elements which we believe are not justified and are not necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief.  The purpose of my contribution is to stress the desirability of adopting the amendment proposed by my party colleague and spokesman on Health, for the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Robert Molloy.  The advice available to the Minister doubtless will be to the effect that section 5(5) of the Health Act, 1947, makes provision in a general global way, which applies to all the Health Acts which are to be construed together, for the manner in which regulations are to be brought before this House.  That is the negative or permissive manner of subordinate legislation which involves merely laying the relevant legislation before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas by making it available in the Library of the Oireachtas.  The onus is then on anyone who wants to cancel or annul the particular measure to bring a motion in that regard before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some matters, and it is well recognised in legislative practice, which are of such significance and importance that they are dealt with in another <Col N="1212" /> manner.  That is, that the person who proposes to make the regulation was to bring it before the House to have it expressly approved rather than to have it implicitly approved by lack of challenge which is the situation in relation to other regulations made under the various Health Acts.  I am submitting to the House that on this occasion the regulations provided for in this amending Bill are of such wide-reaching significance and importance that they deserve to be dealt with in a manner which requires positive approval before they have the force of law rather than the negative, implicit approval based on the fact that nobody has found them of sufficient importance to oppose them.</P>
    <P>These regulations are of far-reaching significance, especially for the weakest in society.  Everybody in the House is aware of this because the Minister acknowledges it by assuring the House of his intentions in relation to the regulations that he proposes to bring forward.  I suggest to the House that it is incumbent on us to provide a protection for those people especially when we can do so at no cost, except perhaps the minor administrative inconvenience that any Minister for Health has who wishes to make regulations under this section alone, to come to this House and have those regulations approved.  Could anything be a more simple safeguard and less expensive in time and effort than that simple alteration which Deputy Molloy proposed compared with the enormous hardship and suffering which could occur were we in future to allow a Minister, with less sensitivity than the present Minister is demonstrating in the regulations he is describing to the House, to come before the House with draconian and wide-reaching proposals to impose charges of very different kinds on out-patients? What protection will there be if it is cast on the Opposition at that time to seek to annul those regulations rather than putting the onus on that Minister, whoever he may be, to justify what he doing and to get the explicit support of the entire House?  What I am underlining is <Col N="1213" /> the balance that Deputy Molloy's amendment proposes to establish.</P>
    <P>This legislation is merely enabling legislation.  It has capacity for good and capacity for harm.  Its capacity for harm is best safeguarded against by requiring a Minister for Health who proposes to avail of the powers made available to him in this legislation to come before the House and justify his use of those powers. It is not much to ask.  It has no ideological content, as is shown by the variety of contributions in favour of the principle by speakers from a variety of backgrounds and with a variety of different viewpoints as to how the legislation should and should not be used, but merely gives this House what it should always seek, that is, some degree of control over the powers it delegates to Ministers to exercise on its behalf.  I ask this of the House, that it considers whether this particular set of powers is of such potential for injustice as to require this additional safeguard.  I ask the Minister therefore to accept Deputy Molloy's reasoned and reasonable amendment to the legislation and to make a distinction between the power being conferred on the Minister by this 1987 amending Bill, and the generality of regulations under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>All I am asking is that this House puts the Minister of the day to a slight administrative inconvenience in order to safeguard the interests of those who some time in the future may not have as strong a voice as they may have now.  We should have regard to that danger.  It is my belief that if all the Deputies of this House assemble here this evening to cast their vote on this issue, this measure will pass regardless of whether the Government give it their support.  I appeal to the Minister that in a spirit of generosity, cooperation and reasonableness perhaps, he ignores the advice I anticipate he will receive to the effect that section 5 of the 1947 Act is sufficient safeguard and to accede to what is offered in a generous spirit here, as a genuine effort to improve this Bill and to make it more just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker, <Col N="1214" /> Deputy McDowell, was making the point that he thought this Bill might be used for good or for bad and that the regulations that might arise thereunder might have to be looked at by the House from time to time in that light.  The Labour Party do not agree with that view.  We see that this Bill is not needed.  We see that the proposal which is associated with this Bill, which was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement and by the Minister for Health here today, is a disgrace and an outrage and should not have been brought before this House.  Already from around the country and certainly in my constituency I have had reports from very many people in the course of today.  There is a sense of absolute fear and apprehension of what the implications of this measure will be for so many people who are living literally on the breadline, from hand to mouth, and whose money runs out before the next pay day comes around.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks of priorities and says we must have a sense of priority in the various measures we introduce.  What greater priority could there be than to ensure the basic health needs of those who cannot afford to pay for them?  What greater priority could any country seek to provide for its citizens who are in poor financial circumstances, as tragically so many are today, than to ensure that their health is provided for?  Who is it that goes to the out-patients' departments in the hospitals, anyway?  Let us consider that aspect.  Is it the people with &ldquo;mercs&rdquo;, or other big expensive cars, or big incomes? Deputy Harney made the point that we do not have to provide these services for those on £40,000.  Those people would not be seen dead inside an out-patients' department, queueing up for hours on end, waiting to get a basic and necessary service.  They go to the other system, the other side of the coin, to which Deputy De Rossa referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two systems of medicine in operation in this country, two systems of doctoring, of hospitals.  One you might refer to in a genteel fashion as the public system and the other &mdash; let us call a spade a spade &mdash; the luxury system.  Those who <Col N="1215" /> participate in, or avail of, the luxury system do not go down to the out-patients' department.  They do not sit there for many hours waiting to have the basic medical needs of themselves, their wives or their families attended to.  It is the people who are in poor circumstances who go there.  That is where the attack is directed in this measure and in so many of the other measures that have been introduced in this budget.  The Government say that only those who can afford to pay and those alone are to be affected by this measure.  Is that really so?  Just look at the matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, outlines those who are exempted &mdash; that is fine.  He has not set out those who are not exempted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond analysed a section of one category that is not exempted &mdash; those, and there are so many, on low income, taking home £130 or £140 per week or maybe less, to support a wife and some children.  Many of those work in the public service and their salaries are frozen now also.  Apart from the salaries of departmental secretaries, principal officers and so on, the salaries of those who are employed by the local authorities or who are employed in menial tasks in the public service and bringing home very low pay are to be frozen also.  These people opt to remain in employment but their wages are being frozen in this budget; they are the ones who are being attacked here.</P>
    <P>If attacks had to be brought in on medicine, why was not some tax brought in on the luxury end of medicine &mdash; the Blackrock Clinic operating now in all its grandeur and grandiose glory to furnish the needs of the upper echelons of this country who have been barely touched by the budget introduced by this Government? Where is the surcharge brought in on their medicine?  Are their medicine, their service, their expensive clinics and that line of service, encompassing the Fitzwilliam Squares and so on, being surcharged? No, it is the weaker section. I have heard so many speakers on the Government side &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and other Ministers <Col N="1216" />&mdash; say that they seek to protect the weaker sections of the community.  There is some idea that if you repeat the phrase often enough maybe you will come to believe it yourself.  Perhaps with some type of media hype with constant repetition, people will come to believe that it is so.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health can repeat it all the times they like.  The facts show otherwise.  They show that the attacks here are directed at those on the lowest levels of society, those bringing home £130 per week, those who are struggling, perhaps with their first home and with a mortgage.  The people subscribing to the VHI will have their premiums increased and the Minister for Health tells these people, who are struggling on low wages and waiting until the money comes in on the following Friday because they are out of money, to find a charge of £10 to bring a sick child to the hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health gives a whole list of reasons for people using the OPD services.  In fairness to him he mentioned, as the last one, what I believe is the correct and true reason, that the service is free.  The reason for this is not because they want to avail of something to which they are not entitled but because it is free.</P>
    <P>Of course the country is in a difficult economic situation; we know that.  The Minister said in the course of his introductory remarks that the priorities for the country must be identified.  I would ask him, what are the priorities?  Here is one selected to be hit, this one, attendances at OPDs or having to go to hospital as an in-patient, something in respect of which a person has no choice.  When VAT was introduced it used to be said: ah, well, one had a choice, one could decide whether to buy an article and suffer the imposition of VAT.  When one is sick or one's children and one is worried &mdash; one may be worried needlessly but the Minister as a doctor will known that many people's worry is real nonetheless &mdash; one does not have any choice, that is not like deciding to buy an article on which VAT is charged.  This is quite involuntary.  One <Col N="1217" /> may have to go around and beg, borrow or steal the £10 to have one's child attended to.  The Minister says that the priorities for the country must be identified. That is a fair enough suggestion. One might well ask the question: what are the priorities that he and his Government have selected and brought forward in this budget?  For example, did he select the introduction of some realistic capital taxation?  Could that not be said to be a fair and reasonable priority the Government might have considered having regard to the fact that capital taxation now is but a mere fraction of what it was ten or 12 years ago?  Oh, no, no such suggestion; I do not hear anybody of the three main right wing parties advocating that.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Bernard Allen was making his contribution &mdash; one that means life and health, bread and butter to so many people &mdash; I noted down some words he used in the course of his remarks, four, five or six times.  Value for money, he said; efficiency, he said; wastage, he said; expenditure control, he said; management, he said &mdash; these are the words being used when there are families without a penny in their pocket waiting for Friday to come, their child ill, coughing.  What are they supposed to do, are they to use the GP service?  No, until now the OPD was always the bottom line, this constituted the fall-back position for those who were on the floor.  They knew they could always go to the outpatients' department of a hospital.  That has been traditional going back for decades.  One might not have had a penny in one's pocket but at least one knew that one could resort to that fall-back position and go down to the out-patients' department of a hospital.  It may not have been a wonderful service at all times, one may have had a long wait once there or have experienced difficulty getting there.  At least one knew that one would not be turned away because one could not produce £10.  One knew that one's child would be attended to, which constituted some sense of comfort to those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that they will provide an insurance system instead.  The hard <Col N="1218" /> fact of the matter is that, tragically, I know in my constituency, Tallaght &mdash; and it must be the same up and down the country &mdash; there are thousands of people who do not know of and could not afford to take out insurance on the pieces of furniture they have in their corporation or council houses; they just could not afford to pay the relevant premium.  They would not have the expertise to go and see a broker to arrange such insurance. Those people who are at risk do not insure their meagre belongings in their homes &mdash; and there have been many such cases where fires have occurred and their entire belongings have been destroyed. In many cases, particularly in local authority dwellings in Tallaght we discovered they had no insurance or were not covered at all in respect of those items. Yet the Minister says: do not worry about that, we will set up an insurance scheme for you so that you will be able to take care of your health and that of your wife and children by arranging insurance cover through the VHI.  I might tell the Minister that that proposition is not realistic.  Such people could not afford to take out that insurance or to pay the premiums, they would not know how to set about doing it.  Yet a basic health facility, that of life and limb are at stake here.  I have no doubt that people will be frightened to go down to the out-patients' department of a hospital.  I know they are already in a state of fear about the provisions of this Bill.  So many people have already telephoned me today about this, asking me what they can possibly do in this position, how could this charge be imposed in respect of a basic matter such as health?  They have asked: if we need to have an operation how do we find £50. Yet it is something people have to have when the need arises.  This Bill constitutes the most unfeeling, unthinking measure ever.  I am amazed that the Government have introduced it in these times of difficulty and stress.</P>
    <P>If there are some priority needs then I say the Government should introduce some capital taxation or at least restore capital taxation to the level obtaining 12 years ago, using that money to provide <Col N="1219" /> this small basic need &mdash; the £6 million they hope to raise from these charges.  I would remind the House that £12 million more than is at present being raised from capital taxation was raised 12 years ago. One might well ask: what would the equivalent figure be were it updated to take account of inflation?  I would advocate that the Government should restore even a modest measure of capital taxation rather than take from those who cannot afford it, those on low incomes or social welfare, robbing them of that basic, fall-back position to which they could resort.</P>
    <P>What about the farmers?  Could they not make some reasonable contribution now instead of the modest contribution they were making until now by way of the land tax?  The Government had to abolish that tax, about which the farmers did not complain, it was so small anyway. Perhaps they could have raised that tax somewhat, using that money to provide this basic floor facility or, alternatively, impose a tax on luxury medicine so that this basic floor or fall-back position for those in appalling circumstances could be maintained, when they would have the solace, of knowing that they did not have to worry, that there was somewhere they could go when their children fell ill, when there was something happening they did not understand.</P>
    <P>Those are the priorities this Government might well have considered but chose to ignore.  They chose to hit those who can least afford the charges, notwithstanding repetition of comment to the contrary.  No matter how many times the Taoiseach or the Minister repeat it the facts show otherwise.  An analysis of the details show that those at the lower end of the scale are hit hardest by every such measure contained in this budget, while those in the upper echelons escape virtually unscathed.  It is an outrage and a disgrace.  I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to withdraw this proposal, abandon it, to find his £6 million in some other way.  There is plenty of scope for him to do so.  He should not impose this appalling visitation on the poor when they have had that basic <Col N="1220" /> facility available to them for decades. Their fathers and grandfathers always knew they could go down to, say, the Meath, St. James's Hospital, or wherever, where they knew they would be received and get the attention they needed.</P>

      <P>I welcome an opportunity of making a few points on this important Bill we have been discussing for the past two and a half hours or so. As one who has been a Member of this House over a number of years, having listened, as I did earlier this evening, to Deputy B. Desmond, it was difficult for me to forget some of the things over which that Minister presided in the last four years.

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention now or ever to utter untruthful statements about any Minister or former Minister in this House.  I spent one whole afternoon visiting patients in the Carlow Psychiatric Hospital and I remember well what they, their relatives and the members of the staff felt about the Minister's activities only a few short months ago.  Deputy Desmond showed a lot of concern for the woman from Tallaght who has £120 a week and a couple of children and asked what happens when she or one of her children gets ill and has to go to an out-patients department.  No matter where the woman comes from, it is only reasonable that people on low incomes should have free access to both out-patient and in-patient hospital and medical services.  Those who can well afford it should pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many cases where people earning incomes of up to £40,000 go to the out-patient services in our public hospitals.  Many people I know, people who can well afford to pay, have gone for X-rays, blood tests and used other facilities in the out-patient departments of our public hospitals.  It is wrong to subsidise everybody irrespective of their ability to pay.  The Progressive Democrats believe that the principle of asking people to make small contributions towards medical expenses is reasonable in cases where people can afford to pay. However, it would be unreasonable to give the Minister a blank cheque, as this Bill seeks to do if not amended, so that <Col N="1222" /> we would not be in a position to discuss the details of regulations which may be introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister is saying in good faith tonight that he intends to levy £10 for the first visit relating to a problem and he made other references to the in-patient charges.  It may well be the case, in a couple of months time, if we give him a blank cheque on these regulations, that these charges will be increased and this could place an unfair burden on people less well able to pay.  Already the Minister for Finance, Deputy Mac-Sharry, has said it may be necessary to bring in a mini-budget in a couple of months time.  Tonight we could also be giving a blank cheque to the Minister's successors, because tonight we are bringing in enabling legislation and all that will be required is for any Minister for Health to bring in, by way of regulation, charges for out-patient services in our community, which do not have to be debated in this House.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have failed as a society to respond to the economic crisis that confronts us.  In so far as this Government are making a determined effort, I want to see them being given support, because I am tired of the politics which says that just because one changes sides in the House something one proposed a couple of weeks ago is now wrong.  That kind of hypocrisy must end if politicians are to respond to the demands being made by the people.  That is why I was appalled to hear Deputy Desmond outline details of Cabinet information.</P>

I do not want the taxpayers continually having to pay in their income tax for services to which other people should be able to make some contribution. That is what the Minister is seeking to do and I would ask him, as did Deputy McDowell and Deputy Molloy, to be reasonable and accept the amendment which asks the Minister and his successors to bring before this House, for debate and approval, any regulations that he may make as a result of this Bill being passed tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I want to allow time for a reply.  I want to correct one or two impressions that might have been given.  This debate has as its background the question of general provision <i>versus</i> private provision or selective provision.  Let us be clear about this.  Where a private provision in health care has flourished it has always driven down the standard of general care and I defy people to produce evidence to the contrary.  In Britain, for example, where people have published work on the differing character of the different health services in their own country and in other countries, they have made the point that so-called private provision in health care is never really private in that the greater proportion of its costs are not provided for privately.  People do not pay for the education of doctors, or for the building of hospitals.  They provide an increment in addition to what has been State expenditure that has been transferred from public taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, what happens is that the more that is allocated to private provision, the more one drives <Col N="1225" /> down the volume of resources available for general care, so one either provides a general health system funded by direct taxation or one brings in a mixed system which indirectly transfers privileges. What I have listened to in the course of the budget is something else &mdash; a number of non-supported assertions concerning the behaviour of poorer sections of the community.  I have heard in this debate that people are flocking to out-patient centres simply because they are available and free.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing my remarks to you.  I want to place on the record one piece of research which can be checked.  It is in the <i>Irish Medical Journal.</i> 1980, and the officials can point out the details.  In a survey of 104 elderly people in North Dublin they were found to have 174 treatable illnesses and they were not being treated because they were beyond the medical card guidelines.  For all these assertions about people abusing services, you could find pockets of people who are not coming forward because they feel they cannot afford health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interesting side fo this is the more you move away from public Exchequer provision for health care the less accountable it becomes, the more privileged it becomes.  In 1986, 85.7 per cent of the cost of health care was carried by the Exchequer, about 6.2 per cent was carried by levies and 8.1 per cent in charges. The more it is shifted into levies the less accountable it becomes and the worse <Col N="1226" /> the character of general health provision becomes, and the more hidden privileges, the hidden transfers from general taxation to private non-accountable health care which is usually not researched is encouraged.  It is a massive shift to inequality.</P>
    <P>The true test of this and every other measure should be the putting of one question which I hope all Deputies will ask themselves: are the measures contributing to a more or a lesser degree of inequality in terms of income, wealth, the consumption of services or transfers in our society?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is to introduce a £10 charge for out-patient services, but the debate covered a lot of ground and I will try to deal with all the points raised.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats wanted to move an amendment.  I do not believe we should accept that amendment because it would delay the passage of this legislation which we are anxious to have as soon as possible.  We have had a very wide-ranging debate over the last three-and-a-half hours and if we were to debate the regulations again we would be taking up the time of the House covering the same ground.  I do not believe it is necessary at this stage to discuss the amendment further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 (5) of the 1947 Health Act provides for the laying of regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas and within 24 sitting days they may be annulled if this House so decides.  Deputy Allen said the legislation providing for charges for in-patients would hit the more vulnerable families and went on to defend the prescription charges.  I fail to understand how he could do that because the most vulnerable people in the State are those on very low incomes who are eligible for medical cards.  They are the people we had to defend by removing the imposition placed by the Fine Gael <Col N="1227" /> budget when they tried to raise £13 million from that section of the community.</P>
    <P>Hospital care costs approximately £100 a day, although it varies in different hospitals from £500 to £1,300 a day.  We are asking in-patients to pay £10 a day up to a maximum of £100 in any one year. I do not think that is unreasonable.  A number of Deputies felt the Exchequer should pay the total cost but people realise the Exchequer cannot afford to pay more to the health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made a long contribution and said he was opposed to the charges, but he and other Deputies have to face the reality that the national debt now stands at £24 billion, £12 billion of which was accumulated during the term of the Coalition Government.  We have to deal with that.  If we continue to provide an unlimited amount of money out of the Exchequer for services, we will not be able to deal with this.  Deputy Taylor went on to say that our priority should be to ensure that the health of our citizens, particularly those who cannot afford to pay, should be protected.  They are the group we wish to help but there are only two choices open to us.  The first is to increase taxation, and before we started this debate the Labour Party voted against an increase in taxation which would cost a person with a salary of £10,000 an extra £25 a year.  Now they say we should not introduce these charges. The other option, which to me is unthinkable, is to reduce the level of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission I should like to conclude the Second Stage by replying to the points raised by Deputies.</P>
      <P>The second choice is that we reduce services to an unacceptable level and I do not think anybody here would want us to do that.  We are proposing a charge of £10 for out-patients to be paid on the initial visit only for any specific illness. For example, if a person were to break his leg, and if he were eligible, he would pay on the first visit, but he would continue to attend the hospital until treatment was completed with further charge.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that there is a hardship clause.  A number of Deputies mentioned genuine cases who would not be able to pay this charge.  We accept that, but the chief executive officers of the health boards will implement that hardship clause.  There is a tradition in Irish health care that nobody has ever been refused medical treatment at any level, hospital, doctor or anywhere else, because of inability to pay and I have no doubt that will not cause a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI will implement a scheme which will be very modestly priced and I have no doubt it will not cause hardship. This scheme will give full cover to both <Col N="1229" /> the out-patient and in-patient charges and, hopefully, it will be in operation in six weeks time.  As I mentioned earlier, people with medical cards are totally exempt from the charges, as are women who are receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks, children suffering from diseases or disabilities prescribed under section 52 of the Health Act, children in respect of defects noticed at a health examination held pursuant to the service provided under section 66 of the Health Act, and persons receiving services for the diagnosis or treatment of infectious diseases. I want to add to that the hardship clause. <Col N="1230" /> Persons who are unable to pay the £10 charge out of their means will not be obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the question of designating all of Counties Cavan and Monaghan a severely disadvantaged area for headage grant purposes. As the time is limited I suggest that Deputy Fitzpartick be allocated nine minutes and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise the question of the inclusion of all Cavan and Monaghan in the severely handicapped areas scheme and I should like to thank the Minister for coming to the House to listen to me.  I hope he will be able to give the undertakings I will be seeking.  Cavan and Monaghan were classified as disadvantaged areas in 1973 and a number of revisions of the classification occurred between 1973 and 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpartick Mr. T. Fitzpartick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpartick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few additions were made to the severely handicapped areas in those counties beyond those designated in 1973.  Further additions were made between 1985 and 1986.  Following the dreadful summer of 1986, the previous Government decided to go to Brussels with a package.  In August of that year the EC were requested to double the headage payment for 1986 and to reclassify 2.7 million acres which had been classified as disadvantaged as severely handicapped.  The previous Government requested the EC to accept responsibility for a recoupment of up to 75 per cent of the cost instead of 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between August and Christmas of 1986 weekly meetings were held between the civil servants of the Department of Agriculture and EC officials in Brussels in an effort to work out a formal application and agree on the terms.  In mid-January the matter was brought before the Council of Ministers by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, and the Commissioner for Agriculture, Commissioner Andriessan undertook to expedite the Irish application.  There seems to be some difference as to whether it was lodged on 16 January or 4 February, but it does not matter very much because it was brought up at the <Col N="1233" /> Council of Ministers in mid-January and may not have been lodged formally for a few days after that.  It had been before the Commission in Brussels informally since August 1986.</P>
    <P>I intervened in this matter today because I was unhappy at the statements or noises which have been coming from the Minister for Agriculture and Food since he assumed office.  He complained that it had not been included in the Book of Estimates and I got the impression that the new Minister was finding an excuse not to pay the headage payments this year, which payments had been publicly guaranteed by the Minister for Agriculture. I do not think I am being unfair to my Fianna Fáil colleagues in Cavan-Monaghan when I say that during the election campaign they undertook to stand over the assurances given by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now there is the question of funding and the people who have charge of the purse are the Government.  The budget was introduced yesterday and until then no provision had been made for funding any scheme for 1987.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food complained it was not included in the Book of Estimates. That may be so but it is not usual to include additions to existing schemes affecting old age pensions or matters of that kind in the Book of Estimates.  If it was thought it should be included in the Book of Estimates, a paragraph could have been put in the budget speech yesterday saying that the additional classification was on its way and that it would be covered by a Supplementary Estimate. There is no problem about a Supplementary Estimate.  Last year the Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture amounted to £37 million.  The entire amount involved here is only £4 million for the two counties I am speaking about and £15 million for the entire country.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to go into this matter in as much detail as I should like or to spell out the case as clearly as I would wish.  I am speaking on behalf of the people of Cavan-Monaghan and it is too bad that my colleague, Deputy Andrew Boylan, who also represents <Col N="1234" /> Fine Gael in Cavan-Monaghan, will not have an opportunity of speaking.  Neither will Deputy Farrelly who represents Meath.  I am telling the Minister for Agriculture and Food that there is nothing to prevent him paying these headage payments this year.  They are not normally paid until the November to February period and there is nothing to prevent him paying them then.  Nor is there anything to prevent him from introducing a Supplementary Estimate to cover the amount.  If he does so, he will have the support of this side of the House.  He can find adjustments in his Department, as is often done.  He will have savings here and over-expenditure there and he can find the money to make these necessary payments.</P>

      <P>I will confine myself to the facts in replying to the statement from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The facts are as follows. Irrespective of what conversation may have taken place at a Council of Ministers meeting or any informal contact with any Commissioner, no application was submitted to the Commission of the European Communities until the Dáil was already dissolved.  The application was submitted on 4 February.  In respect of conversations that might have taken place in corridors or at Council meetings, the Deputy may not be aware that nothing of this nature arises in the context of price negotiations or Council considerations.  Unless and until an application is submitted to the Commission the matter is not even before the Commission, much less before the Council, and therefore casual comments that may have been made at a Council meeting are of no relevance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain fact is that despite the congratulations lavished on the former Minister for Agriculture by both the Cavan and Monaghan County Councils during the course of the election campaign, no application was submitted <Col N="1235" /> by the administration to Brussels in this respect before the Dáil was dissolved on 4 February.  In case Deputies and the people they represent may feel a special case was being made for Cavan-Monaghan even on 4 February, I have to tell them that was not the case.  The case submitted on 4 February affected 22 of the 26 counties.  The only four counties not included were already severely handicapped areas, namely Donegal, Mayo, Sligo and Letirim.  Let it be stated that no special case was ever made for Cavan-Monaghan by the outgoing administration in respect of reclassification. The inference all the time is that there was.</P>

      <P>In relation to the present proposal to reclassify all of the existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas, the cost in the first two years of operation would be of the order of £30 million, of which only £7.5 million would be recouped from the Community in those years.  This would mean that in the first two years the figure of £23 million for headage payments would have to be provided by the national Exchequer.  Clearly Deputies opposite did not make provision for one red halfpenny and there could not be anything which would involve a payment in two years of £7.5 million from the Commission.</P>
      <P>I am still going to do all possible to make up for all the failures of the previous Government and the next time a Minister for Agriculture is congratulated in Cavan-Monaghan people will know a little more about the facts.  Nothing had been done.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret that there are no pigmeat plants here at present which meets the licensing standards of the United States Department of Agriculture.  However, on the basis of several investment proposals now in the course of implementation, I am confident that a number of plants will reach the required standard during 1987.</P>
      <P>Generous investment grants and other incentives are available to pigmeat plants to enable them to achieve the highest hygiene standards.  Deputies will be aware that FEOGA grants of up to 50 per cent are now available for approved pigmeat projects on top of IDA grants of up to 25 per cent of approved cost.  I was pleased to be able to announce recently that an extra £15 million in grants will be available from FEOGA for pigmeat projects over the next three years.</P>

      <P>The recent discovery of three Colorado beetles occurred in a small consignment of parsley imported from France.  Nearly all boxes in the consignment were traced and destroyed and the remaining few boxes were used at consumer level.  Importers have been instructed to present consignments for inspection before distribution and Department inspectors have intensified checking and inspection procedures.  The French authorities agreed to bring forward the special pre-export inspection and certification procedures prescribed under EC legislation which operate from 1 April to 15 October each year, and <Col N="1049" /> apply to imports from all continental member states.</P>
      <P>The colorado beetle occurs freely in continental Europe and as a consequence some risk of infestation in this country will exist.  My Department will ensure that the phytosanitary regulations are fully enforced but in addition there is need for continued vigilance by importers and the public.  The production of out-of-season parsley and similar vegetables would, by cutting down imports, help to reduce the risk from Colorado beetle infestation.</P>

      <P>Ireland is afforded special EC trade derogations under which we prohibit imports of live pigs and fresh, chilled or frozen pigmeat from member states which are either affected by or vaccinating against classical swine fever. Imports of certain uncooked lightly curred pigmeat products are permitted but are subject to stringent conditions. Such imports are only allowed under specific authorisations and each consignment is rigorously checked on its arrival into this country.  These measures minimise the risk of importing disease thus safeguarding our continued access to export markets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>As was provided for in the EC legislation, release of food to the charitable organisations terminated yesterday. Accordingly the question of making alterations to the scheme does not arise. However, my Department will bring the experience gained in implementing the scheme to bear on any schemes of a similar nature which may arise in the future.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the distribution of free food to persons in need are subject to the relevant EC regulations.  These regulations stipulated that the free food must be distributed through charitable organisations.  My Department's role was to make the various food products available to such organisations where the latter were able and willing to distribute in accordance with EC requirements.</P>
      <P>With regard to eligibility for the scheme, my Department's instructions to the charitable organisations were that they should apply their normal criteria for determining eligibility of individuals or families for the free food.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the excellent work carried out by the charitable organisations who participated in the scheme. Altogether, there were about 160 charitable organisations involved and this helped to ensure that the free food was made available in most parts of the country.</P>

    <P>1.  <i>Legislation.</i></P>
    <P>Irish Life, and all other authorised life assurance companies, are supervised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1985, The European Communities (Life Assurance) Regulations, 1984 (SI No. 57 of 1984) and the European Communities (Life Assurance) (Accounts, Statements and Valuations) Regulations, 1986 (SI No. 437 of 1986).</P>

    <P>Trustee Savings Banks Acts, 1863 to 1979.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Ratios.</i></P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks must hold 80 per cent approximately of their resources in the form of deposits with the Minister for Finance and in addition are required to maintain a prudent level of primary liquidity.  Their deposit rates are determined by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Concessionary taxation arrangements.</i></P>
    <P>The Trustee Savings Banks are liable for corporation tax on their profits under the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, subject to the provisions of section 337 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and section 41 (8) of the Finance Act, 1968, under which these banks are exempt from tax in respect of interest and dividends arising on deposits with the Minister for Finance. This arrangement helps minimise the management expenses payable by the Minister to these banks.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Reporting, auditing and inspection</i></P>
    <P>These banks employ private-sector auditors to audit their annual accounts which are published.  In addition section 31 of the Finance Act, 1940, provides for the inspection of the Trustee Savings Banks by persons nominated by the Minister for Finance.  Inspections take place <Col N="1056" /> on an ongoing basis and the banks also make weekly reports on their operations.</P>

    <P>The profits of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund are available to the Minister for Finance under section 19 (i) of the Finance Act, 1930, and there is no taxation requirement on these profits.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Reporting, auditing and inspection.</i></P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Post Office Savings Bank Act, 1861, requires that the annual accounts of the Post Office Savings Bank be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition An Post reports monthly on the operations of the Post Office Savings Bank to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(vii)  CENTRAL BANK OF IRELAND.</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Legislation.</i></P>
    <P>Currency and Central Bank Acts, 1927 to 1971.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Ratios.</i></P>
    <P>The Central Bank must maintain the Legal Tender Note Fund, and a Currency Reserve in the General Fund.  The first two of these are maintained for purposes of the currency while the General Fund is the bank's operating fund.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Concessionary taxation arrangements.</i></P>
    <P>The Central Bank is exempt from direct taxation and certain stamp duties. However, under the Central Bank (Surplus Income) Regulations, 1943, the surplus income of the bank, after allowance <Col N="1057" /> is made for depreciation and appropriations (of not more than 20 per cent) to a general reserve and 15 per cent of wages and salaries to the superannuation reserve, is transferred to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Reporting, auditing and inspection</i></P>
    <P>Under section 35 (2) of the Currency Act, 1927 (as adapted), the Central Bank is required to transmit a statement of its accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is, in turn, required to furnish the audited accounts and his report thereon to the Minister for Finance for presentation to the Dáil.  Section 36 of the Currency Act, 1927, requires the Central Bank to prepare and send to the Minister for Finance a report of its proceedings every year within six months of the end of the year and requires the Minister to present the report to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I have a supervisory responsibility for authorised insurers operating in the State under the provisions of the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1985, and the Insurance Regulations, 1976 to 1986, made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who is an independent statutory officer who reports annually to me, <Col N="1074" /> has supervisory responsibilities in relation to credit unions and friendly societies.  Credit unions are governed by the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893, to 1978, the Credit Union Act, 1966, and Regulations made under those Acts.  Friendly societies are governed by the Friendly Societies Acts, 1896 to 1977, and by Regulations made under the Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Insurance</i>
    </P>
    <P>The paid up share capital requirement for insurance companies depends on the nature and scale of the business proposed. In practice a non-statutory minimum requirement of £0.5 million is imposed.  Insurance reserves are required to give 100 per cent cover of all liabilities. Additionally, in the case of Irish head office companies and branch offices whose head office is outside the EEC, additional free reserves are required calculated by reference to relevant European Communities Regulations.  The approximate ratios are: Non-life, 16-18 per cent of premium income; Life: 4 per cent of mathematical reserves plus 0.3 per cent of capital sum at risk.</P>
    <P>No particular liquidity ratio is stipulated in law but rules and regulations are applied to ensure a prudent spread of assets in terms of liquidity and security.</P>
    <P>Insurers are required to submit audited accounts and returns within six months of the end of each financial year.  More frequent returns are required of newly authorised insurers.  Deadlines for submission of accounts and returns may be brought forward where this is considered desirable from a supervisory points of view.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Credit Unions and Friendly Societies</i>
    </P>
    <P>No specific ratios for capital, reserves or liquidity are set down in the legislation governing credit unions or friendly societies. However, section 23 (1) of the Credit Union Act, 1966, requires each credit union to allocate not less than 10 per cent of its surplus funds in each financial year to its reserves.</P>
    <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies in his supervision of credit unions seeks to <Col N="1075" /> ensure that their business is carried on in a proper and prudent manner.  Credit unions are required to make an audited return annually to the registrar.  There is no set frequency of inspections of credit unions but the registrar does undertake a number of such inspections each year to the extent that the resources available to him allow.</P>
    <P>In general, friendly societies may be classified as associations which provide for the mutual benefit of members rather than as financial institutions.  There are a small number of societies which have a long-standing authorisation to accept subscriptions or deposits and make loans to members.  Each friendly society is required under legislation to submit to the registrar an audited annual return of receipts and expenditure, funds and effects of the society.  I intened in the near future to submit for the approval of both Houses draft regulations to extend and strengthen the supervisory arrangements in relation to such societies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation Arrangements</i>

      <P>The only financial institution in relation to which I have direct responsibility is the Housing Finance Agency plc. which is a State-sponsored body operating under the aegis of my Department. In addition, I am responsible for policy and legislation in relation to building societies but not for their supervision which is a matter for the Registrar of Building Societies.  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the Agency and building societies is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Housing Finance Agency</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  The Housing Finance Agency Acts, 1981 to 1985.</P>
      <P>2.  No such ratios or requirements apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> 3.  Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1985, provides that income arising to the agency, since incorporation, from the business of making loans and advances under section 5 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, is exempt from corportation tax.</P>
    <P>4.  The annual report and accounts, of the agency are submitted to the Minister and laid by him before the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis.  In addition there is ongoing liaison between my Department and the agency in relation to its operations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building Societies</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  The Building Societies Acts, 1976 to 1986.</P>
    <P>2. (i)  The Registrar of Building Societies has recommended to societies with a reserve ratio of less than 4 per cent that their financial policies should be such as to ensure that a reserve ratio of at least this level is reached as soon as possible;</P>
    <P>(ii)  The Building Societies Regulations, 1987, require a society wishing to engage in the forms of unsecured lending permitted by the Building Societies (Amendment) Act, 1986, to satisfy the registrar that, in the last financial year in respect of which its annual accounts have been laid before an annual general meeting of the society, the ratio of its reserves to its assets was not less than 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The Building Societies (Prescribed Investments) Regulations, 1984, (S.I. No. 186 of 1984) prescribes the investments in which a building society may invest its surplus funds.</P>
    <P>3.  There are no concessionary taxation arrangements in force in relation to building societies <i>per se</i>.  However, in common with other institutions which do not distribute their surpluses, building societies are subject to corporation tax at a rate of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>4.  The prudential supervision of building societies is the responsibility of the registrar of building societies who has extensive powers under the Acts.  Section <Col N="1079" /> 70 of the 1976 Act requires every society to submit an annual return to the registrar within a specified period.  An auditor's report must be attached to each annual return.</P>

      <P>At present, the licensing of public hire vehicles (taxis) in the Dublin taximeter area and the enforcement of regulations under the Road Traffic Acts governing their operation is a matter for the Garda Commissioner subject to a determination being made by Dublin Corportation from time to time as to the number of new public hire licences which may be granted in that area by the Commissioner in any year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> As regards (a) to (c) of the Deputy's question, I understand from the Garda authorities that the maximum number of licences which may be granted in the Dublin taximetre area is 1,835 and that the actual number in use on 30 March 1987 was 1,824.  The Garda Authorities are satisfied that the latter licences are being operated by bona fide taxi licence holders.  The Garda Commissioner may revoke a licence if, for example, the holder is not a fit and proper person to hold a licence.</P>
    <P>(d) is primarily a matter for the Garda Commission.  Regarding (e), I have no proposals to make public hire licences non-transferable.  Under section 31 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, the Authority may, with my consent, make by-laws in relation to the regulation, control and operation of public service vehicles within the Authority's functional area and may in particular by such by-laws provide for the licensing by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or by the Authority of such vehicles and their drivers and conductors.  The section has not yet been brought into operation.</P>
