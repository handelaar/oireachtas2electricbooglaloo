      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to inform the House that I have received from Deputy Emmet Stagg, who was suspended from the service of An Dáil on Thursday, 18 June for disregarding the authority of the Chair, a written and approved expression of regret in the following terms:</P>
      <P Just="Right">23 June 1987.</P>
      <P>Dear Ceann Comhairle,</P>
      <P>In accordance with requirements of Standing Order 55, I wish to convey to you my sincere regret over my conduct in the House last Thursday.  I regret my refusal to obey your ruling calling on me to resume my seat and the disruption which led to my suspension.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P Just="Right">(Signed) Emmet Stagg.</P>
      <P>A motion may now be moved providing that the Order of the Dáil of 18 June suspending Deputy Emmet Stagg from the service of the Dáil be discharged.  I would remind the House however that Standing Order 55 provides that the Ceann Comhairle shall, on motion made without notice, amendment, adjournment or debate, forthwith put the question for the discharge of the order of suspension.</P>

      <P>I wish at this stage to make it clear that if such a motion is moved it is the intention of the Government to oppose it.  I believe that in this regard Deputy Stagg is treating the procedures of this House and the office of Ceann Comhairle with disrespect.  I am quite satisfied from reports of the interview he gave on the radio this morning that this is not a genuine or sincere apology to the Chair.  Rather is it an artificial technical device to enable him to vote in a crucial division this evening.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Order of the Dáil of June 18 suspending Deputy Emmet Stagg from the service of the Dáil be discharged&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I had intended moving this motion without discussion, as is the Order of the House, but I must respond to the Taoiseach's remarks.  The attitude being taken by the Taoiseach I find hard to comprehend because on 28 November 1967 the then Deputy Coughlan's apology was accepted by the Chair and in 1951, the late Deputy Patrick Smith's apology was accepted by the Chair.  Who is Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, to question the sincerity or the bona fides of the apology being offered by Deputy Stagg?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this very short Bill is to extend the operation of the special ground rents purchase scheme that is administered by the Land Registry under <Col N="3260" /> Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I had the pleasure of initiating the Act of 1978 which provided a new method for the purchase of ground rents on dwellinghouses.  It had become apparent that the main reason people did not avail themselves to a greater extent of their right to purchase the fee simple under the Ground Rents Act of 1967 was the legal cost of doing so.  Under the scheme provided by that Act the purchase is a matter for the parties themselves to arrange, although any dispute or difficulty may be referred to arbitration by the county registrar whose award may be appealed to the Circuit Court.  The purchaser is liable for the ground landlord's costs of the transaction and that liability is limited to such costs as are necessary and reasonable.  The approach adopted in the 1978 Act is that for a fixed fee the Land Registry undertake the legal work involved in the acquisition of the fee simple.  That procedure provides a ready means by which ground rent tenants of dwellinghouses can free themselves of ground rent and I am glad to say that a considerable number of people have availed themselves of that opportunity.  The total number of applications received between 1 August, 1978 and 31 May this year is 52,742.</P>
    <P>The special purchase scheme originally had a life of five years to 31 July, 1983 and was extended by legislation in 1983 for another year and again in 1984 for a further three years to 31 July, 1987.  On both occasions the extension was subject to an increase in the fees and the increases were calculated to cover the cost of administering the scheme.</P>
    <P>Following the 1984 legislation all fees may be revised by ministerial order.  The scheme is self-financing on the basis of current fees and, accordingly, no increase in fees is called for at present.  The vast majority of applications received into the Land Registry are made by persons in occupation of their dwelling house, who have the consent of the ground landlord to the purchase of the fee simple.  The current fee in these &ldquo;consent&rdquo; cases is £26.</P>
    <P>I am proposing in the Bill to extend the <Col N="3261" /> life of the scheme indefinitely &mdash; a course which I think will be welcomed by Deputies and by those ground rent tenants who will continue to have an optional purchase procedure that is as simple and as inexpensive as possible.</P>
    <P>It may be that some aspects of the operation of the special purchase scheme under the existing legislation are capable of being improved.  What I have in mind is that since the Land Registry scheme would, by virtue of this legislation, be placed on a permanent footing the scheme should, perhaps, be assimilated more to the ordinary registration functions of the Land Registry.  I propose to have this matter examined further.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to mention ground rents payable by local authority tenants. The No. 2 Ground Rents Act of 1978 extended the right to purchase the fee simple to those tenants for the first time. It may be that public sector landlords, such as local authorities, can and should be better enabled to make special arrangements to bring an end to ground rents payable to them, many of which are for nominal amounts payable if demanded, which are not and were never intended to be collected.  I am having this question examined to see what can be done and any proposals I may develop to deal with the matter will be announced in the ordinary way in due course.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is, as it must be &mdash; if we are to get the legislation through before the present scheme expires on 31 July next &mdash; confined to repealing the provision of the No. 2 Act of 1978 which limits the period within which applications may be made under Part III of that Act.  The Bill therefore is, essentially, a one section Bill.  Section 1 proposes the repeal of section 18 (as amended by an Act of 1984) of the No. 2 Act of 1978 and its effect will be to ensure that the Land Registry scheme of ground rents purchase will extend without limitation beyond the date I have mentioned.  Section 2 is a standard provision in relation to short title, construction and collective citation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="3262" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the repeal of section 18 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 which has the effect of extending indefinitely the special ground rents purchase scheme introduced in 1978.  Clearly there are still a large number of ground rent tenants who are anxious to avail themselves of this scheme and who see it as a relatively simple and inexpensive way of buying out the fee simple of their properties.  The Minister, when replying might tell the House the numbers who have availed of the scheme to date and give an estimate of the number of residential ground rents in the country.  Repeated requests have been made for the complete abolition of ground rents.  One can well understand the resentment of the ordinary house-holder at having to pay ground rent, particularly when he or she may be struggling to pay a large mortgage out of a heavily taxed income.</P>
      <P>I recognise of course that we are talking about houses built prior to 1978 because one cannot impose a ground rent on houses since the passing of the 1978 Act.  We have been told repeatedly it is not possible on constitutional grounds to abolish existing ground rents without payment of compensation.  People have a right to private property under the Constitution. The right to an annuity under ground rent legislation is a form of private property.  We have the conflicting interests of two people with a right to private property &mdash; the landlord as a result of the original contract and the person who owns the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that the level of compensation that would have to be paid if legislation is introduced to abolish existing ground rents would amount to between £40 million and £70 million.  This leads one to ask the question, where would the money come from.  From the taxpayer.  Who is the taxpayer?  He is the person paying PAYE, the person whom we are trying to relieve of paying ground rent.  That would mean another of the transfer payments which have bedevilled the country in recent years.  A person would be paying extra tax in order to get an extra benefit from the State.  It would <Col N="3263" /> have the effect also that the compensation would be up to the full multiple of 7.2 or 7.3, whereas individual residents associations can at present negotiate with the landlord for a much lower rate.  The alternative course is to introduce a Constitutional amendment but from past experience I have serious reservations as to whether appropriate wording could be found which would be acceptable to the majority of the Irish people and which would not have a broader effect on the overall rights to private property.</P>
    <P>Despite all of this, we have the continuing spectacle at election time of some political parties represented in this House giving commitments they know they cannot stand over with regard to the abolition of ground rents.  At the last election a member of the Minister's party who is now a Minister of State in the Government sent a letter to ACRA indicating quite clearly that Fianna Fáil were committed to introduce a scheme to abolish ground rents and that the finishing touches were being put to a 37 page draft document.  He stated that the proposal would bring in termination dates for ground rents on local authority and private houses.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when he is replying to tell us if it is the Government's intention to live up to the commitment given by that Deputy and, if so, will he please explain will this be by way of legislation resulting in compensation being paid or is there a proposal to introduce a constitutional amendment?  I do not want to see a situation continue whereby the public are misled into thinking that by holding out and not paying their ground rents it would be possible to force legislation to be introduced which would wipe the slate clean.  These unfortunate people are finding themselves ending up in court and facing the consequences of the court's decision.  I am proud that my own party, despite the possible loss of votes at election time, have behaved responsibly on this issue and have told the truth each time we were asked our views on the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    <P>The last time this issue was debated in <Col N="3264" /> the House was when the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill, 1984, was introduced.  It had the effect of extending the special ground rents purchase scheme for a further period of three years and there was a provision to allow for an increase in the level of fees charged.  It also gave the Minister power in the future to alter fees by way of order.  There was tremendous opposition from the Fianna Fáil Party at that time to the proposed increases.  It was stated they would result in a slowing down in the number of applications which would be received in the future under the scheme.  I would like to ask the Minister if that was the case and, if so, does he propose to use his powers under the Act to reduce the fees in order to increase the flow of applications once again.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the 1984 Bill the Fianna Fáil Party, through its spokesman, Deputy Michael Woods, introduced an amendment to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order fix the termination for ground rents on dwelling houses, where these come under his control or under the control of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods argued that in cases where ground rents were under Government control through the local authorities, the Minister should provide a scheme for the termination of these ground rents to demonstrate the State's commitment to the abolition of ground rents.  Perhaps the Minister when he is replying will tell us why this Bill does not do as his party requested in 1984 or have they had a change of heart since then?</P>
    <P>It is a pity that State bodies like the Land Registry do not resort to a little publicity at times when they are trying to promote particular schemes such as the scheme operating under this legislation. The existence of the scheme should be publicised and the Minister should take steps to see to it that the Land Registry have adequate resources to eliminate <Col N="3265" /> delays in dealing with applications under this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to indicate on behalf of the Progressive Democrats that we accept and welcome the Minister's initiative in making the Landlord and Tenant Ground Rents Purchase Scheme open-ended rather than limping from extension to extension.  It is a worthwhile change in the law and one which will be of benefit to the community generally and not merely the people who avail of the scheme.  There are a number of deficiencies in this Bill and I want to point them out, not on the basis that we intend to oppose the Bill, but in order to encourage the Minister perhaps at an early future date to bring forward another Bill, if we are all still in the same positions at that stage, to improve the law and make it more certain and more amenable to more people.</P>
      <P>The question of ground rents is surrounded by a good deal of mystification and a considerable amount of misunderstanding. Ground rents as a phenomenon are complicating the law relating to real property.  They make it inaccessible and unworkable for the average person.  They make it more and more unlikely, for instance, that the work of conveyancing can be taken away from solicitors as a monopoly and given to licensed conveyancers as might be thought reasonable in the context of the examination of restrictive practices which is now in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish real property law is immensely complicated and very little has been done to address many of the issues which complicate it so much.  Since 1881 and 1882 there has been no major statutory reform of the law of conveyancing and that not-withstanding the fact that in 1925 Lord Birkenhead's law of real property in England hugely changed the law there, rationalised it and brought many practices into conformity with commercial reality.  That is more than 50 years ago and many of the principles then enshrined in English law of real property, which has many similarities to ours and a common source in many respects, still <Col N="3266" /> stand unenacted in this country.  As a Parliament we have a bit of explaining to do to ourselves and to the electorate at large to excuse the fact that Irish conveyancing law is in such a shambles to excuse the fact that Irish conveyancing costs are so high and that because of all these complicated features Irish conveyancing law remains a jungle so far as the layman is concerned and one which cannot be simplified or made more competitive as a consequence.</P>
    <P>In many respects ground rents were introduced in order to permit the developers of large-scale developments to impose restrictive covenants and orderly development in areas the subject matter of ground rents.  Long leases of 800,900 or 1,500 years and fee farm grants were introduced for the general purpose of orderly control and retention of rights such as easements and covenants affecting the control of development of real property.  We could have the same protections for the community at large, for the developer and for people who have an interest in property without the necessity of ground rents and long leases of that kind.  The law could be developed to make restrictive covenants enforceable even entirely divorced from leases.  The restrictive covenants could be made to have force apart from leases and thereby uncomplicate title, something that is most desirable.</P>
    <P>At present the recovery of ground rents has been changed so that no right of re-entry on the part of a ground landlord is now enforcable to recover his rent. In many cases where nominal amounts of £5, £10 or £20 per annum are paid the ground landlord has found himself in the position that he cannot recover outstanding arrears of rent from tenants or lessees under a ground rent lease on the basis that it costs more to write one letter than is involved in the amount of the rent.  In a sense sums of money, by a process of inflation and by depriving people of any adequate remedy, have been effectively eroded out of commercial reality.  The property right which goes with them has in fact disintegrated. If somebody owes another person £5 per <Col N="3267" /> annum ground rent and refuses to pay it, there is literally nothing that can be done to recover that money.  The property right associated with the long lease has effectively terminated because there has been no right of re-entry since 1978. There is no real right to recover the moneys in question.  Since the 1967 Act the restrictive covenants as to user have been watered down because where planning permission is given these covenants are in many cases unenforceable at the behest of the ground landlord.</P>
    <P>The whole property rights system connected with ground rents and long leases have been eroded to the point of non-existence in many cases.  This brings me to the question of the extent to which the Constitution forms an insuperable barrier to the progressive abolition of ground rents.  In my view the Constitution does not stand as insuperable a barrier as had been thought heretofore.  It seems to me that there are certain forms of property right which can be extinguished simply by virtue of their minor significance and the ill-effects which their maintenance have on the general good of society and on commercial and social good order and growth.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is sometimes interpreted very restrictively as effectively putting in aspic all property rights as they are now and saying that they cannot be saved.  There is a huge volume of rights which can be altered this way and that by legislation.  For example, intellectual property rights which give people rights in copyright for the lifetime of the author of a book and for 50 years afterwards. They are a form of property right under the Constitution.  I have no doubt that it would be open to the Minister for Justice to come into the House tomorrow morning and say he is changing the copyright law, to say that henceforth, it will be for the life of the author plus 25 years, or for the life of the author <i>simpliciter</i> and nothing to his relatives.</P>
    <P>Property rights do not necessarily carry with them constitutional immunity for change or abrogation or conversion to something else.  This House has been ill <Col N="3268" /> served by the advice it has received over many years on the implications of the property rights clauses in the Constitution. They are there subject to various caveats about the common good.  If it can be shown and demonstrated that the common good is served by the extinction of certain property rights in certain circumstances then that can be done.  All the case law, which anybody can see well surveyed in Deputy Kelly's book on the Constitution, could lead no one to the belief that every single copyright must be conserved no matter what the social consequences are and without regard to the ill-effects it has on society in general.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats take the view that the time has now come to look at the conveyancing law, at estates, at the complexity of estates and at the pyramid titles which obtain in this country especially in areas where land is unregistered. If we say that in relation to the residual titles of those towards the top of the pyramid who have a very exiguous and theoretical interest in land that the common good may well be served by extinguishing their rights the question arises as to whether compensation should be payable.  I do not think there is an automatic right to compensation.  The Constitution does not say that.  The Constitution &mdash; to use the analogy I used earlier in relation to copyright &mdash; does not mean that a property right cannot be extinguished or varied without compensation to any person who may be affected by it.</P>

      <P>With respect, a <Col N="3269" /> Cheann Comhairle, I am dealing with the necessity for this Bill.  This Bill is here because, as has been pointed out by Deputy Barrett and the newspapers generally, there seems to be a difficulty in abrogating ground rents completely, though this has been promised to the electorate on many occasions.  This Bill would not be necessary, and this is a Second Stage debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the time of this House is limited but equally the Chair is well aware that the circumstances in which this time came to be limited are not of my making.</P>
      <P>In my view the necessity for this legislation and the requirement for a scheme of this kind comes about from an unduly cautious view of the constitutional implications &mdash; the real property provisions of the Constitution as they affect ground rents.  I make no apology to the House for saying that or for pointing out that if a more courageous interpretation were put by this House generally and by the Government on the property provisions of the Constitution we would not have Bills such as this before us.  We would not have had a Bill such as the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Trees and Woodlands) Bill put before us.  We would have a different approach to the question of regulating property rights especially in relation to real property in the common interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe also that the object of this Bill would be better served if it contained amendments to the 1984 Act in relation to the number of years within which a person can buy out, at a reduced rate of compensation to his ground landlord.  At present ground rent can only be bought out at the reduced rate of the 7.2 multiple, to which Deputy Barrett referred. One can only buy out at that rate if one is clear of the date of ending of the tenancy in question by 15 years.  If you miss the 15 year deadline, thereafter during the 15 years immediately prior to the <Col N="3270" /> expiry of the tenancy, the situation turns into one in which the amount of compensation payable by the tenant to the ground landlord increases very dramatically towards a much more substantial capital sum.  Recently I had an example of a woman in my constituency who lives alone and who by the time she realised that the ground landlord's lease to her was coming to an end had missed the time limit by about ten years.  She will have to pay £3,000 or so to purchase her house, whereas someone who was well advised by a solicitor some ten years earlier bought out for a nominal sum of £60 to £70.  It seems to me that the 15 year limit is unfair.  I know it is there to try to give flesh to the protection of property rights in the Constitution and to prevent ground landlords who are within a short distance of recovering their property outright from feeling that they are being expropriated by their tenant.  I feel it is a very crude instrument and does not really reflect commercial or social justice.  The ground landlord who is within 15 years of the expiry of the lease in question is not somebody who is gravely disappointed, or feels expropriated, if 15 rather than ten or five years before the end of the ground lease his tenant opts to purchase out.  I do not see why he should be given a different order of magnitude by way of compensation simply by the lapse of those few years.  That seems to be fundamentally unfair.</P>
    <P>This Bill leaves aside an opportunity to amend The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, in another material respect.  That Act is directed towards the prevention of the creation of further ground rents in respect of certain classes of property.  At present it is restricted to houses principally used as a dwelling.  I think that the arguments I addressed earlier to the general question of ground rents and their control and extinction would seem to support the proposition that section 2 of that Act should be amended to extend the prohibition of the creation of ground rents to other classes of property, not simply dwellinghouses.  I see a good deal of force for such an amendment.  I can see <Col N="3271" /> that there would be some commercial objections &mdash; some people involved in building blocks of flats or shopping centres might feel that a ground rent system in that context is the only way to ensure the adequate enforcement of covenants and the orderly regulation of the development in question.  That brings us back to the point that begs the question: is there not a better way of ensuring orderly control and restrictive covenants and the like separate from ground rents and long leases?</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill because it extends the right to purchase out ground rents, but we raise several question marks.  First, have we done sufficient fundamental thinking in this House as to how we can really tackle the problem that this Bill is only partly designed to confront.  Second, have we done all we could to achieve justice as between varying classes of ground rent purchasers? Third, is it the case that the Constitution requires a scheme of the kind that this Bill is designed to extend, or could we not have a much more far-reaching reform of the law of real property?  Fourth, should we not, as a Parliament, address ourselves to the general issues of conveyancing law and not merely to the small issue which is at stake here today?  The introduction of this Bill represents a lost opportunity to do certain things which, as I pointed out, could have been done in relation to the 1978 and 1984 legislation and which would have resulted in a greater degree of social justice.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I have taken a reasonable amount of time on this matter.  I would prefer to put down more amendments. I would have preferred to call for votes on the amendment but I might be accused by some people of filibustering had I done so.  I wish to establish a marker that this legislation is not considered to be adequate.  It is considered to be necessary and desirable but inadequate.  We will let it through on the basis that it is necessary but we will not accept that it is an adequate response to the commitment given by the Minister's party to the public on the reform of the ground rents law.</P>

I think that most people who intended to redeem their ground rents under the existing legislation in all probability have done so by now.  I know that in my constitutency, which consists largely of housing estates built over the past 15 years, an appreciable number have availed of this legislation to buy out their ground rents.  However by no means have they all done so and it is appropriate to retain this legislation in force until more extensive legislation is introduced to extend the redemption or the possibility for redemption and termination of ground rents on a broader basis.  I believe that even without amending the Constitution it should be possible to devise a termination arrangement over a period of years.  I agree with the comments made by the previous speaker, Deputy McDowell and I believe much could be done to resolve this issue once and for all without the necessity of a referendum on a constitutional amendment.  Many members of the Government led ACRA and many residents' associations to believe before the election that such a scheme was possible.  I believe that such a scheme is possible and the Government should apply their minds to preparing legislation to that end and bringing it forward to the House for discussion.  The present situation is unsatisfactory in a number of respects.  Reference has been made to the question of the use of the creation of ground rents to enforce covenants to secure orderly development of estates and areas.  I believe that was always entirely inappropriate.  There should never have been a role for ground landlords to be involved in orderly development; that is a matter for the local authorities.  In my view the planning departments of local authorities are the appropriate agencies to undertake the responsibility to secure the development and maintenance of areas in a proper manner in accordance with the planning laws.  Private individuals, or companies, <Col N="3273" /> be they resident or foreign, ought to have no role in this.</P>
      <P>It is strange that in the State we had a very marked degree of neglect of urban land, particularly when one contrasts it with what applied to rural and agricultural land.  Perhaps the reason is that the entire energy of the State going back to the twenties and thirties was devoted to rectifying the situation of rural land. After the State was formed much attention was given to the vesting and breaking up of the large farm estates.  The system of land purchase annuities and so on was devised and worked very well.  A great deal of energy was put into that scheme. That contrasts very markedly with the attention given to urban land, so much so that the landlord and tenant situation both as regards ground rents and ordinary business and residential rents was pretty much neglected in comparison.  Indeed the whole area was virtually untouched between the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and the amending legislation of 1958.  Since then the progress has been at best sporadic and limited.  The failure to tackle the issue over the years has left a ludicrous situation of these nominal rents referred to by the Minister which are as low as 3p or 5p per year, or perhaps £5 per year or of that ilk and many of these are vested in local authorities.  The local authorities in some type of halfhearted manner purport to apply the covenants retained under those leases reserving 5p a year in connection with covenants. There is no need for that.  The way to deal with the covenant position is through the planning laws and by-laws, not under leases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the local authority as ground landlord, a much simpler situation applies.  There is no reason why the Government, through the Minister for Justice or the Minister for the Environment, should not issue a directive to arrange a simple efficient termination scheme for local authority rents.  There is no earthly reason local authorities should waste their time and energies collecting or trying to collect in many cases, these trifling amounts to the nuisance and annoyance of house occupants who feel <Col N="3274" /> they own their houses.  The time, trouble and expense expended by employees of many of those local authorities cost far more than the amounts recovered under these old ground rents, most of which are either nominal sums or trifling sums.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that in the private sector many of these rents owned by private ground landlords are not recovered. The are abandoned because of the expense that would be involved in seeking to recover them.  That is true and it gives rise to great complications on conveyancing.  In many cases when one goes to sell a house one finds that the ground rent has been either abandoned or has not been paid for very many years and when people try to find the ground landlord &mdash; they must do so before they can sell their house &mdash; there is great difficulty in finding out who that ground landlord is.  There is the spectacle of house owners who have a house in the course of sale running around trying to find out where the ground landlord is. Often he cannot be found and this can give rise to considerable difficulties for solicitors and house owners on the conveyancing side.</P>
    <P>It may well be inappropriate to have the necessity at all in the present state of the legislation to produce a last receipt for ground rent on a sale, but the practicality of it is that solicitors acting on behalf of mortgagees, building societies, banks and whatever are insisting on their production and this is causing a considerable degree of difficulty in many ways.  It highlights the obsolescent nature of the whole institution.  We really must apply our minds now to phasing this out completely.  Progress has been made. There is no doubt that the scheme has made progress and an appreciable number of people have availed of it, but many thousands are still left who have not availed of the scheme and probably will not do so, and that position too will have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The kind of proposal suggested by ACRA merits examination.  It involves a kind of termination procedure, a phase out procedure on a basis such as a fixed number of years, or whatever, applying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3275" /> Such a procedure would be welcomed by the residents' associations, by house owners and, I believe, by most ground landlords who, as has been indicated, find the present arrangement a nuisance and an irrelevance.  Ideally the house owner should be the freeholder and his position should be enfranchised.  There should be nobody over his head on the covenant position or otherwise.  That is the kind of scenario which was promised by the present Government and their Ministers on the run up to the election.  I believe it can be achieved without the necessity for a constitutional amendment.  I look forward to the Minister indicating when he replies that he will have this examined and that his intention is to bring before the House new, more comprehensive legislation that will lead towards what we all agree would be that desirable result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution on the Second Stage of this Bill and in opening I would like to quote from a document of 1965 in relation to the issue of ground rents:</P>
      <P>Taken in extremis, the idea of a modern community which does not entirely own the land on which it exists is faintly ridiculous.  The fact that the rental is paid into the pocket of some obscure lord whose only claim to fame was that his ancestors won the land by conquest only aggravates the situation. The sooner ground rents are completely abolished, the quicker we will have a rational land structure.  Anachronisms of this nature have no place in the Ireland of today.</P>
      <P>That very far-reaching condemnation of ground rents was carried in an editorial in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 15 October 1965.  That is a journal of, I suppose, the business community of this State.  Since that time there has been little real progress in seeking the abolition and the ending of the faintly ridiculous arrangement that they commented on then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point must be underlined that there are upwards of 400,000 people in this State who are subject to and can be <Col N="3276" /> called upon at any time to pay ground rent.  That figure has been highlighted and underlined time and time again by ACRA, the association who have spearheaded the campaign to seek the abolition entirely of ground rents.  The number the Minister has indicated of people who have taken up this scheme of purchase represents a little over 10 per cent.  Therefore, the issue of ground rents as a fundamental injustice will not go away and no scheme, however open-ended, introduced by the Minister will ever meet the widespread demands of residents throughout the country for their abolition.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party welcome the Bill here today nevertheless.  It is directly in response to the demands of ACRA and a demand that was articulated in this House as far back as 27 June 1984 when the last extension Bill was introduced. Deputy De Rossa then rose on our behalf and argued that the Minister of the day should introduce an open-ended scheme and should not limit it from time to time. However, the limiting from time to time, previously as today, affords us all the opportunity to condemn Fianna Fáil roundly and pinpoint the fact that Fianna Fáil, in or out of Government, will not go to the electorate in the future and suggest that they have in mind, in train, or whatever, at the bottom of a file, on a shelf in an office, or at the back of their head a scheme to abolish ground rents. That is the spectacle that we as an electorate have been subjected to since 1977 at each election, time in and time out. The present Minister was involved, in the famous wording of a letter, in a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents.</P>

      <P>We must acknowledge genius when we are faced with it. However, a more important letter enamated from the ranks of this Government in the run up to the last election.  It is dated 15 February 1987, written by Deputy Michael Woods, TD, the then <Col N="3277" /> spokesperson on Justice and the expected incoming Minister for Justice at the time. Consequent on a public meeting in the Donaghmede area he wrote to the secretary of the Donaghmede Community Association, and I quote in part from the letter:</P>
      <P>As I stated at your Public Meeting we are fully committed to the immediate introduction of legislation to terminate ground rents which come under the control of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke at length at the meeting about a remarkable document that he had drafted in Opposition.  It is 57 pages long, not 37 as the previous speaker said. He represented the letter at that meeting as a document which would lead to the abolition and termination of ground rents.  He went on to say that at least in the area of local authority owned or State owned ground rents the Government would take firm and definite action.  It is particularly relevant to the Donaghmede area.  There are 720 ground rents in that area which are owned by Dublin Corporation. They yield, not a paltry sum, but in excess of £12,000 per annum.  They have yielded, or should have yielded, if paid &mdash; because upwards of 600 of the residents there are not paying them and have not been doing so for some time &mdash; over £200,000 to Dublin Corporation. The Minister, Deputy Woods, indicated in his letter that legislation would be introduced immediately to terminate ground rents owned by local authorities. Subsequent to that meeting and having had the good fortune to be in a position to write as a Deputy to the Minister, I wrote to him asking what had become of that 57 page document.  I had already written to Deputy Woods and he told me he had forwarded it to the Department of Justice for the Minister's attention.  It has been represented as a scheme which will lead to the abolition of ground rents. In particular, it was to lead to the immediate introduction of legislation to terminate ground rents owned by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell us where that document is and what he has done <Col N="3278" /> with Deputy Woods' great scheme for the abolition of ground rents.  Promises were made time and again during the election that Fianna Fáil in Government would take action to terminate and abolish ground rents but they were not kept. I take the point that has been made here today that the constitutional bar that is constantly being represented to us prohibiting progress in that direction is not as forceful as it has been made out to be.</P>
    <P>This Government could and should take up the issue firmly.  They should present the Bill we are told they have in draft form, that is comprehensive and that has addressed in very serious form the whole question of the abolition of ground rents.  I challenge the Minister to tell us whether he has any intention, serious or otherwise, of bringing forward legislation at any level in regard to ground rents.  By implication, the Bill before the House indicates firmly that Fianna Fáil have no interest in bringing on the scheme further.  If they had a scheme in mind to abolish or to terminate ground rents, there would not be a need for this open-ended timetable that is built into this amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Previously in the House I raised at Question Time the whole issue of this amending legislation.  The Minister advised the House that there would be an announcement in the ordinary way in due course.  In a supplementary question on 13 May 1987 I raised two specific issues.  One has been referred to, the non-entitlement of a ground lessee to purchase on the same basis the ground lease within the last 15 years of the life of the lease.  The other issue I raised was whether the Government would consider an amendment of section 28 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, to prohibit the entitlement of a ground landlord to apply to court for the committal to prison of a defaulting ground lessee.  The Minister stated on 13 May that he would investigate both of these matters and would refer back to the House.  I am particularly disappointed that the Minister, in his speech today, did not refer to that matter.  It appears that was a response of convenience and one <Col N="3279" /> that carries as much weight and commitment as all the other representations the Minister and the Government have made on this issue in the past.</P>
    <P>If this Government have any serious interest in meeting the very widespread demands of people for the phasing out or the abolition of ground rents, and if there are the constitutional problems which the Government so often talk about, why not at least move in a direction that would render it difficult for a ground landlord to collect ground rents?  Previous Governments moved in that direction with the abolition of the right to re-enter and the abolition of the right to create new ground rents.  What would be wrong if this Government were to move a step further and abolish the right of a ground landlord to seek to commit to prison a defaulting ground lessee?  There are examples, and they occur on a daily basis throughout the country, where people are being presented with orders of court for committal to prison of two, three and four weeks.  This, in turn, never seeks to effect a payment but it costs the taxpayers approximately £500 per week to help a landlord to collect money to which we all agree he is not justly entitled, whatever the strict legal position.</P>
    <P>While none of us can stand in the way of progress whatever way it is presented to this House, nonetheless it must be underscored that we as a party are disappointed with the Minister's response on this occasion not only to demands from ACRA and other political interests in this House but also in the light of the commitments of members of his own party when in Government and in Opposition to the ground rent lobby during the years.</P>

      <P>I and my party welcome this Bill as I consider it is unsatisfactory to bring a Bill into the House every number of years to extend the period of time in regard to ground rents.  However, there are a couple of problems which I wish to put to the Minister.  The first one arises in regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3280" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I should like him and the House to be aware that I shall have to put the Question at 12 o'clock in accordance with the Order of Business of yesterday.  If Deputies want the Minister to reply they should afford him the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of problems arise in that when a person obtains a loan from a building society to purchase a house and when there is a ground rent attached, the building society's solicitors are reluctant to take the vesting certificate, especially where the ground landlord cannot be found.  They seek registration in the Land Registry and this causes long periods of delay for people who take out loans.  This is the one serious problem which I see in regard to this Bill and I ask the Minister to address himself to it and to see how it can be resolved. Perhaps the Land Registry could arrange for a specific section to deal with cases such as the one I mentioned and which would deal with the matter expeditiously. Quite a number of problems arise continually in tracing the landlord.  I understand the arbitration system is working reasonably well but the Minister should extend this legislation in order to deal with situations where the original ground landlord cannot be traced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this very short but important Bill.  As I said in my opening speech, this Bill is necessary because the special scheme of purchase of ground rents on dwelling houses operated by the Land Registry expires on 31 July and I am proposing an extension of the scheme indefinitely after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not purport to deal with substantive issues.  These include the question of assimilating the scheme more to the ordinary registration functions of the Land Registry as well as examining what further changes can and should be made in relation to ground rents paid by local authority tenants.  Any proposals I may bring forward in these matters will <Col N="3281" /> be announced in due course.  Tens of thousands of tenants have availed of the opportunity to buy out their ground rents and I am sure others would wish to avail of the scheme at some time.  The Bill, when enacted, will give that option.</P>
    <P>In regard to a query raised by Deputy Barrett, the number of ground rents bought out to date is 52,742 and a very rough estimate of ground rents remaining is 200,000 and not 400,000 as was mentioned by Deputy McCartan.  Many of the local authority ground rents are of nominal amounts and are payable only if demanded.  For that reason and because we are talking about public sector landlords, it is only right that the Government should examine the position to see if such public sector landlords can make special arrangements to bring these ground rents to an end.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned the area of conveyancing and I should like to tell him that the Law Reform Commission are at present examining the law on conveyancing with a view to seeing what changes could beneficially be made, particularly changes which might lead to reduced conveyancing costs.</P>
    <P>Up to 31 May 1987, 52,742 purchase applications were received at the Land Registry and 47,587 vesting certificates had issued.  Arrears on hand amount to about 5,155 cases.  These comprise almost 1,990 consent cases and 3,165 arbitration cases.  The Land Registry are required to deal with applications in order of receipt except where serious inconvenience or substantial loss would arise if an application were so dealt with.  In general there is a delay in issuing vesting certificates of about two months in consent cases and one year in the case of applications for arbitration.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the case of leases that have only a short period to run.  There is a possibility that a much higher purchase price will be payable if purchase is not effected more than 15 years from the date of termination of the lease.  That is why successive Governments have encouraged people to buy out their ground rents well before the lease <Col N="3282" /> has expired.  Again I should like to appeal to those who have not yet purchased their ground rents under the special scheme to seriously consider doing so now.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of termination dates, mentioned by Deputy Taylor, the position is that any scheme for the abolition of ground rents would be confiscatory if and to whatever degree it did not provide for fair compensation for ground landlords.  Various schemes for the abolition of ground rents have been suggested by ACRA and others with a termination date for payment of ground rent which seemed to avoid the difficulty but which turned out on examination to involve either confiscation or payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>The termination of the liability to pay ground rent at some future date without any obligation to compensate the landlord is, in reality, a demand in another form for confiscation.  It differs from the other forms merely in that it would operate from a future date, but despite this there are some who continue to seek a date for the termination of ground rents. The belief that ground rents can be ended in this way is misleading and misguided. It would appear that the total abolition of ground rents would raise important constitutional issues and would certainly involve some form of compensation to the ground landlord.</P>
    <P>In relation to ground rents on domestic dwellings held by local authorities and other public bodies I should like to state that the ground rents are in effect held by the State.  As I mentioned in my speech I am examining such ground rents, how they may be terminated and the detailed implications of such a move.  This Bill had to be introduced to extend the existing special ground rents purchase scheme because it was due to terminate on 31 July.  There was not sufficient time to finalise the necessary examination of the question of terminating ground rents held by local authorities.  This I intend to do in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has in mind.  There may be some confusion about the purpose of including the phrase &ldquo;and also includes all monuments in existence before 1700 A.D.&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;historic monument&rdquo;.  The intention is that all monuments which were in existence before the date will be historic monuments by reason of their age and without regard to whether or not they have any architectural or historical interest.  This does not mean that they must necessarily be preserved but it does mean that they are worthy of note and of being recorded <Col N="3285" /> and that consideration should be given to any proposal to remove or destroy them.</P>
      <P>Since the commencement of the National Archaeological Survey in the sixties it has been accepted that any monuments which were in existence before 1700 A.D. should be recorded. The Survey of Urban Archaeology which was commenced in 1982 and which is now nearing completion also takes 1700 A.D. as the cut-off point.  The selection of any date is an arbitary one but it will be seen that the year 1700 A.D. is now well rooted in archaeological practice in this country.</P>
      <P>Of course all monuments of post-1700 A.D. which are associated with the commercial, cultural, economic, industrial, military, religious or social history are also historic monuments, and can be protected under this Act where such protection is warranted. Several such monuments are already in full State care as national monuments and if 1840 or 1850 is being taken as the end of the great classical revival movement in architecture, there is nothing in this legislation to stop us from picking out the best elements of this period which survive in order to protect them.</P>
      <P>However, Deputies Kemmy's and Enright's amendments substituting 1840 and 1850 A.D. for 1700 A.D. would bring a very large section of the existing building stock of the country within the ambit of automatic protection and land the Commissioners of Public Works with an impossible task.  Post-1700 buildings, as I have said, are not excluded but our protection of these has to be selective. Any monuments erected before 1700 will be given historic monument status and it can then be decided whether a preservation order is necessary on other buildings.  The Bill gives sufficient discretion to the Commissioners to protect buildings, irrespective of age, and I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that an antique is defined as anything made or constructed before 1840 and that 1700 is a bit too early?  I believe 1840 <Col N="3286" /> might be a bit too early if it excludes a number of monuments and artefacts.  I take the point that this would involve the Office of Public Works in costly expenditure in maintaining such monuments but at the same time there is a lack of alignment between the definition of an antique and what constitutes an historic monument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In his own words, the Minister furnished the material proving our argument.  He said that protection is already there for historic monuments built prior to 1700.  He also said that many buildings built after 1700 do not come under this protection.  There are magnificent buildings built after 1700 in many towns throughout the country which add character to those towns.  I am aware that there are planning laws and that local authorities have issued statutory notices preventing people from interfering with a number of those buildings.  Take Westport, for example.  There are malls with beautiful buildings in that town which because of their historic connections come under the protection of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern and hope similar concern will be shown by all our citizens with regard to artefacts, monuments and archaeological discoveries.  The Bill defines &ldquo;historic monuments&rdquo; as &ldquo;all monuments in existence before 1700 A.D.&rdquo;.  Consequently the discretion of the commissioners is enshrined in law. They can decide whether a preservation order should be put on any monument irrespective of its age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our case is that to demand from the commissioners that everything before 1840 or 1850 would be automatically included as preserved historic monuments would be far too demanding and would place us in an impossible position because of the size of the task, deciding the necessary criteria and watching every planning application made throughout the country.  As I said, the commissioners already have this discretion.  We have agreed the definition of an historic monument and, given the flexible position and the civic responsibilities of statutory <Col N="3287" /> authorities and the public at large, these buildings are adequately protected.

Under the definition of &ldquo;archaeological area&rdquo; the commissioners will be able to decide that any area around an historic monument is an archaeological area.  I am not sure how the Minister will be able to restrict this definition but it is so loose at present that the commissioners have <i>carte blanche</i> to define any area, no matter how large, as an archaeological <Col N="3288" /> area.  That will cause problems in the years to come and it gives too much power to the commissioners.  I would like &ldquo;archaeological area&rdquo; to be more closely defined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 11, after &ldquo;person&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;shall not own or use a detection device without licence and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment touches on one of the most centrally crucial and important provisions in the Bill.  I wish to comment on the regrettable lack of time made available to discuss this &mdash; or any other &mdash; amendment in the Bill.  It became apparent yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dukes, his Chief Whip, Deputy O'Brien and the former spokesperson in this area, Deputy Doyle, believed we had almost completed Committee Stage and for that reason had agreed to an hour and a half to discuss it. It was not until the position was clarified, that it was made clear that we had not even embarked on Committee Stage, that they realised their error.  It is absolutely appalling that we have an hour and a half to discuss about 40 amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to tighten the whole area of the use of metal detection devices and to ensure that no person shall own or use such a device without a licence from the Minister.  The current law is that anyone can own, sell or use a metal detector.  Section 2 seeks to lay down regulations prohibiting their use in certain areas.  At present the law regarding treasure trove is weighted in favour of the treasure hunter and it is a licence for wholesale destruction of our archaeological sites.  Two people in the State uncovered a hoard using these devices and are now in possession of property to the value of £5.5 million.  When the case was mentioned in the Supreme Court, counsel for the Government sought an early date for hearing on the grounds that there was a serious increase in the <Col N="3290" /> invasion of archaeological sites by treasure hunters using these devices.</P>
    <P>As long as there is an incredible financial incentive to people to search for treasure, it will be impossible under section 2 to regulate the position.  Most of our archaeological sites are in remote areas and the area from which the treasure to which I referred was recovered is a raised piece of ground in the middle of a bog, far removed from the public view.  To a great extent they are not marked and the Bill is trying to confront this problem. Many of them carry plaques, warnings and signs but in the case in question although signs were displayed they were ignored.  Where there is a broad entitlement to own or use a detector, it will be very difficult for the passing observer, a concerned member of the public or a garda, to identify a licensed dig.</P>
    <P>It appears that members of the clergy have been colluding in ravaging archaeological sites for export as reported in a recent case in Sligo.  Counsel, quite rightly, emphasised this position to the Supreme Court when seeking an early hearing for determination of the issue. We can only hope that the ultimate decision will be to our benefit but if you take into account the difficulty in policing the sites and the unbelievable financial incentive to treasure hunters, it is obvious that unless there are severe restrictions and regulations on the use of detection devices, this wholesale ravaging will continue.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that legitimate pursuits are involved in the use of metal detectors.  Metal detector groups are responsible in their approach and we are not seeking to ban them.  However, until the law is resolved in our favour, the Minister should restrict the availability of detection devices.  That is why the Minister should accept this amendment so that he would have immediate control of the issue of licences to all persons, irrespective of where they will be used. That would ensure that the Minister or his Department would know exactly where every detection device is and who owns it. Through a registration procedure easily introduced the device could be traced to <Col N="3291" /> the owner if found in use at any site in contravention of the law.  That kind of scheme is used in many other areas of social legislation, for example, the regulation of firearms and, more recently, the control of dogs.  It may seem like wielding the big stick but, in view of the unsatisfactory legal position at present, the Minister must recognise that to allow the general, unfettered issue of licences for these devices can only lead to continued ravaging and trespass of our very important archaeological sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy McCartan for putting down this amendment because it gives me an opportunity to speak on the Bill.  One can take the view that we must have major restrictions in this area but they would prevent innocent people using metal detectors from enjoying themselves,</P>
      <P>I know that my views on this matter would not be in agreement with those expressed by other Members but this is draconian legislation which will squeeze out the innocent lobby.  Some Members seem to be under the impression that there are hundreds of people with metal detectors trying to make a fortune out of buried treasure but most of them are genuinely interested in their heritage and it is a hobby&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know many of them and some could be Deputy Doyle's friends. They are not trying to make money, most of them pursue it as a hobby. Deputy McCartan said that metal detectors should be issued only under licence but that is a very illiberal view.  The Bill is bad enough without inserting that provision. We have lost the run of ourselves by getting so worked up over this matter. Indeed, these artefacts would still be in the ground if the metal detectors had not located them.  The law should have been strengthened in other areas so that people who find treasure-trove could not dispose of it, that it would have to be given to the <Col N="3292" /> State.  I understand the purpose of the Bill but we have gone the wrong way about it.</P>
      <P>Many people innocently involved with detection devices will end up giving X number of months' notice before they can pursue their particular hobby.  If an area is defined as an archaeological area, one could find that a farmer would have to give perhaps ten months' notice before he could carry out works of drainage, or reclamation, or even cultivation.  In this Bill fines of £1,000 and on indictment of £50,000 are mentioned.  In terms of the limited number of people who are out to get money out of the system the effect on innocent people is too drastic.  Any artefacts or treasures found should become the property of the State. According to the amendment put down by Deputy McCartan, people using metal detectors would have to have a licence. That is totally illiberal.  It will end up with everybody having a registration number and there will be no freedom.  There are some people left in this country who believe that we should be free to pursue our own interests any way we like without contravening the overall common good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the amendment as proposed by Deputy McCartan and would be appealing to the Minister to take that one on board.  It is the single most significant amendment of the long list which appears before us today.  The success or otherwise of this Bill will depend on whether we have taken it on board.  Deputy McCreevy has made a fairly good case for people who use metal detectors and has referred in detail to the amount of damage done by people who use them in the vicinity of archaeological sites and who remove goods to sell them.  The damage done by such people is well catalogued and well <Col N="3293" /> known and cannot be more deplored than it has been already by speakers in the House on Second Stage of the Bill. However, the Deputy is ignoring the damage done by people who take metal detectors to archaeological sites and who do irreparable damage, making it impossible for archaeologists to build up a case history of the site.  Irreparable damage is done by inexperienced people using metal detectors on sites even if their intention is never to remove objects to sell them.  We cannot ignore that kind of damage.  We cannot succeed in the aims and objectives of this Bill if we continue to ignore it.  For that reason as well as the well catalogued damage done by people who remove objects and sell them either at home or abroad, I shall be fully supporting the amendment put down by Deputy McCartan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the section is strong enough in itself to prevent the blatant and indiscriminate use of metal detectors.  My judgment is somewhat coloured in that I am totally opposed in principle to the indiscriminate use of metal detecting devices.  At the same time, I can see that the legislation must enable metal detectors to be used in certain cases, perhaps in areas of prospecting, mining and so on.  Overall, my view would be to ban the use of metal detectors by untrained persons.  This is really the crunch of the matter.  With the best will in the world, enthusiastic amateurs can use these devices and &mdash; let us not kid ourselves about this &mdash; essentially the purpose is to try to unearth treasure, sell that treasure and get the maximum award possible for it.  This is the motivation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just make my point? I am going to put some quite alarming facts before the House as regards the amount of treasure that has been found and which is &mdash; I shall not say in private collections &mdash; but being hoarded by people who would not have any great interest in the treasure they found.  Would it surprise the House to know that there is a particular case of over 50,000 coins having been unearthed? These would be a sprinkling of Irish coins, mediaeval coins, English coins and so on.  The National Museum prides itself on having the best numismatic collection of Irish coins in Europe, but there are rare varieties of coins that are yet to be discovered.  We could take the example of the mint of Carlingford which has yet to be discovered.  Unless hoards are presented or offered to the Museum, there is no way of assessing the type of archaeological area or community which existed around the place of discovery.  It is not just a question of taking the treasure out of the ground but of assessing the community involvement.  Coins can be a tremendous asset to archaeologists and historians for dating purposes, in finding out how our forefathers lived and the cultural and social activities carried on in particular areas, no matter what part of the country one is talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support much of what Deputy McCartan has said but, unfortunately, it would not be workable to ban the absolute use of metal detectors.  I would urge that a system of licensing and compulsory training of some sort in the usage of metal detectors under the strict control and <Col N="3295" /> supervision of archaeologists be instigated. The Minister has a golden opportunity of setting about a type of community monument watch scheme under which our national monuments would be guarded by people living in local communities.  These are the people who will identify those who come into areas using metal detectors and causing damage in these localities.  A great amount of archaeological pieces of pottery and items of gold has been unearthed and the people who have taken these items without reporting their finds to the museum are not collectors in the true sense.  They are just waiting until they can devise a method of selling these items abroad.  I would urge the Minister to hurry the legislation which will prevent the exportation of such finds and will identify the items which must be reported to the museum.  It might not be realised in the House but it is a fact that people from other countries who would not innocently use metal detectors come here and use them for gain and they could not care less for our national heritage or for our monuments.  They wilfully destroy in order to profit.  One example is the destruction of Clonmacnoise Abbey where one of the tablets was stolen and taken out of the country.  There is a whole litany of examples where this type of damage has been done.</P>
    <P>It would be a national disgrace if the Derrynaflan Chalice leaves the country. It could leave the country, judging from the way some of the decisions are coming from the courts.  I do not know how a figure of £5.5 million was put on that treasure.  It cannot be evaluated in money terms.  It could be four times that value, or ten times that value.  Legislation must protect such items.  Deputy McCreevy should know that the metal detector in that case was used on someone else's property.  It was a national monument, but the land in question was owned by somebody else.  I agree with the Deputy's point about draconian laws but private property must be protected.  The way the law stands at the moment someone could come into the Deputy's back yard with a <Col N="3296" /> metal detector and work away and be the owner of whatever he finds.  That is very unsatisfactory.  This section of the Bill is of critical importance and must provide our authorities with a strong arm necessary to control this situation which has got out of hand.  It started off as an innocent pursuit but now it is being pursued by people who are just in it for monetary gain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there is a lobby for the use of metal detectors. Perhaps Deputy McCreevy did us a service by speaking for that lobby in such a forthright manner.  I am against curtailing freedoms.  I like to see people enjoying hard won freedoms but there is another side to the story on which Deputy McCreevy did not touch.  This side was alluded to by Deputy Brady and Deputy McCartan.  The cases have been well publicised. However, there are innocent uses of metal detectors.  A television programme last week showed where unemployed people in Britain used metal detectors in seaside towns to pickup coins and so on.  There was no ulterior motive other than to pass the time.  Other people use metal detectors for different reasons. People have gone into ancient sites and have enriched themselves at our expense. Our national monuments and treasures are owned by the people and they should not be plundered by individuals.  Nobody would be against the people whom Deputy McCreevy describes as having innocent pastimes but unfortunately we cannot legislate to take care of every case.  In this case there is a balance between absolute freedom and some restrictions and the balance lies in favour of Deputy McCartan whose amendment was designed to protect our heritage and to cut out some of the abuses I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I will not prolong my contribution because there are 44 amendments to this Bill, some of which are very important to me.</P>

      <P>On consideration of the section, I find that there are adequate safeguards in it.  I appreciate that for <Col N="3297" /> some people who use metal detectors the only motive is profit.  There is a considerable amount of greed involved but the numbers who would do such a thing are small.  If the section is enforced rigidly it will provide the necessary safeguards. The amendment is too restrictive.  It should not be necessary to have a licence to own a metal detector.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about the Derrynaflan Chalice and its finders, Mr. Webb and his son-in-law.  They have come in for a lot of criticism but in fairness to them the day after they found the chalice and recognised it as an item of value they brought it to the National Museum.  As regards compensation, they have pursued their case through the courts.  Deputy McCartan is a lawyer and he will have to admit that everything they have done has been within the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>At least they brought their treasure to the National Museum on the following morning.  We in this House should recognise that if items are found there should be some reasonable compensation for the finders.  If we are too rigid some of our most valued possessions and historic items are likely to be smuggled out of the country to Britain or to America.  We should address ourselves to the payment of reasonable compensation. Resonable compensation is paid in Britain for items that are found. We have a responsibility to face up to this aspect.  This will cause much controversy. Vast numbers of very valuable items have <Col N="3298" /> been smuggled out of Italy and Greece particularly.  If we suppress rewards or give only very small rewards we will encourage people to remove valuable items from the country.</P>
      <P>There is a belief that there are valuable items in many areas where excavation has not been carried out.  The Wood Quay office blocks were built on top of a very valuable archaeological site.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  There were valuable items of an historical nature in Wood Quay and nobody will ever know to what extent they were there because it is too late to find out now.  Before land reclamation and such work is carried out in areas where there are any doubts in regard to historical items preservation orders should be issued as a matter of urgency.  Such factors as machinery, fertilisers and land reclamation can do untold damage to items.  I have considered the amendment Deputy McCartan has proposed but I am confident that the section as outlined will meet the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The licensing or otherwise of Mr. Webb's metal detector would not have changed the situation.  The same applies in the case of Wood Quay.  I do not support the amendment, not because I do not support fully the sentiments of its mover but because I do not think it will achieve any more than the objectives of the Bill as already outlined.  It will do nothing to improve the objective of this section which is to protect our archaeological heritage from the ravages of perhaps the uninitiated, or which are perhaps deliberately done.  I will not go into that this morning.  The same damage can be done to archaeological objects below the ground, whether they are in archaeological sites or otherwise, by any detector and regardless of whether it is licensed.  The important thing we are trying to achieve is the apprehension of the illegal use of those detectors and of <Col N="3299" /> the illegal users of those detectors.  Hopefully the law as we are proposing it now will be enforced.  This discussion will be totally superfluous unless the law is enforceable and is then enforced.</P>
      <P>I do not support the amendment even though I support the sentiments behind it.  I totally disagree with Deputy McCreevy's enunciation of the situation. Would that it was as he pointed out but that is not my experience.  There are many innocent people who use metal detectors, whether beach-combing, in their back gardens or elsewhere.  This is done quite innocently and it is an interesting hobby.  Unfortunately there are some people &mdash; and I think there are more than what we pretend &mdash; who have metal detectors purely for monetary gain and are quite happy to destroy archaeological areas and sites in the hope of retrieving even one object that would be in the Derrynaflan category in terms of value.</P>
      <P>I accept the section of the Bill as it is.  I do not think that licensing metal detectors would help us achieve anything more.  If I did think so I would have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Why not change the law or tighten it so that items which are found would be the property of the State? An interesting point was made by Deputy Doyle, for whom I have great admiration in all senses of that word.  If someone finds an item of the importance of the Derrynaflan Chalice and does not have a licence he will not be likely to report the find and take it to the museum, running the risk of being fined up to £50,000.  That is the flaw in the logic of what Deputy Doyle is saying.  There is an analogy in <Col N="3300" /> this that relates to the presence or non-presence of oil off our shores.  Some people take the view that if oil is out there we should leave it there and not give anybody the chance of taking it out. Other people believe &mdash; and this is being expounded by the Minister for Energy &mdash; that if it is there we should try to get it ashore because it would bring some productivity with it.  The logic of what is being said in the House in relation to the use of metal detectors is that it would be better to leave artefacts in the ground, let them corrode away with no one ever finding them.

      <P>We could argue on another day whether or not items would be better left in the ground.  Many people would be of the view that it is better to have these items displayed in the National Museum.  This legislation is not going to drive the metal detectors lobby away but it is going to drive them underground. Then when items of importance are found by a person who has not got a licence he will not put the objects in the National Museum and face a fine of up to £50,000.  This legislation will drive the users of metal detectors further underground and the problem will get worse. That is the flaw in the logic of this Bill which was introduced by the last Government and supported by this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very remiss in moving the amendment if I did not answer some of the remarks made by Deputy McCreevy.  By his admission, the lobby he first sought to speak <Col N="3301" /> on behalf of are persons who are no strangers to the underworld to which they would return.  This underlines the sense of this amendment.  I see the licensing provision as a temporary measure; I do not see it as something that would be there forever.  In the current climate of events at least we should be addressing a bit more carefully what we propose to legislate for.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has suggested that a better way to go about it is by making a provision allowing for anything found to become the property of the State.  Clearly he has not had any consideration to the litigation that is currently pending before the courts and the implications of that litigation.  On Second Stage the point was made that we may at the end of the day be facing constitutional considerations &mdash; the old hoary question of the rights to private property as enshrined in the Constitution. That is central to the question. The matter is <i>sub judice</i> and I have not sought to trespass on it nor do I want to. However, there is a big question to be answered on another day when another tribunal has delivered its judgment on the existence or otherwise of the right to treasure trove or the right of the State to recover property.  No provision in any Act in the interim period without a Supreme Court determination, or a constitutional determination through a referendum, can be envisaged or encountered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the school &mdash; to borrow the word of the Deputy &mdash; that these items are better left in the bloody ground if that is where they are until such time as they are located in a responsible and learned fashion by people who know what to do and how to interpret their location.  This point has been made already.  It is far better, and I can say it unequivocally from what little bit of information I have, that there was more damage done to the Derrynaflan hoard from the time it was removed from the hole until it found its way into the hands of those at the National Museum than was ever done in the centuries it lay in the bog where it had been purposely hidden. <Col N="3302" /> If we think that this issue is not of serious consequence I should like to take a moment to advise the House of the extent &mdash; it is not even documented here &mdash; of archaeological pillage in a country which is now no more than a £28 air flight away from us.  Let us make one point clear.  In Europe and indeed elsewhere, Ireland is known as a soft spot for archaeological pilfering and excavation in an illegal and unsupervised fashion.  If because the information is ignored by Deputies we do not want to talk about the sins of our own in this regard, at least we can take up the point of foreign intervention.  The incident in Sligo of the standing stones originated from a potential purchaser in America.  The grand larceny of items from Clonmacnoise was perpetrated by a non-national who went into court and said he did not really know where he was or what he was doing and on a laughable fine of £50 he was sent home.</P>
    <P>In Britain the archaeological preservation interests have organised themselves under a campaign known as STOP. They represent right across the board the Association of County Archaeological Officers, the Council of British Archaeology, the Museums' Association, The British Archaeological Trust, The Society of Museum Archaeologists, The United Kingdom Institute for Conservation and Young Rescue which is for children aged between nine and 16 years who are interested in archaeology.  These organisations have organised themselves together to try to stop the wholesale invasion of archaeological sites by treasure hunters in that country.  The litany is incredible.  Of the number of areas in Wales and throughout the country, one is worth recounting in detail, namely, the Mildenhall site in Wiltshire which involved a coin hoard, to which Deputy Brady has referred.  The coin hoard was discovered by treasure hunters who removed it and in order to retrieve some useful information about the hoard a controlled rescue excavation was immediately carried out by archaeologists.  The following night police apprehended three treasure hunters on the same site.  The <Col N="3303" /> next day more intruders hacked away the remaining undisturbed layers in the region of the hoard.  The site was disturbed to a depth of 2 feet 4 inches and important historical evidence, including part of a Roman floor, was destroyed and the remains of not one, but two hoards were hopelessly jumbled.  That is the kind of thing that is going on.  If we continue as at present we will be subjected to an invasion of people during the summer months coming over and engaging in this activity.</P>
    <P>Having laid the ground for the case I will refer very briefly to the amendment and address myself to those Deputies on the far side of the House, and indeed on the Fine Gael side also, as to what is being proposed and suggested.  What is proposed is a simple scheme as exists in many other areas of social legislation seeking to control deleterious objects or substances.  Throughout our social code of legislation we have regulations seeking to control or restrict the use of a proliferation of devices.  In practical terms what does it mean?  It means that if Mr. Webb, yesterday, today or tomorrow, went to his local Garda station or Department office to ask for a licence he would be told under no circumstances would he get a licence to use or own a metal detector device.  It would mean that any person in this State, for the time being, who wanted to use a metal detector device would have to account to some local authority, or person in authority, as to why he wanted it, what was the specific project in mind for its use and what would be the period and the location the activity would take place.  It would afford the Minister through his authority to lay down conditions, to say, for example &mdash; and this is where we could meet Deputy McCreevy's requirement &mdash; that as a condition in the trade-off for allowing the licence that the person should undertake to surrender what is found to the local authority or the issuing authority. There is nothing to stop a private individual, however they secure their rights to private property, from contracting in <Col N="3304" /> advance to surrender them should they uncover something of importance.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Fine Gael side that there is sense to this whole scheme because it allows information at local level for the supervisory authority, be it the Garda Síochána, boards of works, commissioners and their agents in an area, to know what should be going on, where and when.  It arms them with information which enables them to know whether someone, perhaps, noticed in the distance, or reported in a phone call is legitimately pursuing an exercise.  All of this may well be draconian, tough and hard but in the balance of interests the preservation of our historical and archaeological history is crucial and paramount. It is important to us but it has been abused in the past and unless we take some action we will lose very seriously.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be alarmist but I will underline what I am saying by pointing out that in the current climate where the treasure hunter is in a position of being protected by law, it is folly in the extreme at least not to consider introducing restricting legislation.  Who knows when the issue is resolved, hopefully to our advantage, at a future date, we can come back here and say that the financial incentive, the impetus and the motivation have gone and we can now relax on the supervision and licensing procedures.  I would have no objection to that.  I urge Deputies to have a rethink on this matter and to consider accepting the amendment.  Finally, perhaps the Minister when replying to my remarks, will take the opportunity to indicate if any of the amendments on the table are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two simple points.  Deputy McCartan said there was sense to his scheme.  I think there is also common sense to his scheme.  Common sense would tell us that if metal detectors could be held only under licence we would have fewer metal detectors and that in itself would minimise the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be made to follow. Secondly, the very act of having to take <Col N="3306" /> out a licence would impose a certain discipline and a certain sense of responsibility. We should all work to ensure that young, middle-aged or older people, who have a natural curiosity about objects of this nature and who have a sense of discovery and exploration, are encouraged to join local historical and archaeological societies who have done a great deal of good in their own regions during the years. That could and should be done, Thirdly, may I repeat the point I made very badly at the beginning of my contribution.  I think we have all grossly underestimated the amount of damage that has been and is being done to archaeological sites by untrained people.  These amateurs go on to sites with no thought at all of lifting or selling anything or making a profit.  They give no thought to anything except the pleasure they derive from using these detectors or using these instruments.  I think they have done untold damage which as yet has not been highlighted. The matter of profit and export has been highlighted by the press and the other aspect has been ignored.  However, it is just as real and just as damaging in the long term and it must not be and cannot be ignored.  Untold damage is being done on sites by people like this and I can see no way, except the way suggested by Deputy McCartan, of dealing with this. The situation is so serious that if we must err at this time we must err in the direction in which Deputy McCartan is going. Let the pendulum swing to balance later on.</P>
      <P>It is my impression that this legislation is being taken very seriously by the Government.  They are putting it through very quickly because they realise its application is so urgent if what we have is to be salvaged.  It is my impression that this will stay on the Statute Book for a long time.  That being so, I think we better accept the reality of the situation and copperfasten what we are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan mentioned that he would see the licence as a temporary or interim measure.  I think, and I am sure my colleagues would agree, that the Bill is an interim measure and it <Col N="3307" /> is important that it is seen to be so.  It is important to differentiate between the adventurer and the speculator, who goes out wilfully to steal our national assets. This type of plundering must be stopped. I am satisfied that section 2 prevents the unauthorised use of metal detectors, as Deputy Doyle said, if the law is enforced. That is the bottom line.  I am surprised that this type of amendment has been tabled by Deputy McCartan.  It has been described as draconian and I would agree with that description.  It is also unworkable.  We should not enter into the whole question of licences if it interferes with human freedom.  Deputy Kemmy said that he treasures the freedom of the individual: I am aware that he does and so do I.  I feel we should not in any way go down this road.  The Bill is an interim measure and we should try to deal with it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>One point that has been stressed during this debate is that the State, and I address this point to the Minister, must become more actively involved in excavation works and legal metal detection of our archaeological objects because there is a wealth of objects to be found under the ground and in the sea.  This is the message which comes from this debate.  I believe it is time to move on from this amendment. I hope we can deal with this Bill today.  However, I could not agree with this amendment and I am surprised it comes from a Deputy who professes to be a liberal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much the sincere sentiments expressed by so many speakers on all sides.  I appreciate their commitment to the matter.  I feel that to require persons to obtain a licence before acquiring a detection device would be going too far and basically it would be impracticable.  It would also take the commissioners out of their particular area of responsibility.  There are many legitimate uses for metal detectors, such as for tracing pipes and cables.  It is not the intention that the Commissioners of Public Works, in their role as the national <Col N="3308" /> monuments authority, should become involved in controlling the use of metal detectors for purposes other than for searching for archaeological objects.</P>
      <P>Metal detectors are used in many other areas and we would be adopting a role which would be more relevant to the Departments of Communications, the Environment and Energy if we were to accept the amendment as proposed.  I will not be recommending it.  I do not think it would be operable or feasibe to accept the amendment now proposed.  It would also mean that we would have to have a double licensing provision.  First a licence would be required to own or use a metal detector or a device in any instance &mdash; that would be putting the commissioners into a totally new role &mdash; and consent would then be required in order to use or be in possession of the device at a protected site or to use it elsewhere for the purpose of searching for archaeological objects.  A person who wishes to use a metal detector to trace cables in an archaeological area would, therefore, require a licence to own the detector and a consent to use it.  We must be practical in our approach.  The restrictions we are imposing in the Bill go much further than those in many other countries.  We are setting a headline in the control of these devices and I am confident the provisions we are making will be adequate, without imposing an impossible administrative, burden on the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the Derrynaflan case.  The position is that one item of law was decided and that decision has been appealed to the Supreme Court and, consequently I do not want to comment on it.  Several speakers have raised constitutional issues regarding the right to private property.  In my Second Stage speech I stated that this Bill was an interim measure.  The main factor which inhibited me from introducing a more comprehensive Bill is the Derrynaflan case which is at present being heard in the Supreme Court.  Until that case is finally decided, we will not know what the law is regarding ownership of items <Col N="3309" /> which were hitherto considered to be treasure-trove and, therefore, the property of the State.  When we receive the judgment of the Supreme Court we will decide how we should proceed with further amendments of the law.  I imagine that a far more comprehensive provision will then be required than exists at present.  For instance, it may be necessary to provide not only for articles which are unlawfully excavated but also for articles found in circumstances where no breach of the law is involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy and others have alluded to the provisions in this Bill for a maximum fine of £50,000 for an offence involving the use of a metal detector in contravention of this Bill.  This will be a very serious deterrent for anyone proposing to use a metal detector for the purposes of searching for archaeological objects.  While some people have come upon hoards of great value most metal detector users never find valuable treasure and they will be deterred by the level of fines imposed as a result of the passage of this Bill.  Many reports are received by the OPW and the National Museum of the use of metal detectors. This shows that there are many concerned people around the country who will ensure that any illegal uses will in future be reported.  I consider this a practical, legislative approach which offers an operable and a fair and equitable balance between those who must use metal detectors in certain cases and others who would wish to misuse them.  Consequently, I believe this section is sufficient and I regret I must decline the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has taken me wrongly on a number of points.  The first is in terms of seeking to draw the commissioners away from their primary area of responsibility as envisaged in the regime.  It is not necessarily suggested that a licence in the first instance to own or use should emanate from the commissioners.</P>

Right across the board there is a whole range of ways in which they can do it.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have power further on in the Bill for the purpose of regulations and there is nothing to prohibit him from using those regulations to identify someone other than the commissioners or their agents.  The commissioners can appoint agents and the like to carry out work on their behalf. There is nothing to stop them in that respect.  It could be the Garda Síochána for and on behalf of the Commissioners. It is not an insuperable problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that it is a double licensing system and that it is incongruous and difficult to carry out. Street trading comes to mind immediately and the regulation of people who want to peddle their wares on the streets of Dublin.  Any street trader in Moore Street selling flowers, fruit or anything else must get a double licence, a licence <Col N="3311" /> from the Department of the Environment and a licence from the local authority. It works reasonably well, so these are not serious impediments.</P>
    <P>I hope that our interim scheme as envisaged in this Bill will be no longer than a couple of months and that by the new session of this House the Minister or someone on the Government side will be in a position to introduce very comprehensive legislation.  It is hoped that decisions in other places will run in our favour, but I am concerned about the interim period.  We need greater controls. In pursuing this I am prepared to accept that in the range of liberty as opposed to preservation I will allow the accusation that I am illiberal and for preservation.</P>

      <P>The House must recognise that the Irish Association of Professional Archaeologists have recommended the establishment of a regional rescue excavation system to the OPW.

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of the provisions here so far as metal detectors are concerned, but the only real remedy will be when we strengthen our laws whereby artefacts over a certain age automatically become the possession of the State if the State wants them.  The real damage is being done by professional predators who are out there with their metal detectors seeking to gain commercial benefit for themselves.  What is provided, interim measure or not, is satisfactory for the time being.  I do not agree with the Minister of State that it is an interim measure because we await the outcome of the Derrynaflan case.  We do too much of that kind of thing.  We should pre-empt the outcome and we should introduce our legislation irrespective of what is happening there so that we do not suffer the loss as we may if the court case goes against us.  I ask the Minister of State and the commissioners to exercise <Col N="3312" /> common sense in regard to licensing when there are licences issued because many people are involved in this sort of thing. For instance, many people are scouring the lakes with the aid of various metal detectors.  I presume people aided with them were responsible for finding the Lough Kinale Book shrine, one of the marvellous treasures we now have in our National Museum.  If we wait for the National Museum or the official scouring of all of the lakes it will take another 1,987 years before we get around there and the artefacts will be deteriorating. We should exercise a tremendous amount of common sense in the issuing of the licences.  What the Minister of State said is absolutely right, local people have an interest in the preservation of their monuments and artefacts and of our heritage for our great collections, and I believe that they will report the illegal use of metal detectors.</P>
      <P>Overall, this Bill is a very great advance and very badly needed.  It will rectify matters, but finally one must think in terms of ensuring, by constitutional change or otherwise, that it is organised so that artefacts over a certain age automatically become the possession of the State.  Constitutional change may be necessary in this regard, but this will get rid of the high powered, low profile operators who are doing this purely for the sake of treasures turned into money for themselves.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 14, 25, 28, 37, 40, 50, 56, 57, 107 and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At their meeting on 16 June 1987 the Government approved IDA financing towards the cost of a major development plan for the meat industry to be undertaken by Goodman International Limited. The plan involves a capital investment of £120 million on the further development of existing processing facilities at Waterford, Dublin, Muine Bheag, Nenagh and Cahir and the establishment of four new processing facilities, two of which will be located at Tuam, County Galway, and Ardee, County Louth.  The <Col N="3321" /> IMP plant at Leixlip is not involved in the development.</P>
    <P>The IDA will contribute £25 million in grants and £5 million in redeemable preference shares.  It is expected that the EC will also contribute towards the funding from the FEOGA fund.  Neither the State nor the IDA are involved in the underwriting of the exchange risk in regard to any foreign currency that might be required for the project.  Implementation of the plan will result in the creation of 664 new jobs, together with additional spin-off employment in the construction, packaging and services sectors associated with the new investment. Approximately 500 seasonal jobs are also expected to be provided.  The details of the precise timing and location of the jobs being created is covered in the agreement between the IDA and the promoters.</P>
    <P>The main features of the plan are the introduction of new advanced technological processes which will facilitate the production of long shelf-life consumer products, an expansion of cattle and sheep processing facilities, an increase in deboning and the development of new added-value products.  Virtually all the new output arising from this investment will be exported.</P>
    <P>The proposed development plan was the subject of consultation between the IDA and the promoters over a number of months.  A formal application for grant assistance was submitted on 9 April 1987. Approval of the application was recommended by the board of the IDA on 10 June and by the IDA on 12 June.  As is customary in cases involving grant applications, the audited accounts of the promoter were examined as part of the assessment process.  The conditions for the grant assistance include a performance clause with grant clawback options related to employment and value-added created.</P>
    <P>The Goodman International Group received IDA grants totalling £5 million since 1977.  During that time 835 new jobs were created at an average cost per job of £6,000 approximately.  The number of jobs anticipated was 820.</P>
    <P>The numbers of cattle slaughtered and <Col N="3322" /> exported live in 1986, 1987 and 1988 are estimated as follows:</P>

    <P>The grant aid for the introduction of new processing capacities is linked to adequate supplies of cattle being available to meet the needs of the plants. While the Department's policy is directed towards increasing cattle supplies no specific Government action is required for this project.  The slaughtering capacity of the industry is difficult to quantify as it depends on the hours worked, processing facilities &mdash; chilling, freezing and deboning capacity &mdash; and other technical considerations. In 1986 the export plants slaughtered 1.4 million cattle and 1.2 million sheep.  It is not possible to give details of the capacity of individual plants.  The Goodman International plan is concerned for the most part with the creation of a new generation of meat plants based largely on existing throughput and the plan should not lead to any significant excess capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring raised on the Order of Business yesterday the question of further State support for the Goodman project. In particular he sought clarification of the impact of the proposed change in section 25 of the Finance Bill in the tax treatment of certain grants.  The Government's development intentions for the food industry have been expressed in clear terms to the House already.  An intrinsic element in that approach was the creation of a more favourable tax climate for the food sector in general. All new grant-aided food manufacturing investment will be eligible to benefit from this proposed change and the Goodman Group may benefit in the same way as any other manufacturing food firm.  The extent of any such benefit for individual companies is difficult to forecast as it <Col N="3323" /> will depend on the tax position of the recipient company.  The only State money to be paid directly in support of the Goodman project will be those which I have outlined in this reply and which I gave to the House in the course of a full Adjournment debate last Thursday.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state if the fact that grant-aid is linked to adequate supply, as he indicated in his reply, means that if there is not an adequate supply of cattle the package will not go ahead?  Is the Minister in a position to confirm that the package may not proceed if adequate supplies are not available? Will the Minister indicate his answer to Question No. 57 which seeks information on the present slaughtering capacity of each meat processing plant and the slaughtering capacity that will be obtained after the full implementation of this project?  I do not think the Minister answered that question.  Will the Minister indicate if the project, if fully implemented, will involve extra slaughtering capacity?  If so is the Minister satisfied that in the event that there is not an increase in supply that the extra slaughtering capacity involved in the project will not have the effect of prejudicing employment in other plants?</P>

Will it fall due to a lack of finance or is there a possibility that the State might be asked at that stage to provide more money?

      <P>I should like to emphasise that the main thrust of the project is greatly enhanced added value and not any increase in livestock throughput.  This project can operate on the basis of the company's present kill which is 40 per cent of total slaughterings and even after implementation of the project there will be plenty of room for competitive processing. The three new slaughtering processing facilities will have an additional planned throughput and already the expansion of the beef cow numbers is the subject of a promotional campaign launched by ACOT.  That body are bullish about the numbers as a result of their campaign.  The reduction in interest rates will also improve the climate for producers and processers but if a shortfall occurs the IDA have the right to review those elements of support which might be linked to additional cattle throughput.</P>

The Deputy questioned me about procedures and I should like to assure the House that all normal and correct procedures were followed in the submission and the examination by the IDA of the proposal and in the ultimate recommendation for approval by the Authority.  This proposal was under discussion for a number of <Col N="3325" /> months and a formal application was submitted on 9 April.  The Authority, and the board of the IDA, were made aware of the project during those months before the board recommended approval on 10 June.  The Authority approved it on 12 June.  In the last few weeks, because of the scale of the project, there was frequent consultation between Government Departments.  That consultation made it possible for the Government to give a quick response to the recommendation of approval given by the IDA.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the existing slaughtering capacity can cater for a throughput of 65,000 head per week, a figure that has never been exceeded?  Will the Minister agree that the maximum throughput per week has never gone beyond 63,000 head and is usually a lot less?  Second, has the Minister given any consideration to a provision of funds to ensure an adequate and possibly an increased supply of raw material in the light of the major investment of national funds now proposed for the processing end?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of this project and programme is that this is an investment in new technology rather than an investment in bricks and mortar.  It is not an investment to increase slaughtering capacity.  What we want is more processing and to create more jobs at home.  Last year we exported 322,000 head of cattle live and I would hope that by the end of this programme we would substantially reduce that number. Additionally we have too great a dependence on intervention and third countries <Col N="3326" /> markets, both of which are coming under increasing pressure.  Too high a percentage of the meat exported is in carcase form and in many instances the additional processing is done outside the country. At the end of this programme we should be creating all that added value and additional jobs in Ireland.</P>

      <P>While I am in favour of investment in additional added value, the point I was raising dealt with additional slaughtering facilities since the existing maximum facility of 65,000 has never been exceeded.  There are four new operations involved in this proposal. What will be their effect on slaughtering capacity?  I am interesting in getting a true read out of the impact of this investment in relation to slaughtering capacity.</P>
      <P>Secondly, what were the Government's intentions in the light of this major investment in relation to the production end?  I would agree with the Minister on the question of trying to divert live exports into our meat factories, but that will not provide the answer.  There is need for investment in beef cows and there seems to be no intention on the part of the Government to make an investment at that end&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While the Minister persists in saying that the total amount of State aid is the £25 million grant and the £5 million redeemable shares, surely now, because of section 25 of the Finance Bill, the company will have an opportunity of writing off the State grants against their tax liability? Will the Minister accept that through this device they will be able to write off up to £12.5 million in any one year? Secondly, was this a prerequisite sought by the Goodman group before they would conclude the deal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I was very glad that the capital allowance provision was restored in the 1987 Finance Bill as an additional encouragement to the food industry because we want to get development there.  We have a sufficient number of reports, particularly in the meat industry, the most recent being the 1985 sectoral report.</P>
      <P>This programme is totally in line with the recommendations of that report. Section 25 of the Finance Bill, 1987, covered the general food industry.  The benefit to any company, including this one, will depend on their tax liability and it will certainly not be in the region of £12.5 million because manufacturing companies pay a 10 per cent tax rate and virtually all the products resulting from this programme will be exported.  Therefore, the lower rate will apply and the maximum tax liability is 10 per cent instead of the usual company tax of 50 per cent.</P>

I have seen IDA proposals to the Government over four <Col N="3332" /> and a half years and there is always an investment to return ratio which is underwritten by the Department of Finance to ascertain whether the taxpayer is getting good value for money.  That information must be in the Minister's brief because it is in every IDA proposal to the Government.</P>

      <P>I do not have that information in my brief.  This is probably one of the lowest levels of grant-aid in the food industry and in general industry.  I will read out some percentages.  In the general food industry in designated and disadvantaged areas a grant of up to 75 per cent is available and the general rate paid out to overseas industry in the past three years was 26.85 per cent in the designated area and 27.19 per cent in the non-designated area.

      <P>In view of the proposed savings on intervention, Third World refunds and the proposed added value, will there be a better price for the producer of raw materials?  As Deputy Bruton said, the price of cattle is variable and it is difficult to make money out of producing them.  Does the Minister consider that this will give a guaranteed price to the producer of meat and for cattle in the market place?  Is the Minister satisfied with the level of technology proposed in relation to shelf life and added value products&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The whole basis for this project was to provide a better cattle industry over the years.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a <Col N="3333" /> seasonal supply problem and a dependence on opportunistic markets like third countries and intervention.  I have no doubt that at the end of the project the Irish meat industry will be at the top of the world league in terms of added value, processing and the money paid to the original producer.</P>

      <P>The arrangements introduced last October, under which my Department provide support for the reactor collection service operated by the South Western Cattle Breeding Society Ltd. in association with Ballyclough Co-operative Creamery Ltd., in County Cork, were part of a special programme to bring about a significant reduction in the level of bovine TB in the county. The various elements of the programme which, I am pleased to say, has been a considerable success to date will be reviewed later this year.  Whether the arrangements can be extended to other counties will depend on a number of factors, notably the experience in Cork and the existence of proposals from farming organisations or co-operative societies to establish a comparable service elsewhere.  I do not mind giving credit to the former Minister, Deputy Hegarty, for setting up this arrangement which is working very well.</P>

      <P>With a view to expedition, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 11, 32, 35 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Estimates the Government provided £250,000 to Bord na gCapall with a view to winding up their activities with effect from 1 April 1987.  This has now been done and staff have been made redundant.  While the board have ceased to function they continue as a legal entity pending decisions regarding development of the half-bred horse industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, my Department have made arrangements for the continued operation of the Irish Horse Register and the Register of Approved Stallions.  The arrangements also include the provision of facilities for the issuing of passports and the registration of the 1987 crop of foals.  ACOT have taken over responsibility for the supervision and certification of examinations for the Irish Diploma and Certificate in Equestrian Science.</P>
      <P>I am examining the whole question of the future of the half-bred horse industry with a view to identifying the factors that impede development and ascertaining how best the State might help, given the present constraints in the public finances. For that purpose I had a meeting recently with the various interests in the industry and requested submissions from them on future developments.  I intend to meet those interests again shortly before formulating permanent arrangements for the industry.</P>

I do not know if it is appropriate at this point that I should give any further details but if the House wants them I can give them.  It does underline the fact that we must have a very comprehensive, efficient and reliable system in relation to the register and the purchase of stallions and supervision in the interests of what is an essential element of the industry.

      <P>Malibu Beach has, broken wind, is a whistler and roarer as they say, two defects which under the Horse Breeding Act of 1934 render a stallion unsuitable for breeding.  It also has what is called a parrot mouth, which is known as the overshot.  Transmission, one of the other horses, is also a whistler and, in addition, is a rig: I am sure the Deputy, is aware that is the term used of a stallion that has only one testicle.  He also has a parrot mouth, being overshot. French Wilt also has chronic broken wind and is infertile.  It is a matter of great concern that these three stallions, two of which were purchased in 1986 and one some time earlier, have been found to be so inadequate for the purposes for which they were purchased.  My Department <Col N="3338" /> have demonstrated in the action they took that the priorities of the half-bred industry are being protected and promoted in the interim by them.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is appropriate to the present situation.  Can the Minister give us an assurance regarding item No. 19 on the Order Paper, the Horse Breeding Bill?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies are both informed and interested in this area because there were some other related questions this afternoon.  In so far as we are talking at European level about alternative sources of farm activity and in so far as we have such natural advantages in terms of tradition, knowledge, breed or whatever in this area particularly, I share the view of every Member of this House that this is a priority area for control and development.  Let me for that reason assure the Deputies, particularly those interested in this area, that I had a very detailed consultation, as part of a series of consultations, with all the interests concerned.  Part of the problem was that there were too many interests concerned, 13, all legitimate in their own way.  One can see the problems there.  I assure the Deputy and all others that it is my intention in the foreseeable future to bring forward the final proposals which can in time be incorporated into legislation.  I do not want to do anything in a hasty way.  I support in every respect what the Deputy has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan walked into that one.  In view of that fact that this was a board charged with monitoring this industry and promoting it and in view of the very obvious serious defects, even to non-qualified veterinary personnel, will the Minister have an inquiry into the purchase?  Will there be an inquiry to find out from whom the animals were purchased, who examined them and will the Minister lay that information before this House because of the seriousness of buying animals of this nature with such obvious defects as a parrot mouth, which is something that can be seen immediately? This is a board statutorily charged with this responsibility and there is need for an immediate investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that I do regard this as a very serious matter; we all do.  It is particularly serious in view of the fact that the purpose of this scheme, and particularly the leasing of the stallions, was to enhance the breeding strain in the half-bred industry.  I have already conducted some inquiries, and to the extent that I will need further inquiries I shall undertake them, too.  How I should put the matter before the House is another question.  Certainly, when we come to introduce legislation I will have no reason to withhold information from any Deputy who has a legitimate interest in this industry, and that means everybody here.  During the course of a recent informal meeting of Agriculture Ministers we were invited to visit a half-bred breeding and equestrian <Col N="3340" /> school outside Brussels.  Belgium is a country that started far behind us and had nothing of our tradition, advantages and knowledge.  It is important that we recognise that other countries are catching up and passing us out and that nothing but the best standards will be acceptable here.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has made such a clear statement of commitment to this industry which is of vital importance to agriculture, to our exports and to our standing in sport throughout the world.  Will the Minister agree that this matter of hilarity here today is not the first cause of concern about the operations of the board and would he agree that whatever the fault of board members there was no evidence of any problems among the staff in regard to any chicanery that might have gone on?  The Minister said he had communicated with or spoken to all concerned but is it not a fact that the Minister did not meet or speak to the staff who were made redundant as a result of whatever had gone on, and that the Department refused to meet them and saw no reason to meet them, although they wanted to discuss their redundancy terms, pension funds and so on?</P>

In relation to discussions, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter for a Minister to meet individuals involved in matters that arise as a consequence of redundancy or of the termination of the activities of a board.  I do not suggest that it is not a matter of vital importance for the people concerned, and even for the Minister, but the Deputy will appreciate that it is not part of the procedures of Government that the Minister and the Department would meet individuals in each of these cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The future development of the food sector will require a much greater emphasis on marketing to enable the industry to adapt to the changing pattern of consumer demand.  This will entail not only a firm commitment to and a substantial investment in marketing, but also considerable attention to product development, quality and presentation.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the office of the food industry and the transfer of food functions from the Department of Industry and Commerce to my Department will facilitate a more unified approach by the State agencies to the development of the food industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said it was not exactly the intention of the priority question.  The question was whether the Minister accepts that a more unified approach to <Col N="3347" /> marketing is now required.  In his Estimate speech recently, the Minister said he had set up a working party of members of the farming organisations and of his own Department but would he not accept that despite the stated ambition of his party to have a market driven industry there seems to be no marketing input into this working party so far at national economic recovery is concerned.  Can the Minister hear me?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is enormous duplication in the activities of State-sponsored bodies in the key areas of marketing and promotion and that a more unified and coherent approach is necessary; also in view of the diminishing role of intervention in beef and dairy products and of the emergence of marketing organisations within the larger food processors embracing many continents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a response already from industry for the new strategy of the Department of Agriculture and Food in relation to marketing and product development.  It is fair to say that an impact is being made and industry is responding to the new climate.  We are <Col N="3348" /> constantly encouraging industry to avail of the State facilities and incentives available for development in the food industry in order to enable them to diversify into value-added consumer products.  Deputies who were in the House earlier got an indication of the kind of development which is taking place.  I welcome that development very much.</P>
      <P>In addition, Government strategy for the food industry is to encourage the sector to seek out and exploit opportunities for the production of consumer-type products and the grant aiding agencies have been asked to give priority to projects related to such products.  Furthermore because of the importance which the Government attach to marketing the appraisal of investment proposals put forward for State aid by manufacturers includes an assessment of their marketing arrangements.  Aid to investment is conditional on those arrangements being adequate.  There is an emphasis on marketing.  The State agencies are regularly monitored for their performance in relation to their ability to market Irish food.  The industry is encouraged to develop consumer-type and consumer-ready products manufactured in Ireland for supply directly to consumers in the various supermarkets in the UK and throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting what the Minister says, would he not agree that the direction the industry is taking is going to render absolute in terms of the stated Government policy of today many of the promotional agencies which were there when intervention was more important and when companies did not have their own promotional activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that thesis.  Rather than rendering promotional agencies obsolete their role will have to be enhanced and improved and that a greater marketing and promotional effort will be required.  Because our dependence on intervention and opportunistic markets will be lessened we will have to have regard more and more to the marketplace.  We will be dependent <Col N="3349" /> on the good offices of State agencies to do the best marketing job possible for the future of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy but I wish to deal with three more questions within the prescribed period. The Deputies had a fair innings.  I will allow a brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Irish farmers receive the lowest returns for milk and beef at the farm gate would the Minister accept that the track record of the promotional agencies up to now has been good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can accept that.  As the Deputy well knows there are a number of peculiarities in relation to Irish agriculture, for example, seasonality of supply and a number of other factors which are peculiar to Ireland.  Generally we want to improve efficiency and product development and marketing and get a better price back to the farming community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 38 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted within the dairy industry that further rationalisation of milk assembly and processing facilities must take place over the coming years. This is inevitable if the industry is to continue to develop, to adapt to changing market requirements to maximise returns to milk producers and to protect the jobs of the workers engaged in the industry.  I will continue to ensure that investment aid from national and EC sources will be available to facilitate this process; in that context it is encouraging that FEOGA grants have recently been restored for investment projects in the milk sector.</P>
      <P>Investment decisions by individual co-operatives are of course ultimately a matter for themselves to decide.  I have, however, been urging the industry to diversify into the manufacture of nonintervention type products in order to maximise employment and added-value following the drop in milk intake which will follow the reduction in quotas.  We must reduce our dependence on intervention products and I must commend those progressive co-operatives which have already been most active in developing new markets for consumer products.</P>

Fianna Fáil in Opposition prepared a policy document for the development of horticulture; the central point of the policy document being the establishment of a statutory body of An Bord Glas which was freely available to everybody to read and to study prior to Fianna Fáil returning to Government.  The position at present is that the interim board, at its last meeting, decided to establish a number of commodity teams which embraces personnel both from ACOT, AFT, producer groups and others to tackle the various areas in the industry which need to be tackled immediately.</P>

The same question arises in relation to the horticultural staff, horticultural advisers and specialist advisers in ACOT.  What is their future?  They are interested to know.  Do not tell me it is not a real issue. They have been asking me and I now ask <Col N="3352" /> the Minister to make a clear statement on the situation even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>I have been actively pursuing with the EC Commission and Council the setting up of a restructuring scheme.  A proposal to this effect has in fact been included now, at my request, in the price fixing compromise that was circulated at last week's Council meeting. <Col N="3353" /> While I will be seeking to have this implemented as soon as possible, the date for the setting up of such a scheme will be dependent on when agreement is reached on this year's price fixing.</P>
      <P>The categories of producers who will be eligible to buy up the additional quotas made available under such a scheme will be finalised following consultations between officials of my Department and representatives of the farming and co-operative organisations.  These categories will generally be based on those presently eligible for priority distribution of flexi-milk.</P>

      <P>This is purely for information purposes.  If the price talks conclude within the next month or so what kind of a date would he expect to have in mind as to when the restructuring scheme will be operational?

I must inform the Deputy truthfully that there is no specific time scale between the completion of price talks and the date of implementation.  I assure the Deputy that I would be talking about weeks rather than months but that is subject to Commission agreement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the immediate action she proposes to take in order to assure students presently taking the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations that they will be treated fairly in the correction of public examinations in the light of the information published in the media today that at least 57 printing errors or misprints <Col N="3354" /> in 44 examination papers have already been discovered.</P>

      <P>The printing errors or misprints referred to in the question are covered by the <i>errata</i> list supplied to each examination superintendent.  There is an <i>errata</i> list prepared each year for the public examinations.  At the beginning of each examination the superintendent refers to the <i>errata</i> list for that particular session.  If there is an error in this <i>errata</i> list, the superintendent calls it out, and the candidate makes the necessary amendment on his or her examination papers.  The question of special treatment in the marking would therefore not arise through some mischance the superintendent did not call out the appropriate amendment.  I can assure the House and indeed parents of pupils that all candidates will be treated fairly in the marking of the public examinations.</P>

      <P>I did not put down this question in any sense whatsoever to attempt to embarrass the Minister.  I am well aware that these examination papers were printed, for the most part, before the Minister took up her responsibilities. Because of the fact that there was a previous error where the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was missing from a crucial, large question in one of the papers; because there was ambivalance last week about the word &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; in an accountancy paper; because most seriously the correction slip, to which the Minister referred, supplied by the Department to supervisors was itself wrong in two further cases, because of all these difficulties I believe there should be a special inquiry by the Minister in her Department into the way the whole operation of the printing, proof reading and correction of examination papers is carried on.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Hussey acknowledged that the examination papers were prepared as far back as last January.  I was not going to bring it up but I am glad the Deputy acknowledged it.  On the <i>errata</i> to which the <Col N="3355" /> Deputy has referred, first of all, the omission of &ldquo;or&rdquo;, I answered that question very fully one night in an Adjournment Debate lasting half an hour and that is on the record.  With regard to the accountancy error referring to the creditor/debtor which was not included on the <i>errata</i> list, I can assure the candidates and the House that this error will be taken into account in the marking. Again, I assure the House that I have given the closest possible attention to the examinations since they commenced and I am absolutely determined, as are the officials in my Department, that equity of treatment and, above all, a system of fairness will appertain in the marking of these examinations.</P>

      <P>I pointed out to Deputy Hussey that the number of <i>errata</i> unfortunately indeed seems to be at the same rate this year as in other years. The whole conduct and operation of the examinations is a huge complex operation, one involving enormous skill, ingenuity and work by my Department and by all the various educational agencies throughout the country.  Immense effort is called for and immense effort is given, and there is integrity at all levels. Because of the necessity for secrecy the number of proof readers, as the Deputy knows, quite well, has to be very small because it is all done by people and the number involved must remain very small. The people involved both in the Examinations Branch in Athlone and here at the Department in Dublin work extremely hard to carry out this complex operation on behalf of the young people, their parents and the public in general. I am very satisfied that the measures we have taken, and will continue to take, through the examination systems which we have set up for the superintendents and for the supervisors of superintendents will aim to bring out a comprehensive method whereby the <i>errata</i> and the various matters arising from them will be attended to with great care.  I assure the House that I will be taking a personal interest in that matter.  It would not be in the interests of anybody that we would make a public statement at this point as to the methods we will devise for our various marking schemes to cope with the system.</P>

      <P>In view of the chaos which obviously is caused not by the lack of efficiency of the Department but because they are labouring under the <Col N="3357" /> great difficulties of such increased numbers every year, does the Minister not agree that this chaos points irrevocably to the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board with responsibility for examinations?  That is a very important point.</P>

      <P>I now see the point of the Deputy's question.  I do not intend to go into that matter.  It is an entirely separate issue but it makes very clear to me the reason why the Deputy has been so assiduous or busy about putting down her various questions in this regard.  It makes matters very clear why the Deputy is pursuing this.  Let me say to the public at large that I have the utmost confidence in my staff in the Department here in Dublin and in Athlone, who are carrying out on behalf of the public, the teachers, the young people and parents, a very comprehensive job in the compiling and issuing of the examination results.</P>
      <P>I gave a comprehensive answer because I think it is in the interests of all that I am fully briefed and fully responsible to this Dáil for this question.  I accept my responsibilities utterly.  I think the responsibilities of a Minister is paramount in issues such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.&mdash;(1)  Where the Board is satisfied that by reason of the presence of any void, space, cellar, machinery, furnace, oil or petrol storage tank or any other duct cable or energy source, in or on any lands or premises which lie adjacent to or in the near proximity of any gas pipeline mains or storage <Col N="3461" /> facility owned or maintained by the Board, there is a danger to persons or property arising from any potential leaks or escape of gas into such lands or premises:</P>
    <P>(i) it shall be lawful for the Board to discontinue the supply of gas to any part of the said lands or premises, and,</P>
    <P>(ii) it shall be lawful for the Board to make a Gas Safety Order in respect of any such lands or premises whether or not there is a supply of gas thereto.</P>
    <P>(2) A Gas Safety Order shall specify the works which the Board considers reasonably necessary to obviate the danger referred to in subsection (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>(3) A copy of the Gas Safety Order shall be served on any persons appearing to the Board to have an interest in the lands or premises affected by the Order and shall be advertised in a manner to be prescribed by the Minister in regulations made under this Section.</P>
    <P>(4) The Gas Safety Order shall indicate whether the Board proposes to carry out the works or whether it is requiring the owner or occupier of the lands or premises to carry out the works.</P>
    <P>(5) The cost of carrying out the works specified in a Gas Safety Order shall be borne by the Board unless the Court shall otherwise direct on finding that the works are necessitated by the unlawful and unreasonable use of the lands and premises by any person, in which case it shall be lawful for the Court to direct that person to pay the whole or part of such costs.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Court may also direct that a person who has constructed on his lands any space or structure or has installed thereon any machine or thing giving rise to a danger as aforementioned, and has failed to obtain <Col N="3462" /> planning permission specially authorising such construction or installation, shall bear the whole or part of the cost of such works.</P>
    <P>(7)  In this section &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; means the Circuit Court for the area in which the lands and premises are situate.</P>
    <P>(8)  Any person aggrieved by the making of a Gas Safety Order may apply within 21 days of the service of the Order upon him by way of Appeal against such Order to the Court by Notice of Motion served on the Board, to vary or discharge the Order.</P>
    <P>(9)  (a)  The Board may, by Notice of Motion served on any person appearing to be interested in the said lands or premises, apply to the Court to have an Order made under subsection (5) of this section in respect of that person.</P>
    <P>(b)  Such application shall be made within 21 days of the service of the Gas Safety Order upon such person.</P>
    <P>(10) Where the Board has served a Gas Safety Order in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, it shall be lawful for the Board, its servant, agents or contractors to enter on the lands and premises in respect of which the Order was made and to carry out in or on the said lands and premises the works specified in the said Order and any ancillary works and the Board shall be liable to pay compensation to the owner or occupier of the said lands or premises in respect of:</P>
    <P>(a)  the disturbance and interference caused by the execution of the said works on the said lands and premises, and,</P>
    <P>(b)  any diminution in the value of the said lands or premises arising from the execution of the said works,</P>
    <P>and the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts in respect of assessing the amount of such compensation shall have effect in relation to compensation payable hereunder as though the works <Col N="3463" /> under this section were works carried out by the Commissioners for Public Works under those Acts and as though the Board were liable to pay compensation in like manner as the Commissioners in respect thereof.</P>
    <P>(11)  The Court may, on an application made <i>ex-parte</i> by the Board, abridge any period of time provided for in this section or deem any notice to be duly served, in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as the Court shall deem reasonable and just having regard to the urgency of the matter and the right of the persons affected by the making of a Gas Safety Order.</P>
    <P>This is a proposal to add an entirely new section to the Bill.  I suggest it is a very comprehensive and necessary amendment because it deals with the problem of voids or cellars in buildings where there can be an accumulation of gas.  This was a major reason for the tragic accident which occurred at Raglan House.  It was a very serious accident because gas was allowed to accumulate over a period of time in a void.  There is no provision in this Bill and in the law as it stands at present to require the owners of buildings that have voids or cellars underneath them to fill these voids and block them up to prevent the ingress of gas into them. That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Let me revert to the Raglan House incident because it seems a most appropriate example in terms of the proposed amendment.  Gas will seep along the direction of a pipeline; in other words, it will defuse laterally, given that these underground services are normally in an impermeable soil and if there is a tarmacadam surface overhead there is no possibility of the gas venting.  It will ultimately end up in a void and the main difficulty is that it seeps into the basement of a building.  The purpose of this amendment is to put an onus and an obligation on the owners of such buildings to ensure that these voids are filled.  That is not catered for at this time. In fact, the gas <Col N="3464" /> service need not be going into any particular building.  The escape could come from a pipeline in the distribution network that would be in the vicinity of such a building.  The dangers are there and we have ample evidence of that in relation to the Raglan House incident.</P>
    <P>I urge that this amendment be taken on board.  I regard it as being a very necessary amendment and it is entirely right that it should be incorporated into this Bill and become law.  The amendment provides that the cost of completing the filling in a void would be borne by An Bord Gáis, except in cases where the building in question did not have planning permission or was in contravention of the law in some other way.  There is provision in this amendment for compensation where there is a disturbance when people are having basements or cellars of their buildings filled in or indeed if there is any diminution in the value of the premises as a result of that work being carried out.  I urge that this amendment be incorporated in the Bill as it is a very necessary amendment.  Such problems as I have outlined are not catered for as the law stands at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy O'Malley that the whole question of safety is paramount in this legislation.  It was the question of public safety that prompted the Government to press BGE for an early bid for the Dublin Gas Company because we were not satisfied that with a gas utility of this size and having regard to the number of users receivership was the right way to carry on the business.  We were very conscious of safety, consequently one of the first decisions made by the present Government was that BGE would make a bid for the takeover of the Dublin Gas Company. I do not intend to get into the whole Cremer and Warner report on the tragic incident in Raglan House and I do not think the Deputy wants to do so either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I cannot accept the amendment but I assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the need for the power he is proposing in subsection (1) (i), that is the power to discontinue gas supply to <Col N="3465" /> a dangerous building.  My intention is to see that BGE have this power, and it is one of the issues which gave rise to section 2 (1) (c) of the Bill.  The Deputy's proposals in relation to safety are covered there.</P>
    <P>Regarding compensation for the type of operations the Deputy includes in his amendment, the amendment proposes to impose obligations on BGE and I am going to see that many of those obligations are met.  That is what I am doing in section 2 (1) (c) but the amendment goes further in that it provides that BGE pay compensation for any inconvenience which may be caused while this work is undertaken.  This would be quite unreasonable for the purpose of getting to where we both want to get to, that is the safety of people living in buildings.  It would be an intolerable burden to place on an organisation.  Really the Deputy is proposing, probably quite unintentionally, that the total cost would be unlimited.  Nobody knows what the cost would be and there would be no limit on the cost of what we would be imposting on BGE.  I could not accept that.</P>
    <P>The question of dangerous buildings and standards is a matter which the task force who were appointed in the wake of the Raglan House explosion are looking at at the moment.  It comes under the area of building regulations mainly.  It is more relevant to the Minister for the Environment because the Cremer and Warner task force whose report of recommendations I accepted immediately they were published &mdash; probably a record speed for any Minister accepting recommendations of a report &mdash; are operating under the Minister for the Environment who is bringing in new building regulations.  The type of proposal the Deputy has in mind appears to be more relevant in that regard.  However, in terms of its imposition of the cost factor on BGE I find myself unable to accept the amendment as proposed, but I assure the Deputy that safety is paramount with me and for that reason section 2 (1) (c) is drafted as it is.</P>
    <Col N="3466" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be associated with Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  When we drafted this amendment we had in mind some deficiencies in the corpus of legislation which now applies to the delivery of gas especially in the Dublin area but I presume, by inference, in other areas also.</P>
      <P>We have a grave difficulty in one respect.  Most of the Acts relating to the distribution of gas by Dublin Gas Company and their predecessors are private Acts of Parliament which are not available to the country at large.  For instance, they cannot be found in the Oireachtas Library here.  They are in the possession of the gas company but generally they cannot be found, they are not accessible and the powers of the gas company are not publicly known or publicly stated and have not been the subject matter of any review with a view to updating those powers to take account of present conditions. That was one of the main motivations that lay behind Deputy O'Malley's and my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in support of this amendment as opposed to what the Minister is asking us to do, that is to rely bona fide on section 2 (1) (c), let me say that far reaching powers are needed now for BGE to render safe certain lands on which gas lines do not now run but which, as Deputy O'Malley said, have gas lines near them.  I do not want to get into the depths and complexities of Cremer and Warner and Raglan House, but there is a case where a 12 inch main runs along the DART railway line near buildings which are constructed on top of voids. Even if there had never been a gas supply to Raglan House and the Ballsbridge complex of flats, a fracture of the mains along the DART railway line could result in a filling of the voids under those buildings by gas.  Even if there was never a supply by the Dublin Gas Company to the Ballsbridge Court complex, the construction of the buildings could give rise to a public danger with no question of the lands concerned having being supplied by the gas company at any time.  The present rights of the gas company as set out in all the Victorian Statutes which govern their <Col N="3467" /> operation do not give them the right to go on to a total stranger's land to see if a danger is created, for instance, in the case of a cellar or void.  They do not appear to have the right to go on to lands which are not affected by a gas supply and to remedy a possible danger.  In that context we sought to amplify the powers of whoever is supplying gas in the Dublin area to cover these dangers to the public.  The Minister says he wanted to arrive at the same result as we seek, but suppose, for instance, there were cellars under blocks of flats in Nicholas Street or anywhere else in the city of Dublin or if there was an underground car park which was dangerously close to a gas main and if in the view of BGE or the Dublin Gas company or whoever is supplying gas to the Dublin area, these would, unless ventilated, create a possible danger to the public, the occupant of the building or whatever, there is no power at the moment to force people who are strangers completely to the supply of gas to change their building or to strengthen walls in it or make surfaces in it impermeable.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to allow BGE to say to an owner of lands with whom they have nothing to do at all that because their main passes by a landowner's premises and because that simple fact gives rise to potential danger, it may be necessary for BGE to carry out certain works on their land to obviate the danger.  In such circumstances if an innocent landowner finds himself affected by what is in the view of BGE a reasonable safety measure, and they have power to carry out works on his land to obviate the danger, he should have rights to compensation when he is not at fault for what gives rise to the danger.  If that is accepted as a reasonable proposition &mdash; I submit to the Minister that it is &mdash; then the question arises, are the powers conferred on him by section 2 (1) (c) sufficient to do that?  It seems they do not give rise to any right, for instance, to pay compensation to anybody.  I do not believe the Minister could make an order under the Gas Acts which would give rise <Col N="3468" /> to a claim to compensation by an innocent landowner whose lands will be affected by certain works which the Minister or Bord Gáis Éireann thought should be carried out on his land.</P>
    <P>The Minister's powers under section 2 (1) (c) do not provide fully for the compensation of such people.  A landowner who does not want to ventilate his cellars and who wants to ignore the requests of the gas board to modify his premises because of its close proximity to a gas pipeline would be well able to resist any such efforts by An Bord Gáis Éireann unless a clear statutory power is given to the board to carry out these works.  Even if the Minister makes very far-reaching regulations under section 2 (1) (c) giving An Bord Gáis Éireann all sorts of functions, a court will not interpret those powers as giving them the right to go on to total strangers' lands to carry out works or to insist that works are carried out, whether or not the landowner is innocent or guilty of creating the danger. It is unlikely that a court will interpret a general section of that kind as giving the Minister such a wide-ranging power.  It is in that context that we thought it better to give an explicit power to An Bord Gáis Éireann to carry out these works or, on occasion to require the owner to carry them out in order to keep occupants of lands and premises safe.</P>
    <P>We have been careful in drafting the amendment to ensure that the relative rights of landowners, gas consumers, the public at large and An Bord Gáis Éireann would be fairly mediated by a court rather than giving draconian powers to An Bord Gáis Éireann to go on to people's lands and to carry out works irrespective of whether or not there is a gas supply on the land.  It has to be conceded by the Minister that the powers of entry on to lands given to the board in section 34 of the Gas Act, 1976, do not extend to the carrying out of works for the purpose of rendering those premises safe from an adjoining gas main.  At present the law is not adequate to deal with problems such as that at Raglan House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady will back me up in saying <Col N="3469" /> that if a landowner who occupies a building with a space of this kind which gives rise to a danger is unwilling to fill that space himself, Bord Gais Eireann and Dublin Corporation cannot do anything about it. It seems, if there is a danger created by the presence of a gas main in an area, somebody should be given a compulsory power to obviate this danger as far as the public are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the open-ended financial obligation that could be placed on Bord Gais Eireann if the amendment in Deputy O'Malley's name and in my name is accepted. We are saying that if certain works have to be carried out, in order to obviate a public danger, by reason of the presence of a gas main and if the affected land is in receipt of a gas supply the board can simply terminate the gas supply. There is no problem in that regard and I am sure the gas company have done that under previous law. If there is no gas supply on the land, cutting off the gas supply or not supplying gas would be no effective sanction to the occupier and therefore this compulsory power should exist. If the works have to be carried out in circumstances of total innocence on the part of the landowner it would be wrong to ask him to pay for it and it would be necessary to compensate him for any inconvenience in carrying out the works. If he carries out the works himself it would be necessary to compensate him for the cost of doing so and also to compensate him for any diminution in the value of his premises which the carrying out of the works would create. I ask the Minister, even if he does not like the phraseology of the amendment in Deputy O'Malley's name and in my name, to accept that it is proper. We will push this amendment and if the Minister does not like it and votes it down he can introduce another one in the Seanad. This is of fundamental importance because the powers given at present do not adequately deal with the problem which arose in Raglan House. Something along these lines is necessary and the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with this amendment. Like the last speaker, I made representations to the developers concerned with Raglan House, to Dublin Corportion and to those concerned with giving power to try to do something about rectifying the impasse that obtains at present in that development. There are extreme difficulties when it comes to the question of incorporating within this legislation an all-embracing power to literally go wherever one wanted. On the one hand, I can see that the last speaker would argue that that is not his intention, that it is just to safeguard the people in similar situations to that of Raglan House. Nevertheless, it would give that all-embracing power and I am not sure, for a variety of reasons, that that would be desirable.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage of this debate I spoke about the safe production of gas. This is the most important aspect of the whole question of the potential risk from what I would call an unignited fire. Gas, as we realise, has an inherent potential of seepage and can seep in all directions. Perhaps if one could carry out an examination throughout our capital city - the same applies to other cities - one would be quite alarmed at the amount of seepage that is taking place all over the city. Obviously, the key to this problem must be twofold. Areas should be adequately ventilated. In cases where there is a build up of gas it is not unusual for street ventilation to take place and the gas company burn off the residual gas. This also happens in other cities as part of the system of providing for safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to gas as a continuous unignited fire hazard once taps are turned on or once the seepage is taking place. It is necessary to have a mandatory system of alarms. This is something which the Minister can consider. He should ensure that, as a start, all new premises would embody such an alarm system, just as smoke alarms are mandatory and their existence in high rise flats has saved the lives of very many people. This would go a long way to preventing accidents from taking place. We are all too familiar with the three explosions that have taken <Col N="3471" /> place. The day before the explosions, and in some cases for the preceding week, residents and shopkeepers when interviewed said there was a strong smell of gas and that they had reported it. An alarm system would not be very expensive but would be effective. The suppliers of the product would be more concerned about efficiency if alarms were to ring when danger arose.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the spirit of the amendment. I have no hesitation in naming the developers, Holland-Lansdowne, who are not prepared to ventilate or fill the voids under the Raglan House development. We are finding it very difficult to compel the developers to conduct that work. They may be anxious to steer clear of such work because it may be deemed as an admission of liability on their part and in that case they might find themselves facing litigation. The Minister should give serious consideration to incorporating in this legislation, or in a future Bill, a directive that will take this responsibility from the developers if the work is carried out. That would clear up problems like those at Raglan House. A directive of that type is needed.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the powers of Bord Gáis Éireann to enter properties or lands adjoining private property. We are all aware that Dublin city has been torn asunder by repair crews and that many roads have been dug up to rectify the gas problem. The board will have to err on the side of caution and if there is any hint of a gas leak they will have to get involved in the work straight away without giving much consideration to roads and soon. It is very difficult to catch up with the problem of seepage.</P>
    <P>It is important to get some information on the safety of the product being sold. I am not so concerned about its power but about how the gas moves in the piping system. I wonder if it has the effect of being corrosive and is tearing away at the pipe joints. I wonder if it gives the self-sealing effect that the old gas did. I hope the Minister will comment on those matters because many of the 130,000 consumers, particularly those living in high <Col N="3472" /> rise flats, are living in fear of explosions. The piping system is being slowly destroyed. I do not wish to sound alarmist about this but if the piping system is not safe as a result of a chemical interaction we will have to something about it as a matter of extreme urgency. The Minister should give consideration to the need for mandatory ventilation. It would not be an expensive way of clearing up present problems. The Minister should also consider introducing an alarm system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that in his reply the Minister referred to the task force and said that the enforcement of recommendations by the task force would be dealt with in the building regulations. I do not want to enter into the entire Cremer and Warner report but it is important that we get some information on what the Minister has in mind regarding safety regulations. Does the Minister envisage handing over to Bord Gais Eireann his responsibilities given under section 38 of the Act? Under that section the Minister is expected to make regulations regarding the transmission of gas and the use of gas supplied by Bord Gais. The Minister has the power to regulate all aspects of gas distribution but I understand that no regulation has been made under that section. I do not think it is enough for the Minister to refer to section 2 (1) (c) and say that it meets the problem of safety or to say that he will be giving functions in this area to Bord Gais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us his intentions about regulations in this area? I understand that the UK introduced regulations in 1972 and in 1984 that were built upon accident experience there. Those regulations cover all aspects such as the supervision of work being done, materials being used, the connection of gas underground to buildings, the replacement of pipes and so on. It is important that, since no regulations have been made to date in this area the Minister tells the House more about his plans. I tabled an amendment in regard to this because it is necessary to have explicit supervision as well as regulations. In regard to the amendment tabled by Deputy Pat O'Malley it is <Col N="3473" /> important that the Minister gives the House an indication whether he intends by regulation or otherwise to deal with the issues raised in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of points in response to the Minister's comments. The Minister adverted to the fact that the building regulations were to be introduced by the Minister for the Environment. The Minister will recall that on Second Stage yesterday I asked why it was necessary to delay enacting the building regulations pending the report of the task force established following the publication of the Cremer and Warner report. It is II years since building regulations were put together but they have not been enacted. I accept that this is not the responsibility of the Minister but I am curious about it because there is a great need to introduce those regulations immediately. We are all aware that the tragedy in Reglan House was exacerbated by the fact that the building had design features that facilitated what is known as progressive collapse. The building regulations that are to be brought in will, I assume, cater for that problem and ensure that no buildings will be built with those design features. That is something that should happen now and should not have to await the report that is to come from the task force.</P>
      <P>I referred yesterday to the whole question of the accumulation of gas in voids and buildings. The question as to why this gas is leaking in the first place has to be addressed. There is great public concern about the fact that there are so many gas leaks from the pipe network in the city of Dublin and I presume other networks. These old systems distributed town gas which was a more moist, heavy gas than the natural gas. I have asked on a number of occasions whether the change-over to natural gas is giving rise to a greater number of leaks than was the case when town gas was being distributed in the pipes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister informed me some time ago, in reply to a Dáil question, that he expected the report from the Dutch <Col N="3474" /> consultancy company who were carrying out an investigation into the long-term repairs and replacements required in the existing network to be available in June. I wonder if he has it now. I know the public are anxiously awaiting the report to confirm that there are no inherent dangers in the system as a result of the change-over to natural gas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would need notice of that question. On the question raised by Deputy Brady about the use of gas detectors by the public, may I quote from the Main Report on the investigation of the Explosion at Raglan House, Ballsbridge, Dublin - I January 1987. Paragraph 9.7.2 of that report reads:</P>
      <P>There are an increasing number of fixed flammable gas detectors available to the public. CWL would caution against the use of low price instruments as spurious alarms may result from changes in humidity and carbon dioxide. However, more importantly, all gas detectors require regular servicing and calibration. Improperly maintained instruments can lead to a false sense of security.</P>
      <P>The best detector is the 'human nose' and therefore increased awareness and prompt reporting of suspected gas escapes is what CWL would favour. However, there may be special circumstances when a good detector may be worth the investment.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of safety is concerned let me read again this Cremer and Warner report as it relates to Raglan House, because Raglan House has been mentioned by practically everybody who spoke on this amendment. Let me read the recommendation specific to the development of Ballsbridge Court. Paragraph 12.2. Reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action should be taken to minimise foreseeable causes of accidental <Col N="3475" /> damage.  Such measures should include, but not be restricted to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;disconnection of piped gas supplies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;prohibition of LPG cylinders or appliances, or solvents, petrol, etc. in significant quantities:</P>
    <P>&mdash;effecting the seal between the ground and building, and ventilating the voids under the ground floors, or the elimination of the voids.</P>
    <P>&mdash;sealing of all holes through walls and floors, and ensuring that fire breaks are in place.</P>
    <P>Only when these measures are complete can a conscious decision be made as to whether, or not, the gas can be reconnected. It is unlikely that this building can be modified in an economic manner to prevent disproportionate and progressive collapse.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment, if accepted, would be that Bord Gáis, a public utility, would be responsible for going in and ventilating the voids under the ground floors of this building. In this complex two people died as a result of a tragedy. I believe it is the responsibility and should be the responsibility of the developer to do that and not the responsibility of a public utility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We totally agree but he has no legal responsibility to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to access to buildings generally. Deputy McDowell was concerned that there was not enough power in the Bill for Bord Gais to take action in examining premises and so on. The very next subsection, 2 (2) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of this section, an order under that subsection may confer on the Board, and members of the staff of the Board duly authorised by the Board in that behalf, power to enter and inspect any premises and there to take such measures as they consider appropriate (including the evacuation of persons <Col N="3476" /> found on those premises) for the purpose of ensuring that. in the performance by the Board of the functions conferred on it under paragraph (a) and (b) of the said subsection (1), the safety of the public and property is, as far as is practicable, secured.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy it is my intention to see that these regulations will be followed in the spirit and the letter. Deputy McDowell mentioned that the old Gas Acts were written in Victorian language. In this Bill we are taking unto ourselves the powers in all of the old Gas Acts. The intention is to rewrite the regulations in modern language and give modern instructions.</P>
    <P>I find the idea of imposing an obligation on the board which is the taxpayer, the Irish State, to bear the cost of carrying out changes to a building and compensating the owner difficult to accept. I cannot accept that the taxpayer should be responsible for making these improvements to buildings for people who should do their own work. Bord Gais can carry out works in their own pipeline but should not have any responsibility for buildings, especially buildings which are not supplied with gas. This amendment is asking us to accept that Bord Gais should be saddled with responsibility for carrying out alterations generally and that is not something I am prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton made points on safety regulations. The regulations made will cover the subject mentioned by him. There have been no regulations made so far but there are standards, and they have been published, on many areas of the operations of gas. I can make a list of them available to the Deputy. There is no difficulty with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>These standards are under the control of the Gas Technical Standards Committee of the IIRS. The committee are working on updating them with a new set of standards and they will be promulgated <Col N="3477" /> by September. They will deal with the installation of service pipes and safety aspects. By September they will available. I cannot accept the idea in this amendment that Bord Gais should pick up the bill for ventilating roads etc. for any owner whose property happens to be near a gas main, even if he does not have gas. I cannot accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in giving public money to any private person, nor is Deputy O'Malley. We tabled this amendment for the following reason. If the Minister or somebody else owned a large bonded warehouse with cavernous cellars and An Bord Gais decided to put a pipeline in the street, the engineers might advise him that if the pipes fractured and the gas went into the cellar there could be an explosion which would destroy a block of the city and they could say that work must be carried out to ventilate the cellar, to strengthen the walls and make them impermeable. I cannot see why the poor landowner should be made liable for changing his cellar because an Bord Gais decided to put the mains outside this warehouse. I cannot see why the cost of making his cellar safe should be transferred to him because An Bord Gais decided in their wisdom to lay a mains outside his warehouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We struck a very careful balance in this amendment. In ordinary cases where there is no fault on the part of the landowner, if An Bord Gais put down these pipelines they should have to bear the cost of making the adjoining premises safe, but where there is default in terms of planning permission, reasonable user or unlawful user of a premises - in other words, if, for instance, in the Holland Lansdowne case it transpired that those voids should never have been there and that they were a breach of planning permission, which is questionable I believe - then it should be the landowner's liability to fill them in. We have carefully balanced this amendment to take account of the innocent landowners' interest as well as the culpable landowners' interest and to allow a court to decide. I can fully <Col N="3478" /> accept the Minister's reluctance to burden An Bord Gais with extra expenditure in the interests of private landowners, but I cannot see how any sense of justice could permit a situation in which An Bord Gais could insist that a landowner who had no interest in the gas supply should carry out works on his land and at his own expense because they decided to lay a mains near his property.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, in my view eminently just and I ask the Minister to accept the principle of it. It is not a zany idea. It is trying to do justice between two legitimate interests, the interests of the public to have a gas supply and the interests of landowners not to be the proprietors of what could turn out to be time bombs.</P>
    <P>The Gas Act was brought in in 1976 and section 38 provided for the making of regulations by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and An Bord Gais. It is amazing that II years and many deaths later there has not been a single regulation provided. There are powers under the Civil Liability Act which make the local authority responsible for repairing roads. There are court decisions to the effect that an empowering section of this kind may be mandatory and that at some stage one may end up with a very substantial bill for failing to carry out what I consider to be a duty and to make safety regulations. I do not believe it is merely a power; it is a duty. Our amendment attempts to strike a balance of fairness and I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that we have departed from a fair stance. I ask him to accept the principles we are laying down and to accept that section 2(1) and (2) would not give the board the powers we say are very necessary to obviate this kind of danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When talking about the lack of regulation under the 1976 Act, the Minister referred to standards which are in force. To my knowledge these standards do not cover the precise sort of defects we experienced in the Raglan House case. They are much more limited in their intent. They may deal with items <Col N="3479" /> such as materials but they do not deal with the broader issues of management, supervision, replacement of pipes, connections and so on. He is talking about a much narrower area and I do not think it meets the needs here.</P>
      <P>On this amendment, I would like clarification as the to the meaning of &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; and &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; in subsection (5). It appears the Minister is right in saying that this amendment, as it stands, would be putting a burden on An Bord Gáis to put in order a building which was being supplied with gas if the board felt work was needed and was reasonably necessary. The only case where the board would not bear such a cost would be if the owner of the building had acted unlawfully or unreasonably. The Minister may be pointing to defects, that there would be many cases where the kitting out of say, the Ballsbridge complex would be adequate to receive supplies but I do not believe it would be right for the cost of that kitting out to fall on An Bord Gais. This amendment seems to be defective because while it gives the board the right to discontinue the supply of gas it also says An Bord Gais should specify the works needed and bear the cost. I am looking for clarification on that point.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the product on sale today is as safe as the previous product, referred to as town gas? Is he satisfied that the present piping can cope with the new gas, or is it having a continuing corrosive effect which is causing a breakdown in the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the relevance of the regulations, I will make available to Deputy Bruton two standards - IS 265 and ICP 3 - both of which were mentioned in the Cremer and Warner Report.  They are comprehensive. I will let the Deputy have copies for his information after the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety powers I am taking in this Bill are comprehensive and are expressed in the widest terms. I fully appreciate <Col N="3480" /> and recognise the concern expressed by Deputies on all sides about safety, and that is what I am trying to achieve. Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons I gave earlier. I accept what the Deputies are trying to achieve, but I can assure them that the powers I am taking will be firmly exercised by me. I do not want to saddle An Bord Gáis Éireann with the immeasurable and astronomical costs which this amendment would impose. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to pipe laying Bord Gais operate in the same way as any other gas utility throughout Europe or elsewhere. They must build and route their pipelines to the appropriate standards. I will continue to monitor this aspect regularly and no doubt future Ministers will act in the same way.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Gerard Brady, I am perfectly satisfied that the product is safe. Under the new management, which will be in place when this legislation is passed, there will be an increase in the usage of gas by residential, commercial and industrial consumers in the Dublin area. It also has major advantages from an environmental point of view. I am well aware of Deputy Brady's commitment to a clean environment and natural gas has major benefits as far as cleanliness is concerned.</P>
    <P>As the report by Cremer and Warner stated, there is a need for small bore pipes to be installed in high rise buildings and work has been done in this regard without waiting for a report from the new officals who have been put into Dublin Gas in advance of the legislation being passed. If replacements and improvements are required they will be undertaken as soon as possible. The old piping was laid at a time when safety standards were not as stringent as those now in operation and when there was not such a high level of traffic. Consequently, continuous renewal is required and I assure the House that this will be carried out. In the Bill we have increased the borrowing power of Bord Gais far in excess of what is required for a mere takeover of the bank's liabilities and for stamp duty. <Col N="3481" /> There is flexibility so that funding will be available for the necessary improvements to be crried out.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the good faith of the Deputies on the far side of the House and that they are trying to achieve the safest possible buildings in which people will live and work. However, I cannot agree to the imposition of a charge on BGE which the acceptance of their amendment would entail. I assure them that the primary aim in finishing the receivership, the takeover by Bord Gais and the drafting of this Bill is the safety of the population of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A question was asked regarding potholes. Of course it is disgraceful that many of them have been there far longer than they should have been. At one stage there were 3,000 potholes but the figure is now about 200. I encourage people to report a smell of gas or if they are concerned in any way about safety. It is better to have a traffic delay and safety than a tragedy and a clear flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>No Minister could give blanket guarantees that gas is totally safe because, by its very nature, it is highly inflammable and accidents can happen. However, as far as is humanly possible, we are trying to ensure the safety of the people of Dublin in regard to gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>On account of the lightness of this gas it has a lower temperature ignition flashpoint so it is very difficult to detect. It does not have the same aroma as older gas. Could the Minister say whether this product is more corrosive on the piping system in comparison to the old gas? This is of critical importance to people who have experienced explosions because they are worried that if piping is replaced, there will be corrosion on older existing piping at the new joints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened patiently to the arguments for over an hour. I am inclined to agree with the Minister that the builders should be responsbile for ensuring that cavities under their buildings are not susceptible to gas leaks in the piping which has been in the vicinity for many years or put in <Col N="3482" /> after the building is completed. It is up to us to make sure that the legislation forces them to comply with building regulations in that regard. A public utility should not be expected to take responsibility for that. I am glad that the number of holes has been reduced in Dublin but I appeal to the Minister not to call them potholes because many of them are caverns and if a car went into one it would hardly be noticed. I should like the Minister to assure us that BGE are replacing old piping. I am sure they are operating to some plan; it would be unbelievable if they were not.</P>
      <P>Why is there no problem in regard to natural gas in Cork? Perhaps there is and they are keeping it quiet. Is piping the only serious safety problem? I understand that Cork have replaced all their piping which was probably not as old as Dublin piping. Do they have any problem now in regard to corrosion or leakage? My information is that they successfully inserted a smaller bore piping, it may be plastic, and that it is not subject to corrosion. This is all technical stuff to me and I only know what people tell me and what I read in the newspapers. It would be important, if the Minister had any information on the Cork experience, if he would tell us and if the danger is mainly due to piping and that there is some plan to work on that, we would know where we stood on the matter.</P>

      <P>On the question of corrosion, the suitability of natural gas and whether it has a corrosive effect, in the report that I told the House I received yesterday there was reference to the fact <Col N="3483" /> that an assessment of internal examination for contamination and corrosion of the mains had been carried out in order to ascertain the suitability of the New Dublin Gas cast iron system for natural gas. This investigation revealed hardly any mains corrosion, which is the point we were getting to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of natural gas which has a lower flash point the odour is added to the gas so that it is an odorous gas. There is a process of replacement going on all the time, I can reassure Deputy Mac Giolla of that. There were some problems originally in Cork but a significant improvement has taken place under the control of one particular man. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that that man, who got the gas situation under control in Cork, is the individual whom Bord Gáis transferred up to Dublin and he has been operating in Dublin for the last number of weeks. I had asked in particular that he be sent up because of the job he was doing in Cork. He is at this stage getting the situation under control, hopefully. It is very <Col N="3484" /> dangerous, talking about the gas network, to say that anything is under control. That would be something that a very foolish or a very brave Minister would refer to and I am neither. We are doing the best we can and this is drafted so that we can, as far as is humanly possible, set down the regulations so that the use of natural gas in Dublin and Dublin Gas generally are safe for the people of Dublin. I have nothing further to add on the amendment. I find myself unable to accept it for the reasons I have outlined over the last hours debate. I can assure the Deputies concerned that I am very conscious of the safety aspects and will be doing everything in my power to make sure that the system is safe for the people of Dublin. I cannot accept the amendment with the unlimited financial implications that it has for Dublin Gas.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 10 and II, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Board shall set up a subsidiary company in which it has a 100 per cent shareholding and to which it appoints the board membership to operate the functions of the Dublin Gas Company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What I am proposing in this amendment is that the relationship between Bord Gais and Dublin Gas should be of the nature of a subsidiary relation to a holding company rather than the intention now being formulated by Bord Gáis that they would totally integrate the gas distribution task in Dublin into the overall operations of Bord Gáis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3487" /> The importance of the amendment I am proposing really stems from the past troubled history of Dublin Gas. It is not a statement of principle that it is completely wrong in all cases that distribution should be integrated with transmission but we have to be very conscious of the troubled history of Dublin Gas - a history that has been of a number of failed attempts to resolve particular problems in that company. There have been special problems in the work practices, there have been problems in the management expertise in the area of marketing and there have been problems in the financial accounting procedures which were brought to light following the appointment of the receiver. These problems are very distinct ones that will not be resolved overnight. This is an important amendment because Bord Gáis are, as presently set up, the major beneficiary of what could only be called a royalty on behalf of the Irish people from the resource of natural gas.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, Bord Gais, according to their latest accounts, those for 1985, earned £94 million on a turnover of £200 million. They have a huge cash flow to which they can tap. A real danger which successive Ministers on both sides of the House have had at the back of their minds is that if Dublin Gas become entirely integrated and linked with Bord Gais Éireann, the cash available to Bord Gais would not act as a spur to resolve the various management problems in Dublin Gas but would end up concealing those problems and the distinct marketing, personnel and financial problems would be buried under the much larger and at present very profitable body of Bord Gais Eireann.</P>
    <P>We do not have an up to date prospectus of Dublin Gas as they now stand. We do not know precisely the losses that are projected nor do we have the 1986 accounts of Bord Gais Eireann. There is considerable uncertainty as a result of this as to what precisely is going to happen to Bord Gais if Dublin Gas become wholly integrated into that company and what sorts of problems are going <Col N="3488" /> to be wholly integrated into it. What is involved in this take over is that the taxpayer, through Bord Gais, will be providing funds to subsidise losses in Dublin Gas for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the relationship should be one of a subsidiary to a holding company and under that relationship we could keep at arms length from Bord Gais the special problems that have to be tackled in Dublin Gas. It would be adequately transparent to the taxpayers that these problems were being tackled and that Dublin Gas were coming round to a position where they were capable of performing profitably as distributors of natural gas in Dublin city. It has been the case in many other capital cities that this activity has been done profitably and we want to see that happen in Dublin. The best way of ensuring this is by establishing the relationship of subsidiary to holding company under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the worries that underlie Deputy Bruton's amendment. He is concerned that a total take over, lock stock and barrel, of Bord Gais by Dublin Gas would to some extent cloud some commercial realities and perhaps transfer to Bord Gais some commercial unrealities which would be to the detriment of everyone in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I can say so parenthetically that is why Deputy O'Malley and I put down amendment No. 6 which is aimed at the same general problem but approaching it from a different angle. We assumed that the purpose of this Bill was to enable Bord Gais to acquire separately the assets of Dublin Gas and to take over the contracts and obligations, including the employment obligations of the Dublin Gas Company and that a wholly owned subsidiary would not do all this work, as proposed by Deputy Bruton, that it would be done by Bord Gais. Whichever way it is the intent of this amendment and of our amendment is roughly the same, that is, that in some sense there should be a halt put to the total transfer as a going concern of the Dublin Gas Company as they now stand to Bord <Col N="3489" /> Gais, that somehow some of the problems of that company should be rooted out at this stage and should not be integrated into a semi-State body which, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, have a monopoly function which enables them effectively to be a revenue generator for the State.  It seems unwise to combine a board who are flush with money because of their monopoly position and because they receive the proceeds of natural gas sales on behalf of the State, with a set of obligations and a set of commercial procedures and practices which are outdated and which are the subject of a good deal of industrial dispute and entrenched restrictive practices which could give rise to a waste of taxpayers' money in the future.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that we proposed that there should be a mechanism whereby the Minister would come to this House and say that the board propose to acquire, for example, the pipeline and certain assets from the Dublin Gas Company and put before this House the consideration it is intended to pay for them and justify in each case what is proposed. Likewise the employees of Dublin Gas should not be taken on board without question by Bord Gais with all their restrictive practices and their acculumated entitlements.  I would like the Minister to be in a position to have to come to the House and say: &ldquo;The labour relations package that is going to be in place from now on is going to be substantially different and it is on this basis that I am looking for the sanction of this House to employ X or Y person or X or Y 100 people or that I intend acquiring this asset or that asset of the Dublin Gas Company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a difference of philosophy between the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Bruton in that we are taking the Minister's Bill at face value &mdash; that he is in the business of acquiring assets and taking over contractual obligations and that Bord Gáis will do that themselves.  We want to put in safeguards to stop that from infecting the new body with all the problems the old one had. Deputy Bruton is saying, no, stand aside <Col N="3490" /> from the Dublin Gas Company to some extent, maintain it as a subsidiary and in that sense effectively keep the revenues of Bord Gáis at one remove from the bottomless hole which the Dublin Gas Company proved to be in years gone by. Both of those proposals are aimed at the same thing which is efficiency and accountability.  They stem from a sense of great unease that the Dublin Gas Company is beset with problems.  I accept that the receiver, Mr. Somers did his best to overcome and to tackle those problems. I am not satisfied and I do not think the public at large are satisfied either that Dublin Gas and their assets are being taken over on the correct terms.  That is the all important thing.  What are the terms of take over, whether it be as a separate subsidiary, as Deputy Bruton suggests, or merely a set of obligations and assets as the Minister seems to be contemplating?  If it is not clearly understood that every single aspect of the Dublin Gas Company is vetted for efficiency, that every single employee role is vetted in terms of necessity, that every single asset is evaluated as to its effectiveness in terms of being an asset of Bord Gáis, that every showroom and every single item of stock and equipment is the subject of a vetting process, this House stands in danger of sanctioning the purchasing of a series of obligations and liabilities of various kinds including employment contracts and employment practices which would be hard to justify in some respects.  This House stands in danger of taking them all on board and giving them to probably the greatest softy of a parent company, one which is flush with these gas revenues.  That is our deep seated objection to what is going on: there does not seem to be any sense in which the actual terms of the operation of Dublin Gas will thereafter be subject to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's amendments &mdash; this one and the next &mdash; are aimed towards making it quite clear that there is to be accountability in the manner in which Dublin Gas is run.  We are deeply concerned, and his amendment is to this effect, that all these unacceptable labour <Col N="3491" /> practices, all the waste, all the inefficiencies, will be taken on board and will be impossible to eradicate once taken on board.  I presume the Minister will not accept the amendment but when replying I should like him to state what are the terms of the take over.  What are the guarantees of efficiency?  Who is going to make all these decisions?  Who is going to learn from the mistakes of the past? What guarantee has this House that we are not taking on board a series of restrictive practices, a series of over-valued or useless assets or the like.  What guarantee have we that we are getting value for money? That is our concern and we want an assurance from the Minister that we will be in a position to criticise and to evaluate whether the consumer is getting good value for money if this deal goes through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the need for transparency in relation to the activities of Dublin Gas.  Amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Bruton covers some of these fears.  It proposes that separate accounts should be published for Dublin Gas and that the transparency question would be covered by that aspect of the separate accounts.  He is anxious to see that the true cost of gas distribution in Dublin is clear.  I am in general agreement with that.  I see no problem in regard to separate accounts for operations in Dublin especially in view of the BGE's role in collecting the economic rent &mdash; or whatever way one would like to describe it, from Kinsale Gas.  The consultancy report which was carried out in advance of this take over of Dublin Gas looked at this question, dealt explicitly with this point and recommended strongly in favour of transparency.  It recommended also that there be separate accounts for BGE and the Dublin distribution activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 of the 1976 Act already allows me to specify the contents of the accounts of Bord Gáis Éireann.  I am happy to be able to assure the House that not only will separate accounts of the Dublin operations be kept internally <Col N="3492" /> by BGE but that they will also be shown in the boards future annual reports.  This will cover many of the fears Members have in relation to Dublin Gas being a possible drag on the operations of Bord Gáis.  There will be separate accounts. They will be shown in the published accounts of Bord Gáis and they will separate from Dublin.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question as to whether it should be a subsidiary or whether there should have been a general integration, this is a matter which was looked at not just by myself but also by the previous Government.  They had a report carried out on it and took the view that integration was the appropriate method of nationalisation.  They took that view, among others of maintaining safety and standards and they specifically decided against a separate subsidiary company.  I agree fully with their decision.  I have confirmed it myself in my approach to it.  I am satisfied that the creation of a subsidiary does not automatically supply an answer to the very reasonable concerns which Deputy Bruton mentioned today and which he mentioned also in his Second Stage contribution when he referred to better management of the distribution operation with particular regard to safety.  He said that consumers would benefit from friction and competition between BGE and their Dublin subsidiary and he referred to the question of transparency.</P>
    <P>There were general questions about which the previous Government were concerned.  Those were questions asked by Deputy Bruton and which I asked when I took up the job.  Regarding the question of friction the difficulty in the past was that there was too much evidence of friction between Dublin Gas and BGE before the receiver was appointed. I am sure the Deputy would agree that that was not helpful and would not be helpful in the future.  One of the primary objectives is to ensure that there is no opportunity for a repeat of that performance. I believe that the correct approach is the one I am taking here which was the approach taken by the previous Government and endorsed <Col N="3493" /> by the consultants who were brought in to advise on this matter.  The integrated gas utility which is being proposed for the nation is the right way forward.</P>
    <P>The question of the management structure was looked at in the report.  The management structure is being taken on board by BGE.  There will be a separate regional structure within BGE dealing with Dublin Gas.  It will be an eastern regional approach and they will have their own assistant chief executive dealing with it.  They will have their own financial and marketing people.  The Dublin operation will be tight with its own sets of accounts which will be published in the annual report.  I will insist that they show separately the accounts for the Dublin operation; just as the ESB operate the electricity network around the country, Bord Gáis will be operating the gas network.  The utility of the gas rather than merely its transmission will in future be the responsibility of Bord Gáis.  I am satisfied that with the management changes which are to take place both in Dublin Gas and BGE and with the extension of the board and the strengthening of the whole operation we will have an effective safe utility not just in Dublin but nationally.  In relation to the guarantees I am giving to the House concerning the accounts of BGE as they relate to Dublin Gas, we will have this transparency which everybody is anxious for.  The right approach is the one I have taken.  This is the approach that was decided on by my predecessor and which was confirmed by the consultants who advised on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am glad the Minister accepts the approach of amendment No. 3.  However, I would like to tease out further precisely what he has in mind regarding the relationship between Dublin Gas and BGE.  I would prefer the idea of a holding company and a subsidiary company.  I ask the Minister precisely what sort of relationship is envisaged?  I understand that BGE would envisage taking on as head office functions certain elements of the operation of Dublin Gas.  While the Minister may be <Col N="3494" /> able to provide us with accounts they would be accounts of the production and distribution aspects.  An Bord Gáis would find themselves managing the marketing and personnel areas.  Despite the Minister's assurances of transparency we would find on the management side a rather curious cross-cutting relationship between the two companies, which I do not think would be to the service of either company.  Even to make the accounts accurate would involve An Bord Gáis allocating costs on some basis which we do not know to the Dublin Gas operation. That would have the potential for clouding the transparency the Minister sees as desirable.</P>
      <P>I fear also that the relationship in terms of the price contract between BGE and Dublin Gas could be dubious under the sort of relationship the Minister envisages. There is a very genuine concern that there are others trying to compete in the supply of energy to the Dublin market.  Some of them are receiving supplies of gas from BGE, and there would be the rather curious situation that the price contracts that BGE have with the Dublin Gas operation would be at arms' length and open to scrutiny in the way that the price contract to the ESB would be.  If we do not have a type of subsidiary to parent relationship there might be some question mark about the fairness of competition between the ESB and Dublin Gas who are competing for consumers in the Dublin market.  It would mean artifically that taxpayers' money or as the Minister calls it, the economic rent that BGE have at their disposal was being diverted into unfair competition on the Dublin market for the Dublin Gas activity compared to the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain in a bit more detail the sort of management structure that would be involved between Dublin and the wider BGE activity and to what extent there would be stand-alone activities in BGE, and how overheads that BGE decided to take on and carry on behalf of the Dublin Gas operation would be allocated as costs to the Dublin Gas operation.  At the end of the day my objective is the same as that of <Col N="3495" /> the Minister, to ensure transparency and also that the very real problems we all know about in the management of Dublin Gas are not buried and subsumed into the management functions of BGE, which to date have been very effective as far as we know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that comprehensive accounts will be prepared. They will not only cover the question of distribution but will be fully comprehensive and will be a separate section of the overall annual accounts of BGE.  They will be separate accounts for Dublin.  All of these points have been gone into in great detail in the Touche Ross report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how the Deputy's amendment to have a subsidiary or otherwise would change any of his fears &mdash; let me say groundless fears &mdash; on this question of the price contract and the relationship between the BGE pricing and what is being charged in Dublin.  The amendment will not satisfy that.  Dublin Gas will be part of an integrated gas utility from now on.  It will be a region within Bord Gáis Éireann. Roughly the organisational structure will be a chief executive at national level, a director of transmission and engineering, a director of distribution in the Dublin region and the same in the southern region, a director of marketing and sales, and a director of finances and administration.  In the Dublin region there will be the grade of assistant chief executive officer and there will be services such as residential and commercial sales, small industrial sales, appliance sales, local marketing and advertising, meter reading, customer services, distribution engineering, distribution system operations, maintenance, national meter control, national management accounting, stores, stock control, recruitment, industrial relations, personnel and training.  All of these functions will come under the control of the director in the Dublin region. This is in line with the Touche Ross report which the previous Government called for.  All of the detail of the integration <Col N="3496" /> has been studied very carefully.  I assure the Deputy and the House it will be implemented for the economic and safety benefit of the gas users in Dublin, for the people of Dublin and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view my proposed amendment of a subsidiary would deal with the question of the price contracts, but I have taken the precaution of including also in amendment No. 3 that details of the contract would be a required part of the accounts the board would publish in relation to Dublin Gas. If that were the case, Dublin Gas would have a similar relationship as the ESB, where the price the ESB pay is published in the annual reports of BGE.  It is only right that the same situation should prevail and that a genuine price would be charged to Dublin Gas rather than a transfer price whereby in some other across-the-counter or under the table deal an unfair competition relationship would be set up.  I would like to hear the Minister elaborate on how he sees the central marketing, sales and financial functions which he says BGE will take on in the integrated utility as being consistent with showing the Dublin Gas operation as a transparent operation? Does that not leave the BGE operation capable of taking on board many of the overheads that should rightfully be attributed to Dublin Gas, in that way clouding the transparency the Minister is trying to achieve? Is there not a risk in these centralised overheads he envisages that we will not have the result we seek here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the transparency and the cost of the Dublin Gas operation, normal accounting procedures are involved and it would be but proper apportionment of the cost of central services due to Dublin Gas.  It is not unique to Dublin Gas; it goes on all over as far as price is concerned.  There is no suggestion of &ldquo;under the counter&rdquo;. Economic rent, as has been described, and all other things in regard to pricing can be assessed by looking at the detailed accounts which are published and which <Col N="3497" /> will be published in future.  There is and will be nothing hidden.  We want an operation that is efficient, that runs an efficient gas utility, that expands to be much more economical and is seen to be run in a way that attracts the confidence of the poeple of Dublin so that they will switch to using natural gas.  With the type of approach we have in mind and are striving for in this legislation and with this integration it is in our interests to have everything up front and that is what we will be striving for.  There is no question of trying to hide anything and nothing will be hidden.</P>

      <P>I am at a disadvantage in that I have not seen the Touche Ross report to which the Minister referred.  In logic it would seem that the most sensible relationship for an operation like this would be one of a holding company to a subsidiary.  However, I accept that the Minister has sought and obtained advice on this issue and that he is acting in the best interests, having got the best advice. I do not intend to press this amendment, on the understanding that the Minister is accepting the third amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Board shall publish each year separate audited accounts of the Dublin Gas Company operation showing the full financial position of the company, including details of the contract for purchase of gas and the tariffs for sale of gas to customers.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially we have discussed the import of this amendment.  It is accepting that <Col N="3498" /> the Minister is not going to set up the relationship of a holding company to a subsidiary which is the most normal arm's length type of relationship which gives a very clear account of what the Dublin Gas operation would be.  Therefore, I am pushing the alternative amendment forward which is more minimalist, that BGE be required to publish each year separate audited accounts of the Dublin Gas Company showing the full financial position of the company.  We should have access to the contract price that BGE are charging out to Dublin Gas and any other details of contractual relationships such as rebates, price and so on involved.  We should have access to the tariffs for sale that the Dublin Gas operation is charging out to both consumers and industrial users.  We should have access to the different costs and the numbers employed, the various types of costs allocated into different areas, marketing costs and so on.  In other words, the intention is that the Dáil through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies would have available to it all the information needed to enable it to make a realistic assessment of whether Dublin Gas under the umbrealla of BGE was performing in the way it was intended and that there would be no danger that the poor practices that have existed in Dublin Gas would be transferred.  Therfore, it is important that we get the fullest information possible and that it includes very clear notes to describe how costs that have been taken on by BGE that relate to Dublin Gas are to be charged out in the financial report for Dublin Gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I agree with the need for separate accounts for Dublin Gas and I am going to ensure that they are there.  I ask Deputy Bruton to go along with me so that I can accept his amendment.  Will he agree to a minor alteration in it, if this is agreeable to the House? With that alteration the amendment would read: &ldquo;The Board shall publish each year separate audited accounts of the Dublin Gas Company operation showing the full financial position of the <Col N="3499" /> company, including details of the contract for purchase of gas and a general description of the tariffs for sale of gas to customers.&rdquo; There will be customers and individual contracts will be separate.  In normal, good commercial practice it would not be advisable that all details of commercial decisions would be released. If the Deputy can accept that and if it is not going to delay the Bill I will accept it with that alteration.  However, I need guidance from the Chair on this.</P>

      <P>4. In page 3, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) An order under subsection (1) may set conditions under which excavations, arising from the provision, maintenance, repair and replacement of pipelines, may be carried out generally or in any specific area, including any of the following matters:</P>
      <P>(a) the period of the day or week during which any such work may be carried out,</P>
      <P>(b) a time limit for the completion of any such work,</P>
      <P>(c) a time limit for the handing back of any excavated area to the relevant local authority,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) penalties for failure to comply <Col N="3500" /> with an order made under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was put down to endeavour in some way to control the gay abandon with which the Dublin Gas Company have been carrying out maintenance, repairs, excavations etc.  This has been referred to under the earlier section.  I am aware of the defects in the amendment as put down, but I ask the Minister to accept that there is need for some control in this matter.  The defects I see in the amendment that I have put down are that it might seem to be interfering with the day-to-day running of the company and I do not want the Minister sticking his nose in on the day-to-day running of the company.  However, from the manner in which the Gas Company have been operating in the past year or two, it seems that every hole they dig is a major emergency.  There can be no control of it.  There are 3,000 emergencies at any one time.  I do not believe they are all emergencies; therefore they are using the excuses of danger, emergency and the need for safety to dig a hole any place they like any time they like, disrupt anybody, traffic or people or whatever at day or night or any time. I am asking the Minister to look at that and to achieve some control over it.</P>
    <P>A public utility should not be allowed to operate in that way but it has been accepted because the public think that every one of these excavations represents an emergency.  I do not know if the Minister has information on all the excavations that were carried out, on how many of them were emergencies or how many were ordinary maintenance or repair works.  On the understanding that they were not all emergencies, I ask the Minister to accept that there should be some directive in regard to the manner in which the planned replacement of pipelines, which has nothing to do with emergencies, repairs and maintenance are carried out.  There should be control over the place in which the work is done, over the length of time in which excavations <Col N="3501" /> may remain open and also over the completion of such work.  The problem arises when the work is carried out on the gas pipelines but when the closing of the excavation is not completed.  Therefore, there should be a time limit in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that these are matters for the local authority but the local authority have no control over public utilities and they cannot tell them that a certain job is an emergency or that it must be done at a certain time.  The local authority have to allow the Gas Company to dig up roads or footpaths whenever the public utility so demands. There should be some control over this and there should be time limits for completing excavations.  Penalties should be imposed for failure to comply with these controls.  Perhaps the control should be incorporated in the powers of local authorities. In any event, I ask the Minister to ensure that there is control over the operations of the gas company in particular. All those excavations have been a grave upset to the city of Dublin.  They have caused enormous inconvenience and enormous cost to commercial concerns, to public transportation and to individuals going to and from work.  They have caused a huge headache and huge costs to the local authorities.  This problem will continue because when the excavation is completed the street, roadway or pathway is still in a totally unsatisfactory condition, the local authority, while they can never put it back to its original state, must endeavour to rectify it as much as possible.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I am asking for control over the gas company in the manner in which they carry out excavations. There can be exceptions for cases which are proven to be emergencies but in all other cases there must be control over the time of the day or night at which the work is carried out.  If work is to be carried out in a quiet suburban area it could be done during the day but in a busy area with a lot of traffic the work could be done at night.  There must be controls such as this over planned excavations for the replacement and maintenance of pipelines.</P>

      <P>On a small technical point, Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment states: &ldquo;In page 3, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following new section&rdquo;.  We are deleting &ldquo;new section&rdquo; because it is not a new section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the points covered in the amendment put down by Deputy Mac Giolla and the other Workers' Party Deputies.  On occasion one could be forgiven for thinking that the streets of Dublin were building sites; there are so many excavations going on at the one time.  Unfortunately, most of them, in the recent past anyway, have been attributable to the operations of Dublin Gas.  I accept also as does Deputy Mac Giolla, that it may not be possible to superimpose the controls on the operation of Dublin Gas to the extent he would like to do.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it would be putting constraints on them that would prevent them from carrying out necessary works and make it very difficult for them to function. I do not know whether, in routine maintenance works, it might be possible to get Dublin Gas to excavate roads at a less busy time.  As Deputy Mac Giolla has suggested, they might be able to plan their work on the basis that a certain amount of the work could be done at night.</P>
      <P>The other point that is a source of great nuisance is the partially completed excavations after the work has been completed. The trenches are back-filled and are left in that state for some considerable time.  I can accept there is a reason for this and that one has to allow for primary settlement before the local authority can finally reinstate the trench.  That problem will be very difficult to overcome because there will be subsidence and it will be some time before there is consolidation and the local authority can properly reinstate the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw one point to the Minister's attention and perhaps he can make an input to it.  If there was greater co-ordination between the various public utility services that, on occasion, have <Col N="3503" /> to excavate the streets it would be very beneficial all round.  On some occasions we have seen the ridiculous situation where one utility had completed their operations and the street had been reinstated by the local authority but where, within a very short period, another utility come along and rip it up again.  The whole process seems to go on <i>ad infinitum.</i> Certain portions of Merrion Square have been in a state of siege for years.  The number of road openings in that area have been quite legendary.</P>
    <P>One is required to get a road opening licence from the local authority before one can get permission to open an excavation in a road.  I am not sure if this applies to the various utilities.  Perhaps the local authorities should exercise some kind of umbrella control over the opening of excavations in public roadways by ensuring that if they issue a road opening licence to one utility they should at least draw the attention of other utilities such as Bord Telecom, the ESB, the water works or whoever to it.  If they have some investigatory work or repair work to carry out in that area it would be appropriate that they would do so at the same time so that the reinstatement and road surfacing could be completed with less risk of the work having to be done again within a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the points expressed by Deputies Mac Giolla and Pat O'Malley in regard to this question. In my view it should be left to the Dublin Transport Authority.  I had thought that the DTA had some sort of authority to plan and regulate the exercise of excavations.  If they do not we should look at that legislation and consider giving them the authority suggested by Deputy Mac Giolla.  That reflects a defect in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Bruton has said.  It seems to me that properly we should not approach this on the basis of this being a gas opening because next week we could find ESB cables disintegrating and resulting in a <Col N="3504" /> similar debate on the ESB.  The next day we could have a similar debate on Dublin Corporation.  In my view it is a general matter that does not come within the ambit of the Bill.  The Minister, who has close experience with the workings of the Department of the Environment, is aware of the issues involved.  Every time an excavation is opened at, for example, O'Connell Bridge where such work is in progress at present, a cost should be paid to the community for keeping it open for three days rather than two days.  That payment should be sought to ensure that wherever possible the work is done at night and that it is covered with metal plates during the day to make it passable because the cost to the community of snarling up all the traffic in the centre of Dublin is not borne in on the utility doing the excavation.  I am not in favour of some massive layer of bureaucracy being imposed on what are on occasions emergency activities but it strikes me that the Dublin Transport Authority or a local authority should be entitled to charge money to a utility who has statutory power of excavation in order to encourage that utility to dig holes at the right time and carry out the work as quickly as possible.  Effectively, I am suggesting that they be charged a differential rent based on the fact that they are digging at a busy place and are not doing so at night time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sorely pressed utility will not pay people overtime to work at night unless the external cost to the community is in some way borne in on that authority by their having to pay some contribution or charge for having to do the work during the day rather than at night.  The Minister should look to his colleague, Deputy Flynn, and ask him to ensure that there is no question of the gas company digging holes in the way they are doing at present. There is one at the corner of Bride Street that has remained open for at least three weeks with no activity around it and a few desultory cones falling into the excavation. Nobody should be allowed do that on a busy thoroughfare without paying back to the community the cost of the disruption they are causing.  The liability <Col N="3505" /> to re-instate holes dug by utilities is in dire need of legislative reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he is discussing this matter with the Minister for the Environment, should bear in mind that when the main gas pipeline was laid it was done in a very skilled way by highly specialised people.  They carried out the reinstatement themselves and they did a fantastic job throughout south Dublin. The work was done almost in military style and that had the effect of minimising the disruption to the community.  I wonder why that expertise, which was brought about by employing independent contractors who were paid bonuses to get the work finished on time, is not available now to make sure that this necessary work is carried out with the minimum of inconvenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to have strayed rather dramatically from the debate on emergency excavations undertaken by Dublin Gas around Dublin.  We have strayed into debating the need for a co-ordinated operation by all utilities. We are debating when they should open certain roads, do certain jobs, when Bord Telecom, the ESB, the gas company, the water mains or sanitary services sections of Dublin Corporation carry out work. That is far removed from the terms of the amendment before us.  I do not see any reason why there should not be greater co-ordination in regard to general maintenance work.  I accept that every Dubliner, and those who visit the city, are most frustrated by the amount of excavation work that has taken place.  There were up to 3,000 holes open soon after the Raglan House incident but that figure has been reduced to 200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety is my primary concern when dealing with the problem of excavations within the Dublin region.  I do not go along with the amendment proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla because it appears that it is prompted by a concern for inconvenience caused by the diggings.  I accept that as a legitimate point but the gas utility must be conscious of the need for safety and the need to carry out maintenance and repair work.  To meet the <Col N="3506" /> point made by the Deputy, and other Members.  I will insist that proper work practices be specified by Bord Gáis Eireann to their work teams and contractors in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that excavations are carried out when leaks are found.  The crews do not go along and dig a hole until they have found the leak. The leaks are classified according to the seriousness of them and work is carried out accordingly.  The operation is not as haphazard as it may appear.  Some repairs have to be left open for a period of up to seven days for further checks.  That causes inconvenience and frustration, as mentioned by Members.  Deputies Pat O'Malley and McDowell raised the question of reinstatement and said that after holes are filled there is the primary settlement. The position is that Dublin Corporation insist on carrying out the reinstatement work and I wonder if that is the way it should be.  I hope those holes are filled as soon as it is safe to do so.  I am not saying that there are not cases where they should be closed sooner, such as in Bride Street.  I will have that matter investigated for Deputy McDowell.  Perhaps he and I will go along and see the work carried out.  I will have that particular one investigated for him.</P>
    <P>I am as concerned as anybody else about the inconvenience caused not just to our own population but to our tourists at a time when we are making every effort to develop our tourist industry.  However, the primary concern has to be safety. Deputy Mac Giolla made the point that they are not all emergencies but the fact is that when reports come in they all have to be dealt with as if they are emergencies. People have to go out and if there is a leak they have to dig and investigate it.  The case where they do not go and investigate is the very case where there will be a tragedy; therefore, they are all dealt with as a priority.  I can assure the Deputy that with the passage of this Bill and the integrated gas network we will have, I will see to it that particular work practices are specified to improve the situation for the benefit of the people of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke about the gay abandon with which the gas company open holes in the roads and streets I did not speak lightly.  Up to a few years ago Dublin Corporation had control over openings in the roads.  If they were repairing a road they advised all public utilities that if they wanted to do anything with that road that was the time to do it.  If the ESB wanted to open a section of road they would apply to the corporation and inform them.  The corporation would immediately contact Telecom Éireann and the gas company and say that if they wanted to do anything there now was their opportunity.  The same thing happened if Telecom Eireann wanted to carry out work.  That was working quite well under the old gas system. When the old gas company wanted to open a road they would advise the corporation. However, the corporation have not been told one thing about any of those 3,000 holes in the city of Dublin. They do not know where and when the next hole will appear until they go around and find it themselves.  They are going around counting the holes.  They are not informed about them, there is no control. There must still be some normal maintenance and excavation work by the gas company despite all this crisis of leaks. There must be the normal work of putting in new pipes or putting gas into a new area and so on.  I am very glad to hear what the Minister had to say about work practices to be laid down.  Presumably the Minister will see that they are laid down and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that these will include informing the corporation and that there will be some control over the normal excavations.  As regards the reinstatement, Dublin Corporation do that work.  They do the job properly. They do not want a half-baked job done. However, they cannot do the reinstatement until the matter is handed back and that is point C, the handing back of the excavated area to the local authority. They can put in the back filling and it may <Col N="3508" /> be only temporary.  They can say they want that held there because they will be reopening it in two or three weeks.  An area can be left for months and the corporation are not told it can be reinstated. When the local authority reinstate it they charge the public utility the cost of the reinstatement and that is as it should be. However, they cannot do that until the area is handed back to them.  There should be a time limit on that.  Public utilities are inclined to leave it because as soon as the corporation do the reinstatement they bill them so they put it off, even for a couple of months, before informing the local authority that they have finished the work.  That matter has to be incorporated in the work practices area.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell's point that if you do not make it expensive for the gas company to open up O'Connell Bridge in the middle of a Friday, the busiest day of the week, they will do it then, rather than at night because from the point of view of labour and so on it is more expensive to operate at night.  I recongise there are difficulties as regards penalties but there must be penalties laid down in order to have the appropriate control.  I am sure the Minister understands the position and I think this sort of thing can be referred to the work practices to which he has referred.  I hope he will take it on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  In particular I will examine the situation in relation to notification and liaison between the gas company and the corporation. The Deputy will understand that when these holes are dug it is in response to an emergency report of a gas leak.  I will try to ensure with the new management that there will be greater liaison between themselves and the corporation. As far as normal maintenance is concerned, I agree fully with the Deputy that there should be prior notification to the corporation.  That does not just go for the gas company: that goes for everybody.  As far as possible I will try to ensure that the work is completed as soon as possible so that as little inconvenience <Col N="3509" /> as possible is caused to citizens and to visitors to the city, with the one proviso that safety is the overriding principle.</P>

      <P>Before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  &mdash;(1)  The Minister shall make arrangements for his Department or designated persons or bodies to act in a supervisory capacity in respect of the safety functions exercised by Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the House that we have touched on the spirit of this if not the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have touched on the spirit of this but we were very constrained by the narrow import of amendment No. 1 which we discussed at that time.  This gets to the nub of the safety issue.  The lesson from the Raglan House experience was that, in the commercial environment in which Dublin Gas operated, and will operate in the future, you cannot put responsibility for policing safety in the hands of the people who <Col N="3510" /> have the responsibility of earning a commercial profit.  We have seen, sadly, how easy it is for safety standards to suffer when a company comes under commercial pressure and we all know Dublin Gas will continue to be under commercial pressure in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>In principle, it is wrong that the body that polices safety should be the same body that carried out commercial operations in this way.  With the best will in the world, I do not think Bord Gáis Éireann should be the board to assure us that when a gas hole has been filled and a leak inspected, everything is safe, and that we can take their word for it.  That is not an acceptable way to conduct safety.  It is important that we have an outside body overseeing the safety aspect.</P>
      <P>In my amendment I propose that the Minister should be acting in a supervisory capacity in respect of these safety functions which he is conferring on An Bord Gáis and I have allowed for the fact that he may wish to designate this activity in this area to other persons, such as the IIRS who have experience in this way.  In this amendment I have also specified the sort of things we need which are additional to the powers the Minister has under section 38, namely, the promulgation of regulations in relation to gas. The requirements I have spelled out cover the need for periodic safety audits in the company, the need for safety action programmes &mdash; the Raglan House report suggested that there be safety action programmes &mdash; to be agreed with someone in a supervisory capacity who can monitor their achievement; the need to be assured that the technical management practices in the company, which were shown to be so different in the case of Raglan House &mdash; the checking of leaks, the various procedures of passing information we found to be totally defective, need to be supervised; and critically important to the achievement of progress is the fact that we need a public record of leakages and accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the Raglan House report asked the task force to identify all relevant codes and standards which need to be reviewed and <Col N="3511" /> updated and to incorporate the lessons learned.  Among these is the amendment I am pressing now, but there is also a very serious need, which I think the Minister has acepted, for regulations under section 38 of the Gas Act which have not yet been made and the sooner we get to the stage where definite standards are enforced by regulation and supervised by the Minister the better.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister told us on Second Stage, that is, that Dublin Gas have taken on board the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report.  We must remember what those recommendations are because they need supervision if they are to work.  They include improving safety awareness, issuing procedures to the staff, drawing up annual safety plans, considering undertaking detailed internal audit of working practice, examining standby cover for holidays, reviewing the replacement policy for pipes, improving the record of gas escape details passed on when a gas escape is discovered and examining the feasibility of periodic safety checks for all consumers.  These are the things it would be desirable for Dublin Gas to be doing. To say Dublin Gas have taken these recommendations on board is reassuring up to a point but, having accepted that they will examine these recommendations it is not reassuring if they do not do something about them.  The bottom line is that they should need to answer to the Minister for safety and that it be done in the way outlined in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary motive of the Government in bringing forward this legislation was concern that a gas utility of this size was being run in receivership. We felt there should be a proper management in place in Dublin Gas.  We followed the line of integrating Dublin Gas into Bord Gáis Éireann but safety was our primary motive.  We were concerned about the safety of the utility and the dangers to the people of Dublin.  That was what prompted us to take quick <Col N="3512" /> action and to bring this measure before the House.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment in its present form.  Bord Gáis is a statutory corporation which will be responsible for all aspects of safety with regard to supply and distribution of natural gas in the Dublin area and in any other areas designated by the Minister of the day from time to time.  This is the same system that works with the ESB.  Deputy Bruton is proposing that there should be a further layer of supervision, another layer of bureaucracy, which would not necessarily ensure the achievement of the legitimate objectives which Deputy Bruton proposed in his amendment.</P>
      <P>He quite rightly said that in the Cremer and Warner report on Raglan House, safety was mentioned as well as the establishment of an agency for the investigation of incidents.  This is being looked at by the Government and me and already officials in my Department have had consultations with the United Kingdom health and safety executive and we are examining the way forward.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of responsibility and supervision is concerned, at the end of the day the Minister of the day will have overall political responsibility to the Dáil for all matters relating to the safety and the effectiveness of any systems which are put in place, but it is a different approach to that proposed by Deputy Bruton, who is advocating another layer of bureaucracy which I do not feel is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, and have, acted on the report of Cremer and Warner in relation to the recommendations which refer to Dublin Gas.  There is a liaison officer in my Department, appointed by me, monitoring the effectiveness of the response of Dublin Gas to these recommendations, and seeing that they are acting on those recommendations.  When the legislation is concluded in this House this evening and in the Seanad next week, the final takeover will be concluded.  That will mean Bord Gáis will have the operations of Dublin Gas under their umbrella.  I can assure the House that <Col N="3513" /> safety will be their primary responsibility and their primary task.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Deputy is concerned about safety but I cannot go along with the idea of establishing an extra layer of bureaucracy.  In relation to paragraph (b), this is already being implemented by Dublin Gas as part of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report.  Any order which relates to safety under section 2 will of course be laid before the House so that Deputies will have a chance to examine it and to debate the whole issue of safety.</P>
    <P>I am taking the right approach in the legislation, that BGE, being a statutory corporation, will retain responsibility for safety in the way the ESB acted in the past and continue to act at present.  As I have said a number of times during the debate safety is our primary goal. Although I am very conscious of this, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can persuade the Minister to change his mind since I know that safety is his primary objective. He said that Bord Gáis would be responsible for safety.  Dublin Gas were responsible in the past but experience has shown that that is not enough unless it is supervised. We have learned from sad experience. In Britain there were a series of explosions although they had promulgated regulations and had a supervising authority in the Department to do this task.  We are not breaking massive new ground.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggests that this would involve another layer of bureaucracy but that is not the intention of the amendment. Indeed, the Minister already has a certain amount of responsibility for regulating the safety aspects of gas but, as I pointed out on a number of occasions, his Department have chosen not to exercise that responsibility because they failed to issue any regulations under that section. Over the last 11 years, since the Minister has been given that responsibility, his Department have not responded in the way in which the Department in the UK did in response to similar accidents over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3514" /> The Minister suggested that his agency for investigating incidents will deal with this problem.  The intent of that agency is quite different, as the Minister made clear.  It was to investigate things like the <i>Betelgeuse</i> and other disasters and to draw lessons from them.  I have in mind the very simple matter of supervising the implementation of safety standards and not sifting through the debris of disasters to draw lessons.  Many aspirational recommendations were made in the Cremer and Warner report in relation to Dublin Gas but, if they are not policed, in a few years they may not be practised until we reach the sad state we experienced earlier on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will have overall political responsibility.  That is true but if he has not issued regulations under section 38 it is not reality.  We need someone to police this and not to leave it to the body delivering gas on a commercial basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will have to be clearly told where the public stand in relation to the Dublin gas company as a result of all this.  The mass of Victorian legislation to which I referred earlier imposes very definite obligations of various kinds on the gas company, for instance, the obligation to supply to a willing customer and to maintain supply and penalties for failure to maintain supply.  They are part of the law of the land but I am not happy that we are being told the full story as to what obligations would be put on Bord Gáis.  As I understand the substance of the Bill, the Minister will be able to pick and choose the obligations which exist at present in relation to Dublin Gas.  He can decide which of them, in his view, would be appropriate for Bord Gáis to continue to labour under.  These relate to safety, to continuity of supply obligations and to making a supply in safety.  If the Minister decides that a certain obligation is not mandatory he need not transfer it to BGE as a function under section 2 of the Bill. In those circumstances, the obligation, which is part of the law now, will only <Col N="3515" /> continue to bind a husk of a company with no substance left.</P>
      <P>In regard to safety and commercial and legal obligations, if the Minister can choose which obligations to transfer, does it mean we are buying a pig in a poke?  Will the Minister tell us what Victorian legislation he intends to save? When will we know?  Deputy Bruton said that some of the people who have been injured or whose property has been damaged by an explosion will be able to sue. Will they?  When the Minister has taken everything and Bernard Somers has tied a few ribbons on his file, will the Minister give an undertaking to the public that BGE will have the obligation of liability? Will the people to whom Deputy Bruton referred get compensation for the damage done?  Have the Government made a decision on this point?  Will those people be left empty handed staring at a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; notice on a dirty glass window in a disused office?  Will that be the extent of the vindication of their rights?  Bord Gáis Éireann will have the pipeline and all the bits and pieces they want to take from Dublin Gas but what about the person whose house has been destroyed by an explosion following a gas leak?  I should like the Minister, in the context of the safety proposal made by Deputy Bruton, to assure the House that every person who has a claim in respect of damage done to his person or property will be compensated by BGE and that they will not just take the advantageous functions of the company and leave the people owed money in damages by Dublin Gas with nothing.  An employee who has an outstanding claim for personal injuries will be able to use the ordinary insolvency legislation to protect him but what about someone who has already imagined he has a legal claim against Dublin Gas?  Who will compensate the ordinary Joe Soap who has an outstanding claim against Dublin Gas?</P>

Insurance is covered; there is no need to be worried about that.  There is no question of taking away anyone's legal rights.  I want to assure the Deputy on that.</P>
      <P>As far as the thrust of Deputy Bruton's comments is concerned, we are coming near the end of this debate and I want to be as helpful as I possibly can.  I cannot accept his amendment as it stands. However, I am prepared to make an order under section 2 of the Bill to oblige Bord Gáis Éireann to make periodic reports to the Minister of the day on their performance as far as safety is concerned. This order can be a matter for debate in this House at the appropriate Estimate time or on any other occasion, as to the performance of Bord Gáis in relation to the reports under section 2.  I am prepared to make that order to meet the genuine points Deputy Bruton has put forward.</P>

      <P>The Minister certainly is making a genuine effort to move towards the amendment.  I would like to tease out the sort of order he would make under section 2 to see that it would meet the essential concerns I have. Essentially, we want to see that the best practices that could be operated are being carried out. It involves not just BGE reporting to the Minister but someone other than BGE from time to time conducting a safety audit.  That is the nub.  There should be available to the public some sort of records.  I am quite happy that that element can be picked up in the Minister's suggestion.  I should like to hear him specify that the periodic reports he will require will have some content that will meet these matters; secondly that <Col N="3517" /> there will be an obligation for an independent safety audit at periodic intervals. That is an essential element.</P>

In the order I will make under section 2 I will specify, for example, probably somebody like the IIRS to carry out the safety audit periodically on the operations of BGE. The order to be made can encompass all the points as laid down by the Deputy and other points if I so decide.  When I look at the drafting of the order it may be that I would want to add further points, but I can take what is there on board as the basis of an order under section 2 without accepting the amendment as it is.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1)  Where the Board proposes to acquire the assets of the company or any of them, the Board shall submit a scheme, hereinafter called an &ldquo;Assets Acquisition Scheme&rdquo; to the Minister in respect of the assets to be acquired, and such acquisition shall not be made unless the Minister has made an Assets Acquisition Scheme Confirmation Order, under this section.</P>
      <P>(2) Where the Minister proposes to make an Assets Acquisition Confirmation Order, he shall lay a draft of such Order before Dáil Éireann and such Order shall not be made by the Minister unless within 21 sitting days of the laying of the Order before Dáil Éireann, a resolution has been passed by Dáil Éireann approving the terms of the draft Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3518" /> (3)  Where within two years of the passing of this Act the Board proposes to employ any persons who were at any time during the period of two years prior to the passing of this Act, employees of the company, the Board shall submit a scheme to the Minister in respect of such proposed employment, hereinafter called an &ldquo;Employment Scheme&rdquo;, to the Minister, and no such employment shall take effect unless the Minister shall make an order, hereinafter called an &ldquo;Employment Scheme Confirmation Order&rdquo;, setting out all the terms of employment in respect of which the Order is made.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister shall not make an Employment Scheme Confirmation Order under this Section unless a draft of such Order shall have been laid before Dáil Éireann and within 21 sitting days of the laying of the said draft Order before Dáil Éireann, a resolution has been passed by Dáil Éireann approving the terms of the draft Order.</P>
    <P>This is the second amendment in the names of Deputy O'Malley and myself and there is very little time to discuss it. The gist of it is that it is our belief that before Bord Gáis propose to acquire any assets of the Dublin Gas Company &mdash; and this is what subsections (1) and (2) of the proposed section are concerned with &mdash; the Minister should be told what assets are to be acquired and also the amount of money proposed to be paid and whether Bord Gáis regard the assets as necessary or unnecessary.  They must convince the Minister that their acquisition is desirable. The Minister must then tell this House that he believes a certain set of acquisitions is desirable and that set is undesirable and that a relevant order has been made.  The board have been given very wide power to acquire assets and it seems that this House, especially in times of financial stringency, should be concerned with getting value for money.  It should be consulted before assets are acquired and the acquisition should be <Col N="3519" /> justified in full.  Subsections (3) and (4) are concerned with employment.  This worries me very substantially.  There have been accusations levelled against the company &mdash; and they may be less substantial than is generally supposed &mdash; that there are restrictive practices and over-manning and employment conditions operating in the Gas Company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be untrue. Before Bord Gáis take on a huge new workforce the terms of employment of the new employees should be known to this House and the Minister should agree that those are reasonable terms rather than have a strike in two years' time when everybody says that there have been over-manning and restrictive practices and the employees have said that they were taken on on that basis.  There would be a strike against a national utility of a very substantial size and the laws of picketing would mean that it would be a strike that would cripple the whole gas network wherever Bord Gáis have any installation.  It would not be confined just to Dublin.  People in Cork would be paying the price for a Dublin industrial dispute.  The purpose of the last two subsections in particular is to make the Minister accountable to this House for the political decision which is about to be made.</P>

I believe we have the same level of commitment in Dublin Gas to jobs and pride in jobs as in many other companies throughout this country.  A figure is thrown around about nonattendance at work on a particular Monday.  If some audit on attendance were carried out on a Monday morning in any major concern it would be interesting to see the result in percentage terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the name of my colleague, Deputy J. O'Keeffe.  It is a reasonable resolution and it is very important from the point of view of agriculture and exports.  I was amazed at the Minister's attitude when he seemed complacent about the whole thing and conveyed the impression that everything was in hand, that everything would work out in due course.  Time is running out, we are now almost to 1 July and discussion of the farm price package has not yet been agreed nor do we see any signs of agreement and it is not to be discussed by the Heads of Government. This indicates a lack of urgency.  The Minister will readily recognise the tremendous loss that means for agriculture and not only for agriculture but for the whole food processing sector. There is great urgency in this matter.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, raised the question of reasonable increases for farm products.  This is not an unreasonable request.  Everybody realises that agriculture is the backbone of the country, the hope on which the whole economy turns.  Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to the protection of the market support system.  This is crucial to our interests.  I hope Ireland's interests are fully recognised in the course of the discussions.  I am sorry the issue will not be raised by the Heads of Government. If that had been the case it would at least have given the matter new impetus.</P>
      <P>In the not too distant future there will be a change over of the presidency and that may or may not benefit Ireland's cause.  Valuable time has been lost in trying to reach agreement in the shortest possible time in order to give the Irish producer maximum benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always been considered good Europeans.  We were recently called upon to give an indication of our commitment to Europe and we did so. <Col N="3523" /> However, nobody should take us for granted.  There is a tendency to do so. Whether or not we want to accept it the delays that have occurred in these talks are severely detrimental to our agriculture and to our economy.  These delays constitute a reduction in the possible grant-aid assistance or price increases that will be available to us.  More delays will only represent a further blow to the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent time last evening referring to the proposed taxes on fats and oils and the crucial nature of that element of the discussion.  Failure to reach agreement on that issue will be tragic from our point of view.  The question of emphasis must now be geared towards reaching an early and satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Green Pound devaluation being sought by the Minister, somewhere in the region of 5.8 per cent for beef and dairy products, and 10 per cent for cereals, the response which appears to be emanating from the Commission appears to be a Green Pound devaluation of 2.8 per cent for beef, for pig meat 1.2 per cent, for other livestock 1.3 per cent and for cereals, 6 per cent.  A failure to get an increase of the order of which the Minister spoke last night will mean that we are sliding down the European scale in relation to farm income.  We cannot afford that.  The Minister should reiterate his case in that area and try to ensure that the serious delays do not bring about a situation where those who are delaying the discussions will achieve their objectives by virtue of that procrastination.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister mentioned the question of reclassification of existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas.  He was critical of the previous Administration and implied that provision in this regard was not made either in the previous Government's Estimates or in their provisional budget.  As the Minister knows, provision has never been made in the Estimates for such changes in the handicapped areas, but changes took place.  The Minister's argument is without foundation.  I reiterate <Col N="3524" /> the call of my colleague for the reclassification of the areas referred to.  Previously it was not necessary to enter a sum in respect of such changes in the Estimates.  Those areas desperately need the advantages that such changes would bring about in the near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to the dismantling of the negative MCAs at least in our commitment to Europe we have tried to be good Europeans and have been effective. For that reason and since we are a small economy largely dependent on agricultural output we should have the benefits. I cannot understand why we have not yet achieved the full benefits that Europe proposed for us originally.  These benefits are often reiterated for us whenever the issue of Europe is to be sold to us.  We accept that but our European partners must also accept that we demand the benefits that will accrue to us.  I may be wrong, but there is a hint of suspicion that perhaps the present negotiations are hampered by some of the things this Administration said when in opposition. They equivocated on a couple of occasions that come to mind fairly readily about the benefits of Europe and the desirability of continued membership and so on.  There may well be a possibility that our European partners do not take us too seriously.  I wish to underscore the need for the Minister to very forceably press forward at the negotiations our case in relation to agriculture and the entire economy.</P>
    <P>An issue which took up some considerable time today in the House was the possibility of an expansion in our beef herd.  This is listed as item No. 5 in Deputy O'Keeffe's motion, and rightly so.  If we want to achieve all the benefits that we are told about in relation to a certain meat deal, obviously we will need to have the raw materials to put into that package.  If we do not have the raw materials there is very little likelihood that we will get any of the benefits.  This was clearly illustrated today.  The measures that have already been proposed for the expansion of the beef cow herd fall far short of what will be required if we are to capitalise on the recently announced <Col N="3525" /> meat expansion plan by the Goodman Group.  Perhaps the Minister will let the House know whether there will be any net job losses in other sections of the beef and meat processing industry as a result of the implementation of the package that was referred to in the House today. I am anxious to find that out, and I am quite sure that the companies outside of the 40 per cent who are controlled by the Goodman operation are anxious to know also whether this deal will militate against their interests and, if so, to what extent. I strongly urge the Minister to give very careful consideration to item No. 5 in Deputy O'Keeffe's motion and try to ensure that the beef cow herd is increased in such a way that it will provide the raw materials for the much vaunted and greatly publicised meat expansion plan about which we have all heard a great deal.</P>
    <P>A year or so ago we used to come into the House and hear the then Minister wrongly and firmly criticised if he returned from Europe with anything less than 100 per cent success.  Under the present administration there seems to be a slight change of heart on that side of the House.  They seem to have adopted a rather nonchalant air when the Minister comes home disappointed.  That sort of nonchalance can be very expensive and very demoralising to the people who depend on the Minister's success.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make any political points but what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If criticisms were allegedly valid last year and the year before when farm price agreements were reached and agreed upon much earlier and very satisfactorily concluded by the then Minister, surely some criticism must be levelled at the participants in the current discussions who are acting on behalf of the farming and food producing sectors in Europe and who have failed to reach agreement.  That is an abdication of their responsibilities to the people they represent. This is particularly unfortunate in the case of this country which is a net exporter and produces far more than is required and by virtue of the continued delay in the negotiations we now find that <Col N="3526" /> we are at the lower end of the incomes scale.  If there is no visual indication of an agreement being reached in the last days of this month other measures will have to be taken because it could well happen, with the transition of the Presidency, the days and weeks might well go by without agreement being reached. Obviously that would be very serious for the industry in this country.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind the changeover in the presidency and try to emphasise to his colleagues the pivotal nature of the industry to our economy.</P>
    <P>Last evening we all agreed that a discussion of this nature would strengthen the Minister's hand in his negotiations and so it does and should.  I would not like our European partners and colleagues to get the impression for one moment that we in this House were indulging in a cosmetic effort in order to hype the situation for their benefit.  We are absolutely serious about this.  These delays and the failure to reach agreement to date have cost this country at least £50 million.  The food and agricultural sector can ill afford that luxury at present.  It must be clearly brought home and illustrated to our European partners that delays of that nature cannot be tolerated in future.  We accept that, because we had a change of Government and Minister and because of the other changes throughout Europe that could have some affect on the negotiations but that does not give anybody the right to go away with the impression that this will be allowed to continue in the future.  It is detrimental to agriculture and to our entire economy and we will not tolerate it in the future.  Perhaps he would give us some indication as to what if any progress has taken place behind the scenes in the past few days and what is likely to happen in the next few days. As we all know, the discussions which take place behind the scenes can often be as beneficial as those that take place publicly.  Hopefully the official contacts which are now taking place will be accelerated and will be of benefit to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate <Col N="3527" /> and I thank my colleague for it.  It is an appropriate time for this Motion and this is the appropriate forum for it.  One thing which concerns me is the lack of concern and commitment by the Minister in connection with the talks that are taking place at this time.  He should have visited his colleagues in their own capitals and indicated the urgency of these talks and their successful conclusion to farming interests in this country.  This industry is perhaps of more importance in this country than in any of the other EC countries. I have said publicly before and I will say it again that a visit by the Taoiseach to the other Heads of State would have clearly indicated the urgency of this problem. It brings home to me the feeling that a serious type of discussion is not taking place, that there is no serious effort being made and there is not the kind of commitment which is required at this time for farming in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that we would, with the Taoiseach, visit the other Heads of State with a view to indicating the type of urgency involved which is so important to us in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one speaks about the reclassification of the less severely handicapped areas this would bring enormous benefits to a substantial part of this country.  As well as that it would bring in a large amount of money, free of charge, when one realises that the heaadage payments are paid for on a pound for pound basis by the EC.  This surely is an EC attainable aid as far as this country is concerned. This is an aid we should aspire to not in the months or years ahead but immediately. The talks have dragged on and they have dragged on before but not to the same extent as they have on this occasion. This is happening because a serious effort is not being made to attain what we have set out to achieve.  The motion as presented by Deputy O'Keeffe seeks a reasonable increase for farm products, protection of the market support system and so on.  Going back over the record it will be seen that the Fianna Fáil shadow Minister for Agriculture, over the past four years, indicated to this House how <Col N="3528" /> easy it was to obtain all the things which he thought should have been obtained. He indicated that though efforts were being made we have now seen the total lack of effort and the difficulties which are there.  Because of what is taking place and because of the lack of urgency we are still where we were months ago without any progress being made and without any of the aids which we aspired to being attained because of the lack of commitment. We have the full Green Pound devaluation.</P>

      <P>On a point of order that is entirely incorrect.  The Government Chief Whip knows quite well that the only people who offered were the people on this side of the House.  With your <Col N="3529" /> agreement, Mr. Chairman, we decided to allocate the time among three of our speakers which is not uncommon in this House.  If some Member from that side of the House had offered last evening the Deputy would be in possession now and he would not have had to raise that issue.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House or to argue. Certainly it is not my intention to mislead in any way but it is normal in Private Members' Time that the Opposition Party commence at 8.10 p.m. on a Tuesday evening and it comes across this side at 7.10 p.m. on the following evening.  From what I understand the far side of the House has been in possession since 7.10 p.m. last evening and therefore it should have come across here at 7.10 p.m. this evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government want a rapid decision on the best possible package for Irish farmers with regard to these negotiations. Considerable progress has already been made in price negotiations and substantial gains have been achieved as against the original proposals. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, has made it clear in the Council that neither he nor Ireland can be taken for granted. For example, he is still striving for improvements in the degree of dismantlement of the Irish MCAs and we are receiving <Col N="3532" /> more FEOGA benefits per head of population than any other member state.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that delays have nothing to do with changes of Government but with the intractable problems that exist at present.  We expect an Agricultural Council within a week or so. We expect the Presidency to announce its intentions very soon with regard to the matter. We do not expect that the change-over from the Belgian to the Danish Presidency will delay matters.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to Deputy Durkan's contribution with regard to item No. 5 of the motion &mdash; measures to encourage the expansion of the beef cow herd &mdash; with particular reference to the recent announcement of a package to develop the Irish meat industry. It is disappointing for an Irish firm that has given an unstinting degree of service and support to Irish agriculture over a period of 26 years and is prepared to invest a substantial amount of money in the Irish food industry in a natural resource area with the provision of 665 additional permanent jobs and at least the same again in the multiplier effect of this natural resource industry, that there is such a begrudging attitude with regard to this matter.  For several decades the IDA have supported the development of the Irish economy.  Many Irish companies and multinational companies have been supported to a far greater degree, and we have never had this type of hostile reaction. It is sad when an Irish firm, one of the largest beef processing firms in Europe, invest their own money in the Irish economy, in contrast I might say to others who put their money into economies outside Ireland, that we could not at least have some welcome for this development.  There is no question of dislodging jobs in other competitive firms in the meat business. In fact today the Minister for Industry and Commerce is opening a meat plant, Tara Meats at Kilbeggan which has been grant-aided by the IDA at a higher percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3533" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe knows that an ultra modern plant is being erected in Bandon which will be in production by September. Again, this was grant-aided by the IDA to a higher degree than the Goodman plant. I wish to assure the House that any firm or organisation in the food area that has a proposal for expansion or for the development of the food industry will be most welcome to set up and develop here. They will get every facility. This is not an exclusive deal. I would have preferred that the Goodman company had been given a greater welcome as it is an Irish firm investing in probably the most important sector of the Irish economy especially when there is a ceiling and a difficulty in expansion for commodities such as milk.  There is tremendous scope for expansion in the general meat area and we should be trying to encourage that type of development.</P>
      <P>These negotiations have been almost unprecedented in difficulty. We all know the huge market problems which form the background against which they are taking place. We are only at the beginning of tackling these problems which clearly will take years to overcome fully but even more immediately we have the background of an enormous budgetary problem. Expenditure on agriculture in the Community is running at least £2.5 billion above available resources this year and next year we could be short up to twice as much again.</P>
      <P>These are stark realities and allow little or no room for manoeuvre.  We cannot solve our market difficulties by throwing money at the problems.  Even if we could, we have not the money to fill the slings. We will not get the money &mdash; at least from an influential group of member states &mdash; even to keep the policy moving on more economical lines until we, in the agricultural policy-making business, demonstrate the capacity and willingness to get on top of the market problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that background the Commission's original proposals were understandable &mdash; understandable but too severe.  It would have been understandable had we not secured <Col N="3534" /> any real improvements in the negotiations &mdash; understandable but wrong. For the Minister did secure significant gains. These were outlined at great length last night so I will not go into great detail now.  However, it must again be put on the record that the Green Pound adjustment is significantly better than the original proposal &mdash; especially for beef, though still less than what we want; that the cereals net price reduction is less than that proposed, and the maximum moisture content impoved with a less drastic weakening of the support system; that the butter intervention systems will be more rational with the admission to eligibility of unsalted sweet cream butter and that the milk quota system will be much more flexible with the introduction of the restructuring scheme.  This has been long sought and long promised but is now at last to be delivered I welcome that scheme because it will be of advantage to the less well off farmer, a farmer with a small quota and with some new entrants to the milk industry.</P>
    <P>These are real improvements and they make the package more acceptable from Ireland's point of view.  Of course, I warmly welcome all of them.  There is, however, an area where, as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, I have a particular interest &mdash; the development of processed and higher added value production.  It has long been a catchcry that the CAP with its commodity bias militated against diversification of the industry. That was never strictly true.  Our over-dependence on interventioin products here arose to some extent from our geogrpahical position but, more importantly, from the lack of market and product research, and a less than fully developed marketing emphasis in many of our major manufacturing concerns. If the CAP offered a temptation towards intervention thinking it was a temptation to which we easily succumbed.</P>
    <P>One of our principal aims in Government is to encourage greater emphasis on value added and more highly processed production.  This requires much greater <Col N="3535" /> effort by all concerned in food manufacture in Ireland to maximise the value of our native raw materials.  This will be a long process but I am happy we are getting action in a number of those areas. As Deputy Durkan has pointed out, some of them are well publicised and I will not go into greater detail.  The CAP as a whole does not hinder that process; indeed by providing a basic support and guarantee in the market it actively helps it but there are areas where anomalies in the operation of the CAP are a clear disincentive to further processing here.</P>
    <P>The absence of MCAs on certain processed products, even though MCAs apply to the relevant basic products, is a clear example of such anomalies.  The haphazard and uncertain way in which MCAs could be introduced or discontinued every six months on the group of processed products, such as chocolate, known as non-Annex 2 goods is another such example.  The industry here has long been looking for the removal of such anomalies.  I am very pleased indeed that the pressure of the Minister Deputy O'Kennedy, on this is paying off. The final compromise clearly provides for the introduction of MCAs on cooked beef and a range of sugar-based goods.  It does not, unfortunatley, include soft drinks in that range.  These are in a somewhat different position in that the introduction of MCAs in that case invovles not just Commission action but also unanimity in the council.  Nevertheless, we are continuing to press the case and in the meantime the MCA extensions which have been included should safeguard the position &mdash; and indeed allow further development &mdash; of industries worth £50 million and providing 1,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The compromise also provides greater security in the operation of the MCA system for the non-Annex 2 goods.  In future MCAs will apply whenever the calculated amount exceds a minimum figure.  This is simply to avoid having to pay or collect very small amounts.  Except in these cases, MCAs will apply to the processed products concerned whenever there is an MCA on the relevant basic <Col N="3536" /> products.  This is as it should be and will allow the industries to plan their future in Ireland with greater confidence.</P>
    <P>We have now passed through a series of traumatic changes in the CAP, and we remember the adjustments of recent years which were far more dramatic than anything which will be seen this year. We must now move forward and, going beyond the basic support provided through the CAP, make the best use of what we have got.  We have real advantages in Ireland and we must exploit them fully.  It is not unrealistic to believe that we can be one of the principal quality food producing countries in the Community, but that will require hard work and a different emphasis in the future. The CAP will remain an important basic support for our farmers and processors. It should thus give them the confidence to maximise the value of their production. This year's price package should enable us to take another step forward in safeguarding the CAP and encouraging the Community to agree to provide the resources necessary to allow all our policies to develop.  From a more narrow but equally important viewpoint, it is also a package from which we stand to make real gains. For both these reasons it is important that it be adopted soon.  We would still like to see it improved in some respects and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, will continue to press for such adjustments even though the scope for manoeuvre is very limited.  We can best support his efforts by passing the amended motion here tonight.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I ask you to allow me to give some of my time to my colleagues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, would like to make some comments on these negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very fitting that this House should express its support tonight for the long and intensive efforts being made by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the context of this year's EC price negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of direct financial transfers we in this country derive more benefit per <Col N="3537" /> head from the CAP than any other member state.  Even more basically important is the fact that EC membership opens up to us a variety of major consumer markets for our agricultural and food products.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Community agricultural decisions have a widespread effect on the Irish farm sector. This is reflected in the intense interest shown here in the negotiations, as well as in the degree of attention devoted to the CAP by our media.</P>
    <P>The annual price negotiations are always difficult, and this year is no exception. It is easy to understand why.  There are now 12 member states, each with its own needs and viewpoints.  There is a financial crisis in the Community.  International talks on freeing agricultural trade are getting under way in GATT. Some of the proposals in the price package, particularly in the agrimonetary, cereals and fats and oils areas, are seen by member states as presenting them with major problems, but in spite of all the difficulties, the task facing this country remains the same &mdash; to defend the Common Agricultural Policy and Ireland's interests within it.</P>
    <P>It would have been pleasant and neat if the 1987-88 price negotiations could have been settled long before now, but we are not in the business of seeking a quick conclusion irrespective of its contents. We need first to be satisfied that the package contains the best deal available for Irish farming and food.  The five Council sessions on the price package that have taken place up to now have not been wasted.  The Commission compromise that emerged at last week's session contained, from Ireland's point of view, some substantial improvements on the original Commission proposals.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the prices package have already been explained and commented on at some length in this debate.  I will not spell them out again beyond emphasising that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is still seeking to improve even further on what is now proposed.  The prospect is that a few of the central issues may be raised at the <Col N="3538" /> European Council meeting next week. Obviously, a further effort to resolve the prices package as a whole will have to be made by the Agriculture Council itself in the near future.  It will be our endeavour to ensure that a solution is reached which safeguards the future development of the CAP and the interests of the Irish farm and food producers.</P>
    <P>EC policies in recent years have placed more and more emphasis on restricting production of surplus agricultural products. Given the cost of disposing of these surpluses on the world market and the present financial crisis affecting the Community, restrictive policies are likely to continue in the foreseeable future.  This poses a problem for the individual farmer.  Increased efficiency in production can contribute to an increase in income from traditional farm enterprises, but the scope for such improvement is not limitless.  Therefore, more and more farmers will have to look elsewhere if their farm business is to grow.</P>
    <P>One approach which must receive greater attention in the years ahead is the development of alternative farm enterprises. It is, of course, more important that only enterprises which have a genuine potential for growth are encouraged. The Department of Agriculture and Food together with ACOT are, therefore, carrying out a thorough examination of a number of enterprises with a view to identifying those which have a long term prospect of success and which can readily be fitted into the Irish farming scene. The enterprises that are being examined include farm guesthouse tourism, deer farming and sport horses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Be careful of the horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided the long term profitability of these enterprises can be demonstrated, consideration will be given to extending the range of eligible expenditure under the farm improvement programme to include capital expenditure on these enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised earlier that one of the main benefits to us of EC membership is free access to Community markets. We <Col N="3539" /> generally tend to think of this in relation to our main farm products but it can have relevance also to my sector of horticulture. The aim of the office of horticulture and of the interim Bord Glas is, of course, to develop horticulture not only towards a reconquest of the home market but also, where practicable, towards exports within the Community. In fact, our horticultural exports have already shown an upward trend in recent years.  The increase in very large part has been attributable to rapidly rising exports of mushrooms, in both fresh and processed form, to other EC member states. While the quantities involved are not enormous in terms of international trade flows, I see in this a good omen for the future.  Our EC membership gives us a preferential edge over suppliers outside the Community.  I expect that as the Bord Glas activities develop we will be turning our attention increasingly towards exports in addition to our efforts on the home market. Producers who acquire the ability to compete successfully here in Ireland should in many cases be able to do so elsewhere in the Community as well.</P>
    <P>Among the matters we raised in the Community price negotiations was the question of including harvesting and ancillary equipment for horticultural crops and potatoes in the types of expenditure eligible for FEOGA investment aid.  Such equipment is an obvious necessity for competitive commercial production and we want the Community to include it for investment aid purposes in the framework programmes we have drawn up for horticulture and potatoes. That would provide an appreciable backup to our efforts to develop both sectors; it would be particularly important for peas and beans, one of the few sectors not in market difficulties in the Community, as well as for the potato crop. This question falls within the Commission's competence; the Minister for Agriculture and Food has put it to the Commission that such facilities are needed in this country. I am glad that the Commission has expressed its willingness <Col N="3540" /> to examine our request.  The Commission gave a similar response to another relevant request of ours, namely, that the Community regulation on producer groups be extended to cover potatoes as well as some other production sectors in Ireland. I am hopeful, therefore, that relatively rapid progress can be made with these improvements.</P>
    <P>I would not want to give the impression that these moves at Community level are the only actions we are taking to develop horticulture.  There is a whole series of other measures as well.  For instance, quite apart from the matter of harvesting and ancillary equipment that I have just mentioned we are already obtaining substantial FEOGA support for improved processing, grading and packaging of our horticultural products.  The Community measures to encourage fruit and vegetable producer groups are already available in Ireland and I will continue to do what I can to encourage Irish producers to make full use of them; this is particularly desirable in view of the rather fragmented state of production in this country and the requirements for steady and reliable supplies to supermarkets.  We are also encouraging the use of new technology to increase productivity in horticulture. I was glad to be able to announce recently that provision is being made in the current Finance Bill to apply a reduced rate of corporation tax to the adoption of a new and useful technique known as micropropagation.  Finally, An Bord Glas have recently set up a series of commodity teams for the various horticultural sectors.  These teams are to put forward, within a matter of months, practical solutions to the problems of horticulture.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that taking account of all these efforts, the horticultural sector in this country is destined to expand and prosper, fuelled by a growing demand for a number of its products and by increasing efficiency.  Membership of the Community has given rise to challenges and difficulties in this sector as in others but, as I have shown, it offers substantial <Col N="3541" /> opportunities as well.  These opportunities depend largely on the maintenance of an effective Common Agricultural Policy.  That is a major objective of ours at Community level. The CAP must, of course, solve its market and financial problems in order to survive but it must solve them in a humane and equitable way.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is pursuing that aim with tenacity and determination in the current price negotiations, and this House should give him its support.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Liam Lawlor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very sobering lesson to all associated with agriculture that the talks in Brussels have dragged on for so long.  This highlights the problems of agriculture in the Community.  I hope the farmers, the farming organisations and all concerned are able to identify the reason the Council of Ministers is having such a very complex and difficult task planning for the future of agriculture in the Community.</P>
      <P>In the past ten or 15 years we have on many occasions had the cliché of added value.  We have had sectoral reports, IDA reports, beef processing reports and Telesis reports.  Every time you make a political speech you speak about the potential of our young people and of added value in the food processing sector. If Fine Gael's attitude, to a lesser extent the PD's attitude and, as of this morning, Deputy Dick Spring's attitude, to the recent announcement in the meat processing sector is anything to go by in measuring their commitment to added value food processing, one can only say that they are very pathetic and begrudging towards our most important industry. Deputy Bruton should be well aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope it lasts longer than the last beef deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; as should Deputy Durkan, of the unemployment close to my constituency and in Deputy Durkan's constituency, in IMP in Leixlip.  I am glad that he has expressed his concern in the <Col N="3542" /> form of putting questions to the Minister today but he might address his questions to Deputy Bruton who had a long-standing connection with the IMP problem in Leixlip and, consequently, with the unemployment that arose there. Deputy Bruton is an expert on the meat processing and the agri-sectors.  He took a pathetic attitude to the recent package announcment.  I am glad Deputy Durkan is questioning the Minister with responsibility for food about the possibility of a food facility in Leixlip.  I hope something on those lines will emerge but it should not be forgotten that there was a very thriving food processing plant in that town but thanks to the likes of Deputy Bruton and others who were involved it is no longer there.</P>
      <P>A new era in the food processing sector is dawning.  The Minister with responsibility for food has moved rapidly but the fact that decisions were taken and progress made was also cause for criticism among the people opposite.  Do Fine Gael and Deputy Bruton want to deny the food processing sector the investment of about £70 million from Goodman International by virtue of the IDA and the FEOGA contribution that may be forthcoming?  It is the one area of FEOGA investment that this country will hope to capitalise on in the years ahead. It is the one investment area on which FEOGA will look sympathetically. There is very little potential for further investment from FEOGA in the dairying sector.  They are not considering any of our dairying projects in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the structure of the meat processing sector in order and the slaughtering capacity has been put right.  We must never have a repeat of the debacle of the seventies when Deputy Bruton, in his connections with the co-operative movement, was not able to cope with the situation.  We should now try, as the Minister said to move forward into the fast lane of added value processing.  All we have from Deputies Bruton and Spring are pathetic criticisms and negative comments.  It behoves them to withdraw their negative opposition and not to oppose merely for the sake of opposing. <Col N="3543" /> What we are doing in the case of Goodman Internationl will take the meat processing sector through to the year 2,000 and give us the image abroad of a quality producer.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity that anyone on this side of the House has had to put on record our congratulations to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister of State and Goodman International for their dynamic approach to the whole project that is emerging.  I hope Deputy Durkan will be successful in his quest for some added value processing operation in Leixlip.  That would be most desirable.  What we are doing offers the one potential solution to the economic problems of this country.  Agriculture is the greatest earner of hard foreign currency. It is an area with minimum outgoings. Every other sector out of which we export has an input of costs from outside the country.  The multi-national companies are responsible for two-thirds of our exports.  The remainder is from Irish-based industries.  That is where the potential lies.  We are all aware that much of the multi-national profits are repatriated, that only the minimum remains here.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton's criticism of this package arose from the very disappointing position with Hyster Automated Handling Limited which borders his constituency and is in mine.  He seemed to join the two projects together in his criticisms even though his name is in granite as having opened that plant.  In four years he did nothing about those doubts, fears and his criticisms which he is now expressing so freely.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record my total opposition to Deputy Bruton's attitude towards positive pragmatic investment. His is the worse type of grudging Irish attitude one could take.  It is that naked petty attitude that has so beset this country in so many areas.  For once we have a Minister of State with responsibility for food who understands the sector.  He comes from a dairying background. There have been meat processing plants in his area for many years and he has <Col N="3544" /> seen the growth, prosperity and failures that have taken place.  I am confident, now that we have this programme, that in ten years time Ireland will be one of the cream producers of quality added value meat processing products which will find a shelf spot in all the quality locations, particularly in Europe.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his work and assure him of the full support of Fianna Fáil for this project.</P>

      <P>I was anxious to contribute to the debate to encourage the Minister to put on all the pressure possible to wrap up the wheeling and dealing that has been going on.  While we can make very flowery speeches in the House, the grim fact is that farmers are losing out. I am aware of the problems involved &mdash; they arise every year &mdash; but at this time of the year it is imperative that a satisfactory deal is concluded without delay.  I was surprised at the negative attitude adopted by the Minister with regard to the extension of the disadvantaged areas.  In the run up to the election we held meetings with the groups who were looking for these extensions. Those meetings were attended by Department officials and representatives <Col N="3545" /> of the Government.  We are asking that the momentum be continued and that the commitments given be fulfilled.  Department officials should visit the areas concerned and carry out an assessment.  We are not suggesting that the Government should rush over to Brussels with this programme because some areas may not qualify.</P>
      <P>Grain growing gets a low priority in all negotiations and that concerns me.  As a tillage farmer I hold the view that dairy farmers are doing comparatively well. Grain growers here are up against it because we could be washed out without a trace by the major producers in UK and on the Continent if we do not demand a quota system.  Those countries would beat us any time in price.  They can afford to sell grain at a price lower than ours. We do not have a hope of competing in that market unless a quota system is introduced.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of loose talk about import substitution and much has been done in the past three or four years to get farmers to grow wheat for flour.  At last major co-operatives have agreed to give contracts to farmers to grow wheat.  The co-ops have undertaken to buy the wheat for the millers.  This is the first time we will be growing a substantial amount of wheat for flour.  Up to now a lot of our flour was imported and the move by the co-ops is a major breakthrough. Few people realise that in the region of £120 million is spent on imported feed grain. The big assemblers of rations, our co-ops, look to South America and California for beet pulp and the Department cannot do much about that.  The movement will have to come from the farmers and their co-operatives.  The future of tillage farmers depends on how the Minister handles grain production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the 300 acres of seed potatoes grown by Mitchelstown for the Fri Dor Corporation in Holland who will be setting up a business in Midleton shortly are looking very well.  I understand that in the coming season we will have seed for 3,000 to 4,000 acres of potatoes for french <Col N="3546" /> fries.  Last year we imported almost £40 million worth of chips and the move in Cork should help to arrest that.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the interim board established by the Minister of State. I hope the new board will be different because I would be unhappy with one group having a monopoly on it.  The parliamentary questions I tabled about this matter were neatly side-stepped and went for written reply with the result that I did not get an opportunity of questioning the Minister.  The Minister referred to one producer group but we spent four years endeavouring to get the Irish farmers to set up their own groups. I am pleased to note that the Dublin meat group, in the charge of Colm Warren and Michael Mahon of the IFA, have arranged contracts with Dublin supermarkets. I appeal to the Minister to appoint those men to the new board. Our future lies in horticulture and it is important that we appoint people who have local experience.</P>
    <P>In my view it would not cost very much to bring about the revolution the Government are looking for in horticulture. We should not delude ourselves into thinking we have a wonderful climate for horticulture. In the Cork area in 1985-86 we lost our shirts on French beans and were it not for a dry period this year we would probably have lost a lot more.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Hegarty for sharing his time with me.  I support the amendment which states that Dáil Éireann supports the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to have the negotiations on EC agricultural prices for 1987-88 completed as quickly as possible and in a way that <Col N="3547" /> best promotes the development of agriculture. It is important that we consider how best to promote the development of the industry.  The efforts of the Minister, and the Minister of State, in recent months have been considerable.  Since we entered the EC there has been too great a concentration on prices and not sufficient concentration on more efficient production, further processing and marketing. Prior to our entry to the EC it was a question of supply and demand and we did not have a big problem about storage of unwanted products. Intervention has proved very costly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's efforts to reduce costly imports by home production while at the same time encouraging further processing of value-added products and a more aggressive international marketing campaign.  The decision by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to allocate responsibility for the different sectors to the Ministers of State will pay dividends.  It will undoubtedly pay dividends to have Ministers with individual responsibility for production, marketing and processing.  I come from a constituency where farmers concentrated on milk production since we entered the EC.  The introduction of the super-levy in 1984 was a great drawback to small farming enterprises.  The restrictive measures introduced by the Government in December of last year put a nail in the coffin of small milk producers.  In the allocation of quotas and the buying up of quotas I hope the Minister in future will give special recognition to the problems of the small producers.  In December 1986 we also had severe restrictions on intervention.  They were not felt as severely as they might have been because since the early part of this year there was a very favourable trade with the British supermarkets.  This offset our problem to a certain extent.  Our first aim should be to diversify and reduce our dependence on costly intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One important part of Deputy Kirk's speech was where he said that among the matters raised in the Community price <Col N="3548" /> negotiations was the question of including harvesting and ancillary equipment for horticulture crops and potatoes in the types of expenditure eligible for FEOGA investment aid.  We have a sorry record over the past number of years with the almost complete collapse of our fruit, vegetable and especially potato production. In 1982 we imported 82,000 tonnes of potatoes and 25,000 tonnes of frozen potatoes at a cost of £57 million. Admittedly it dropped the following year and has dropped since, but that is something the Minister has to correct.  I believe in grant-aid for that type of equipment. I was involved in the export potato business for many years.  We found that the biggest problem was the substantial amount of money that the British were putting into potato production and potato storage.  I believe the Minister is on the right path in regard to the production of potatoes.</P>
    <P>The most important function of the Department at present is to monitor the changing requirements of our primary producers and to concentrate on quality products.  It is clear that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has done a worthwhile job representing this country in the negotiations to date.  He has obtained a series of improvements as compared with the Commission's original proposals and in particular in regard to cereals the MCAs on processed foods and the dismantlement of Irish MCAs generally will result in a price increase in terms of the IR£.  We should, with all possible haste, get the dismantlement of those Irish MCAs because they are creating a very serious problem.  Our aim at EC level must be to achieve and maintain an effective Common Agricultural Policy, a policy that will be conducive to the interests of farmers and food processors. The climate is right for us to continue on the course on which the Minister has embarked.  I want to congratulate the Minister on his work and I think the House should express its appreciation of his efforts.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank our spokesman on agriculture for allowing me five minutes of his precious time in this very important debate. I, too, would like to add my support to the Minister in his efforts to make sure he makes the best deal possible in Europe.  Expansion of our beef cow herd must be a priority. It is a guaranteed formula for maintaining our cow herd numbers.  The Minister should insist that the maximum rate for beef cow and cattle grants be paid to Irish farmers.  If there is to be a future for our beef cow trade it must come by the preservation of the numbers of that category of animal.  It is well known that with a reduction in milk production as envisaged in the coming years our cow numbers will dwindle.  The Minister should also impress on his European partners that, where farmers are curtailed in their production of milk by the quota system, they should be allowed to benefit from the beef cow scheme to improve their income and bring it up to a living standard.  There are farmers in my constituency who have a quota as low as 7,500 gallons.  How can anybody expect people to live on that meagre quota? Under a certain limit it should be possible to incorporate the beef cow scheme to bring a farmer's income up to a viable level.  I hope the Minister will put that across in his talks in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also take into consideration that no off-farm income should apply in the case of beef cow grant or cattle headage schemes.  Our aim should be to increase our beef cow herd and to bring it to a standard that will benefit not alone the individual farmer but the State as well.  Our aim should be to increase our output in beef production to the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much taken by the introduction by the Minister of An Bord Glas. I hope he will not muzzle that Minister <Col N="3550" /> and that he will provide sufficient funds to enable him to get that industry off the ground.  In reply to a question of mine to the Taoiseach yesterday I was told that three was almost £70 million worth of vegetables and frozen chipped potatoes imported last year, totalling a quarter of a million tonnes.  We have the finest climate in the world for producing vegetables. We have the finest soil.  Because of the prevailing south-westerly winds we are free from any nuclear fall-out from Chernobyl etc.  We should now capitalise on that very important industry.  I would ask the Minister to explore the possibility in Brussels of getting EC grant-aid towards remodelling the Fastnet Vegetable Co-Operative in Skibbereen.  We do not want a white elephant of a factory with briars growing around the doors. We want this factory operating again. We want the Government to tackle this problem and ensure that we will not import 250,000 tonnes of vegetables this year.  The Minister should explore every possibility to get funds from Brussels to remodernise that factory which will be a source of income for the farmers of south-west Cork and south-West Kerry.</P>

      <P>The Minister should do his utmost to have the less severely handicapped areas reclassified as disadvantaged areas.  It is most important that we extend the disadvantaged areas as far as possible.  We could nearly make a case for 85 per cent of this country to be classified as disadvantaged.  There are areas in the Six Counties, fertile valleys, which are classified as disadvantaged. The Finn Valley in Donegal, with some of the finest land in the country, is classified as a disadvantaged area.  I see no reason why the entire Cork South-West constituency could not be classified as a disadvantaged area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm my support for the last point raised by my constituency colleague, and I have no doubt our colleague on the far side of the House would also agree.</P>
      <P>During my time attending Council meetings of the European Community I very often found it an advantage to be able to point to a debate in the Dáil, or to a decision of this House, to reinforce my efforts to secure the best possible arrangement for this country. The Danes in particular very often use the ploy of referring to their very strong foreign affairs committee and pointing to decisions of that committee by way of reinforcing their efforts to secure what they felt were in the best interest of their country.</P>
      <P>My purpose in putting down this motion was to reinforce the hand of the Minister in completing the farm negotiations and this has been achieved by this debate.  Deputies have been able to state their views clearly on what are the national priorities and objectives.  It is very significant that the approach adopted by Deputies on all sides of the House has closely conformed to the objectives I set down in my motion.  I touched on the urgency of securing an agreement and pointed out the specific objectives to be pursued in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister put down an amendment essentially covering the same issues in general terms.  He has spoken of the need to have these negotiations completed as quickly as possible.  I am in total agreement. It is in the interest of this country that we have a rapid and successful end to these negotiations which are costing the Irish farmer approximately £2 million each week they are delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked the House to agree that he should complete these negotiations in a way that best promotes the development of Irish agriculture.  That causes me no problem.  That is why we are sending him to Brussels.  Of course we want these negotiations completed in the best interest of Irish agriculture. On that issue I see the Minister covering points in a general way, whereas my motion <Col N="3552" /> covers it in a specific way.  As far as I am concerned, when the Minister goes outside the boundaries of this country, representing this country, and fighting to promote the best interests of the Irish farmer, I say to him, good luck, bon voyage, do your best, that is what we want you to do.</P>
    <P>In a spirit of constructive opposition I will accept the Minister's amendment.  I want him to go back to the negotiating table and ensure that there is a rapid ending to the negotiations, but one that is in the interest of the Irish farmer and that the results will be such that they best promote the development of Irish agriculture.  On that score I have no problem in accepting the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to leave the House and go back to Brussels solely bearing in mind the general voice of this House that he should operate in the best interest of Irish agriculture.  I want him also to remember the specifics which I outlined in the original motion. I want him to bear in mind that there has not been any dispute in this House on those specifics.  In fact, they are national priorities.  From that point of view, it is necessary that he bear those points in mind.</P>
    <P>On the question of reasonable increases in the full green pound devaluation, the Minister referred to what was on the table already and said he was not satisfied.  I am not satisfied, the House is not satisfied and the Minister can go back seeking the full green pound devaluation in the knowledge and confidence that he has the backing of this House.  He can use that at the negotiating session in order to secure the full green pound devaluation.</P>
    <P>The same applies to MCAs, or border taxes as they are known.  It is clear that the continuing existence of MCAs is not in the interests of Irish agriculture.  The problems our agriculture have to face in exporting to hard currency countries are very obvious.  When I hear the Germans, the Dutch and people in that category talk passionately about the need for a full, free, liberal, open internal market in industrial goods, I say I am in broad <Col N="3553" /> agreement with them, but they should let us have the same arrangement in relation to agricultural products.  As I see it, the existence of MCAs distorts competition and ensures that we do not have a full, free, open market.  There has to be a sustained effort, if necessary initiated by the Irish Minister &mdash; he should not have to initiate it because I know the Commission want it as well &mdash; to totally dismantle MCAs.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that there is a need for the expansion of the beef cow herd. I pointed out yesterday the problems associated with the diminution of the numbers of dairy cows.  It is very obvious that this will lead to a shortage of calves and beef in the years ahead.  Obviously it is a national priority that we reverse that trend and we take the necessary steps, with the assistance of Brussels, to substantially increase the beef cow herd.  I quoted figures which suggest that we need to replace upwards of 200,000 dairy cows and, looking at it from the point of view of output and income, we need about 300,000 beef cows to replace that number.  That is a major drop and I believe EC support is justified from the point of view of achieving that national priority.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into the Goodman deal because we talked about it at Question Time today, but I want to make one point.  I believe it is quite legitimate for an Opposition, when there is a very substantial national stake involved in such an undertaking, to have full details, to tease out those details and to raise the issues which are causing public concern. That does not in any way indicate a blanket opposition to the deal or indicate that we are critical of the Government for being involved in it &mdash; although there <Col N="3554" /> are elements which suggest we should be critical because of haste &mdash; but it is essential that the Government bear in mind that it is normal, logical and democratic that the full details be teased out in this House.  The question of additional capacity and availability of supply has not been clarified which brings me back to increasing beef cow numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last night on Second Stage of this Bill I raised the question of the definition of export goods.  There is a possibility that these trading houses could be abused to the extent that if there were not a very tight definition of exports one could have somewhat bogus companies importing merchandise and re-exporting again.  What is the specific definition provided <Col N="3557" /> for in this regard? Will there have to be a given percentage of Irish materials in finished products? Will the country of origin have to be put on these products, or will there be any restrictions on the way these companies operate? The Minister would agree that it would be totally improper if we were to leave any loophole whereby people could import and subsequently export and avail of 10 per cent profits tax.  Before we make any decision on section I perhaps the Minister would clarify that aspect.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;export goods&rdquo; means goods, which, in relation to the manufacturer of those goods, are goods for the purposes of this Chapter and which are exported by a Special Trading House, which is not the manufacturer of the goods, but which, in relation to the relevant accounting period, is the company claiming relief from tax by virtue of this subsection where the selling by the Special Trading House of the goods so exported is selling by wholesale;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance included that in section 29 of that Bill.  For the purposes of section 29 of the Finance Bill, and hence this Bill, the goods which may be handled by special trading houses are Irish manufactured goods as defined in the 1980 Finance Act.  That is goods which are manufactured in the normally accepted meaning of that term.  That also includes data processing equipment and computer software.  Under the definition of &ldquo;export goods&rdquo; used in the 1987 Finance Bill the special trading houses are confined to selling by wholesale.  The definition of export goods and special trading houses are well covered in the 1980 Finance Bill and in the 1987 Finance Bill.  This will not allow goods to be imported and re-exported, because the <Col N="3558" /> provisions of section 29 of the 1987 Finance Bill which govern the scheme are being inserted into Chapter 6 of Part I of the 1980 Finance Act in which goods are given a specific meaning and refer only to goods manufactured in the State.  In effect, the finance legislation confines the tax relief to the exports of Irish manufactured goods.  The term manufactured goods embraces manufacturing as generally understood and also computer software and data processing equipment.  In practice, the inspector of taxes dealing with the case will determine whether or not the company is dealing in Irish manufactured goods.  In the final analysis the individual company would have recourse under the law to challenge any decision of the Revenue Commissioners. I am confident that we have tied down manufacturing and the export element of it and that there is no scope for anybody to get out of that by trying to import goods for subsequent re-export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify in the area of companies who might import components and might add certain value to it for re-export, people involved in components, or in assembly and who would be involved in legitimate export, using foreign components, what clear parametres are laid down in relation to the definition of export there? I am talking about percentages of Irish input. I presume that it is reasonable to have some added value utilising foreign components particularly in a country which does not have for instance indigenous steel.  This is a question of balance.  We should be flexible in our interpretation. The whole purpose of this is to stimulate enterprise.  One can quickly recognise the chancer or the cowboys.  I want to be sure that genuine Irish industries do not find themselves bound hand and foot because of a percentage on the wrong side of a rubric of some kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reasonably normal procedure in defining manufacture. It comes down to the interpretation of the individual inspector of taxes in following the legislation. There <Col N="3559" /> is scope, as the Deputy knows, for some goods to be reprocessed and for that to be defined as manufacture.  There would have to be a very substantial element of reprocessing in the State, for it to be defined for tax purposes as manufacturing. I understand that that is a system which the Revenue Commissioners are well used to handling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the proportions? Is there a figure of some kind? I am not looking for exact definitions. This could very well be the first test of this Act, if someone believes that they are making a genuine contribution and some revenue commissioner with no particular skill in the area of manufacturing but who is involved in taxation may decide to the contrary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Special trading houses will be purchasing Irish manufactured goods.  The Revenue Commissioners are fully confident in the way in which they will tackle the question of what is manufacturing and what is not.  There is not a set percentage.  It depends on the nature of the process, some of which are very complicated.  It depends on how substantial is the element of reprocessing. At the moment the definition of manufacturing is tried and tested.  The fact that a trading house will be purchasing Irish manufactured goods will not cause any problem because we already have a working system for what is manufacturing and what is not.  That will not present a problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, I want to raise the question of the compatibility of this section with the Treaty of Rome.  My understanding is that section 42 of the Finance Act, 1980, was introduced to provide for 10 per cent corporation profits tax for manufactured goods.  That replaced Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  That part of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, had provided for nil corporation tax in respect of exported goods. It was found by the Government at that time that distinguishing for tax purposes between exported goods and non-exported goods was discriminatory and contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome which were quoted at that time. As a result the Government had to introduce section 42 of the Finance Act, 1980 which abolished the export profits tax relief and the wording used at the time was that:</P>
      <P>Save as is provided for in subsections (2) and (3), relief from corporation tax shall not be given under Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in respect of any accounting period or part of an accounting period falling after the 31st day of December, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this Bill, which relies on section 29 of the 1987 Finance Bill, the reintroduction of this discrimination as between exported goods and other goods, which would appear to be a reintroduction into our law of the same discrimination which had to be removed under section 42 of the Finance Act, 1980. Interestingly enough, it is only two sections previous to the section which the Minister has just relied on to answer the case made by Deputy Keating in regard to another matter.  This is a serious matter.  It is not desirable that business people should be invited by the Oireachtas &mdash; because in a sense that is what we are doing by making a special tax provision in section 29 of the Finance Act and by laying down a special procedure in this Bill &mdash; to undertake investments on the assumption that they have <Col N="3561" /> a certain protection in Irish law if that protection in Irish law is not compatible with superior law, namely, that provided in the Treaty of Rome.  There is a danger that people could lose their money if this legislation is subsequently struck down.</P>
    <P>I do not make this point lightly.  I was a Minister for Industry for more than three years.  I thought of analogous measures which would be of special assistance in the tax area to people who were exporting as distinct to those who were simply, to use the Telesis jargon, in the non-trade sectors but my opinion was that to attempt anything of that kind would run smack into the Treaty of Rome.  I cannot quote the precise article of the Treaty of Rome which is involved although I could do so if necessary.  I would refer the Minister to the debate in the House on section 42 of the Finance Act, 1980.  I am sure he will find in that debate ample justification in the contribution made by the then Minister for Finance as to why the section doing away with export profits and tax relief for new companies was necessary.  I would like a full explanation from the Minister on this.  I hope there is a perfectly adequate explanation and that my fears are not warranted.</P>
    <P>This is rather convoluted legislation. Section 1 defines export goods as &ldquo;having the meanings assigned to them in subsection (ICC2) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1987) of section 39 of the Finance Act, 1980&rdquo;.  When you look at the said section 39 you see that &ldquo;export goods are goods exported by a special trading house&rdquo;.  What is a special trading house? A special trading house is one selling export goods.  This does not enlighten us very much as to the meaning of this legislation.  One term is defined in terms of the other so that you end up with a definition that seems to be something approaching nonsense.</P>
    <P>In section 29 (b) of the Finance Bill, 1987, there is a definition of exported goods.  It says: &ldquo;For the purposes of this subsection goods are exported when they are transported out of the State in the course of selling by wholesale of those goods ...&rdquo;.  This may be the key to the <Col N="3562" /> problem but it does not refer back either to the definition of &ldquo;export goods&rdquo; or the definition of a &ldquo;trading house&rdquo;.  It seems that they are not interrelated.  Therefore, I have to think that the matter is extremely complicated and perhaps the Minister hopes, by making this legislation so incomprehensible, the bureaucrats in Brussels will not be able to understand it sufficiently to discover whether it is compatible with the Treaty of Rome and meanwhile the Minister will go on merrily issuing licences and people will go on merrily acting on them solely on the faith of the Minister &mdash; and I am sure people have immense confidence in his veracity and good intentions in issuing licences &mdash; and that this cosy arrangement will be conducted quite independently of the law.  That would be fine but I do not think it is compatible with the spirit of the Constitution which is that the law should be clear and people should know where they stand.  I do not think that is the case so far as this legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am putting two questions to the Minister: (1) how can this legislation be said to be compatible with the Treaty of Rome, given what happened in 1980 in regard to export profit tax relief and (2) does this definition make any sense in view of the rather circular definitions that are used to explain what is involved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Deputy Bruton are extremely sensitive and I think the Deputy knows that.  I am not saying he should not be raising those points &mdash; that is his duty as a Member of this House &mdash; but they are sensitive issues. Any decision of this House that might ultimately end up in a court, be it the Supreme Court in this country or a European court, is obviously something one has to be very careful about.  In particular, one has to be very careful about what one says in this Chamber about those issues because there are people with an interest in this debate who are looking at Irish legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent decision from Commissioner Peter Sutherland's office regarding small and medium-sized industries states that &ldquo;countries in the peripheral regions and <Col N="3563" /> suffering from disadvantages would be allowed to introduce measures for the effective marketing of their exports&rdquo;. That is a recent decision in regard to the question of competition and, in particular, exports.  I am relying somewhat on the small and medium-sized industries scheme within the EC to clear up any difficulties.  This is a scheme which assists small companies and countries on the periphery and, in particular, small companies, that happen to be in countries on the periphery.  There are no guarantees that any scheme or law passed by this House will not ultimately be shot down by the courts.  There was a case recently which ultimately led to a referendum. There is no guarantee that what we do here will not ultimately be tested by a citizen.</P>
    <P>We have officially notified the EC commission in regard to this legislation.  We have no reason to believe that it will be contrary to the Treaty of Rome in any way.  Taking that into account, as well as the situation of small and medium-sized companies and Commissioner Sutherland's recent decision in that area, we are reasonably satisfied that this will not conflict with EC legislation.  Deputy Bruton is a very experienced Member of this House and he knows that in any area dealing with the EC one is exposed and one has to be very careful.  It would be silly of me to give a cast iron guarantee that no court anywhere will not strike this down.  There are other parts to which Deputy Keating, or perhaps Deputy Yates, referred last night about the Circuit Court and so on.  One cannot judge what might go on in that area.  We are satisfied, having notified the Commission, that this scheme is not contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  The Deputy also asked about definitions.  He is longer dealing with the parliamentary draftsman than I am.  Advice from the Attorney General's office and from the parliamentary draftsman is that the definitions in this Bill, in a somewhat convoluted fashion as the Deputy suggests, are necessary to cover what we want to achieve.  I said last night &mdash;<Col N="3564" /> Deputy Bruton may not have had an opportunity to read that part of the debate &mdash; that I am very keen to have a simple, quick and as fair a scheme as possible.  That is why export goods are simply defined&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and is why &ldquo;special trading houses&rdquo; means a company which exists solely for the purpose of carrying on a trade which consists solely of the selling of export goods.  That is specific and clean.  A &ldquo;trading house&rdquo; means a company which exists solely for the purpose of carrying on a trade which consists solely of the selling of export goods.  It is a reasonably clean definition. I take the advice of the parliamentary draftsman but that is simple English to me.</P>

      <P>This is a point in relation to the definition of exports and it is a very simple one.  I am anxious to be as helpful as I can to the Minister and not to protract something which cannot be answered.  There is an inescapable circulatory as he describes it so far as &ldquo;special trading houses&rdquo; includes in its definition the word &ldquo;export&rdquo;.  The main thrust of the questions have been about the definition of exports which includes within it the definition of manufacture. The initial question raised by Deputy Keating was in relation to the Revenue Commissioners consideration.  The Minister referred to it as a tried and practical operation in terms of its definition.  To what extent is the labour content which is involved taken into consideration by the Revenue Commissioners? If it and other factors that might define what is an Irish origin manufacture which turns out to be an export are taken into consideration what are the proportions involved? If the Revenue Commissioners stand apart from the Minister's office in operating this Act, does the Minister propose to enter into negotiations with the Revenue Commissioners to try to answer some of these considerations in terms of proportions which would satisfy those of us who are asking questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add briefly to what Deputy Higgins has said? I am trying to get clarity on these issues.  Anybody who is going to be attracted to the financial lure &mdash; if I can call it that &mdash; of this Bill will want clarity in these definitions. These are business people who are practical hard-headed people and in the context of putting together their business plan they will need to define the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister referred to data processing.  There is no way in which that can be wholly domestic in origin.  It seems to me to be reasonable to press a little on this.  I am not over-happy about an arrangement which takes refuge in tradition carried on by the Revenue Commissioners.  We should be a little more explicit on these definitions.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that there is a degree of evasion &mdash; not by the Minister <Col N="3566" />&mdash; and a degree of nonsense about a definition which defines a &ldquo;special trading house&rdquo; as being a house which is involved in the export of goods and the export of goods as being something which the &ldquo;special trading houses&rdquo; do, which essentially is the Minister's reply.  We are saying this in a spirit of trying to be helpful so that the Bill will succeed so that we do not have people who are interested in putting projects together coming back and asking the Minister, or perhaps asking us, that question in a few months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to be helpful.  I should like to make two points. First, manufactured goods are already assessed by the Revenue Commissioners. All the manufacturing companies around the country have to go through this process at present.  Unless they satisfy the Revenue Commissioners as to the definition of manufacturing they will not get the 10 per cent.  That is the existing legislation. All we are doing here is taking another group of people and applying exactly the same regulations to them. We are debating regulations which are already in place, operated under the last Government and this Government, but they do not form part of this Bill.  This Bill does not set out to define manufacturing because that is already covered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Manufacturing companies, under existing laws, have to clear with the Revenue Commissioners the definition of manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>But the definition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is already going on.  Manufacturing companies have to get the approval of the Revenue Commissioners before receiving the 10 per cent.  All I am doing here is adding on a few more people to that process.  That process does not come up for debate in this Bill because it is already going on and defined in other legislation.  It is important to point out at this stage that this section is in the Finance Bill.  We are talking now for the past 20 minutes about export goods and their definition.  Section <Col N="3567" /> 29 of the Finance Bill was passed by this House last week.  With respect, I have a different Bill before the House tonight and there are many amendments &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can gauge the input value of <Col N="3568" /> goods at one end of the factory.  We are talking about somewhat more ephemeral concepts like marketing and value added in certain areas and the kind of activities which a special trading house would be doing which are not manufacturing.  In that context, how easy is it to take the manufacturing idiom and simply apply it to a totally different concept? There will be arguments in the market place about this and it is as well that we dispose of them and be as explanatory as we can.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;section 39 of the Finance Act, 1980 which I have in front of me and there is no reference whatsoever to export goods in that. There is a definition of goods and manufactured goods, but there is no definition of export goods. The Minister did not answer my very first question which is what is an export good. Is it something that can be imported and re-exported? I was intrigued during the debate on the Finance Bill this year that this whole Bill and what it refers to were described as &ldquo;trading houses&rdquo; but when we came near to Report Stage the Minister for Finance changed the term to &ldquo;special trading houses&rdquo; which makes one curious about the insertion of the word &ldquo;special&rdquo;. Is this some political marketing logo, or is it because there are other forms of trading houses? Will the Minister clarify why the word &ldquo;special&rdquo; was inserted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to point out that this Bill does not set out to define export goods. It sets out to define export goods for the purposes of trading houses that was defined in section 29 of the Bill last week, and which I have read out to the House a number of times. Deputy Yates is concerned about importation and re-export and I have tried to deal with that, in that this legislation says it must be manufactured in Ireland. The definition of manufactured is in other legislation, but the goods must be manufactured in Ireland and exported by the trading house. I know what is being said but I have to try to redirect the debate. It is quite clear that it has to be manufactured in Ireland and it has to be exported by one of these companies that have a licence. We could spend a great deal of time getting into all types of side roads. Ninety nine per cent of the people reading this would be reasonably happy as to whether something is manufactured or not manufactured in Ireland. That has <Col N="3571" /> already been tried and tested by the Revenue Commissioners who have been defining manufacturing for God knows how long. Secondly, it must be exported. It must be manufactured here and exported for a trading house to be able to avail of the concession. I think it is another day's work if we want to have a full debate on what is manufacture and export.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is not whether a commodity is manufactured or not, as there is legislation and a substantial body of case law on that. The case law, interestingly enough, is rapidly widening the definition of what is manufacturing and we may soon find ourselves with virtually all activity classed as manufacturing as defined by the courts. We may find that what was intended as a special incentive becomes a general incentive now that the corporation profit tax basis disappears. However, that is a separate matter. What we are concerned about here &mdash; it is strictly relevant to section 1 and it is impossible to raise it on section 2 &mdash; is the meaning of the terms &ldquo;export goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;special trading house&rdquo;. I want to raise the problem of the circularity of the definitions of &ldquo;special trading house&rdquo; and &ldquo;export goods&rdquo;. The latter is defined in terms of being goods sold by a special trading house and a &ldquo;special trading house&rdquo; is defined as a body that sells export goods. The Minister has not clarified that point and I stress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not know what it means because you do not know where you are starting from. Nobody knows what is a special trading house other than by the fact that the Minister recognises it as such. If there is no definition of export goods, then the Minister could recognise any activity as being the activity of a <Col N="3572" /> special trading house and any goods as export goods by consequence of the fact they were being handled by a special trading house. Therefore, the legislation is a lot of rubbish.  If that is the case, we might as well give the Minister a one line Bill saying, &ldquo;whoever the Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, says should have tax relief shall have tax relief&rdquo;. Because the definition is so circular it means there is no guidance, no containment of what he may or may not do, given to him by the House, and under this legislation he could end up doing virtually anything. Let us not say that is negative thinking; it is not negative thinking. The fact is that business people will invest their money on the strength of this legislation. They must know what the thing means. We are not, therefore, raising niggling little points, or sensitive issues as the Minister chooses to describe them. We are raising important questions on the basis of which people are going to invest their money.</P>
      <P>Another point I wanted to raise related directly to this. This definition of export goods relies on section 29 of this year's Finance Bill. We have a statement here that export goods are goods which are exported by a special trading house which is not a manufacturer of the goods. So far that is clear.  We go further in the same section of the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We can laugh if we wish. Let me start this point again. I was slightly thrown off my train of thought. I have raised the first anomaly, that this circular definition essentially means nothing except that the Minister can do as he likes. The second problem is the question of what export goods are so far as special trading is concerned. In the new subsection (ICC2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1980 as inserted by the Finance Bill, 1987, export goods are defined as goods which are exported by a special trading <Col N="3573" /> house which is not a manufacturer of the goods. However, subsection (ICC2) (c) provides that &ldquo;export goods when exported in the course of its trade by a Special Trading House shall be deemed to have been manufactured by the Special Trading House, nothwithstanding that the manufacturer has claimed, or is entitled to claim, relief under this Chapter in respect of the sale by it of those goods&rdquo;. Therefore, we have a statement that goods which have not been manufactured by the special trading house in order to qualify shall be deemed to have been manufactured by it. That again is going to cause considerable difficulty. Who is going to do the deeming? On what criteria will they deem goods that have not been manufactured to have been manufactured? What is meant by the provision that goods which qualify a special trading house for the relief only if it does not manufacture them shall be deemed nonetheless to have been manufactured by it for the purposes of another subsection of the same section? I can see many people having difficulty in working that out.</P>
      <P>It behoves this House to pass legislation that is clear. I am not asking that our legislation should contain prose as limpid as that in <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> or Shakespeare's sonnets or any thing of that kind. A certain amount of turgidness is inevitable in legislation, but some attempt should be made to make definitions internally consistent and, as far as possible, clear. Section 29 of the Finance Bill, 1987 on which this definition relies is completely confusing. If something is completely confusing it is likely to be completely ineffective. I hesitate to say it, and I do not wish to say it in a partisan fashion, but the Minister of State has been making great political play of the orginality of this proposal. However, if this proposal is totally ineffective and nonsensical because it does not rest on proper definitions, his whole case will go rapidly out the window. That is something that we as politicians in this House, being asked to spend our time on this legislation, cannot ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3574" /> The Minister referred to the consistency of the legislation with the Treaty of Rome and he says that he is relying for this on a statement made by Commissioner Sutherland.</P>

      <P>The problem here is that the definition of export goods is what is to be the basis on which the Minister will be able to assure that this legislation can be used only by companies exporting <Col N="3575" /> Irish goods. If, however, the definition of exports which distinguishes between goods produced here and goods produced elsewhere is incompatible with the Treaty of Rome as discriminating between one country and another within the Community, Deputy Keating's fears that this could become simply a system of trading houses to obtain tax relief for the organisation of imports into this country could very easily be well founded.</P>

      <P>I must say to the House at this stage that three words were hovering around here tonight, &ldquo;export&rdquo;, &ldquo;goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo;.  This Bill does not set out to define any one of those. Before the Bill came in at all each of those words had an existing meaning either in existing legislation or in existing practice. For example, the Finance Act, 1980 section 39 provides:</P>
      <P>In this Chapter &ldquo;goods&rdquo; means goods manufactured within the State in the course of a trade by the company which, in relation to the relevant accounting period, is the company claiming relief under this Chapter in relation to the trade:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Goods were already defined in legislation before this Bill was introduced in the House. In section 42 of the Finance Act, 1980, exporting is defined as goods exported out of the State. No attempt has been made by any Government in recent years to define exporting better than it is already defined. There was much industrial legislation before this House in which Governments could have attempted to better define the word &ldquo;exporting&rdquo;.  This Bill is relying on the existing definitions, such as they are and inadequate as they are, of the words &ldquo;exporting&rdquo;, &ldquo;goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;. Those three words are defined in legislation prior to this Bill and this Bill is relying on the existing definitions. If those three definitions, as they are currently understood, are not acceptable they will have to be tackled in other legislation. I did not set out in this legislation to improve the definition of goods, of manufacturing or of exporting but neither was there an attempt made in much of the legislation which was introduced in the House in recent years to better define <Col N="3577" /> those words.  I am relying on the definitions of those words in existing legislation. We are still debating the Finance Bill which was passed by this House recently.</P>

Long before we came up with <Col N="3578" /> the idea of special trading houses people had been operating manufacturing companies around the country and they know what exporting is, what manufacturing is and what goods are covered under the Act.

      <P>The term was defined in Part IV of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, and that scheme was abolished in 1980.  The only place where the definition of export had any operative relevance until this legislation was introduced was in regard to what CTT may or may not do and this House has complete control over that.  This legislation in extending it to a new area where it will now be the basis for automatic tax relief which people can get under the provisions of section 2 (7) by going to court if necessary and overturning what the Minister has done.  The House is losing control of how this definition can be used.  The courts and their business people can now use this legislation as they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definitions become much more important once they become a basis for tax relief than when they were simply a basis for authorising what CTT might or might not do. After all the Minister can completely control them.  They may be <Col N="3579" /> entitled by law to do something but he can tell them they cannot do it. That is not the case with this legislation. Under section 2 (7) the court will rely on the terms of this legislation and it does not matter what the Minister says. He can say that was not what he meant when he included it in this legislation but that will be of no value. The court will ignore what the Minister, what I or what anybody else in this House says.  In coming to their decision they will only be concerned with the definition in the legislation. I submit therefore that the definition is unclear and is possibly incompatibe with the Treaty of Rome. To introduce a tax concession on which people will make substantial investment decisions on the basis of two uncertain supports is to invite people to misinvest.</P>

I am setting out to do something very simple which will be of help. I have dealt with the EC situation. I do not accept the suggestion that one will automatically get tax relief in this scheme. They will have to satisfy the conditions which are laid down in this Bill in regard to proper marketing plans and they must also satisfy the Revenue Commissioners. Manufacturing companies have to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that they are genuinely manufacturing goods and they must comply with the conditions laid down.

      <P>The fact is that any decision by the Revenue Commissioners is capable of being appealed to the courts on the basis that, among other things, the aggrieved party feel that the decision made by them is incompatible with the law. We make the law and it is the law that will decide what the courts will decide, whether the decision of the Revenue Commissioners was wrong. Therefore, if the law we are passing today, which relies on section 29 of this year's Finance Bill, is unclear or incompatible with the Treaty of Rome it does not matter a fig what the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied or not satisfied with. That can be appealed to the courts <Col N="3581" /> and overturned on the basis that the legislation before us in not clear.</P>

      <P>We cannot change a Finance Act tonight. The definition relies on two items in different finance legislation. I am relying on law passed by the House.  It cannot be changed tonight because it is not on our agenda. Most Ministers rely on existing legislation unless they are seeking to make a fundamental change in the definitions which have been operating in the State for some time. Section 2 (5) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall not grant a licence in respect of a Special Trading House unless he is satisfied that the applicant for the licence has the structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the sale of export goods. That condition will have to be met. The Minister of the day will have to be satisfied that the company is a bona fide concern with a proper structure and organisation before a licence is issued.</P>

      <P>I hope not to be repetitious and to enable the House to make progress. I do not wish to protract a discussion which cannot be terminated easily this evening. In his previous contribution on section 1 the Minister suggested that he does not want to open up the question of the process by which the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied by manufacturers approaching them in relation to what is benefit under the existing tax laws.  We can solve the problem if the Minister indicates that as this legislation, with other legislation, is crucially dependent on that process it will mean that if the decision of the Revenue Commissioners is contested in court for judgment it will be the decision of the Revenue Commissioners versus the law. The law is the responsibility of the House and the question of proportionality is a policy decision. I am asking the Minister to note the lack of openness in relation to the proportionality content of the process being followed by the Revenue Commissioners. That is the point on which we are all stuck. I would be satisfied if the Minister noted that there is a transparency defect. We know what the process is. I realise that this is making a concession to the idea that if I do not see a transparency that is in previous legislation and we allow another Bill through on a flimsy basis we are taking some risk. I would take that risk but the Minister needs to give a commitment to the House that he will try to make some progress in that regard not only in this legislation but, through his colleagues, in other legislation.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that I will undertake a review of the definition of these fundamental words in my Department. I will have a discussion with the Revenue Commissioners on how they arrive at what is and is not substantial in the question of reprocessing. I know the Deputy is concerned about the labour content, as I am. I would like to think that the Revenue Commissioners take into account a very substantial Irish input into whatever is being put on top of the basic <Col N="3583" /> product. That is what one would like to see. Following my discussions with the Revenue Commissioners I will communicate with the Deputy, if that is the wish of the House.</P>

Those decisions taken by him may be appealed to the courts and the courts will look, not at the Minister's bona fides, not at his intentions but at what the law says. If these definitions do not make sense we are making bad law. The Minister challenged me to produce a definition that would make sense rather than relying on the Finance Acts. It was the Minister's choice to rely on the Finance Bill of this year. He could have his own definition of &ldquo;export goods&rdquo; if he wished but he chose to rely on another incomprehensible piece of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that &ldquo;export goods&rdquo; should be defined in section 1 not by reference to section 29 of the Finance Bill but along the following lines: export goods shall mean goods manufactured in the State which are sold outside the State and not sold back to persons within the State. I suggest that a special trading house instead of being defined as is in the Bill should be defined as follows: a body engaged in selling Irish produce or goods outside the State which are not sold back within the State. Those definitions would make more sense than the impossibly <Col N="3584" /> dense wording of section 29 of the Finance Bill upon which the Minister has voluntarily chosen to rely in his definitions in the section.</P>

I do not want this to become an accountant's plaything or device that accountants will hand off the shelves to everybody for tax dodging. I would certainly want to keep a very close eye on that. Neither do I want it to get into the cowboy area. I just make those comments now because it is my intention to watch this very carefully. This is not casting a stone. If there are indications that people are abusing it or that the professionals are getting around the definitions in it or that our decision to rely on existing definitions was a wrong one, I will have no difficulty in asking for changes in this legislation at any time. A decision was made to rely on existing definitions and a decision was taken on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and on the advice of the Attorney General to rely on this particular form of words. I understand the Deputy's viewpoint, I see what he is getting at and I understand his worries but there is a greater need in the country right now than getting the Is dotted and the Ts crossed and that is that I would like to get these moving over the summer so that we can get some additional exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, in the nicest possible way, to stop lecturing us about what he wants to do. We are all here tonight because we believe that this Bill might, properly developed, facilitate the Minister's and our collective <Col N="3585" /> objectives. It is not desirable to put on the Statute Book sloppy legislation as a mechanism for creating jobs or exports. Does the Minister accept in principle that there is an argument even about whether the concept of definitions outside the ambit of this Bill is causing possible problems theoretically to the Bill itself, possibly involving a challenge to the courts in due course? Might it not be more desirable, as a principle, to incorporate the definitions under question within the Bill, the only purpose of this exercise being that the Bill is as watertight and as efficient and as clean cut as possible, thereby facilitating precisely the objectives which the Minister and all of us want to achieve. It is not that we take a different view or that we do not want to suit the Minister. What we do not want is to end up with a challenge to this Bill in six months' time which turns not just this Bill but some of the definitions we are talking about on their heads and we find that we have a mess of potage. That is the point. One way I would suggest is that he should get some of his colleagues to reflect for maybe half an hour and when we come to the Report Stage in due course he could consider the possibility of incorporating the simple definitions outlined by Deputy Bruton or definitions analogous to those in the context of the Bill itself so that it is self-contained and, therefore, does not rely on questionable definitions outside of the ambit of this measure.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to do but self-contained legislation is not something you very often get. Pardon me if I seem to be lecturing the House.  That is not my intention.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we took a decision in respect of many other Acts down the years, instead <Col N="3586" /> of defining things afresh, to rely on existing definitions and if existing definitions are incomplete then they should be tackled in a different way. I will have the Department carry out a review of the fundamental and basic legislation and precedents that those words rely on. I do not think I can be any more helpful this evening. We took a decision to rely on the existing definitions. It is the Finance Act which gives the tax relief. We are trying to be consistent between the definitions there, which we had to work out with the draftsman and the Revenue Commissioners and the Attorney General's Office, and the definitions here. With respect, the House albeit perhaps in controversial circumstances did go along with the Finance Act, at least it was endorsed by the House and I am seeking to rely on something that is already in legislation passed by the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 27, subsection (4), after &ldquo;application&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided such information is within the competence of the applicant to provide&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What subsection (4) says is that if the <Col N="3588" /> applicant does not supply the Minister with whatever information the Minister requires the Minister shall not consider the application. I have only one worry about that, particularly in the context of the situation where the Minister may apparently decide from time to time fairly arbitrarily what kind of information or data might be needed.  I can visualise a case where various bank references or statements of experience in business or trade might be required, and I wonder if one should come down on the side of the individual. There could be circumstances where a person might reasonably make a genuine attempt to provide the information required but because of circumstances outside his control that might not be possible.</P>
    <P>Let us say a trading house was formed with a number of members as co-directors or co-partners and it was not possible to supply the depth of information necessary in all cases because of the exigencies of time, the confidentiality of business transactions or because of personal circumstances. If a person has made a genuine attempt to provide such information, it seems to be a little harsh to automatically disbar that person from being considered, because the section says the Minister &ldquo;shall not consider the application&rdquo;.  It does not say &ldquo;the Minister may not consider the application&rdquo;. This contrasts with the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; above.</P>
    <P>If the applicant is bona fide and has made a genuine attempt to give the Minister the information he requires, is it not reasonable to suggest that his application should at least be considered?  I am suggesting that some form of words be included along the lines mentioned, that is, &ldquo;the Minister shall not consider the application provided such information is within the competence of the applicant to provide&rdquo;, because there are areas of information which are not necessarily immediately available to him or her. He may have to request that information from a finance house, and in some circumstances he might not get it.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that <Col N="3589" /> a person who is genuine will not be discriminated against due to a problem outside his or her control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be of help but I cannot accept the amendment at this stage.  The information the Minister is entitled to seek from the applicant is directly relevant to a special trading house operation as proposed by the applicant. It is also reasonably clear in the legislation that this is a freezing mechanism in the sense that nobody will get a licence until the information is provided which enables the Minister to make the decision.  In this Bill there is a presumption of reasonableness on both sides, that no unreasonable or frivolous information will be sought.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is an argument for building that into legislation but the presumption and wording of the Bill is strong enough to indicate that no Minister would unreasonably demand information from an applicant who is not in a position to provide that information.  That would be tantamount to harassment and I do not honestly believe it is something any Minister would contemplate getting into.</P>
      <P>As regards the phrase &ldquo;provided such information is within the competence of the applicant to provide&rdquo;, it is assumed that the person is in a position to supply that information.  If he is not, then the Minister will have to make the decision on the basis of the information he has. He will only look for the information he needs to assess if the applicant complies with the three conditions &mdash; structure, organisation and marketing ability.  The amendment might help but it is assumed in the legislation that information sought from an applicant will be reasonable and not the kind that a person would not be able to provide.  I could not envisage anyone demanding such information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat consoled by the Minister's reference to presumption but I do not think he is correct. He makes the point that the information to be sought basically relates to three elements &mdash; structure, organisation and <Col N="3590" /> marketing ability.  Subsection (3) says something to the contrary.  It says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may require an applicant for licence in respect of a Special Trading House to furnish to him, within such time as may be specified, such further information in relation to the application as the Minister considers to be necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>I am talking about this in the context of an arrangement where the licensing facility &mdash; I would not define it as a licence to print money &mdash; has at its heart a potential for generating profits.  The decision is essentially subject to the appeal of the courts, a political decision.  In that context it seems a Minister in some circumstances could make an adjudication which might be open to the allegation that it was politically tainted.  That allegation could be brought about by seeking information which is either not reasonably obtainable by an applicant or was such that it could fall under the definition of &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; or &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; but might be quite spurious, and it was sought simply to make it impossible for someone to present an application which requires all the information the Minister says is desirable or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a case that the Minister may decide not to grant a licence; under this legislation the Minister shall not consider the application.  I do not believe we should presume anything.  What we are talking about here is a form of restrictive practice operated by people making very arbitrary decisions in the context of plethora of words that have no definition in this Bill.  There is no reference in this Bill to the structure, organisation or marketing ability of a company.  They are not defined here and the definition of what is &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; or &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; does not apply to those three elements.  They could be anything from a character reference upwards or downwards.  I do not believe it would cause a problem if the Minister was gracious enough to accept that the spirit of the presumption to which he refers could be embodied in the form of words I have mentioned, which are essentially non-contentious, that is, to <Col N="3591" /> add the words &ldquo;provided such information is within the competence of the applicant to provide&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What happens if by some chance a genuine applicant applies when this legislation is law and the Minister finds that the information which is necessary or desirable &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; cannot be provided? Say, somebody returns from spending some time abroad and the business had accounts in a foreign bank which refused to give bank references. The applicant might tell the Minister he had spent three years in Brazil but could not get a bank reference, although he had a good record and lots of assets and although he might want to help the Minister and the country, the information was not available. In such a case the Minister shall not consider the application even though such information would be essential.  In those circumstances and to protect applicants who are bona fide, the Minister might be good enough to think again.  He said the information he sought related to organisation, structure and marketing ability but that is not what the Bill says.  The Bill allows him, his colleagues or his successors to decide what is desirable and what is necessary.  That is very broad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not be naive. A licence for a special trading house is about giving to a particular applicant, over and above the heads of other unsuccessful applicants, preferential capacity to make a profit.  Inevitably, in a small society with a degree of obnoxious repeated representation that permeates the system in this country whenever there is a bob to be made, it is logical that there will be political representations made to the Minister who makes the decision. There may be also inevitably a degree of <Col N="3593" /> succumbing to such representations.  I am only asking the Minister to take reasonable precautions to minimise that risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to rely very largely on CTT in this regard.  Any application made will have to receive a recommendation from CTT to the Minister who will rely on such recommendation, although not exclusively.  The point I am making in regard to the political aspects is that I am particularly keen to get into the operational detail of the scheme a reliance on CTT in regard to recommending an application.  When an application arrives it is our intention to ask CTT to let us have a recommendation in regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>CTT are facilitated in the Bill in terms of grant-aid by the Minister and I have no doubt that, nine times out of ten, the recommendation of CTT will be observed and acted upon.  This legislation will stand for decades and it is not unreasonable to suggest that it should be as watertight as possible.  What is the Minister's objection to the few non-controversial words I suggested? It merely gives the bona fide applicant a greater degree of confidence about his application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. Last night, on Second Stage, I said that these trading houses were basically composed of displaced people who were already in the export promotions and sales business and that it would be better to proceed on a commission basis rather than by direct resale.  There is no provision in the Bill <Col N="3595" /> to limit the number of special trading houses.  Has the Minister a limit in mind? There is also no provision in section 2 in regard to whether licences are renewed annually, biennially or every five years. If someone gets a licence do they have it for all time? What are the terms, if any, in which a licence would be revoked by the Minister?  Moreover, if such circumstances arose for the revocation of a licence, would there be any penalty for breaches of the law if people were granted a licence on the basis of satisfying section 2 (5)? If it happened after two years that they acted improperly in some way, what provisions are in the Bill to take back the licence? There are no provisions in the Bill which means there is a major gap in the legislation.</P>
      <P>If CTT have a lot of input in processing applications, there should be a small fee for this licence which would cover their expenses in examining the cases. CTT are entitled to a small reimbursement for the work involved.  I also mentioned last night that legislation sets out criteria by ministerial order to be laid before this House.  I appeal to the Minister to bring proper orders forward as to how one would satisfy the criteria of getting a licence, not just the nebulous terms outlined in section 2 (5) which are totally ambiguous.  Who decides how professional a structure is or the level of ability required? These are very important questions and as Deputy Bruton said, when these appeals come before the Circuit Court the intentions of the Minister will be totally irrelevant.  The law is relevant.  I do not criticise this Bill in many of the petty ways in which I could criticise it.  There are major omissions in the Bill.  It is a very short Bill which does not state the terms of the licence, how long it will last and, if anything goes wrong, the way in which a licence can be revoked.  It does not give the breaches which would result in revocation.  All these should be set out in a ministerial order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (7) states that appeal is made to the Circuit Court.  What precedent is there for the use of the Circuit Court in <Col N="3596" /> such manner for appeal? It is not right or proper that we should put applicants through expensive litigation or that expensive litigation would decide who would and who would not get a licence on the basis of having the best senior counsel.  That is not fair.  As the Minister of State already quoted tonight, in response to the sensitivity of the EC he is basing this on some loose statements of the current Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, concerning the SME policy. The fact of the matter is that there is no reference whatsoever in section 2 to SMEs which are clearly defined as a particular size of company and a particular scope of company.</P>
    <P>This legislation, on appeal to the Circuit Court can get into serious trouble and cause many people serious expenditure. Could the Minister not have used the CTT as the processing unit, with a right of appeal to the Minister in the way that planning permissions were done some time ago? There should be strict criteria so that there will be no political gerrymandering, as Deputy Keating outlined. What is the position of subsidiary companies here? Last night Deputy Michael Higgins made at least one useful point, the one I noticed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The one useful point that I noted was the notion that free competition exists and marketing practices flourish in free competition.  That is not altogether true when you take into account monopolies.  I want to know whether in terms of large conglomerates two subsidaries of one multinational could get a licence. Are there any restrictions? Subsidiaries of the one corporation could trade against each other and get the benefits.  I hope the Minister is taking a note of this point.  Two subsidiaries could thus avail of all the benefits under this legislation.  I have tried to be as brief as I can in order to get some opening up <Col N="3597" /> of the discussion on section 2, which is full of gaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a large number of issues.  We gave some thought to bringing in very detailed legislation pinning down every last detail, but I want to remind the Deputies about the business expansion scheme precedent in this area.  I have said many times when in Opposition that one of the difficulties of that scheme when introduced was that it ran to a substantial length and every conceivable loophole was covered in the legislation, with the result - and the Minister of the day went close to admitting this - that the business expansion scheme for the first year of its operation did not take off.  We had to take a second bite at it before it loosened up and not kill it with bureaucracy.  I was aware of that precedent and instead opted for a shorter, enabling Bill which would allow us to get this legislation off the ground quickly.  There is a whole range of issues which Deputy Yates has raised that I could have included in the Bill like the number of licences, the renewable features, the application fees, the questions on subsidiaries.  We decided against that for speed.  Also there was a very real commercial problem that until you see the early days of such a scheme you do not really know the creativity and ingenuity of the people who set out to put loopholes in it.  You cannot provide for all those matters in legislation at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>You can try.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a decision to have a relatively straightforward piece of legislation going through CTT to the Minister and with the Revenue Commissioners having to be satisfied also.  We felt that was a speedier way to get on with the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the number of licences, I am on record, and I think the Minister for Finance is also, envisaging between 30 and 50 of these.  We have not pinned this down because, quite bluntly, it depends on the number of serious <Col N="3598" /> minded companies that come forward to establish these houses.  Early indications are that there is a sufficient level of interest out there.  We have had sufficient inquiries already to indicate that we could perhaps head towards those numbers.  If the House feels that we should put a particular number on it, that is fair enough, but it is not necessary.  Let us see what the demand is like.  They have to satisfy conditions which are quite stringent. We shall be publishing an explanatory leaflet which will lay down the conditions in small print with which each applicant will have to comply before we finally grant the licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that be legally binding?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will not be. The CTT, the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners are involved.  The Revenue Commissioners subsequently issue permission for the tax relief.  What is in the memorandum will be taken account of by these three groups of people in deciding whether to give the go ahead. While it is not legally binding, it will be taken very close account of by the people making decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what a court would do in that matter.  A court would obviously take account of the operational structure of the scheme.  The number of licences is between 30 and 50. That depends on the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no limit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That would have made a nonsense of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no limit, but it would not have made sense to have had licences in the first place if you were <Col N="3599" /> going to hand them out like confetti.  That would then run the risk of their becoming an accountant's plaything, and we do not want that to happen.  We want serious minded companies to comply with the three main conditions of marketing, organisation and structure - and by structure I also mean financial structure &mdash; so that the corporate entity would be sufficiently strong to undertake, as the Bill says, successful exporting.  If they are serious, properly structured and properly financed we will be happy to give them a licence.</P>
      <P>The renewability of the licence is something to which I gave much thought.  In the end I decided not to build it into legislation for the main reason, first of all, that I wanted the legislation to work. I did not want to start out by frightening off people by talking about how a licence could be revoked.  Deputy Keating or perhaps Deputy Bruton spoke of the difficulty of getting people to invest.  I want people to invest in special trading houses. I did not want to frighten them by giving some indication that some frivolous reason the licence might be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation there is no facility to revoke the licence. We can revoke the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is seriously suggesting that we should have something which says one can revoke a particular licence, what does one say to somebody? I want people to invest substantially in these.  I am not sure that we should go into the market place seeking substantial investment, up front money, and then perhaps for political reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;perhaps a revocation of the licence.  I felt that one would <Col N="3600" /> not attract serious investment if the revocation clause was in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be very cautious about this scheme particularly with regard to the number of licences.  If there is any indication of people abusing the scheme it will be looked at and suitable amendments will be considered.  This is only the start of building these companies. The application fee is a good idea and one which I will suggest to CTT.  CTT already charge for documentation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Can they charge if it is not provided for here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they are already charging for reports.  I will have to look into this from a legal point of view.  I agree with the suggestion that there should be an application fee.  I will certainly look at the notion of trying to get CTT to charge something which will cover their costs.  In the context of legal advice, my understanding is that it would not have to be in this Bill for CTT to charge a cost to cover the processing of the application.  If I get legal advice to the contrary, I will look at the Bill again at an appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Circuit Court, the Attorney General tells me that this is necessary in order that the Bill will not be challenged in the courts for failure to provide adequate redress to an applicant. I take the Deputy's point that adequate redress could be provided in another way. The Attorney General's office say we should have something here which will prevent the Bill being challenged because there is not adequate redress available to an applicant.  Consideration was given to doing it within the system, that is making the original application through CTT, <Col N="3601" /> with an appeal to the Minister but the difficulty with that structure is that the Minister has responsibility for CTT and one is still playing in the same pool.  An outside applicant would not feel comfortable sending an appeal to the Minister in charge of a State body having had that State body, on which the Minister originally relied for his decision, make a decision in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there precedents for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have precedents before me this evening for that. The Attorney General's advice is that there has to be adequate redress anywhere there is a licensing system or where an applicant might feel aggrieved.  We ruled out an appeal to the Minister on the basis that it would be too much in house as it were.  An appeal to the Circuit Court made more sense.  Anybody can decide to go to court in any case under existing legislation.  There is no question of preventing people from going to court. I hope the Circuit Court procedure will be speedy, but the main thing about it is that it is independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be more independent than you think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the system we run, that the courts are independent.  To leave an appeal procedure within the system between the Minister and CTT would be asking the people who turned it down to be the judges again.  Our approach is sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a slight contradiction in some of the approach to the Bill. On the one hand Deputies want to build in a lot of detail which covers every angle so that people cannot abuse the system and on the other hand when they find something that ties somebody down there is nervousness about it being there at all. Because the Bill is so short and because it does not have chapter and verse on all the questions raised, that might be a reason for having an outside body such as the Circuit Court involved in appeals. <Col N="3602" /> Anywhere there are licences there can be charges of a political content in the decisions.  It is very important that Ministers of this Administration and of future Administrations are totally protected from those charges.  An appeal to somebody outside the political system is probably far more sensible.</P>

They will get the tax benefit.  If they do not make money they will be liquidated anyway and there is nothing we can do about it.  A profit motive has been built in here.  I am interested in the prospect of subsidiaries.  I will look closely at it.  It is very much a legal matter because the definition of a subsidiary in accountancy and legal terms is quite complex.</P>

      <P>When the Minister speaks about serious investment in trading houses he is overstating the mark.  The requirements for a trading house are purely and simply a telephone, a telex and the skill and the knowledge to sell.  I do not see any serious investment in that and I do not see how it can be a criteria for giving such a licence.  On section 2 (3) the Minister says he will require information in relation to applications to be furnished to him.  Would the Minister require from such applicants that they specify to him which goods they are prepared to engage in for export? How would the Minister consider those who would be engaged in the export of food products in competition with a semi-State company like An Bord Bainne?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am out looking for it but there is a need for it.  Many Deputies have referred to the fact that we have put a lot of money into fixed assets down through the years.  Virtually everybody in this House has talked about the need to invest in marketing.  They talk about the fact that it could cost £10 million to launch a brand on the UK market and that it would cost millions to launch a brand on the German market.  If somebody seriously wants to market Irish goods they will have to spend money to do it.  It could cost upwards of £10 million. It is not a question of making a telephone call to place goods; it is a question of trying to launch brands and penetrate markets.  Any of the big companies who have successfully penetrated markets <Col N="3604" /> abroad will tell you that it was a multimillion pound business.  The section is worded as it is to try to attract people with substantial money behind them to a limited number of companies so that they can properly attack the marketplace.</P>
      <P>Marketing is a very expensive business. It does not get capital allowances like machinery and the write-off which industrial investment gets.  There is a school of thought which says that marketing expenditure is as important as industrial investment in the fixed assets sense and therefore, that kind of expenditure should also be kindly looked upon.</P>
      <P>I know what the Deputy is thinking of and that is what I want to avoid.  He is thinking of the person with the <i>Financial Times</i> and a cup of coffee who is selling over the telephone and making a profit on the State in between.  That is the kind of back-alley operation I do not want to permit under this legislation.  This is why I have deliberately suggested that we have these conditions and a licensing system so that we can license people who appear to be marketing seriously.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, obviously we will inquire what kind of goods they have in mind.  I imagine that is part of the information we will be seeking.  There will be no requirement that a special trading house confine their activities to particular products or markets.  The scheme allows a fully commercial approach to be adopted.  The special trading houses will be free to select the areas of activity which are best suited to their own expertise. I expect that commercial reality coupled with market knowledge and market skill will determine the products and markets that are chosen.  It is likely that companies will grow in confidence as the months and years go on and I hope we all learn from their experience.</P>

      <P>This Bill is incorrectly titled.  The Minister is talking about a marketing company and not a trading company.  The definition of a trading company is a company that trades in goods that are established in the market-place by way of brand name or whatever. <Col N="3605" /> The Minister is asking companies to set up, go out and do the market research and come back and have no involvement in manufacturing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Deputy is saying but I have to make myself very clear in relation to this.  I am particularly looking for people who will have some investment in these companies and who will go out and find the market-place. I do not want the kind of person who as you quite rightly described will just get on a telephone and make a sale for a product that is already well known. I do not envisage someone sitting down and ringing America and asking someone there if he would like to buy Kerrygold or Waterford Glass.  I envisage people finding products among Irish manufacturers and then trying to penetrate markets with those products.  It is all about marketing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, there is no way one will sell products abroad that are not well known.  He admitted that it could cost £20 million or £30 million to break into markets.  One cannot break into other markets with Irish products which have no international image and no brand and which cannot be sold here.  That cannot be done.</P>

      <P>We are not that far apart in relation to this.  The purpose of trading houses is to go and find the markets.  The Deputy is suggesting that a trading house cannot sell a product unless it is branded and already well known in the market-place.  If that was the case trading houses would not be needed because the manufacturing companies could sell goods that are already well known.  I want these trading houses to make goods well known and take goods which are hardly known at all now and go out and sell them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A properly run trading company with good money behind them, a good marketing plan, a good structure, a good organisation and a licence will be able to go out and penetrate the markets professionally.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite the contrary, Deputy.  The trading houses are a market-led organisation who will come back to the manufacturers and buy from them.  No trading house is going to buy from a manufacturer who does not have a good product.  The manufacturer will be involved totally because he will not be able to sell his product either directly or through a trading house unless it is good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As the debate developed it has emerged that very little thought has gone into this legislation, that it is little more than an election slogan that has been cobbled together into legislation. While I would not be as emotive as Deputy McCoy, this will at best only <Col N="3607" /> displace existing export marketing activities and would be much better operated on a commission basis using the manufacturers' goods, their logos getting a 5 per cent cut and using the skills of the manufacturers.  Nobody is going to buy the goods and resell them.  Nobody is going to take those risks and succeed.</P>
      <P>The Minister in response to my questions told me that someone who is given a licence to operate one of these trading houses can have it forever and that there are no legal facilities to withdraw the licences.  This is incredible.  He said the reason for this is that it might scare off investment.  Surely we have many schemes, such as the business expansion scheme, which operate on the basis that it is critical that you must not scare off investment.  There was a debate as to whether the licences should be for three years or five years and whether the equity should be locked into small recipient companies.  If there is no time limit on these licences there will be no control over any company who might trade fraudulently and who might be in breach of several different regulations, who might be behind in their tax affairs, who might sell goods under different labels of origin than they should, and who might get up to all sorts of nefarious practices. There is no control in this legislation to combat this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister puts his hands in the air and asks us to accept a Bill with two sections in which there is no control whatsoever. I would not mind if there was some facility for penalties or to check people but this is a blank cheque. It is a <i>carte blanche</i>.  Once people have a licence they can turn around and do as they please without fear of what the Department might do because neither the Department nor CTT, as admitted by the Minister and as evident by what is in this Bill have powers to deal with any problems that might arise.  The Minister confessed that this is quite appalling.  I ask him to withdraw this Bill or to come back on Report Stage with a provision that any licence would operate only for a period of three, four or five years.  I am <Col N="3608" /> not saying any less than three years because I do not want to scare off investors.  If the Minister feels that five years is fair, so be it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also include in the Bill a provision that if, in the view of the Minister who granted the licence, again by way of a ministerial order to which I will refer in a moment, the company have breached certain regulations, that that licence could be taken from them forthwith. That stick should be held over trading houses so that there would be some format and code of conduct under which they would operate.  The Minister does not know who is going to get these licences or who is going to end up running the trading houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>It is easy to say that but when this legislation is passed and the Minister has no control over the checks or balances in the operations of trading houses it will be too late.  Once a licence has been issued that is it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the main substance of a Bill that is rapidly falling apart. Section 2 (5) of the Bill deals with the basis on which a licence should be granted. It states: &ldquo;... the structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the sale of export goods&rdquo;.  What does that mean? I could bring this section to experts in CTT, experts in the UK or private expert consultants in Ireland and they would all have a different interpretation of it.  If, for instance, Deputy Higgins goes in and applies for a licence and is refused one on that criteria, he can produce experts in the Circuit Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that, the Minister is paying them.  I conclude on three points. It is impossible to ask the House at this hour of the night in a three hour debate to approve a Bill giving tax concessions and major licences for these special trading houses without any powers to revoking them whatsoever no matter what they do or whether they break any law. If they get a licence it is for eternity. There is no time check every three years or five years. Because the Bill was circulated only in the past few days and because it is being rushed through before the summer recess, I specifically ask the Minister to look for more detailed criteria for issuing and withdrawing licences by way of ministerial order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get rid of those few points quickly. I should like to be clear about this because, from the tone of the Deputy's comments, it is <Col N="3610" /> important I do not mislead him in any way.  On the question of revoking licences, under existing legislation they cannot be revoked. The Deputy is correct about that. The Revenue Commissioners grant the tax concessions, as they do to all companies and all individuals, on an annual basis. If the Revenue Commissioners decide in a particular year not to give the tax concession because they are unhappy about the definition of manufacturing in that year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Or because their tax affairs are out of date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, or something like that. If the Revenue Commissioners decided not to give the relief then they would not give the relief; for example, if the nature of the trade changed then the tax relief would obviously be withdrawn and without the tax relief the licence is meaningless.  I am satisfied that there is a system here which will prevent tax abuse and that that is built into the ordinary revenue system. While the licences will not be revoked, the tax concession may be withdrawn by the Revenue if they are not satisfied on an annual basis.  Regarding CTT, I should like to put on the record that CTT fully support this scheme and have been advised of their role regarding it. I discussed it with the chief executive on a number of occasions. There is no question of CTT not being enthusiastic about this scheme. I have every confidence in them that they will carry it through. In talking earlier about subsidiary companies, I should like to make it clear that any limited company can get a licence whether it is a subsidiary or a holding company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say we have some reservations about this Bill. There might be people who would be interested in knowing that we have no intention of calling a vote. I put that on the record as it might allow certain people who have a slight trepidation about it to pursue other activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy's nerve is always as healthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let silence be my charity in the circumstances. If I were the Deputy I would be inclined to ask that that be struck from the record lest it be hung around his neck.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that it is unfortunate we are taking all Stages tonight because as the Minister has rightly said there are a number of points to be considered.  We talked about definitions earlier and some amendment which I had put down which he would have liked to consider even through the form of words might not have been exact. We have been saying for the past few weeks that it is not ideal to take all stages of a Bill in one lump. It was Deputy Yates and the Minister who agreed the Order of Business. We did not agree it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future I would think it would be a healthier procedure to take Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage separately so that points made on Committee Stage can be given reasonable consideration. In due course the Minister can come in here and say, &ldquo;I have thought about it&rdquo; and the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; or the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. It is not acceptable that an amendment is rejected, not because it does not commend itself in essence to the Minister but because there is raised somewhere a question mark about the precise form of words in the amendment. I am not a draftsman but one does the best one can. <Col N="3612" /> In my view the time between Committee and Report Stage is for the purpose of putting proper words on the amendment. That is not being facilitated not by us but by a ludicrous approach to the ordering of Business. This is another example I intend to quote tomorrow morning when I get an opportunity.</P>
    <P>I gather that I should refer to the amendments on section 2 in total. I will not be unduly tardy about this. I do not accept that the Minister's reply to the amendment to subsection (4), about which I had some reservations, was appropriate. I still believe there is a problem for people who are genuinely bona fide but who may for one reason or another be asked to go through too many hoops for whatever purpose. I appeal to the Minister to consider it. Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not grant a licence in respect of a Special Trading House unless he is satisfied that the applicant for the licence has the structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the sale of export goods.</P>
    <P>If I were an applicant I would ask what is meant by a structure, an organisation and marketing ability necessary to undertake the sale of the goods. I would ring the Department and ask if they had a blueprint or a set of criteria which could guide me. Perhaps such exists at present but we should be more explicit. I concur with the Minister in what he is trying to do which is to create a successful Bill as fast as possible. If the definitions of structure, organisation and marketing ability are not just woolly but do not exist, then I certainly would not risk putting my money on an investment application which had no frame of reference against which to make a judgment. I am suggesting that the Minister accept the amendment which is to add the following words:</P>
    <P>and the Minister shall provide, to any applicant who so requests, a clear statement of the criteria in accordance with which the structure, organisation and marketing ability shall be judged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3613" /> That need not be part of the legal data associated with the Bill. It could simply be a general guideline as to the kind of ballpark profile we are talking about. For example, the Minister said the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; would include a reference to financial standing or status. That seems to be reasonable. My understanding of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; would have much more to do with the organisational chart of the company and how it was structured and not to do with the financial capacity of the company. This would probably be more appropriate in relation to subsection (3) where he talked about other types of information. I accept that &ldquo;structure&rdquo; could include a reference to a bank, to a financial profile of the company, but it is a word which is nowhere defined in the Bill. Organisation might very well refer to the layout of the company, its organisation chart, its business plan or to whatever proposals it had. Marketing ability is a totally judgmental concept. I can only assume that it would be based on experience or on a presentation accompanying the application to the Minister. Anyone who decides to make a judgment on marketing ability, unless it is based on an application sent in by somebody with a proven track record in the area, is making a very questionable, nebulous area of judgment.</P>
    <P>Marketing ability is totally judgmental and totally nebulous. I would be concerned about that unless it is somehow defined. I am not asking that it be defined in the Bill. I simply ask that an applicant has a right to say &ldquo;I want to know what the State is requiring of me&rdquo;. That is not unreasonable. Fundamentally, what we in this party are trying to do is to roll back much of the nonsensical regulation that is clouded in woolly language and lost in the dim and distant past and which can bind and circumscribe people who want to get on with the business of living and of developing their potential. Here is another fabulous, in the literal sense of the word, set of concepts against which no citizen can have a right of appeal, except to a court and the court can have no right of appeal except to law, and the law is as set out here. Those three words <Col N="3614" /> are too loose and at the very least a background paper or statement against which somebody can make a requisite judgment. If we had more time, which we do not have or if the Order of Business was different, we would be proposing precise definitions of all the key terms which should be part of any reasonable Bill.  I am not asking for that.  I ask that we get a statement. That is not an unreasonable request and I hope the Minister will accede to it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is agreeable I want a brief amendment to subsection (7) at line 1. Essentially the section proposes that whenever the Minister refuses to grant a licence in respect of a special trading house the applicant for the licence may, within 21 days after the service of the notice appeal. I wonder where this period of 21 days came from.  I began to think what would happen if a group of people got together and formulated an application. In practice people work to a fairly business-like system but 21 days seems to be unreasonably short to have to consider the rejection of the application, perhaps receive professional advice on it, hold one or more corporate or board meetings and frame an appeal. I do not see why the period should not be extended to twice that length of time, which is approximately six weeks and which is not unreasonable or illogical. I ask that people be given a reasonable time, bearing in mind that the whole purpose of the appeal will be to submit a considered response to the detailed reasons for the rejection of the application. That will require some time. It will also require time for an entrepreneur or potential entrepreneur to decide whether to risk the costs involved in a court appeal. The provision of 21 days seems a bit inflexible.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take on board these three amendments which would make the Bill more intelligible to the applicant, more sensitive and constructively inclined towards the achievement of the Minister's objectives and more in accord with the spirit of what the Bill in total is trying to achieve. I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on thses points.</P>

      <P>I, like Deputy Keating, would like to make a number of suggestions in relation to procedures and practices. I am not opposing any section of this Bill on behalf of my party. We are making suggestions on procedures and practices in the absence of making any legislative exclusions. As Deputy Keating pointed out, we are doing this because of the preclusion, with the connivance of the principal Opposition party who have abandoned their oppositional role, of the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party from participating as they might like to with regard to the legislative process.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the reference to licence in the context of the position of people who make application for a licence for closely related products. In the determination of the application what degree of exclusivity will apply in relation to range? I have sympathy for what the Minister is trying to do here but the rather porous nature of it is reflected by his telling the House that he is trying to encourage those who have identified products which might be sold abroad &mdash; this is the question of the development of markets for products that are manufactured in Ireland &mdash; and at the same time, telling us that he is working back from the market-place. He will understand when I say that I have some sympathy for him because on the one hand we are trying to sell products that are manufactured here and on the other hand we are trying to identify products that are needed on the market place. Of course there are perils involved on both sides because there is no incentive to purchase products for which there is no identified market niche and, conversely, if you have market niche identification and you have no product supply line, there is that gap in the middle. The missing link, and it is <Col N="3616" /> not the Minister's function to agree to satisfy us totally on this this evening, is the absence of an export policy. If you had identified niches you would be able to relate your productive strategy towards that and you would be able to draw these two ends of the thing together. It would facilitate the Minister very much more. I suggest it would enable you to have a clearer policy with regard to issuing licences because if you get a licence into your Department from the market-place you are not only in danger of having to make a decision as between that application and subsequent ones which might be better, perhaps better in the exploitation of that particular market niche, but you are also more open because it will require a great deal of procedures in your Department to identify and address the question of the large multinational. For example, if the multinational with an enormous marketing budget has located products in some of its subsidiaries and has a product which has reached a particular point of research and development but has not established a market-place, they could make an application to the Minister for the 10 per cent corporation tax incentive. The Irish taxpayers would effectively bear the burden of a number of quite nebulous products. We may be an adjunct to the marketing budget of some of these companies unless this question of subsidiaries, even traced down to commodities, is handled.  It is a real danger. I am not saying that it should place impediments in your way, I emphasise the point to be of assistance as you may find you are being taken to the races.</P>
      <P>The question in relation to the revision of company law cannot be solved this evening, yet the Minister says he will issue the licence to the person who is over the company so far as that can be identified, to an individual.  He has inherited all the defects in relation to the problems of doing that in the existing structure of company law. The greatest abuses that have taken place have been in relation to liquidation and distinguishing personal liability from corporate liability. That is lurking in the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to transfer pricing, I am glad <Col N="3617" /> the Minister is sensitive to that because we are wide open to abuse on it in relation to commodities. We will not go over the old territory of the question of definition, but what is the position of people who purchase commodities for trading on? Deputy Yates is upset about the necessity of my moving into commerce, but if I like to use parliamentary language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was selling soap last night. If an individual establishes a company and purchases commodities which will be sold, that is trading. It is a further adjunct to the general problem about transfer pricing.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister on the question of licensing and revocation. One position of caution in relation to licences is the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. They are very interesting as an extreme example. The circumstances in which a person could lose the licence for a public house are extraordinary. There are several layers in this. Having lost your licence you would try to transfer it in advance and so forth. However, that licensing system was there as a very far out sanction. You could examine different legislation and discover different degrees of sanction. Let me give one that was offered in prospective legislation in relation to revoking a broadcasting licence when the criteria had not been met. That was very difficult because when you had people on the air how did you get them off? They would have established their listenership so they would put enormous pressure on you and so on.  I will not be provoked into saying that people would ignore that one. However, there are precedents, prospective and historic, in relation to the use of revocation procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worry about a point raised by Deputy Keating in relation to the absence of revocation procedures. The licence having been granted, it follows from my point about a number of licences not being granted in areas that are identifiably similar, that you will have not only an exclusive and irrevocable asset that you can state as an asset, but you will have a strong possibility of the subsidiary selling <Col N="3618" /> to another subsidiary using the licence that had been granted as a stated asset. The asset could in turn be used on the basis of share capital and investment. You could find people investing on a very shaky foundation in relation to the circumstances in which the licence had been issued. My interest in the stock market goes beyond that. I can see possibilities there. I suggest that the Minister assure the House that not only will there be an explanatory memorandum available to people who want to apply, but that these are issues which are being adverted to. I wish we could do this more tightly in legislative terms.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's point about an appeal to the Circuit Court but this is somewhat symbolic because the Bill in section 2(3) and in several other sections specifies the ability of his Department to keep requesting further information so you could wear down the applicants. I am sure it is in there and let the Minister use it against all the pirates I have described. However, before you get to the Circuit Court at all you would appear to have satisfied every request for such information as the Department asked. If you lift that log you then have 21 days to resurrect yourself to go to the Circuit Court, and may you make it through that. Perhaps those sections are there for areas of caution but they stand further back than the Circuit Court procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (5) is specific. I worry about language and it is the balance of terms that I am interested in because I do not want to repeat Deputy Keating's point in relation to what is meant by marketing ability. I am worried about the balance between the three requirements, the structure, the organisation and the marketing ability. I can conceive of many people who have a contribution to make in relation to marketing ideas but who have not the structure. The question of the financial structure has been mentioned by the Minister, and this would be one of the definitions of the structure. I worry that such a person would be precluded in a sense unless he can find somebody who can meet that criterion.</P>
    <P>Then we move to the question of <Col N="3619" /> organisation and people starting up for the first time and their ability in relation to people who are trying out one product after another. The trading organisations work in the commercial world by making a number of market probes with products. One of the most difficult commercial decisions is the decision to pull back. A great example of that is the product developed in a company like Guinness who made a number of attempts to launch products on the market and pulled back on some of them while others were markedly successful, one of them in almost every US market at present. When the Minister talks about 30 or 50 that he envisages does he mean that really very few of those will be essentially new people in any of the three criteria? How would you balance them? Is this not saying that one would have to think of putting together such a corporate entity? We keep coming back to the abuses and how open we are to abuses by very large international trading companies. What is to stop them saying, &ldquo;You in a month of Sundays would not qualify for a licence; we would, but if you give us your access to the market and if you put the personnel who are now assisting you in with our application we will put the package together and take the tax spread&rdquo;? So many companies in Ireland are much better at looking at the speculative advantages that they are about producing, trading, selling or paying their taxes, minimal as they are.</P>
    <P>These are specific questions in relation to the groundwork of the legislation. That is all I have to say on section 2 and I have put it all together to assist the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the three Deputies for their contributions. I have some sympathy with a great deal in what they said in a number of areas. My only regret is that we do not very often seem to find the time between all of us to give everything the attention it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal with the points as best as I can in those confines. Deputy Keating rightly asked about the amendments, particularly the three amendments in his <Col N="3620" /> name. In regard to the third one about the 21 days and 42 days, I have no hangup about the number of days and would be reasonably well disposed, if he is agreeable, to make it 28 days. If we can agree on that I can do it straight away because it will not present me with a difficulty at Attorney General level or necessitate holding over the Bill until the autumn. That is my petrification, as it were, about agreeing to other words. While I have sympathy with some of the words, in order to keep the export policy that I am pursuing going, I need this legislation for the summer so that I can get these companies up and running, financed and into the marketplace by the time the Dáil comes back. Probably that is ambitious but I prefer not to wait until autumn to do that. If the Deputy is happy with 28 days I am prepared to put an amendment in my name to the Chair that in subsection (7), line 1, we delete &ldquo;21 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;28 days&rdquo;. Is that procedurally in order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an improvement and I have no desire to cause any difficulty on it.  Is the reason the Minister does not want to accept the 42 days that it might cause some problems with the Attorney General? Is that correct?</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 2 put down by Deputy Keating he spoke about the question of marketing ability and the need to explain to people in advance what type of criteria will be used. I have the draft of an explanatory leaflet which we will give to anybody who inquires about trading houses. It lays out in full the criteria which we will be using. <Col N="3622" /> It asks, for example, for memo and articles of association, financial structure, management expertise, marketing expertise, proposals for product identification, marketing plan, projected main markets and projections for the first two or three years of business. They are some of the items which we will be looking for.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum covers the structure, the type of companies that will qualify, the licensing procedures, the definitions, the capitalisation, business and marketing plan, qualifications and expertise.  It also gives details needed to process the application. I am satisfied it is not necessary to encapsulate in legislation the fact that this document will be given in advance to anybody who applies for information so that they will have plenty of time to prepare their applications and they will be under no illusion as to the quality and quantity of information which we need to facilitate the processing of the application.</P>

      <P>In that case I do not think it is necessary to amend the section. The one thing about including it in legislation is that it will be fixed to some extent. I could see the situation arising where the practice of reprinting or updating it could fall by the wayside.  It is a little more arbitrary than I would wish but at least if it is in existence and is part of the package I will not oppose it. The people will have a chance to know by what standards their organisational structure and marketing abilities are being judged.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's approach. I wish to repeat that this explanatory document will be made <Col N="3623" /> available to any person or company who inquires about it and they will be fully aware of the criteria which will be used in assessing their application.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked me two questions which I omitted to deal with. He was concerned in particular about the question of displacement which was the main point in his Second Stage speech. I gave much thought to this question and it concerned me at the start of my examination of this proposal. I am happy it will not happen because the 10 per cent tax relief applies at present to manufacturing companies. Assuming they have good markets, are selling their products abroad, are getting the 10 per cent tax relief and they are receiving money from the business expansion scheme, there is no incentive for them to deal through a trading house. They would have to pay the trading house, because obviously they must make a profit, and also have to apply for a licence. To have to go to all that trouble for no financial gain would seem to make no sense. The block of exports of a manufacturing company will not be interfered with by a trading house because the manufacturing company is already getting the benefit and there is no incentive to go to a trading house. Therefore, a trading house would be unlikely to displace it.</P>
      <P>If by displacing one means that a trading house cuts in on a market and directs the exports to a different manufacturer, one can take two views: it is either displacement or competition. To that extent one could say there is displacement with every company that receives IDA grant aids. I am not talking about a marketplace that is fixed, where manufacturers get X per cent and trading houses get X per cent; I am talking about a market that is growing. There are new and exciting markets and they can be tapped by trading houses. I am reasonably happy that there will not be any displacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the applications, one area which we will consider very carefully is the question of displacement in so far as we can judge it. We are in favour <Col N="3624" /> of new exports and incremental exports. Assuming the marketing plan, which is assessed by CTT and recommended by them, applies to new areas and does not muscle in on existing manufacturers, then a licence will be given in the ordinary way. The position cannot be black and white. You cannot guarantee that a particular product that is being sold by a manufacturer will not be sold by a trading house next year but to worry unduly about that is to question the whole nature of competition. There is no incentive for a manufacturing company to deal with a trading house. If it already has its markets and is doing a good job it will hang on to those markets. A trading house will have to go elsewhere and find new products and new markets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates wondered why we could not just have agencies that would sell on commission. I thought about that but I wanted to set up a separate risk unit with different people taking responsibility. The trouble with selling on commission is that the manufacturer still takes the risk of finding new markets. An agent can find new markets and feed them back to the manufacturer but the buck stops with the manufacturing company and the goods still belong to them. There would be no risk in any real sense taken by the agent. If he did not sell he did not get his commission and did not worry about it. The risk of producing is still taken by the manufacturer and that is why I rejected the notion of selling on commission and decided on trading houses. In that way the trading house must buy the product from the manufacturer and he will be happy because he has got a sale. Whether the trading house then makes a sale onwards is entirely a matter for it. It sets up a new risk area; the profit motive is there and anybody owning and running a trading house would be very determined to make some profit from it.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think the commission rules would work in that the risk would remain with the manufacturer. I want to take some of the risk from manufacturers so that they can sell in the future to a trading house and do what they are best <Col N="3625" /> at. By definition, manufacturers are production led people. There is an argument which says that if they are not very comfortable with foreign marketing in particular we should not force them into that area. There is a view, which I have a lot of sympathy for which says that foreign marketing should be undertaken by specialists in trading houses and let the manufacturer continue with the manufacturing and sell to the trading house. I am not sold on that completely but it is a structure they might develop. It is better than leaving the risk with the manufacturer which would be the case in the commission on sales. I was worried about those points but having looked at them carefully I can see they would not achieve what I want to achieve.  I will reply to the points raised by Deputy Higgins when he is in the Chamber, if I get an opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In his amendment Deputy Keating asks that information be made available to the applicant and the Minister has said that this information is available in the form of an explanatory memorandum. He outlined its terms and from what he said I am satisfied that the content is what it would be. However, will the Minister tell the House the legal status of that document? If an applicant who is refused a licence and who brings an expert consultant in the export field to court to say that as far as he is concerned the applicant has an adequate structure in his marketing outlet, adequate organisation and ability will he get a licence under appeal? I asked that question on three occasions but the Minister has not answered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What legal status is there for detailed regulations? For example, new concessions were given in the Finance Bill last week to the tourist industry in that they were made eligible under the business expansion scheme but there was a specific provision to the effect that this was a three-year development plan approved by Bord Fáilte.  Why is it that the Minister of State cannot say, as was detailed in the Finance Bill, that a format outlined to the satisfaction of CTT must <Col N="3626" /> be made available as a criteria for the licence? If an appeal goes to the Circuit Court the legislation will not stand up to any type of scrutiny. The Minister's officials can produce an explanatory memorandum outlining what is reasonable to satisfy the criteria of section 2 (5) of the Bill but the judge may take a totally different interpretation because the memoranda are so open-ended and are not accompanied by any guidelines.</P>
    <P>I would have thought it would have been proper to amend subsection (5) by adding something to the effect, to the satisfaction of guidelines to be published by CTT or the Department or regulations made by order of the Minister. That is the format used by other Departments when introducing incentive-based systems. I understand why the Minister is using the Circuit Court appeal system and I support him in that.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a brief reply to points about displacement and commission. Time will tell who is right in regard to them.  Will the Minister outline the legal provisions in the Bill to stop anybody operating under the guise of a trading house from approaching a supplier and saying: &ldquo;I will buy your goods as a trading house to re-export them. I cannot afford the cost of the working capital to buy this stock and I will have to have a credit period of 100 days on the assumption that I, the trading house, will have resold those goods within that 100 day period&rdquo;?  That is de facto a commission basis. What provisions are there in the legislation to preclude manufacturers and trading houses from entering into contracts of sale for resale that would give them credit terms which will in effect be phoney and will put trading houses on the status of operating on a commission basis?</P>
    <P>The difficulty with the Minister's trading house proposal is not that there will be manufacturers queueing up to utilise the services of them. Of course there will. Anybody in the manufacturing business wishing to export will be only too delighted to get some whiz-kid of a trading house to take his products off his hands without the worry of whether they <Col N="3627" /> sell on the export market. The problem will be, given the failure of a national trading corporation in the past that the trading houses will function properly and make a profit. In telling us the legal status of the explanatory memorandum the Minister should explain why it does not conform to the practice in legislation passed last week? Why do we not have the format laid down in the Finance Bill? What restrictions are there concerning the terms that trading house and manufacturer may enter into as regards credit periods?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the example given by the Deputy, the best way to illustrate the position, in my view it would not fit the definition because the Finance Act, 1980, referred to in the legislation, deals with the selling of goods. Goods would have to be sold by the manufacturer to the trading house before they would comply with the legislation.</P>

      <P>Credit terms are a commercial arrangement but the title to the goods would have to pass before there is a commercial transaction. That is why I did not want to go for the commission basis.

    <P>The Deputy asked me about the legal basis for this document. There is no specific section in this Bill which refers to this document. The Deputy is quite right about that. What I am saying for the record of the House is that this explanatory document is available. I will put it in the Library of the House thereby <Col N="3629" /> ensuring it is fully available for inspection. It will be in the Library as soon as it is finally tidied up.  It would be a reasonable view to take of the Bill that before you ask for information common courtesy dictates that you indicate roughly those areas in which you expect people to give you that information.  You cannot just ask for information without saying what information you are asking for.  By definition we have to ask them for specific information because that is in the Bill.  We will ask them for information. That will be expanded to explain what we mean by the information we are seeking.  I am happy that that is covered. You cannot say in legislation that you must get information from somebody without listing the information you need. What I accept is not in the Bill is that further explanation of that information and that is being made available by memo.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins raised a number of points on the Second Stage last night and I have not had an opportunity of responding to him.  I had a lot of sympathy with his comments in regard to the banking system in that if they are going to help us with the export drive we are trying to get going they are going to have to take a lot more risk.  I said that publicly many times.  Deputy Higgins asked how do we stop an application getting into a market that is already flooded by other companies.  The only way we can do that is by competition.  I am not trying to take competition out of the marketplace. These are private sector companies who want to make a profit and we are giving them a tax incentive to go and make that profit so, by definition, they have to compete with each other.  I cannot take that competition away from them but there is a clause in the Bill which says that we will have to be happy that they are likely to trade successfully.  If an application came in and there was already a trading house operating very successfully in the particular product area concerned, we would be likely to take the view that the second application to trade in exactly the same area at exactly the same time might not be successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3630" /> You could probably take that view and, therefore, because it is not likely to be successful you could decline it or indicate to the applicants that there might be a better area in which they should concentrate their attack.  I cannot take the competitive element out of it but we will be trying to steer the companies into being parallel both in products and in markets because we will have access to all the applications.  In fairness the IDA and CTT already do that.  The IDA seek to steer people into parallel areas, they seek to prevent or slow down on grant assistance where there is over capacity in a particular area.  We will try to do all that.  We will make every effort to get parallel companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins was also concerned about the company law aspect.  The Bill mentions the Finance Act.  The Finance Act says a trading house is a company which .... So it is a company.  It is a company under the meaning of the 1963 Act and now the 1987 Companies (No. 2) Bill.  These trading companies will come under the new 1987 Companies (No. 2) Bill which makes a substantial step forward in the tightening up of company legislation.  I am hoping they will be strongly policed in that regard.  The Revenue Commissioners will be keeping a very close eye on these companies anyway from a tax point of view because they will have to assess their taxation on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins talked about subsidiaries, as did Deputy Yates.  I am concerned about that.  It is coming out of this debate that there is a subsidiary situation. We will have a very close look at that situation to see whether we can do anything to prevent people trying to abuse the subsidiary structure.  We will take it company by company and try to prevent abuse by passing it down the line.  Transfer pricing is something to which one is always open but again we will be looking for genuine trading houses making genuine purchases and genuine sales.  If there is any indication that there is any other kind of abuse going on I will have no problem amending the legislation <Col N="3631" /> or bringing to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners what is going on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins and Deputy Yates were concerned about the problem of revocation.  The tax relief situation means that the Revenue Commissioners will be operating with this respect on an annual basis.  Without the tax relief the licence means nothing so in a way there is a form of revocation although not the type that Deputy Higgins would perhaps wish.  I deliberately did not put it in because I did not want this thing to be stillborn and I honestly felt the business expansion scheme was stillborn.  It was covered in red tape and regulations and bureaucracy and systems and structures and at the end of the day most people just did not bother with it.  It has to be amended before it took off in any real way.  I did not want people to read all these heavy regulations, throw their hands in the air and say: &ldquo;that is one thing we are not getting into because by the time we satisfy everybody we will have no trading house&rdquo;. I did not put in that revocation clause because I did not want to start off in a negative way but I am happy that we can police these companies without that particular clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We have dealt, satisfactorily I think, with my second proposed amendment.  I accept what the Minister says in the spirit of section 2, amendment 3.  I would like to come back to the question of revocation and the whole area of the licence and so on.  I have a fundamental problem and I think the Minister will accept the integrity of the point.  It seems to me to be both unrealistic and unprecedented to give with no end date a licence which is an asset the company has, saleable on the open market, and the only alleged revocation clause is that the tax relief by the Revenue Commissioners might be withdrawn or withheld.  I do not think the latter would hold up because, if people have a licence, they have a licence and they could very well go to the courts on <Col N="3632" /> the basis that they are being discriminated against in some fashion. There would have to be some basis for withholding the tax relief as a way of revoking.  There would have to be a purpose or a reason why the Revenue Commissioners would do that and those reasons are not set out anywhere.  It seems to me that where a licence exists, the licence is in place as long as the recipient conforms to some set standards of performance.  The trouble is that that is not said anywhere here and it seems to me that once a person has a licence they effectively have the right to throw out the window all those criteria which actually got them the licence.  All the material the Minister will be asking for painstakingly they can, the day after, tear up.  They have the licence and I do not think there is anything the Minister can do about taking it back from them.  If the Revenue Commissioners decide to challenge that and say they will not give the tax relief they might very well be able to take the Minister to court.  It is fundamentally wrong to have a situation where a person has a licence and has it for ever at virtually no charge and does not even have to conform or be seen to conform to the basic requirements for which this whole Act was set up.  That is a fundamental problem with this section and I think it should be addressed before we close.  I am not asking for a long reply on section 2.  I am simply saying that that is a problem which should be dealt with.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Vocational Teachers' Contracts.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to you for deciding on the urgency of this matter.  I raise this matter because, as we come to the end of this Daíil session, we will have very few opportunities of reviewing what I believe to be some disastrous consequences in relation to a section of the teaching profession which is already very vulnerable.  I am referring in particular to part-time teachers in the vocational sector.  I want to be as economical as I can in the time allocated to me.  What I want from the Minister are a number of assurances and I want to express my concern about some fundamental accountability in policy matters in relation to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter during this session because many of the part time teachers involved will have their contracts terminated in September.  It is expected that the House will adjourn very shortly, next <Col N="3634" /> Friday.  It is not clear exactly when it will resume, but it will certainly be later than the date on which the part-time teachers' contracts terminate.  The position is that they will have lost their jobs before we meet here again and before the Minister and I, as spokesperson for the Labour Party on Education, have an opportunity to address this problem.</P>
    <P>You ruled on a number of questions I submitted by way of Private Notice Questions, and I accept your ruling that this is a matter to which we might have adverted in the budget debate or even in the Estimates, but the fact is that last year the current Minister very courageously challenged an aspect of our accountability in relation to educational expenditure. Then the spokesperson for Education in Opposition, she said she felt the allocations to the vocational education committees should be made available in time for them to make decisions in relation to hiring staff.  She made another point at that time for which I commend her.  She said she felt it to be an absurdity that elected representatives of Dáil Éireann would not be able to find out what were the allocations to the vocational education committees.  I agree with what her sentiments were then.  It is highly improper that I as an elected representative and spokesperson for Education of a party, dealing with people who are my constituents &mdash; teachers and children &mdash; find myself in the position of not knowing what allocation has been given to particular vocational education committees.  This is not answered by saying this is an exercise in local democracy, sending out the allocations to the vocational education committees at some stage and then saying that the vocational education committees can be expected to exercise their mandate very properly.  Let us not judge the merits of the vocational education committees because that is not the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the deafening silence from the vocational education committees around the country, knowing they will hand on to chief executive officers in individual institutions the job of deciding which part time teachers will <Col N="3635" /> be let go and which part time teachers will be retained.  I discussed this matter today with the teachers from one regional technical college in which there are 17 temporary whole time teachers and eight full time equivalents made up of part time teachers.  They said that having gone to the head of the institution involved he could not tell them which of them he will choose to keep and which he will choose to let go.  Not only am I excluded from this process but these teachers and their trade unions are excluded from this process, and in employment terms, as far as the part time teachers are concerned this is making a hangman of the chief executive officer.  That is what is involved, no more and no less, and I am worried about it.</P>
    <P>Part time teachers have a sufficient degree of disadvantage at present.  They often arrive at institutions without specific provisions being made for rooms for them.  There are practical difficulties about their access to basic equipment and the availability of such special equipment as speedy access to photostating and so forth as they might require.  They have no security of tenure which is psychologically damaging, but perhaps that need not concern us this evening.  In relation to those who are losing, and who will lose, their jobs, they now have the disadvantage of the recently introduced requirement of nine months social insurance stamps for qualification for unemployment benefit.  This means that some of them will be forced to depend on unemployment assistance.  Such temporary teachers have no regular payments if they get sick.  The qualification certificate required for disability benefit makes it very unlikely that a part time teacher could get recompense.  Already these people suffer a great deal of disability, but now many of them stand in danger of losing their jobs altogether. This will be devastating for them.</P>
    <P>In trying to raise this matter before the Dáil recess, I submitted a number of Dáil questions.  I submitted Question No. 177 for written answer on Tuesday, 23 June 1987.  I asked the Minister for Education <Col N="3636" /> the number of whole time teaching equivalents allocated to each vocational education committee in the years 1986 and 1987 in respect of teachers on the common basic scale.  In reply the Minister said that it would not be in accordance with normal practice to supply the information sought in respect of each vocational education committee.  This is the very reply she objected to when in Opposition.  I had hoped that the practice which had excluded Deputy O'Rourke from information in relation to the vocational sector when in Opposition would have ended when she became Minister for Education and that I could expect not to be excluded from the information which she so ardently sought &mdash; and indeed which would have had my support &mdash; if I had been a Member of the House at the time because I believe in such parliamentary accountability.</P>
    <P>In Question No. 178 put down for written answer on Tuesday, 23 June 1987 I asked the Minister for Education to state the amount of money allocated to each vocational education committee in respect of discretionary pay and committed non-pay.  I was informed that resources are allocated to vocational education committees on a calenadar year basis, not on the basis of the academic year and that the information in relation to the 1988 calendar year will only become available when the Government have completed their deliberations and taken decisions on the 1988 Estimate. The reply went on to say that information relating to the financial year ending 31 December 1987 is given in the form of a tabular statement which was to be circulated in the Official Report.  I have not yet received that statement and, therefore, I still do not have the information. I have sought specific information in a number of written replies and I know why I have not received such information.</P>
    <P>In Questions Nos. 180 and 1811 asked a specific question in relation to the architectural courses in Bolton Street College of Technology and if they could operate efficiently given that part-time and temporary whole-time staff had been advised <Col N="3637" /> they would not be replaced.  The Minister correctly took up one point in the question which was not strictly accurate at the time, that teachers had not yet been told they would not be re-employed.  Good luck to the Minister for seizing that straw. However, the course to which I referred in Bolton Street depends on part-time, professional staff who cannot be hired within the restrictions of the allocations made to the college.</P>
    <P>I also asked a related question as to whether the teachers in the regional technical colleges are financing their own salary increases in view of the fact that the allocation of moneys for pay in 1987 has been cut by I per cent this year and that it is proposed to cut them by 3 per cent in 1988.  The reply attempted to shelter under the skirts of the VEC because it was that the implications for the regional technical college and the Government's budget statement in relation to staffing the public service had been the subject of discusssions between the Department of Education and the Department of Finance. It went on to say that following these discussions the Department issued circular letter No. 45/87 to the vocational education committees concerning this matter.  It also said that responsibility &mdash; and this is the nub of the matter &mdash; for the introduction of specific measures in order to comply with the terms of the circular letter rests with the college authorities and the vocational education committees concerned.  The reply also stated that the Minister had no reason to believe that essential activities in the colleges in question would be curtailed by the application of the Government's decision.  I have referred to all these questions to indicate the repeated efforts I made to get the necessary information to answer the question addressed to me as spokesman on Education for the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister also informed me that, in the case of the architectural courses in the College of Technology, Bolton Street, she was not aware that any formal advice of the kind indicated by the Deputy had been issued.  It is like saying &ldquo;I have not read the news of your death <Col N="3638" /> yet&rdquo;.  The Minister said in one reply that she had no reason to believe that essential activities in the college in question would be curtailed by the application of the Government's decision.  What does she mean by &ldquo;essential activities&rdquo;?  Has she circulated to the colleges concerned a list of essential activities?  The Minister set up an epistemological investigation of considerable effort when she used the term &ldquo;peripheral activities&rdquo; in Bundoran. I presume, therefore, following my good training in logic that there are essential activities and peripheral activities.  What is the distinction?  This was part of the trail of unanswered questions after the debate on the Education Estimate, for instance, on related matters, particularly services.  If there is such a threat to part-time teaching, how then can the courses be advertised and offered to the public? What is the position of existing courses which have just commenced, those which are half way through to which commitment has been made and those which will terminate shortly?  The Minister said publicly that anyone who started a course could feel reasonably sure they will finish it.  What about the question that arises every summer when the different education authorities advertise courses on a whole series of subjects for adults within the general rubric of education for women, specialist groups and so on?  Are those courses peripheral or essential?  No doubt the answer will be that it is a matter for each individual VEC to make a decision as to what is essential and &mdash; to use the Minister's new word in the vocabulary of education &mdash; peripheral. The kind of people who have been worried about the distinction between existential and peripheral are not etymologists, they have been the beneficiaries of courses run by the vocational sector and include those depending on courses provided in prisons and by the National Council for Travelling People who have offered a number of courses. There are 2,000 traveller children between the ages of 12 and 15.  Only 10 per cent can be persuaded to go on to second level education and only 2 per cent stay for more than a year or two.  Yet <Col N="3639" /> we are told that the VECs involvement in the training centre programmes and the different junior programmes cannot be assured because the VEC cannot say that such programmes will continue.  This even means that the programmes for prisoners &mdash; often victims of multiple deprivation &mdash; will not continue.  There is a whole mix of courses which could qualify under the general heading of adult education.</P>
    <P>We know that the pathetic sum of £500,000 out of £1.26 billion has been cut by £100,000.  Will any courses relating to community and adult education in which the vocational sector are involved continue? To use the new logic of the era in which we live, they will find a way.  That phrase is spreading like a cancer throughout the educational system in a number of schools at different levels.  It really means that they will gather contributions to make up the gap in the State provision. Mrs. Thatcher marched down that road when she wanted to disestablish State education in Britain and to go back to private education to reproduce a privileged and class ridden elitist society.  It is not very republican to be going back to the idea of reliance on private contributions to make up for State cuts, particularly when they affect the underprivileged and those most removed from the educational system.  Perhaps &ldquo;they will find a way&rdquo; does not extend only to the kind of contributions which might supplement matters.  Perhaps people will suggest that there can be a clawback from teachers' pay, increases which they would have normally got and which were negotiated through different public agreements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for giving me the opportunity to come into the House even at this late hours &mdash; it is the cinderella hour but I have not my Prince Charming waiting for me.  I was intrigued by many of the points made by the Deputy, particularly at his quotation &ldquo;They will find a way&rdquo;.  I am anxious to know where the Deputy got that very evocative phraseology; it certainly was not from me.</P>
      <P>The original delay in the VEC budget arose because we did not have our own budget until the end of March.  Normally it would be introduced at least two months earlier in the Dáil and would be available sooner to each CEO.  I met the TUI today who spoke of the matter of informing them as well as the VECs of their allocations.  The Deputy spoke about the deafening silence of the VECs and the CEOs but, indeed, they have not been at all silent.  I have heard from and met many of them.  There is no difference now in the operation from that of previous years.  The Deputy, in quoting some replies from me, implied that I was sitting up late thinking of ways in which I might circumvent replying to the Deputy, but it is not that way at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The passion is still here within my heart but I cannot express it perhaps as fully as I might like to.  The committees are notified annually, as the Deputy knows, by my Department of <Col N="3641" /> their teaching staff allocations for the following sessions which are given under the subheads of full-time day courses, apprenticeships, adult education, cooperation with other institutions.  The main allocations are for full-time day courses.  These have already been notified to the committees.  The allocations are given in whole-time teacher equivalent units so that a committee may employ whole-time or part-time personnel according as best suits the needs of their educational schemes.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy is genuinely interested in the provisions for prison education and for serving the needs of the training centres for travellers.  These are made under the subhead of co-operation with other institutions.  Prior to 1972, as we know, these facilities were provided to a limited extent and were carried out at that time by prison officers with no educational qualifications.  Then the Department of Justice, being enlightened, adopted a new policy and a co-ordinator of education was appointed. Because we needed to extend and to expand these and bearing in mind that the Deputy has said that the majority of persons in custody come from deprived backgrounds and have a poor self-image, together with a high level of functional illiteracy and lack of vocational skills, it was felt that the vocational education committees because they had been equipped and were flexible would be best able to provide suitable programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice approached the City of Dublin VEC and set up in St. Patrick's Institution.  It spread out from there.  The system developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis throughout the seventies and following a review at the end of the seventies it was decided to formalise the structures.  Under the system which has now been in operation for several years, my Department allocate teaching hours to a number of VECs in respect of prison education.  The procedure is that the needs of the particular centre are discussed between the co-ordinator of education whom I mentioned above and the VEC in whose area the centre is located. <Col N="3642" /> The VEC then request a teacher allocation from my Department and an allocation is made on that basis.  The allocation for the service in 1987-88 is currently being considered and will be issued to the relevant committees.  I can assure the House, and am glad to do so tonight, that adequate provision will be made for that purpose, comparable in real terms with the provision for last year.</P>
    <P>Appropriate teaching provision for travellers was made in respect of 1986-87. This included provision for centres for the 12-to-15 year old group as well as for the centres for the 15-plus age group operating in association with AnCO.  I know that there are a number of these centres in Galway, as there are also in Athlone.  The appropriate provision for these centres will shortly be issued to the relevant committees.  The issue of these part-time hours is no different now from what it was in any other year.</P>
    <P>I have already put on record that the money allocated by me to the VECs in 1987 for adult literacy and community education free of charge or at nominal cost, with particular reference to disadvantaged areas, is a sum of £400,000, which exceeds by £50,000 the amount allocated for these activities in 1986.  That fact needs to be repeated because of the constant reiteration of the claim that there was a cut in the allocation last year. There has, in fact, been an increase in the allocation.  The increase of £50,000 in one year underlines the commitment.</P>
    <P>Other adult education courses are expected in the main to be self-financing. The cost of tuition for these courses, inclusive of a stipulated overhead loading, is traditionally expected to be covered by the fees payable by those adults.  I have in mind here adults who have already benefited from full-time day education during their school days.  One aspect of these courses is to provide for adults who participated in the full-time day school system but who left without any formal qualification.  The people I have in mind are those who are functionally literate but who might wish to sit one or other of the Department's examinations in order to obtain a formal <Col N="3643" /> accreditation and who may feel that, despite having reached a fair level of education, they are at a disadvantage in that they do not possess a formal departmental examination certificate.  At present I am engaged in consultation with the IVEA to see what provision might be feasible in this area of adult education. When talking about the provision of prison education, I meant to say that we supply the teaching hours.  That is the arrangement between ourselves and the Department of Justice, but the other operational costs are borne by the Department of Justice.  I am satisfied on three matters, first that the number of part-time teaching hours will be allocated very shortly to the various VECs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Therefore the courses should stay in operation.  I know from my own contact with Deputy Higgins that he feels quite passionately and quite sincerely about the points he has put here tonight.  I fully accept that.  I assure him it is my wish that the part-time allocation of hours would be conveyed as quickly as possible to the VECs.  I have asked my Department to make those arrangements accordingly.</P>

    <P>Reductions in milk production within the EC and elsewhere should go some way towards improving the market for <Col N="3358" /> butter-fat.  Ongoing diversification by the Irish dairy industry away from butter production will also contribute to a solution. Already there are signs that this is taking place and it is expected that butter production in the current year will be considerably reduced on last year's figures.</P>

In addition because of the relatively greater importance of agricultural trade to Ireland, we continue to benefit more than most other member states from the free access to the comparatively high priced Community markets.</P>

      <P>Prices of horticultural products fluctuate in accordance with supply and demand, but there is no information available to me to indicate any abnormally low priced imports.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of An Bord Glas is, of course, to encourage increased output of horticultural products so as to reduce import requirements.  The interim board is already giving active attention to this matter.</P>

      <P>The seasonal nature of our milk production pattern derives from the fact that the dairy industry is grass-based. This in turn results in the concentration of milk production during the grass growing season and a reduction in the seasonal imbalance depends primarily on the economics of producing milk outside that season.  Such a reduction can be achieved by the further development of products capable of providing returns to producers sufficient to cover the extra costs involved in winter milk production.  The main focus of Government policy on the milk sector is designed to encourage the production of products of this type.</P>

      <P>The dipping of sheep for the purpose of controlling and ultimately eradicating sheep scab is a statutory obligation on farmers under the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965.  The order originally required dipping to be carried out twice each year &mdash; in summer and autumn &mdash; but was amended in 1977 to provide for one dipping only, to be carried out in the period 15 September to 31 January.  The <Col N="3370" /> change was made on the recommendation of a special deapartmental veterinary committee which studied sheep scab and determined that the mite which causes scab does not generally become active until late autumn or winter.  Experience elsewhere has shown that the only effective way to control the disease is by proper dipping at that time of year.</P>

The availability of the financial and personnel resources necessary to implement any particular proposal is of course also an important factor.</P>

      <P>The Government have allocated the first £7 million of revenue from the national lottery to the areas of youth and sport, arts, culture and the Irish language, and the health of the community.  The amenities on the canal and the hotel at Robertstown, County Kildare would not qualify for assistance under any of these categories.</P>

    <P>However, since the revenue from the lottery this year is now forecast to be significantly in excess of the £7 million already forecast, I am consulting with my colleagues on how best to allocate the additional resources now likely to be available.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, since many traders engage in a number of different business activities, the commissioners are therefore not in a position to identify VAT liability for specific trading activities from VAT returns.  Accordingly, use is made of statistics from other sources e.g. consumer expenditure data, where available, in order to furnish estimates of VAT payable by a particular trade sector, such as the hotel industry.</P>
      <P>The statistics of VAT due which are included in the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General are of a global nature and are furnished from Revenue records.  These records are compiled from traders' returns and from estimates of tax raised by the Revenue.  They are not compiled on a sectoral basis.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the commissioners that the improvement of statistical information within the resources available is kept under continuing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputies are referring to the rate of excise duty on residual fuel oil used by the ESB which is 7p per gallon and the rate of excise duty on the same oil used by industry which is 3½p per gallon.</P>
      <P>On 1 December, 1981 the rate of excise duty on residual fuel oil used by industry was reduced.  This reduction was intended to be of direct benefit to manufacturing industry and accordingly it was not extended to cover the residual fuel oil used by the ESB.</P>
      <P>In the present very difficult budgetary situation any reduction in this tax would have to be compensated for elsewhere. It is not a question, therefore, of whether this amount of tax should be raised but one of where it should be sought and the Government consider that the present mixture of taxes, including the excise duty on residual fuel oil used by the ESB, is necessary in present circumstances.  It is not proposed at present, therefore, to reduce the rate of excise duty on residual fuel oil used by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant in this context to point out that consumers of electricity benefit from the fact that electricity is not subject <Col N="3388" /> to VAT.  This is in contrast with the situation of other fuel users since all other fuels are subject to VAT.</P>

      <P>At the request of Kerry County Council the Commissioners of Public Works agreed to lease an area of ground to the council for the extension of the burial ground at Abbey Island in Derrynane Historic Park in the Caherdaniel area. The offer was subject, <i>inter alia,</i> to an archaeological investigation of the site to ensure that there were no archaeological remains in that area.  A preliminary excavation carried out in 1985 found that there were archaeological remains there and established that portion of the site should be preserved.  A further excavation would be required before a decision could be made as to whether grave spaces could be made available in another part of the site.  Kerry County Council have indicated that they have no funds for further excavation.</P>

    <P>Under EEC rules, there is free trade in poultrymeat.  Imported poultrymeat, which accounts for about 15 per cent of our market, comes principally from Northern Ireland.  The only effective way to withstand competition from imports is through improved efficiency in production, processing and marketing.  In this connection, poultry processors here have benefited significantly through the availablity of national and EC grant aid. A total of 24 projects involving investment of £15.8 million have been approved for national and FEOGA grant aid, totalling £8.7 million in the poultrymeat processing area since 1980.</P>

      <P>The Department's office in Maynooth is run by a branch manager who provides office accommodation and staffing under contract.</P>
      <P>The growth in the number of unemployed claimants has undoubtedly placed considerable pressure on both the accommodation and the staff of all the Department's local offices.  The situation at each office is kept under constant review and improvements made as soon as circumstances allow.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties at the office in Maynooth, revised signing arrangements which provide for the signing and payment of individuals over an extended four-day period were introduced last year and this alleviated the pressure to some degree.  The branch manager also endeavoured to improve the situation by purchasing a dwelling house which he intended to convert into an employment office but was refused permission to do so by the planning authority. This decision was upheld on appeal by An Bord Pleanála.</P>

    <P>The anticipated payment to Telecom Éireann in 1987 includes some charges in respect of the cost of the installation of a new telephone system in the Department in 1986 which were incurred in that year but not billed until 1987.  The savings already accruing from this new system can be gauged from the fact that payments to Telecom Éireann in 1984 and 1985 were £325,000 and £393,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>Similarly the introduction of new postage procedures have reduced costs from £108,000 in 1984 to their present levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of payments effect of the gas from the Kinsale Gas field to date is about £1,300 million. It is difficult to estimate the balance of payments effect to the entire field but given that about 60 per cent remains to be consumed a rough indication of the total balance of payments effect might be £3,000 million.</P>
      <P>To the end of 1986 BGE had paid £245 million to the Exchequer.  It is not anticipated that any dividend payments to the Exchequer will be made by BGE over the next few years.</P>
      <P>These nil payments are due to a combination of low oil prices and hence lower profit margins for BGE and the need to support the development of gas distribution in Dublin and other centres along with further already planned capital expenditure on gas infrastructure. BGE's anticipated profits over the period are expected to be reduced by at least £35 million.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to project accurately the level of royalty payments over the next ten years as these payments are related to the annual contract quantities agreed between Marathon and BGE and are also related to variation in the price of the gas which is determined by an oil price related formula.  However, if the contract quantities and price are stable for the period, the estimated annual royalty payments over the next ten years will be broadly in line with the 1987 levels.</P>

The decision to build the Cork-Dublin 18&rdquo; pipeline was contingent on a compressor station being constructed at a later date.  The diameter of the pipeline was decided after an economic evaluation of the size and timing of compression facilities, and the decision taken then was the most economical one.  A total expenditure of IR£18.4 million was approved and it is expected that this figure will not be exceeded.

Based on current gas offtakes and estimated reserves, gas could continue to be extracted from the Kinsale Head field until the end of the century at least.

Under a decision of the Supreme Court of July 1986, Marathon are not obliged to deliver more than 60 billion cubic feet per annum from the Kinsale Head field.</P>

The Department will continue to do its best to reduce expenditure in these and other areas.

      <P>I considered the working party whom I have established, and to whom I referred in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 110 of 16 June 1987, to be the most appropriate means of initiating consultation on a comprehensive review of building society legislation.  The question of appointing the building societies consultative council will be considered when the parameters for the nature and <Col N="3426" /> scope of future building society activity have been set out in legislation.  Section 8 of the Building Societies (Amendment) Act, 1986 does not require representation from mortgage holders but, in my opinion, consumer interests should be adequately represented on the council when they are established.</P>

      <P>The authorities of St. John's national school, Sligo, have prepared tender documentation for a proposed extension to their school comprising a general purposes area and certain ancillary accommodation, and now seek authorisation to proceed to invite tenders. Because, however, of the prior claims of a large number of national school building projects involving the provision of urgently needed classroom accommodation, which are also seeking authorisation to invite tenders, and because of the difficult financial position generally, I am not in a position at this time to authorise the invitation of tenders for the project at St. John's national school.  The Primary Buildings Branch of my Department will be keeping the position under review and will be in touch with the school authorities as soon as it may be possible to authorise further progress with their project.</P>

      <P>Arising from the agreement reached between the school authorities <Col N="3453" /> and my Department on the amalgamation of the convent girls' and the boys' national schools at Ballymote, County Sligo, my Department have asked their professional officers to undertake a feasibility study in relation to the extension of the convent national school so as to provide the required accommodation of eight classrooms, a general purposes area and the usual ancillary accommodation.  My Department will communicate the outcome of this study to the school authorities.  At this early stage of architectural planning, I am not in a position to say when the actual work of building may commence.</P>

      <P>My Department are proceeding on the basis of incorporating the old vocational school building in Swords into an expanded school complex located on adjoining lands.  It is estimated that, by proceeding in this way, there will be a saving of at least £1/4 million relative to the cost of building an entire new school on another site.  The purchase of lands by the VEC, other than the lands adjoining the old vocational school, does not now arise and will not be sanctioned by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have indicated to the VEC that they should make whatever arrangements are necessary so that the two rooms and associated facilities in the permanent building at the old vocational school, which are at present occupied by the community council, are available from next September for school purposes. Because of the anticipated extra numbers next September, there is no alternative to this course of action.  There is no further room on the existing site for an additional two prefabricated classrooms and, even if the situation were otherwise, it would not be reasonable to accommodate students in yet more prefabricated classrooms whilst community groups occupied some of the permanent accommodation which was originally provided for the students' needs.  It would not be acceptable, in the <Col N="3455" /> short term, to incur expenditure on more temporary classrooms than necessary or, in the longer term, to build new permanent accommodation duplicating the school accommodation occupied by the community council.</P>
