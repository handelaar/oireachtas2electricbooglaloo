      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 15, 16, 9, 17 and 5.  It is also proposed that the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 15 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 12.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that all stages of No. 16 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 7.00 p.m. this evening by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Marine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that a motion of this kind should properly be put on the Order Paper?  This is a guillotine motion which is open to discussion in the House and should be put in advance on the Order Paper rather than be moved in this way.  I have no objection to this particular debate being terminated in this way but I want to put <Col N="2220" /> down a marker because there may well be objection in the future in relation to other matters of this kind.  The procedure that should be followed is that a motion should be put down and it should be open to discussion.  This practice has grown up in recent times and does not comply with standing orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a practice which has grown up and the Chair is conforming to that recognised practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked if the Taoiseach would keep the House informed about developments in relation to the detention of the vessel <i>Eksund</i> and the Taoiseach agreed to keep the House informed.  Would the Taoiseach arrange for the Minister for Justice to make a statement today of the information that is available?  I would point out that the matter has been the subject of some debate in another Parliament which is less directly affected by the whole affair than this House, and I would ask that an arrangement be made today under which the House would be informed of the full extent of this matter.  This is even more worrying because it seems that a person described as the logistics officer of the Provisional IRA was on board the vessel with an apparent connection still there from Libya.  The matter seems to be extremely sinister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if you have had an opportunity to read your <i>Cork Examiner</i> this morning, but if you did you would find on the front page an article headed &ldquo;Cutbacks Restrict Search&rdquo;.  There are implications in this in so far as the Minister for Justice, in reply to a Private Notice Question I had put down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer for a moment to the matter raised by my colleague Deputy Sean Barrett who was asking if the Taoiseach would arrange for a statement to be made to the House.  I submit that it is perfectly in order for my colleague to ask that question on the Order of Business.  I will repeat the question, will the Taoiseach arrange for the Minister for Justice to make a statement to the House today indicating the reasons for the apparent divergence between the report we have now received and a statement made by the Minister in the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a clean request for a statement, yes, but I am not certain that was what the Deputy was seeking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did ask for a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is perfectly clear to me that what Deputy Barrett <Col N="2223" /> was raising was the question whether the Taoiseach would arrange to have a statement made in the House.  It seems to me that is perfectly in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that a statement at this stage would be advantageous in the whole matter but, certainly, in so far as the matter referred to by the Deputy is concerned the newspaper report is without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for the Environment if he has received the report from the Deputy Secretary, or the Assistant Secretary, of his Department who is also the chairman of the interim board of An Foras Forbartha, with regard to proposals for the dispersal of the activities of that board.  If the Minister has received that report, will he make it available to the House as he promised in reply to a question last week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to unnecessarily clutter up the Order Paper with questions when they can be readily answered in the Chamber.  The Minister was very co-operative and gave an open and generous assurance to the House that he would make the report available. Since the report was to be completed by the end of October the question I have put to the Government is reasonable. Has the report been completed, will it be <Col N="2224" /> made available?  Let us be sensible in the way we do our business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately before reporting progress on the last occasion when we were debating this Bill, I had reminded the House that what we were discussing on these amendments has as much to do with biological facts as with questions of law.  It is no harm to go over those facts again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that, in theory, DNA profiling can be carried out on any cells of the body which contain DNA.  The tests may be carried out on cells from any part of the body, including for example skin tissue, muscle tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue or blood; any cell taken from a person's body which contains genetic code material will have the same code as <Col N="2228" /> any other cell taken from any other part of the same person's body.  The tests cannot be performed on such bodily secretions as perspiration or urine, since these are non-cellular and do not contain &mdash; except possibly by chance &mdash; cells which carry the genetic code material on which the tests are carried out.  Techniques have been developed which enable DNA profiling to be carried out on blood samples, semen samples and samples of vaginal secretions, and no doubt further techniques will be developed using samples from other parts of the body as the need arises.  However, I understand that, if skin cells were to be used for this purpose, the taking of a sample of sufficient size to provide a satisfactory quantity of suitable material would involve surgery.  Simple scraping of the skin, which was mentioned by some Deputies, will produce mainly dead cells in which the DNA will have degenerated, and taking a sample in such a fashion is not satisfactory for any of the techniques of testing for parentage purposes.</P>
    <P>The taking of a blood sample, on the other hand, is satisfactory for all known techniques of biological testing for parentage purposes.  It is a substance which is regenerated naturally by the body, without the creation of scar tissue that skin sampling would involve; and it involves minimal discomfort and risk to the person giving the sample.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that, in this part of the Bill, we are giving a court the power to direct that a blood sample be given &mdash; in other words, that a court offers the person the alternative: either allow your bodily integrity to be interfered with, or else run the risk that an adverse inference be drawn against you regarding the parentage of a child.  The minor infringement of bodily integrity that is involved in the supplying of a blood sample is clearly justified in such circumstances.  But the effect of Deputy Shatter's amendments is that the court would have the power to direct the taking of samples of organs of the body by surgical procedure, or the taking of samples of appropriate bodily fluids other than blood.  I do not think that the giving of <Col N="2229" /> such powers to the courts is justifiable; I have already shown that it is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate on these amendments has been coloured by an assumption that the courts would interpret the expression &ldquo;blood test&rdquo; as somehow not applying to DNA profiling.  This assumption is absolutely unwarranted, and flies in the face of both the biological facts and the plain language of the definition in section 41 of the Bill.  The expression &ldquo;blood test&rdquo; is defined as any test carried out under the provisions of Part VII of the Bill and made with the object of ascertaining inheritable characteristics. As I have already said, all types of testing for parentage can be and are carried out on blood, including serological analysis, enzyme analysis, tissue typing and DNA profiling.  It is quite clear, therefore, that all these tests are covered in the definition. Faced with that plain language, I cannot see how any lawyer could advise a client to waste time and money trying to persuade a court otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister said, it seems he had moved part of the way from where he was the last day. The points I was making in favour of the amendments tabled are that they refer to blood tests and that the means used to determine paternity have moved on from the concept of blood testing to genetic testing, DNA fingerprinting, to which the Minister correctly referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>DNA fingerprinting can be derived from the taking of blood but also from skin tissue.  I never heard anyone suggest that it would be necessary to remove a bodily organ for skin tissue testing to be used in this context.  There is a method for preserving a skin scraping, scientifically used, which does not require anything other than a scraping of the skin on the inside of the hand which preserves the skin and allows testing to be carried out. I regret that the Minister should seek to exaggerate the powers the courts would have conferred on them by the amendment I tabled.  I am anxious to ensure that the courts have powers to enable the most modern scientific techniques to be used for the purpose of determining <Col N="2230" /> paternity and it seems quite clear that in the manner in which this is dealt with in the Bill and in the reference to the taking of blood samples and blood tests, it is not wide enough.  The concept of bodily samples which I am seeking to replace with the definition of blood samples refers to the taking of a sample of bodily fluid, which will include blood or bodily tissue.</P>
    <P>A similar provision was introduced by the Family Law Reform Act, 1987, to English law and it did not give rise to any controversy.  My amendment is on the lines of that legislation and the provision in the Act to which I referred was introduced because the then English legislation which enabled the carrying out of blood tests did not include the type of scientific testing that DNA fingerprinting can give.  Contrary to what the Minister said, it is clearly arguable under this Bill by someone alleged to be the father of the child that the court can only require him to undergo the conventional type of blood testing and that DNA fingerprinting does not fall within that ambit. The Minister's interpretation and mine might eventually have to be decided by the Supreme Court.  The job of this House is to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the legislation we enact.  If the Minister accepts that it is in the interests of children generally that this power for DNA fingerprinting be extended to the courts, I do not understand why he will not accept the amendment I tabled.  I never heard it suggested &mdash; certainly not in the Parliament at Westminster or in any other legislature where they have tried to update the law in this area &mdash; that an amendment of this nature would allow the courts to order the removal of organs from somebody's body.  It is an extraordinary argument to introduce at this stage as it does not fall within the context of the amendment which is very carefully drafted.  What is important is that the courts should be able to use the modern techniques of genetic fingerprinting to determine paternity disputes.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as his arguments are not tenable. <Col N="2231" /> The Minister has shifted his position from last week as he clearly referred to DNA fingerprinting and genetic testing. If it was the intention in the Bill originally to cover this area &mdash; and I do not believe it was &mdash; it would have been possible for an amendment to have been tabled by the Minister which referred expressly to genetic fingerprinting and DNA testing.</P>
    <P>Other scientific techniques may be developed in future of an even simpler nature.  The problem with the Bill is that the taking of a blood sample is the only mechanism that can be used.  A tissue scraping might be a good deal less dramatic for many people and a lot simplier. The way these techniques are developing, within a very short time the necessity to use blood sampling will have ceased.  By incorporating my amendment, we provide for the taking of blood samples, for the use of tissue and ensuring that the courts can require the DNA or the genetic fingerprinting test to be used to determine paternity disputes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that this Bill is, for the first time in the area of paternity, extending to the courts the power to order blood tests.  Someone who does not co-operate in those blood tests or in the testing I have described can have a presumption drawn against them by the courts.  Tests of this nature are not unique.  We provided legislation to have certain tests in the road traffic area many years ago.  It is only in this area that anyone has regarded it as a matter of controversy.  As it is now agreed that such testing should be provided for, we should provide the best legislative mechanism for it to ensure that no ambiguity or difficulty arises from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed and indeed dismayed at the Minister's response.  I would have thought that the Minister would have looked more closely at the proposals put forward in the body of these amendments.  From what the Minister said this morning he agrees with <Col N="2232" /> the position advanced by Deputies seeking to advance the cause of these amendments because he has admitted that scientific tests and the improvement of DNA will develop and that there will no doubt be improvements to the process in time.  For that reason we are supporting the notion that the limitation of the tests within the Bill as it stands should be broadened away from the narrow ground of blood alone to the wider prospect by including the words &ldquo;scientific tests&rdquo; as is suggested.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that DNA finger printing has developed to the extent where it is far more revolutionary and expansive in its achievement than the previous 100 years of genetic investigation. We have made more progress in the last decade in this area than scientists had managed in the previous 100 years. The development of this type of work is progressing at such a rate that the whole process of genetic fingerprinting will improve and in addition there will be a far greater number of areas of scientific identification available to us.  The amendments are seeking to leave the Bill in such a way that courts can avail of scientific development as it progresses.  The Minister in his earlier remarks accepts that and I cannot understand why he cannot accede to these sensible amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks to pour cold water on what has been suggested here by introducing the notion of surgery as the only means of taking samples necessary for this kind of work.  That is not the reality. In April 1986 I attended a conference in Glasgow organised by the International Association of Forensic Scientists where it was made clear that even a minute sample of tissue, or of other bodily substances necessary to carry out this type of testing would be sufficient.  To suggest that a person would be subjected to surgery is extremely ridiculous and I hope the Minister will correct that impression before he departs from this House.  The state of the arts at the moment clearly indicates that we do not need anything of the drastic nature the Minister indicates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to giving undue powers to courts.  These are matters that <Col N="2233" /> will be decided by judges appointed under the Constitution and they have a duty to uphold the bodily integrity of all persons, including litigants before the courts.  To suggest that giving this type of power to our courts would encourage them to head off in a surgical attack upon the bodily integrity of our citizens is ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the law members of the Garda Síochána with no surgical experience are empowered to remove samples from the body of a suspect. Under the Criminal Justice Act of 1976 a suspect, detained for the purposes of a garda inquiry can have scrapings removed from his hands or finger nails by the Garda Síochána.  We have already referred to the road traffic legislation and the powers of the garda, assisted if necessary by a general practitioner attending at the station, to take samples for the purposes of prosecution.  Are we suggesting that the certain establishment of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock is something less important than the investigation by members of the Garda <Col N="2234" /> Síochána of a road traffic offence or a crime.  It is important to point out that members of the Garda Síochána currently have powers to deal with persons who are only suspected of crime, powers equivalent to those we are asking the Minister to bestow on courts administered by judges who have a constitutional duty to uphold the bodily integrity of persons?  I cannot give any credence to the Minister's suggestion that the acceptance of this amendment would give powers far beyond what we as legislators could envisage that the courts should have.  For these reasons the Minister, if not in a position to respond positively now, should at least agree that the matter should be looked at afresh by him and his officials before Report Stage and the ridiculous suggestion advanced here that we need a surgeon to deal with this type of activity should be cleared and the Minister should not introduce exaggerated claims simply to try to win a point in the course of this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 26, subsection (2), line 6, to delete &ldquo;if any person named in the direction fails&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;if any person who has made a application under section 38 and who is named in the direction fails without good reason&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment proposed to subsection (2) of section 45 which is a section which deals with the legal position if someone fails to comply with a court direction with regard to undertaking blood tests.  It would seem that there is a fundamental problem with subsection (2) as it is currently drafted.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Where in proceedings on an application under section 38 of this Act a court gives a direction under section 41 of this Act for the taking of blood samples then, if any person named in the direction fails, within such period as may be specified by the court, to take any step required of him for the purpose of giving effect to the direction, the court may dismiss the application. The amendment I have tabled is:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;if any person named in the direction fails&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;if any person who has made an application under section <i>38</i> and who is named in the direction fails without good reason&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is as follows: this Bill seeks to provide a methodology whereby blood testing can be carried out to assist the court in determining paternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person who is alleged to be the father of the child fails to comply with the court direction with regard to blood testing, the court can reach a conclusion <Col N="2238" /> and take that into account with regard to the allegation that somebody is the father of the child.  It is clearly correct that if the court requires the mother of the child to participate in such tests as are necessary for these tests to have any validity, and if the mother is the applicant seeking to determine paternity for the child or if the child is seeking to determine patentage and the court orders the child to participate in such testing, if the child or the mother fails to participate in such testing as the applicant in the proceedings, it would seem correct that the court should be entitled to dismiss the application.  This is a very strange section because it appears to say not simply that but that if the court orders somebody alleged to be the father of the child to participate in testing and if that person fails to do so, the court can dismiss the application.  I am sure that that is not the intention of the original drafter of this Bill but that is the way the Bill reads.  It is a very peculiar provision to put into the Bill because on the one hand you are saying within the body of the Bill that if somebody does not comply with the court direction the court can draw a conclusion from that with regard to paternity.  On the other hand, you are saying that if he does not comply the court may dismiss the proceedings brought against him.</P>
    <P>It would seem that the clear intent of this provision is to confer a discretion on the court to dismiss proceedings brought by an applicant seeking to determine paternity where the applicant does not comply with the court direction with regard to blood testing.  My amendment seeks to confine the court's discretion to dismiss the proceedings to that, by saying that if any person who has made an application under section 38 and who is named on the direction fails without good reason, within such period as may be specified by the court, to take any step required other than for the purpose of giving effect to the direction, the court may dismiss the application.  That is a commonsense and sensible amendment and I would ask the Minister to accept it in the interests of ensuring that this legislation is as good as it should be in its <Col N="2239" /> operation.  It is as simple and as basic as that.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate to the House whether he would be willing to accept the amendment as tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed. Deputy Shatter has said his intention is to confine the court's discretion.  This amendment would indeed limit the discretion of the court to dismiss an application for a declaration of parentage in a case where there is a failure to comply with a blood test direction.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) contains a special provision which applies where a blood test direction has been given by the court in proceedings on an application for a declaration of parentage under section 38 of the Bill.  Because of the fact that proceedings for a declaration of parentage are less likely, in general, to be adversarial, it is likely that the unavailability of blood test evidence due to the refusal of a person to take a step necessary for fulfilling a blood test direction could leave the court in an unsatisfactory position. The court could be left with some evidence tending to establish the applicant's case, but might consider it unsafe to make a declaration in the absence of blood test evidence.  Subsection (2) therefore gives the court the option of dismissing the application for a declaration of parentage where material blood test evidence is not being made available to it because of the failure of someone to take a necessary step.  This provision is designed not to penalise an applicant, but to safeguard the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To limit the discretion of the court by providing that only where the applicant fails to comply with a blood test direction can the court dismiss the application would, in my view, run the risk of exposing the court to the situation which the subsection as it stands is designed to avoid.  It does not much matter that a person, be it the applicant or someone else, has good reason for not complying with a blood test direction; the important consideration for the court, in deciding whether to exercise its discretion in such <Col N="2240" /> a case, is whether the evidence that it has before it is enough, in the absence of blood test evidence, to warrant the making of a declaration.  This discretion should not be unduly fettered; and the amendment is opposed for that reason.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the special procedure provided for at Part VI of the Bill is designed to enable a person to obtain a court declaration as to his parentage where no other relief is being sought at the same time.  Where the question of a person's parentge arises in, say, guardianship or maintenance or succession procedings, then the court hearing those proceedings may, as under present law, determine the parentage issue for the purposes of those proceedings, without having to invoke the special Part VI procedure.  I say this in order to assure Deputies that the general run of court decisions on parentage will not be affected by this provision at all.  It will only apply to the rare case where a person seeks a declaration of parentage and nothing else; and then only if the evidence is of the unsatisfactory nature that I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that there are two contradictory sections here.  Subsection (1) of section 45 says:</P>
      <P>Where a court gives a direction under section 41 of this Act and any person fails to take any step required of him for the purpose of giving effect to the direction, the court may draw such inferences, if any, from that fact as appear proper in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Presumably if the direction is given to somebody alleged to be the father of the child to undergo blood tests and he refuses to undergo blood tests, in drawing what inferences appear proper in the circumstance the fact that the person has refused to co-operate in the carrying out of blood tests would properly lead a court to the inference that that person knows that he is the father of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) is contradictory.  It goes on to say that the court should not draw <Col N="2241" /> inferences but can dismiss the proceedings. Instead of facilitating the determination of a parentage application this will confuse the matter considerably.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister's response is typical of the manner in which all amendments brought before this House on this Bill have been dealt with, that is, that you think of an esoteric reason which has no relevance in reality for opposing practically every amendment that could improve this Bill in its working mechanisms. I am quite certain that subsection (2) is incorrectly drafted.  It is incorrectly drafted in a dangerous way in that its content waters down the content of subsection (1) which is an intent to create a situation where somebody alleged to be the father of a child and who does not co-operate in the carrying out of tests has some pressure to co-operate imposed on him.  It would seem that what this subsection does is put a person alleged to be the father in a position in which he could refuse to participate and co-operate in the carrying out of tests and then tell the court that because he did not participate in the carrying out of such tests, despite the fact that these allegations are made against him, the court should now dismiss the application.  That is what it boils down to.</P>
    <P>In effect, subsection (2) undermines the entire structure of this part of the Bill with regard to the provision of blood tests to determine parentage in civil procedings. It is a small subsection, but it undermines the entire foundations of the proceedings laid down in this Bill for the carrying out of blood tests.  It renders completely incomprehensible subsection (1). In effect, it places the mother of a child who is seeking to establish paternity or the child itself seeking to establish parentage in an impossible legal position. No credibility can be given to any of the reasons which the Minister has given for not agreeing to this subsection.  It amounts to the usual thing in this House, which is, that Ministers feel that their ministerial prerogative might in some way be invaded and that their political masculinity might be attacked if they accept a simple legal amendment to <Col N="2242" /> improve the Bill and to implement what are supposed to be the intentions of the measure before the House.</P>
    <P>At least on this amendment, whatever about the other ones, I had hoped for a more constructive approach.  We live in hope that such an approach might eventually permeate the walls of this Chamber in dealing with legislation on Committee Stage.  It is my intention to put this amendment if it is not accepted and I will do so because this particular subsection unamended undermines the structure of this Bill in regard to blood testing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which has been advanced.  It would seem that the parliamentary draftsmen having got this far into the Bill began to nod and what appears to have happened is that the wording of subsection (1) has been repeated in subsection (2).  If anything, the subsection as it stands is an ass and it does not make the slightest bit of sense.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this subsection.  If the Minister does not recognise the ridiculous conclusions which could be drawn from the subsection it is a matter which we will have to pursue on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>To re-echo what has been said, a person who wishes to contest or resist an application under section 38 could within the terms of this subsection seek a dismissal of the application by refusing to co-operate with a direction.  I am sure that that was never the intention when this section was drafted.  I believe what has happened is that the wording of subsection (1) infected its way into subsection (2) and it is a matter which could be tidied up by the Minister before Report Stage.  We should compromise on this matter as clearly there are not enough Members present in the House to put amendments successfully.  Perphaps what we could do is to have a fresh look at this matter before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice we have received indicates that the subsection is correct and that it will, in effect, only apply in the rare cases where a person seeks a declaration of parentage and <Col N="2243" /> nothing else and then only if the evidence is of an unsatisfactory nature as I outlined earlier.  The two subsections are not contradictory but complementary.  Subsection (1) would apply in all cases where the question of parentage arises.  I emphasise that subsection (1) would apply in all cases.  On the other hand, subsection (2) is designed to apply only in the special circumstances where a declaration of parentage is sought using the special procedures in Part VI when it is more likely that there will be no proper contradictor to the application for a declaration. As I have said already, it is designed to ensure that in such cases the court would not be put in the position where it may have to make a declaration on the basis of unsatisfactory evidence.

      <P>I am afraid what the Minister has said makes no sense at all because at the end of the day a court will have to make a decision as to whether the person is or is not the father of a particular child.  The amendment which I seek to make would not limit the discretion of the court either to accept or reject the evidence which would be presented.  It would simply limit the court's discretion to dismiss proceedings purely because someone who would be alleged to be the father of a child refuses to co-operate in carrying out tests.  We sometimes like to pretend in this House that things operate in a way they do not. We like to pretend that the Minister is the font of all knowledge and Ministers by their nature also like to pretend that they are.  As the Minister has said, the reality is that he is acting on the advice which he has received and I suggest with respect that the advice which he has received is somewhat limited in its understanding of this provision.</P>

If the Minister is willing to give me a commitment that he will have another look at this section, to cut out some of the parliamentary jargon and that he will arrange for his officials to have another look at it to see if it will work in the way they are currently advising him I am prepared to withdraw the amendment and refer to this matter again on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2245" /> In page 27, subsection (1), lines 4 to 8, to delete</P>
    <P>&ldquo;admissible in evidence in any subsequent civil proceedings for the purpose of proving that that person is or, where not alive, was a parent of that child:</P>
    <P>Provided that no finding or adjudication as aforesaid other than a subsisting one shall be admissible in evidence by virtue of this section.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and substitute</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a presumption that that person is or, where not alive, was a parent of that child unless the contrary is proved in any subsequent civil proceedings on the balance of probabilities:</P>
    <P>Provided that no finding or adjudication as aforesaid, other than a subsisting one, shall be admissible in evidence by virtue of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is a very simple one in that it deals with the question of evidence in court proceedings.  It seeks to avoid, where it is reasonable to raise the presumption, the necessity of having to go to court.  As it stands, the section states that where there has already been a finding of parentage in civil court proceedings &mdash; in other words, where a court has already made a finding of parentage &mdash; that that finding is merely admissible in evidence in subsequent legal proceedings.  It is evidence, and no more, of parentage in subsequent legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) goes on to provide that where evidence that a person has been found or adjudged to be a parent of a child in subsequent proceedings then that person &mdash; unless the contrary is proved &mdash; shall be taken to be a parent of that child.  In other words, it sets up a presumption in subsequent legal proceedings. The purport of the amendment I have tabled is to say: why bring on the person concerned the necessity of having subsequent legal proceedings at all? There is already a finding of parentage by a court.  In my view that should set up a sufficient presumption, to say to any <Col N="2246" /> person who wishes to challenge it that if they do challenge that then they must bring the proceedings.  There has been some tendency in this Bill to produce too much need for legal proceedings.  These should be avoided unless absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission Report examined that point also.  I have referred to the Report on Illegitimacy, LRC4 &mdash; 1982, page 88, paragraph 203 where they say:</P>
    <P>An important question as we see it, is that of proof.  It should be open to anyone with a proper interest to seek to establish the parenthood of a person.  But our law could greatly assist the determination of the question if it set out realistic evidential rules, including legal presumptions, designed to ensure that common-sense prevail and that the delay and trouble associated with largely unnecessary applications for judicial declarations be, as far as possible, avoided.</P>
    <P>Here is a set of circumstances in which common sense says this: there has already been a court finding of parentage. That should be a presumption of parentage unless any other person goes to the trouble and expense &mdash; which they probably cannot afford to do in the first place &mdash; of seeking a rebuttal of that previous court finding.  That is a commonsense suggestion.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed.  It proposes to set up a presumption that the person who is found to be the parent of a child in earlier proceedings of the kind mentioned in subsection (1) is the parent.  This would replace the existing provision to the effect that the finding in the area of proceedings shall be admissible in evidence in subsequent civil proceedings.  Indeed, the Deputy made that quite clear in what he has said.  Subsection (1) provides for the admissibility as evidence in court proceedings of a decision arrived at in earlier proceedings.  Subsection (2) sets out the probative value to be attached to the <Col N="2247" /> earlier finding and would have no relevance to a presumption, as proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>The section is concerned with technicalities of the law of evidence and has been drafted with considerable care.  I would be very reluctant to make any changes in the law unless they can be shown to have distinct and worthwhile advantages.  In the drafting the two parts of the section are mutually interdependent. Consequently, the acceptance of this amendment would cause a certain amount of difficulty.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the same effect as that intended to be achieved by the Deputy's amendment can be readily brought about under the provisions of the Bill as it stands.  If a person is named as the father of a child in a court order in respect of proceedings of the kind mentioned in subsection (1) then that order, or a certified copy thereof, can be produced to the Registrar of Births.  That enables the registrar to enter the name of the father on the births register under either the new section 7 (2) (d) or the new section 7A (1) (d) or the 1880 Births and Deaths Registration Act.  These are at section 52 of this Bill.  In turn, this entry of the father's name on the register gives rise to a presumption that that man is the father.  That is provided for at section 49(3) of the Bill.  Perhaps that will meet the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment Deputy Taylor has tabled and it would appear to me that the Minister does also. We have just had a circuitous argument as to why the amendment is not necessary. The circuitous argument is that one gets a court order, one then goes and registers it and, when one registers it, the presumption arises anyway.  Why the provisions of the Bill cannot stipulate that the presumption arises in the form of the amendment Deputy Taylor has tabled totally escapes me.  In other words, what the Minister is saying is that the court order, as the section is currently phrased, is merely admissible in evidence but that <Col N="2248" /> if after issuing court proceedings someone goes off and registers the court order through the Registry of Births it then becomes a presumption.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not understand why the amendment has been tabled, just as I did not understand why some of the previous amendment could not have been accepted.  This is even less logical because what the Minister said at the end of his comments is that really the provisions of the Bill do what Deputy Taylor wants them to do.  Why can we not enact legislation that is clear?  There is no additional judicial process in the registering of a court order in the Registry of Births.  The court decision has been taken.  Patently this section should incorporate the presumption that Deputy Taylor seeks to incorporate into it by way of the amendment he has tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raised the question: is there any worth while reason for putting down the amendment?  The reason for tabling it is very simple, to bring a sense of logic into this Bill.  Otherwise we will be left with contradictory sections in two different parts of this Bill. I can well imagine a court looking askance, raising its eyebrows, asking what kind of legislation we are enacting here. On the one hand, we are saying that an earlier court finding of the type mentioned in subsection (1) is no more than a matter of evidence to be tendered but, on the other hand, we are saying that it earlier court finding of the type mentioned in subsection (1) is no more than a matter of evidence to be tendered but, on the other hand, we are saying that it raises a presumption if, in a later section, it is reflected in the registration of a birth. That is a contradiction.  Either it is a presumption or it is not a presumption. If it is raised as a presumption in the later section to which the Minister refers, how can it be a matter of evidence only in this section?  There is a contradiction there. It would be in the interests of all sides of the House that we produce legislation that is consistent and logical.  In any case why not accept the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and take a common-sense view to avoid the necessity for legal proceedings when they are not required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" /> Subsection (2) would go on to say that if this previous court order is tendered to the court, and if there is no other evidence, the presumption is raised there anyway.  There appears to be a sort of wish here to promote business for the legal profession.  I suppose that has merit, speaking from a personally biased point of view.  However, it is not in the public or national interest that legal proceedings should have to be engaged in unnecessarily, particularly when most people cannot afford to indulge in them and when the Minister and the Government obviously have not the remotest intention of providing an adequate legal aid system to enable them to do just that.  Why not remedy this contradiction in these two sections if a previous court finding sets up the presumption under the registration of births then it must raise it here also. Otherwise it will look very peculiar and it will be a strange looking Act when it comes into force.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 27, before section 49, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>49.&mdash;Where a woman gives birth to a child she shall be presumed to be the mother of such child and this presumption shall be irrebuttable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> This portion of this Bill deals with various presumptions that arise with regard to parentage which will assist in the establishment of parentage in the event of a court dispute or proceedings in court.  All of the presumptions as they stand are based on determining paternity and none of them is based on maternity.  The reason is that it would have been assumed until relatively recently that there could be no dispute as to who is the mother of the child.  However, medical science has become somewhat more complicated than that nowadays.  Children can be conceived and born in a variety of ways. One way which has received considerable publicity in recent months is birth as a result of test tube fertilisation.  In such circumstances the embryo can be implanted back into the original donor of the ova which gave rise to the creation of the embryo.  In a simple husband and wife case the husband and wife might donate the sperm and ova which are test tube fertilised and then returned to the body of the wife.</P>
    <P>The possibility of surrogate motherhood has not been discussed in the House yet in any detail.  Surrogate motherhood can involve the use of sperm and ova in test tube fertilisation then being implanted not into the original donor of the ova but into a third party surrogate. A great deal of publicity was given recently to an instance in another country where it was alleged that a grandmother had given birth to her daughter's child.</P>
    <P>Our law at the moment does not cope with any of these areas.  If a woman gives birth to a child as a result of the implantation in her of an embryo deriving from ova donated by another women there is considerable uncertainty as to who is the real mother of that child.  That technique is not being used currently in this country but people living here have access to that technique outside this country to conceive and have children within their family.  In those circumstances nobody knows who the mother of the child is at the moment, whether the mother is the woman who gives birth to the child or the woman who donated the ova which resulted in the creation of the embryo <Col N="2251" /> which was implanted in the woman who ultimately gave birth.  As things stand, if a dispute should arise about who is the mother of such a child, no guidance of any nature is given by this House as to how the court should determine it.  I believe people in this country would have a very strong view about surrogate motherhood arising in those circumstances. I think they would also have a very strong view about ensuring that a woman who gives birth to a child is in law accepted as being the mother of that child.  People would wish to discourage that type of surrogate motherhood as part of our social system.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that there can never be any dispute as to who is the mother of a child.  It provides that the women who gives birth to a child is the mother of that child, that that is the presumption, it is irrebuttable and the court can reach no different view on this issue.  This issue should be dealt with in the context of this Bill not just from the point of view of the mother but from the point of view of the child.  If at present I ask the Minister what is the status of such a child he could say that the child might be illegitimate, legitimate, the child of the person who gave birth to it, the child of the woman who donated the ova.  Currently there is no means of determining who is the mother of such a child in a Bill dealing with the status of children and the issue of parentage.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this very simple amendment is designed to ensure that this Bill not only provides presumptions and directions to the court on determining issues of paternity but does so in the context of determining the issue of maternity in the light of recent developments in medical science from which this country is not immune.  Even if we do not practise this type of approach in Ireland, people living in Ireland have access to children being born in these circumstances and we should have a clear policy or approach as to how we view this type of method.  In particular with regard to the children concerned, our legislation should determine not merely the status <Col N="2252" /> of such children but who their parents are and particularly who the mother is of such a child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that there is already in common law a principle exemplified by the maxim <i>Mater semper certa est:</i> the identity of the mother is always certain.  This amendment seeks to give statutory effect to that maxin by creating an irrebuttable presumption that where a woman gives birth to a child she is the mother.  The maxim is true in theory only since there have been cases both here and in other countries where errors have been made in maternity hospitals and confusion has arisen.  The courts are quite capable of giving such maxims the weight they deserve and no more than that.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the maxim dates from a time when procedures such as embryo transfer, egg donation and surrogate motherhood were not even thought of.  It is no longer possible to say without fear of contradiction that a child born to a woman is that woman's natural child.  Of course, in most cases the child is the natural child of the woman, but as long as there exists the possibility that this may not be the case it is wrong that there should be an irrebuttable presumption. Indeed, to provide so in a modern statute is, in my view, to fly in the face of the realities of scientific development.</P>
      <P>We have already, in an earlier amendment, touched on the procedures of ovum donation, artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and so forth.  It would, in my view, prejudge those issues in a very serious way if an amendment of this nature were to be given the force of law. The Deputy and the House recognised when they discussed that matter earlier that this is essentially a matter for separate and comprehensive legislation. Accordingly, the amendment is opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's first objection to the amendment seemed to be that it reflected what the common law provides already.  That does not seem to be an objection; it seems to be in agreement with it.  The second objection <Col N="2253" /> is that there can be errors in maternity hospitals.  I do not understand the relevance of that.  I am saying that when a woman gives birth to a child she is to be regarded as the mother of that child.  If some one gives an unfortunate mother the wrong child when she returns home from a maternity hospital that does not mean that she has given birth to that child.  That comment is irrelevant in this context.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in most instances the woman who gives birth to the child is the mother of the child but it is not possible to say, in the light of medical science whether a child is the natural child of a woman.  This is the very point I am making.  When is the child the natural child of a woman?  Generally speaking the mother will, of course, be the person who conceived the child in the usual way and there is no question of donation of ova or test tube babies.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to deal with the problem where that issue does arise and it is to give guidance to the courts as to how to determine the issue.  The Minister says that without fear of contradiction one cannot in the context of all babies currently say who the mother is.  I would suggest to the Minister, without fear of contradiction, that it is in the interests of all children that we have a mechanism in our law which indicates how we determine who the mother of a child is when an issue of this nature arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House is abdicating its role in this area and saying that because it is too complicated we will not become involved but will leave it to the courts.  That is not good enough.  I accept that this is a complicated area.  The Minister, having given his various objections, went on to say that we should not prejudge the issue. An amendment to establish the status of children born as a result of artificial insemination was opposed by the Minister. This amendment to determine the status of children born as a result of the test tube method in the context of surrogate motherhood is also been rejected. I am not advocating the use of surrogacy. I am merely trying to establish, where it is resorted to, who the mother of the <Col N="2254" /> child is where there has been a test tube fertilisation with a donor ovum.</P>
    <P>If dealing with this matter in this Bill is prejudging the issue, when will the Minister bring in legislation to deal with all these issues?  These are issues that parliaments all over the world are currently confronting because of the enormous lead in scientific and medical developments in this area.  Are we in this House to bury our heads in the sand, pretending that such developments are not taking place?  Are we to abdicate our role as legislators in this area and leave it to the Judiciary when conflicts arise to determine what legal principles are to be applied in the resolution of disputes?  If the Minister is saying that this amendment should not be dealt with in the context of this Bill, I should like him to clarify Government policy with regard to this area and to state specifically when he intends to bring legislation before this House to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 27, lines 34 to 39, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section where a married woman who is living apart from her husband under a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> or pursuant to a separation deed or written separation agreement gives birth to a child more than 10 months after the decree was granted or the deed or agreement came into force then her husband shall be presumed not to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with presumptions <Col N="2256" /> with regard to parentage.  This is of importance in the context of court proceedings which may take place where there is an attempt to determine the parentage of a child.  It is designed to assist the court in taking a view on the matter.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 49 states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, where a married woman who is living apart from her husband under a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> gives birth to a child more than ten months after the decree was granted, then her husband shall be presumed not to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 49 (1) basically sets out presumptions. To put it in simplistic form, where a married woman gives birth to a child, the husband is presumed to be the father of the child.  Subsection (2) provides that where a decree of judicial separation has been granted and a woman who is living apart from her husband gives birth to a child more than ten months after the decree, the husband is not to be presumed to be the father.</P>
    <P>When marriages break down many couples do not have to become involved in contested court proceedings.  Many couples conclude what is known as a deed of separation, a formal document dated and stamped so that there can be no dispute about the date of its commencement. Many couples conclude their deed of separation or a simple written separation agreement and then live apart.  Whether they separate as a result of getting a decree of judicial separation or following the conclusion of a deed of separation, they are effectively separated. The amendment I have tabled is to establish that where a woman gives birth to a child ten months after the conclusion of a deed of separation or a written separation agreement it will also be presumed that her husband is not the father of the child.  If a woman concludes a deed of separation and goes to live with another man and then ten years later gives birth to a child, the husband would <Col N="2257" /> still be presumed to be the father of the child.  This is not in the interests of the child, of the mother, of the husband or of the real father of the child.  I propose that subsection (2) be deleted and that it be replaced by the following:</P>
    <P>(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section where a married woman who is living apart from her husband under a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> or pursuant to a separation deed or written separation agreement gives birth to a child more than 10 months after the decree was granted or the deed or agreement came into force then her husband shall be presumed not to be the father of the child unless the contrary is proved on the balance of probabilities.</P>
    <P>The reason I have specifically confined this amendment to a separation deed or written separation agreement is that they provide, as does a court order, a unique written record of the date when a couple separated, about which there can be no dispute between the couple.  If we extended this to provide for a desertion there could be a considerable amount of disagreement as to when the desertion started, when separation took place in the context of other family law or matrimonial court orders made.  This amendment extends the section in a way that is practical but does it in a way which ensures that no dispute can arise with regard to the date of separation.</P>
    <P>Of course, some couples will separate without ever concluding a deed of separation and some will separate some time before the deed is concluded, but it is important that there be a form of written record, be it a court order which the couple cannot dispute or an agreement the commencement date of which the couple cannot dispute, for this particular presumption to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as drafted is too narrow.  Deputy Shatter's amendment seeks to extend it somewhat but in my view it does not extend it enough and my two amendments are alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial factor here is that the couple have been separated.  Whether <Col N="2258" /> they have been separated pursuant to an agreement or a court decree <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is not the crucial factor.  Settling the dates is one thing and disputes between the couples are another but if a dispute arises on any of these issues, be it under the agreement or the court decree <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, we are only talking about a balance of probability. We are not talking about any conclusive presumption emanating from it.  We are all agreed on the balance of probability and the court would have to determine it.  Therefore, why not be sensible and say that if it is agreed by all that there is no challenge on the issue in court, that they have been living separate for more than ten months, surely one can draw the assumption that the husband is not the father?  That is all this amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <P>If that is going too far, I refer to my second pair of amendments which extend the question of limiting it to a divorce decree <i>a mensa et thoro</i> to include any other court order.  Why limit this to a court decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro?</i> That question is complex and is a matter of evidence, but it was considered very carefully by the Law Reform Commission. They concluded it would be too narrow to base it as the Minister has done in this subsection.  I refer to the Report on Illegitimacy, page 91, paragraph 214, where they first analysed evidential matters. They said</P>
    <P>We have come to the view that the better approach would be for the legislation to include such barring orders within the scope of the expression &ldquo;court order&rdquo;.  It seems to us that where these orders were in effect (provided of course that they are of a duration to cover the relevant time in which the child must have been conceived) commonsense suggests that a presumption that the husband is the father should not arise.</P>
    <P>For example, if there is a barring order in existence for 12 months, on what basis does one draw the distinction between a district court barring order and a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro?</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> If there is an injunction restraining him on a permanent basis, for two years or whatever, on what basis does one draw the distinction between that and divorce <i>a mensa et thoro?</i>  This seems an overly narrow position to take, contrary to the views of the Law Reform Commission. We should take the commonsense approach and say that if a couple have been living separate for ten months or more the presumption should not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>A legal presumption is a convenient way of establishing a fact for practical everyday purposes without having to have recourse to court proceedings. In order for it to operate effectively, it is necessary that the facts giving rise to the presumption should be of a readily ascertainable kind and not be in dispute.  The presumption itself should apply generally without requiring further evidence to support it.  Thus, a presumption of paternity arising out of marriage works well since the marriage is a matter of public record and the natural inference is that the husband is the father of any child born to his wife.  Similarly, the presumption of non-paternity arising out of a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is well based, since the date of birth of the child and the decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> are both matters of public record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, basing a presumption on a voluntary agreement, such as a separation agreement, whether by deed or otherwise, would give rise to problems. Such an agreement would not be a matter of general knowledge and could be hedged around with conditions and exceptions which would render it too uncertain to form the basis of a general presumption such as could be relied on in particular cases.  The same applies to such concepts as &ldquo;living apart&rdquo;, &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; and agreements, whether formal or informal.  They are far too vague and uncertain to act as a basis for a workable presumption.  In the case of a court order other than a decree of judicial separation, for instance a maintenance order or a barring order, there is nothing to prevent <Col N="2260" /> the spouses coming together again at any time and resuming normal married life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not have to apply to the court to have the order annulled although this may be advisable. Moreover, now that the presumption of paternity will be rebuttable in court proceedings on a mere balance of probabilities it will be of relatively minor significance in any event.</P>
      <P>In the light of the arguments made in favour of the amendments, I am prepared to consider them between now and Report Stage to see if some widening of the scope of this provision would be possible.  What I have in mind in particular is that a presumption of non-paternity might arise in cases where a legal separation agreement has been registered in a court.  Deputies might consider withdrawing their amendments on this basis and giving me the opportunity of seeing what I can do between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Taylor's amendments.  I am concerned that we are making some form of class distinction in regard to persons who should be considered under this legislation. Under Deputy Shatter's amendment only those who have recourse to lawyers and the drawing up of separation agreements would be facilitated, but there are many people who separate and live apart for a long number of years and have no need of recourse to lawyers, separation agreements, or courts for divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>.  Because they have no property and there is no problem about the custody of children, they do not enter into a formal document.  The Deputy's argument for this document is the unique date, the opportunity to record, but it has been illustrated that there are many other means, such as the application for deserted wife's allowance, barring orders and so on, which are matters of public record or which could be settled by a <Col N="2261" /> court after hearing evidence and should be available for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister, having listened to all the arguments, would consider broadening the scope a little beyond what he suggested and that he will not be afraid of facilitating all classes in his considerations.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out on the last occasion, I welcome the Bill because it brings into law policy decisions I announced as Minister for Transport.  In one area there has been an improvement, relating to extending the age of secondhand ships which will qualify for the grants from five years, as originally proposed, to seven years.  However, I am extremely disappointed that a figure of £1.5 million &mdash; it may be less than that now &mdash; is provided in next year's Estimates for this.  Originally it was proposed to make £2.5 million available per year and that was accepted by the Government on the basis that it would more than remunerate itself.  We are dealing with an area with major growth potential.  We can create many jobs and at the same time meet the strategic fleet requirements of the country in the event of an emergency. All in all we can save the Exchequer money.  This cut-back is clear evidence of the Government's mad, unplanned cuts across the board.  This is one of the many ill-considered cuts being made by the Government who for four and a half years, when in Opposition, preached largesse and opposed cuts in public expenditure. They took office without a prepared plan and in Government are swinging the axe madly and are even cutting down nicely matured trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members are aware that there are 250,000 persons unemployed and that by the winter the figure will be in excess of 270,000.  The Government have conceded that by 1989 the figure will be in excess of 300,000.  It is hard to see how society will be able to cope with such high unemployment.  We must do everything possible to encourage the creation of jobs in all areas but the Government have not done anything in that regard.  When in Government we selected this area for development.  I accept that the Government have taken on the policies we announced on 6 January lock, stock and barrel and intend implementing them but <Col N="2263" /> they have reduced the resources available. I should like to plead with the Minister to go back to the Minister for Finance to get the original sum agreed, £2.5 million.  It will be a worthwhile investment.</P>
    <P>The measures before us have enabled Irish Continental Line to be saved.  The acquisition of ICL was greatly facilitated by the provisions announced in my package on 6 January, some of which were given effect in the Finance Act and the remainder of which are incorporated in the legislation before us.  There was a third leg to the package, the move by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to make decisions in regard to certain tax arrangements.  We were in a position, as a result of those decisions, to save ICL. That happy development will ensure the continuation of ICL and offers great expansion by the company in the future.</P>
    <P>What about the B &amp; I, a company which is involved in protracted negotiations at present?  I do not wish to say anything that will impede those negotiations but it is worth pointing out that any steps taken should limit the call on the Exchequer and define clearly what the Exchequer exposure is to be this year and for future years.  We should not be prepared to go beyond that but at the same time we must guarantee the future of the B &amp; I.  It is vitally important that the B &amp; I continue in business.  Whatever the result of the current negotiations steps should be taken to ensure that an Irish line continues on the cross-channel services to the UK.  It is vital to our strategic requirements and to our national interests.  It is also vital from the point of view of creating employment.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I was in charge of a host of major State bodies and I was frequently depressed by the disposition of management to look to job reductions as a solution to their financial problems. In doing that they were only following a fashion which has been endemic in the private sector for the past ten years.  It is now the fashion to judge the success of managers by the extent of the reduction in their workforce.  That is wrong and we <Col N="2264" /> should stop that policy in the State and private sectors.  We should adopt policies which will encourage employment and change the decade-old fashion of shedding jobs.  The answer to every financial problem here has been to shed jobs.  That policy has gathered so much momentum that we are reaching the stage when there will be an explosion.  That is not an exaggeration. Any Member who, like me, represents a working class constituency where unemployment is at its worst will be under no illusion.  If the problem continues to grow there will be an explosion with untold consequences.</P>
    <P>We should be doing everything possible to increase employment and we must start by stopping the policy of shedding jobs in the State and private sectors.  I am aware that the Government cannot decide for the private sector but they can adopt policies that are conducive to creation of employment.  That is what the Bill is about in the shipping sector.  There is a considerable number of persons with marine expertise, particularly the employees of Irish Shipping who are unemployed.  I hope that those harddone-by employees, whom we could not help because of legal and other constraints, will be the first to be re-employed as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I seem to be following the fashion of the last ten years in shedding jobs to pay a wage increase to which they should never have agreed.  It is madness and should be stopped.  In the B &amp; I, the unions indicated &mdash; and they should be congratulated for it &mdash; a willingness to take a pay freeze for the next three years. That is precisely the example which should be followed throughout the public service.  I do not want to pretend that public servants are overpaid because many of them are underpaid but, given the national situation, it would be infinitely better to have a prolonged pay standstill in the public service and to maintain jobs.</P>
    <P>Further job losses are unavoidable in the B &amp; I but there is a way to get the resources they need to keep most of the services and employment.  I referred to this a couple of weeks ago when I was <Col N="2265" /> speaking on the Bill but I will recap briefly.  We should form a subsidiary company of the B &amp; I to which all the assets of the company will be ascribed as well as an even amount of the debt.  The Exchequer would, therefore, take on board the remainder of the debt which would be vested in the holding company and remitted over a period of years.  The B &amp; I would then have a solid and sound balance sheet.  Like ICL, the B &amp; I should be told to go out and attract investors, to get money from the private sector.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> today, Dr. Tony O'Reilly is quoted as saying that there is plenty of money around for investment in Irish projects if they make sense.  The B &amp; I could make sense as a joint venture between the State and the private sector.  Why do Sealink make profits on the Irish sea while B &amp; I do not? There is no intrinsic reason for not making a profit on this route.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I are the last remaining subsidised shipping company in these islands.  It is in their interests to go down the road of joint venture with private participation. That would be much better than losing 100 jobs and services.  I urge the Minister to do everything he can to bring about a solution along the lines I proposed.  When I was in Government this solution was my first choice but the thinking was too novel for the Department of Finance and was shot down.  They went for the second choice, which was, to pour into the B&amp;I an initial investment of £120 million and a commitment to £6 million for each of the succeeding three years.  It has not worked, principally because the State sector ethos is still there, the belief that because they are a State company nothing can happen to them and that they will always be bailed out by the Exchequer.  It has adversely affected the performance at all sorts of levels in the B&amp;I and that psychology must be broken.</P>
    <P>Great improvements have been brought about in the B &amp; I.  Mr. Alex Spain, the chairman and chief executive, the board of directors and the workforce deserve a great deal of credit for the changes they have embraced over the past couple of years but they have not <Col N="2266" /> been enough.  The answer is not to cut, cut and cut.  We must think in terms of growth which the Shipping Investment Bill is all about.  The terms of the Bill, together with the provisions of the Finance Act, make the possibility of private investment in shipping, including companies like the B &amp; I, all the more attractive as the ICL shares issue has proved.  I hope that the discussions now coming to a conclusion within the B &amp; I between management and unions and between the company and the Department will not just be on retrenchment but will also have growth in mind.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Communications, one of my principal jobs was to provide for sectoral development and to try to get growth and development in the sector of the economy for which I was responsible. This has worked particularly well in the area of aviation in which there has been a fantastic and persistent improvement over the last few years.  There has also been a vast improvement in the performance of CIE in each of the past four years after 15 years of reverses.  We now have an opportunity to get the same improvement in the shipping industry.  I hope that the Minister ensures that, rather than retrenchment, the growth for which this Bill was designed will extend to the B &amp; I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Government came into power they were faced with a daunting task of dealing with the financial stringencies under which the country is forced to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, the Irish shipowners have been floundering in heavy seas and many have drowned in the process. <Col N="2267" /> However, the Minister has now thrown them a lifebelt and it is up to the industry to grasp it, to pull themselves ashore and to get the industry going.  One also has to acknowledge that there is a refreshing understanding of commercial reality in the Department of the Marine and that the expertise obtaining within it has manifested itself in producing an excellent package for the industry.  The combined thrust of this package can only encourage existing shipowners to replace and to update their fleets and to entice investors to consider ship owning as a new development.</P>
    <P>In relation to grants and training, shipping companies receiving grant aid should be required to fund or to participate in the training of deck officers and marine engineers which is undertaken at the national training centre in the regional college in Cork.  It is a requirement of the Merchant Shipping Act that trainees get sea time.  They generally spend 20 months out of a total of three years training at sea.  While attending the college they receive grants from the European Social Fund but it does not apply when the students are at sea.  At the moment the shipping companies accept the trainees on a work experience programme arranged with the college authorities.  They pay gratuitously an emolument to the college authorities to cover each trainee on such a programme. This scheme enables them to avoid the onus of employing the trainees directly and it therefore rids them of responsibility for further employment when training ceases.  This situation is satisfactory and indeed I congratulate the Chamber of Shipping for their co-operation with what is the appropriate training authority in Cork.  However, this could change and students without the requisite work experience to attain their qualification would be at a loss.  If possible, the Minister should tie in payments of grants with training and by doing so he could ensure a steady growth of trained personnel for work either at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>The quality of both courses in the regional college in Cork has resulted in <Col N="2268" /> international companies actively seeking these graduates many of whom have been successfully placed in worthwhile employment.  It is very easy to give financial assistance but that in itself does not guarantee skilled manpower to man the ships.  The suggestion of integrating grants with training should be an integral part of the Bill particularly where there is no cost to the Exchequer.  Also, when giving grants to Irish ship owners we should stipulate that the manpower is to be recruited from nationals.  This would be akin to the IDA giving grants for projects coming into this country and ensuring that persons are taken from our live register rather than from abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí go léir a labhair san díospóireacht seo, an chéad lá agus arís inniu. Chuir sé áthas orm an méid suime ata acu san mBille seo.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their encouraging and supportive contributions to the debate on this important legislation.  The Shipping Investment Grants Bill is a progressive measure designed to enable the exploitation of an area of huge potential within the economy which has remained relatively underdeveloped up to this.  The Government, in creating the Department of the Marine, have made clear their commitment to the development of our marine resources.  As the first legislation to be introduced under the aegis of the new Department this Bill represents a milestone in their brief history.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is the revitalisation and expansion of the indigenous merchant shipping industry.  Ninety-five per cent of our trade is carried by sea.  This fact powerfully underlines the importance of shipping to the economy of an island state such as our own.  That less than 20 per cent of this trade is carried in Irish registered vessels is a matter of concern.  It compares unfavourably with our EC counterparts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for grants of up to 25 per cent towards the cost of purchasing <Col N="2269" /> new or secondhand ships less than seven years old.  Some Deputies expressed the view that ships of up to 12 years old should be eligible under the scheme or failing that, that the age limit be raised for the purpose of giving access to the Business Expansion Scheme to projects involving the purchase of ships of up to that age.  As Deputy Cullen rightly pointed out, one of the main objectives of the grants scheme is to rejuvenate the Irish Shipping Fleet whose age profile is, on average, significantly higher than those of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>Another important consideration regarding the age of vessels which may be grant-aided is the question of safety. Ships built after May 1980 when the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS) came into force were constructed in accordance with the international safety standards adopted under that convention.  Vessels up to seven years old comply with those standards and are consequently more desirable additions to our national fleet.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of access to the Business Expansion Scheme, this is provided for under the terms of the Finance Act, 1987.  Any amendment to those terms of access would fail to be considered during the drafting of the 1988 Finance Bill.  As it stands, there is no reference in the Bill before the House to fiscal incentives such as the Business Expansion Scheme.  The views expressed by Deputies in this regard will, however, be borne in mind when the 1988 Finance Bill is drafted.</P>
    <P>Subject to budgetary constraints, at least £1.03 million will be made available under the scheme during the first full year of its operation in 1988.  In the two remaining months of this year it is anticipated that approximately £500,000 will be paid.  As regards approval of projects under the Business Expansion Scheme, this must await the passing of the Bill, since access is linked to eligibility under the grants scheme.  Pending the enactment of the legislation, however, two projects have been submitted for consideration and judging by inquiries it appears that shipowners will avail of the <Col N="2270" /> opportunities for investment which it offers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh asked whether the 25 per cent grant includes EC funding.  It does not.  Funding would not be made available for secondhand ships and in general the EC is wary of funding new mobile assets.</P>
    <P>Deputies Doyle and Kavanagh suggested that the loss of a ship should be treated differently from transfer, sale or other disposal, should non-compliance with the conditions of the scheme require repayment of the grant.  I assure Deputies that the parliamentary draftsman's advice is that the discretionary powers at my disposal under section 6 (2) of the Bill are sufficiently broad to encompass such a situation.  Detailed administrative conditions attaching to the scheme will clarify this further and the Deputies' points will be taken into account in drawing up these conditions. It should, nonetheless, be remembered that the conditions of the scheme, including the repayment in certain circumstances of the grant, are designed to ensure that grant-aided vessels are employed in the applicant's business and will continue to be of practical benefit to the economy as part of the national fleet.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cullen and Kavanagh raised the question of our port facilities.  I feel that these facilities are adequate to cater for existing and short term future levels of our maritime trade.  In the 1987 funding for commercial harbours there is included a non-recurring provision of £3 million for the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which effectively will leave as much money available for other ports during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The fiscal incentives which have been introduced for the shipping industry will have a significant impact.  The 10 per cent corporation tax rate will allow shipowners to channel profits into the development and expansion of their services. Interest in the business expansion scheme has indicated that this could also become an important source of finance for the industry.  In addition, the way is now open for shipowners to approach the <Col N="2271" /> National Development Corporation for investment support in projects which are likely to yield a satisfactory return.</P>
    <P>I can also assure Deputies that the investment grants scheme is only part of a long term strategy for the development of all aspects of the shipping industry. With less than a fifth of Irish seaborne trade being carried by Irish vessels there is scope for development in a number of sectors within the trade.  At the moment, for example, we have no refrigerated vessels in our national fleet and depend on foreign operators to carry our perishable goods both in terms of imports and exports.  This is typical of the opportunities which exist for Irish operators in the shipping sector.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the question of employment has been raised again today by Deputy Mitchell because this is an important element in the entire package for the industry and is a central consideration in the thinking behind it.  The benefits in terms of employment will be a basic consideration in deciding on which projects will receive grant aid.  Inquirers have been made aware that they will have to come through on jobs for Irish personnel and the same will apply to formal applicants. Grantees will in any event, have to comply with the manning regulations for registry which require Irish certificates of competency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla asked about the publication of the report of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements so that its findings should be available to the House in deciding on the provisions of the Bill.  I must point out, as indeed Deputies Doyle and Jim Mitchell have done already, that the recommendations of the committee were published in the Green Paper on Transport. Both this Bill and the fiscal incentives introduced in the 1987 Finance Act, were clearly related to those recommendations and in my view represent a genuine response to them.  I hope nevertheless to make a copy of the report of the committee available to Deputies through the <Col N="2272" /> Dáil Library provided that all the committee members are agreeable to this course of action.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Jim Mitchell's concern for the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  The most effective support which can be given at this stage is through fostering a climate of optimism within the shipping industry and by supporting its expansion through the grant scheme and the other fiscal incentives which have been introduced.  The £7.5 million to be made available represents a potential £30 million investment in the industry which will meet the country's basic strategic shipping requirements and expand our merchant fleet.  Only when these objectives have been achieved will job prospects improve and employment of qualified personnel increase.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell in his contribution today referred to the B &amp; I problem.  I appreciate that he touched on the periphery of the problem only, in so far as negotiations are in train at present and none of us wants to impede or to jeopardise these negotiations.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is not a matter for the Department of the Marine; B&amp;I problems are a matter for the Department of Communications.  While negotiations are at a delicate stage all of us in this House should ensure that we do not pursue the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred also to the necessity to make available £2.5 million rather than the £1.03 million which is available in any one year.  We would like to think that £2.5 million could be made available but practically all of us in this House appreciate that there have to be cutbacks and we all have different views on where these cutbacks should be made. While the £1.03 million for the next financial year may not be adequate we will certainly take into consideration that only the most worthwhile projects will be selected.  With the limited amount of moneys available shipowners will come forward more quickly knowing that the funds are limited.  Other programmes have been cut and we also have to swallow this pill.  If there are worthwhile projects that require further financial aid we <Col N="2273" /> will always consider them.  In addition, the Deputy will appreciate that while the 25 per cent grant is important it does not preclude one from availing of the business expansion scheme provided the Department, having processed an application, decide that the application would be eligible for a grant.</P>
    <P>We in the Department of the Marine brought this legislation to the House as quickly as possible.  It was referred to by Deputy Mitchell who was Minister for Communications when it was announced on 6 January.  We could not have brought it to the House much more quickly.  In conclusion, I am confident that, on the basis of the interest already expressed by ship owners, the Shipping Investment Grants Bill will provide the much needed impetus for the expansion of our fleet and the revitalisation of our shipping industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point under section 2 (3) which states: &ldquo;The amount of grants made by the Minister under this Act shall not exceed in the aggregate £7,500,000&rdquo;.  I raise this matter in connection with a point I will be making later concerning the inclusion of the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; under section 6 (2).  If in the instance of a natural disaster a grant aided ship is lost and we do not allow specifically for roll over of the grant, in other words for the ship owner to get a ship which would suitably qualify for grant aid rather than repay the grant to the Minister and then apply again for <Col N="2274" /> another grant, and if the £7.5 million has been earmarked at that stage, the ship owner will not be eligible for a specific second grant for the replacement of that ship.  It is only in that context that I raise the point of the £7.5 million and to draw to the Minister's attention that it further underlines the reason for my being persistent on the later section in relation to the inclusion of the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo;.  I will develop the point further later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher):</NameTxt>
      <P>With a limit of £7.5 million, if a boat is lost and a grant is repayable to the Minister then that money or that percentage of the grant which would be recoupable may not after five years have to be repaid. The scheme would be operated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  If that money was made available it would bring us back within the limitation of £7.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would preference then effectively be given to the ship owner who had lost the ship?  Under the terms before us, we have no reason to believe that if the Minister wished to recoup that portion of the grant deemed repayable, depending on the age of the ship at the time of the natural disaster and there are other applications on hand for a grant which cannot be processed because the £7.5 million has been reached, the shipowner who suffers a natural disaster and has to repay the grant or portion of the grant will have first preference on that portion of the grant for replacing the ship.  If the Minister could give me that assurance it would help but really it further underlines the unnecessary circulation of money.  It would seem far simpler to allow a roll-over of the money within a specific length of time rather than having to get it back and giving preference to that owner provided his replacement ship complies with all the other conditions of grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Doyle's concern that the loss of a ship should be treated differently from transfer or other disposal should repayment of <Col N="2275" /> a grant in whole or in part be required for non-compliance with the conditions laid down.  I have, as a result of her query on Second Stage, been in touch with the parliamentary draftsman and he has assured me that the Minister's discretionary powers in relation to repayment are sufficiently broad.  Given that the company will have already established a good track record, there should be no necessity for a detailed appraisal of the applicant and, subject to the funds being available, if there were funds to be repaid at least those funds would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>Grant-aid would be payable subject to all other conditions relating to the ship itself being complied with.  That company's application would have priority provided it had a good track record.  The Minister's powers are very broad.  I would like to think that myself or anybody else holding the office would take a reasonable and humane view in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister knows, assurances given in this House do not have the status of statute law.  What it says in the Act when it is finally passed is what counts.  It is the only basis on which business can plan.  The Minister might be very well intentioned but the constraints on the Exchequer, the views of the Department of Finance at the time, may be that there are no funds available to replace that grant and that it must be repaid.  The point raised by Deputy Doyle <Col N="2276" /> as shadow Minister for the Marine is a very valid one.  The Minister should give more consideration to it.  We may not have time today if we hope to pass all Stages of this Bill today, but perhaps between now and the Bill going to the Seanad we might give some consideration to a possible amendment to clarify the position.  One thing business needs is to be confident in its planning, to be sure of its position.  Therefore, Deputy Doyle's point should be considered by the Minister before this Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It may also be possible for some form of insurance to be taken out by grantees to cover such losses, the insurance to cover the repayment of the grant and also the value of the ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that a good track record is vitally important.  One could have a situation where a boat is lost by a company with a bad track record, and if what the Deputy suggests were written into the legislation it could tie our hands completely. The points made by Deputy Mitchell will certainly be borne in mind in drawing up the administrative details of the scheme.  I also accept his point regarding insurance.  This is a vitally important point.  He is right in saying that it should be a condition of the scheme that the grantee should record the interest of the Minister in insurance cover for the vessel so that in the event of loss the repayment to the Minister would be covered.  That would be part of the administrative details of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance moneys would have to be sufficient to repay the Minister and also provide the grantee with sufficient funds to replace the ship, so it is a double insurance.  I do not know if it is possible but it ought to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly look at that.  The point made by Deputies Doyle and Mitchell will be borne in mind when we are drawing up the administrative details of the scheme.  The point on insurance is valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was going to make has been made by Deputy Mitchell. It was in connection with the insurance. If the conditions of the grantee getting a grant were that the grant should be insured in addition to the value of the ship, it would get over the problem of possible loss.  There must be some way, even though it is not definitive in the Bill. I accept the Minister's goodwill.  From the point of view of a business, if they knew specifically the criteria they could plan accordingly but if they do not know that, they have to plan for the worst scenario and that may not be conducive to further investment.  Therefore, if we could look at that in terms of the conditions, it would be extremely helpful and might tie it down in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance question will be included when we are drawing up the administrative details of the scheme because not alone is it important to the Minister, it is vitally important to the company or individual owner of a boat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>Ministers change and circumstances change, and nobody is going to go into a court of law and say, &ldquo;Pat the Cope Gallagher said in the Dáil on 4 November 1987...&rdquo; That has no force in law and things change.  Business cannot plan on that basis and, therefore, has to plan on a worst case basis.  The question of insurance may be out of it, <Col N="2278" /> if the Minister cannot completely adopt Deputy Doyle's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal advice is that it is not possible to adopt that amendment completely.  I have gone as far as it is possible to go to allay the fears that are there, to ensure that whatever Minister is in office would be reasonable and humane in that respect.  Providing there is a good track record and that the company can comply with the conditions relating to the vessel, the appraisal of the applicant would be short circuited because all that would have been done before.  A good track record will help to prioritise.  It does not necessarily mean that these people will come in at the bottom of the league.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of State to something which he said this morning and which I suspect was an oblique reference to me.  He said &ldquo;Some Deputies expressed the view that ships of up to 12 years old should be eligible under this scheme, or failing that, that the age limit be raised for the purpose of giving access to the Business Expansion Scheme to projects involving the purchase of ships of that age.&rdquo;  I should like to put the record straight.  I did not say or suggest anything of that nature but the Minister could be forgiven for misunderstanding perhaps what I had said and interpreting that from it.  I said specifically on the last occasion:</P>
      <P>I have absolutely no problems with the seven year limit on secondhand vessels for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went on to say that I do believe that a <Col N="2279" /> seven year age limit for the purpose of the Business Expansion Scheme is not in the interests of the industry.  The Minister for the Marine was present on the last occasion and I was drawing his attention to the fact that the linking of the Business Expansion Scheme to the seven year clause in this section before us today is causing problems for the Business Expansion Scheme.  As far as I am aware, it will not cause problems for this Bill.  Would the Minister undertake to bring this specific difficulty to the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view, perhaps to an amendment in the 1988 Finance Bill which is, I understand, the proper way to deal with this problem? We are trying to encourage investment with an average age of our marine fleet here of 30 years.  I am being generous. We have vessels of more than 50 years old as well as new vessels; it averages out at around 30 years.  There is an enormous case for rejuvenation without insisting that under the Business Expansion Scheme seven years is the upper limit. As I pointed out on the last occasion on Second Stage, there is an enormous number of extremely good eight, nine and ten year old vessels available to our ship owners, and indeed our fishermen, but that is not relevant here.  These vessels are young by Irish standards and would rejuvenate our fleets but that will not necessarily comply here.  I am not requesting any change in the seven year limit for this, but it is unnecessarily restrictive under the Business Expansion Scheme, given the excellent value to be had on the Continent.  I would ask the Minister of State to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Finance, with a possible view to perhaps breaking the linkage.  All other conditions could stand but not necessarily the seven years limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>What was suggested by Deputy Doyle was not intended.  I was quite aware that Deputy Doyle concurred completely with the seven year clause, as did Deputy Mitchell who in his proposed legislation suggested five years and has welcomed the seven year limit. <Col N="2280" /> We are all clear on that.  The Deputies can be absolutely certain that I shall bring to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the question of the 12 year limit which would not qualify for grant aid but might qualify under the Business Expansion Scheme for consideration in the preparation of the 1988 Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>This section raises another point which is a cause of concern.  One very important aspect which has been raised by all the Deputies, including both Ministers, is that of employment in connection with the giving of these grants. Unfortunately, nowhere in the Bill is there any specific reference to the criteria of the type of employment, or of the quantity of employment needed if such a grant is to be given.  That is extremely worrying.  I know that it will not be put into the Bill now but could the Minister, in the terms that he will be drawing up whereby these grants will be given, look at the area of laying down some criterion for employment for Irish people?  We have the quality of seamen available in this country and the object of the Bill is to get as many people back in employment. I should like to see that specific reference put down somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, an important element in the entire package is that of employment.  In drawing up the regulations we would take that into consideration. To give an example, we would not be looking at an application involving a vessel which would give employment to very few as against one that would give employment to many more.  The question will certainly be taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitive. There was an amendment circulated in my name which the Chair has not ruled out of order, but I suspect that he is about to do so.  I would have liked if the Minister could have taken it on board because it incorporates what we were discussing earlier under section 2.  It would simplify the circular transfer of moneys that may result&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspected as much.  I want to come back to the substance of what that amendment was all about.  I appreciate the reason for which it was ruled out and do not argue with that ruling.  Perhaps the sentiment of my amendment could be incorporated if the Minister would agree to drop the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; in section 6 (2).  It would then read:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, conditions imposed by the Minister pursuant to that subsection may require that, in such circumstances (including the transfer or other disposal of the ship), and within such time, as the Minister may specify, the entire of the grant, or such part thereof as may be specified, shall be repaid to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would not pre-empt or naturally result in losses of revenue to the State, <Col N="2282" /> which I understand was the basis on which my amendment was ruled out.  If that cannot be accepted, given the assurances by the Minister of State that such conditions can be included, as he has been advised by the parliamentary draftsman, to satisfy those sentiments, surely those conditions in themselves would be out of order if we cannot drop the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo;?  I am a little worried about the logistics of this.  There is one area about which the Minister is aware that we have doubts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment circulated by Deputy Doyle, the test of the amendment would exempt the replacement ship from the restrictions or conditions under which the original ship was grant aided.  It could, in fact, follow that if we did this one could purchase a ship and qualify for this grant without any conditions attaching to the actual replacement ship.  That is the fear that is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a roll-over, one could provide a ship that would not be up to the necessary standards.  I fully appreciate the point the Deputy is making but I believe that discretionary power will and should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the detailed wording of my amendment might allow for that interpretation, but it was not ruled out for that reason alone.  I fully accept the Minister's interpretation.  If the second line were to be in order it would want to read &ldquo;the replacement of the lost ship with another suitably qualified ship.&rdquo;  That is academic now because we are not taking this amendment on board.  We are really trying to simplify the procedure in the event of a natural diasater where a grant aided ship is lost overnight, that once the insurance is paid the Minister will not insist on clawing back the grant and that when the ship owner wants to replace the lost ship with another suitably qualified ship he would have to go through the entire process <Col N="2283" /> of reapplying for the grant and perhaps finding that the £7.5 million is already spoken for, thereby causing unnecessary delays and complications and circular transfers of money, which is futile.  That is the point we are trying to make.  By the dropping of the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo;, we might do it without any amendments or any threat of implications to the revenue of this State.  That should be in order if the Minister's interpretation of the parliamentary draftsman's wording is also in order, and I accept it is.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I had two meetings with my co-chairman in the run-up to the recent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 21 October.  These meetings, which took place on 15 September and 17 October respectively, were part of the preparations for the conference and addressed issues on its agenda.  The joint statement issued after the conference has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and gives details of the main issues discussed on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether any agreement was reached on any of the issues; in particular, did discussions take place on the matter of extradition, the matter of the Diplock courts, the matter of fair employment and the matter of the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier?  Were any of these matters discussed?  Was any agreement reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these matters were discussed and are the subject matter of a further detailed series of replies on the actual outcome of the conference itself and various other questions tabled to me. <Col N="2293" /> The Deputy's questions were addressed to pre-conference meetings, of which two were held with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and myself.  I gave details of them to the Deputy just now.  If the Deputy will have patience there is a whole series of questions later on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked was: what matters were discussed and what decisions were taken.  Could I ask the Minister to clarify for the House what decisions, if any, were taken.  If none was taken then the Minister should say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very full joint statement which is in the Library, available to the Deputy and the House, setting out in detail what was discussed at the Anglo-Irish Conference.  There are questions later in relation to that.  What the Deputy is talking about are preliminary meetings at which all of these matters were raised.  In particular we had a very positive outcome on one aspect, that is, the fair employment legislation which is now being advanced rapidly by the British Government, designed to introduce fair employment legislation in regard to equality of opportunity and fair employment between Unionists and Nationalists, Catholics and Protestants, a system that will have teeth in it which the present system does not have and which will extend such fair employment practices across the board to semi-State agencies as well as to the civil service, local authorities and the private sector. All of that occupies a higher place on the agenda than it used.  The British Government will be introducing legislation in Westminister next year along those lines. I mention that as one example of a very practical conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware I have repeatedly called for the early introduction of new and effective legislation to tackle the problem of religious discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland.  My co-chairman of the conference, and the British authorities generally, are well aware of the Government's concern on this issue.  We have been assured that it is their intention to proceed with the drafting of legislation as quickly as possible.  The Deputy can be certain that I will continue to convey actively and forcefully to the British authorities the compelling need for the introduction of such legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to that aspect in reply to Deputy Taylor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that all sides of the House are very glad to see these new guidelines introduced which, I might say, were first welcomed by me last September when they were first spoken of.  Could the Minister tell us what is the Government's position now given the fact that he intends to see these backed up by legislation regarding what are known as the MacBride principles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to see fair employment practices and principles, along with legislation, that will be able to monitor this situation properly with attendant necessary resources that will render the MacBride principles, as such, as it were, redundant in that they will subsume the admirable principles that are incorporated in the MacBride series of principles.  If we bring in effective legislation, which is what we really want, we can expedite very desirable improvements in this area, rendering unnecessary any further &mdash; what might be termed &mdash; confrontation and controversy in this area.  This will be possible provided the proper legislation is introduced and the proper resources made available to ensure that it operates properly.  I share the Deputy's sentiments in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that <Col N="2295" /> the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is quoted at a press conference after the meeting in July as saying that the present Minister himself said that the new guidelines on fair employment superseded the MacBride principles. Would the Minister agree that this is in direct contradiction of an interview given last month by the Taoiseach to the magazine <i>Irish/America?</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe very positively that the introduction of such legislation, when implemented and with appropriate and proper resources, in effect will supersede the need for any such principles because it will incorporate the very principles being advocated in the United States at present and called the MacBride principles.  I have used the verb &ldquo;subsume&rdquo; here.  If the legislation is sufficiently effective it will subsume the MacBride principles.  That should be our objective and aspiration.  I hope I have made myself quite clear on this matter.</P>

      <P>I did not.  At all stages I welcomed the publication of the set of voluntary guidelines as an indication or statement of intent and good in so far as they went, but they are obviously inadequate in that they lack any legislative or enforcement aspects.  Unless we get legislative enforcement and, above all, provision of resources aspects covered in positive legislation then we cannot be happy about the situation which exists in Northern Ireland.  I am seeking to get the British Government to put legislation of that kind high on their agenda.</P>

      <P>Government policy remains one of commitment to the maintenance and expansion of official development assistance as soon as economic circumstances permit.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated in 1988 is £32.2 million.  This amount will be allocated as follows: £19 million will be paid in the form of multilateral aid via international organisations active in development; £12.5 million will be disbursed under the Government's programme of bilateral assistance to developing countries and the balance, £0.7 million, represents the cost of administering the bilateral aid programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating:</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister seriously tell the House that there is a commitment to the expansion of Third World aid when he has, for example, in this Estimate put a derisory allocation of £1,000 available for disaster relief where there is a 29 per cent cut in aid to four of the poorest countries of the world and where this Government propose to renege on an express commitment given by Government in March 1986 to giving an additional £1.5 million to the world food fund, apart from other express commitments? Is that not one of the most cowardly gestures ever seen in this House, to provide, for example, £1,000 for disaster relief?  I am sure that is a joke.  If it was not so tragic it would be laughable.  How can the Minister defend those three examples?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been listening he would have heard my answer which was, that the maintenance and expansion of official development aid will occur as soon as economic circumstances permit.  Secondly, the amount of £1,000 is a token Estimate.  The Deputy, having been in office, knows what a token Estimate is.</P>

Would he agree that with the massive cut of £11 million in the Estimates for 1988 the very fabric and structure of the ODA programme are now in jeopardy?  Would he further agree that the moral reputation of Ireland built up so well by the previous Government on international fora has been substantially damaged by the repudiation of many of our statutory and voluntary commitments to the ODA programme?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 15 and written Question No. 50 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has strongly and consistently supported the implementation of the principle of self-determination for the people of the Western Sahara.  It is an essential element of our approach to this conflict that, through the good offices of the UN Secretary General, conditions be created at an early date which will enable the people of the region to exercise their rights.  Accordingly, at this year's session of the UN General Assembly, I instructed the Irish delegation to vote in favour of a resolution which calls for a ceasefire in order to create the conditions necessary for a peaceful and fair referendum in the area.</P>
      <P>In a statement explaining the Irish position, our representative emphasised our full support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General in seeking to work out a basis for agreement between the parties involved.  These efforts are continuing and it is my earnest hope that they will prove fruitful.</P>
      <P>We have not recognised the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, established in 1976 by the Polisario, the region's indigenous resistance movement, because we are not in a position to recognise an independent state in the Western Sahara before the people of the region have themselves decided the issue of self-determination through a referendum. Furthermore, it is not our practice to give formal recognition to liberation movements or similar bodies which would involve ascribing to them the actual status of a Government.</P>
      <P>Humanitarian concern for the wellbeing of the Saharawi people has been a priority consideration of our approach. As a practical expression of this concern, funds have been allotted in the past for the provision of food and education supplies for the refugees living in camps in western Algeria.  We are continuing to keep the situation under close review.</P>

We feel the best way to resolve this matter is to have a properly conducted referendum, as has already been conducted in other troubled areas where elections were properly organised and supervised.  Deputy Higgins and other representatives of the three parties were at the elections in Nicaragua, which we have consistently stood over as being valid elections.  As I said, I would like to see a properly supervised referendum held in the Western Sahara.  I am aware of the terrible conditions facing the people there by way of starvation, violence, homelessness and so on.  These conditions are intolerable.

      <P>I agree that the practice of taking Priority Questions with oral questions is growing.</P>
      <P>As co-chairmen of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I jointly chaired a meeting of the conference on 21 October last at which, among other issues, the matters referred to by the Deputies were discussed.  At the conclusion of the conference a joint statement was issued, the relevant passage of which states:</P>
      <P>The conference discussed reports from the groups of officials considering measures to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice and policy aspects of extradition.  It was agreed that the two sides should remain in close contact on these issues.</P>
      <P>Discussions are, therefore, still ongoing and, in accordance with normal practice, it would not be appropriate for me to go into the substance of the issue at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of <Col N="2314" /> rejecting or accepting matters in an ongoing process.  When there is not definite agreement between both sides on any issue it becomes part of that process.  The thinking behind the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Conference was that it would be such a process and if there was not agreement on particular issues, they would remain open for discussion.  There will be further discussion on the Diplock Courts and many other issues concerning the proper administration of justice in Northern Ireland with which we are concerned.</P>

Are they at civil servant or ambassador level?  Does the Minister envisage another or a series of ministerial meetings taking place before 1 December?  Is there any procedure under which the House could be consulted either by way of statements or debate before 1 December so that we may be able to assist the Government in trying to resolve the serious difficulties that appear to be emerging?

I had a meeting in London a few days before the Anglo-Irish Conference.  I maintain my contacts and my staff maintain theirs.  We are seeking to ensure that above all else the process that has been established will continue and that there will be no diminution in Anglo-Irish relations.  At the same time, we want to ensure that what is required in regard to reforms of the administration of justice as far as the Nationalist community are concerned is followed up in a vigorous and meaningful way through the conference and by the British Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to reply to Question No. 16 in my name, one of the questions that is being taken with a number of others.  Will the Minister tell the House the attitude of the Government in regard to the coming into force of the Extradition Act, 1987, on 1 December if some of the changes in the administration of justice, and the Diplock courts, which the Government have put forward, have not taken place by then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all agree that in the public mind there is an interrelationship between the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and extradition. Speaking at Bodenstown recently the Taoiseach said it was clear that at present many Irish people are questioning whether Dáil Éireann should agree to submit Irish citizens to a system of justice in which a large section of the community in the North has not as yet been persuaded to place its confidence. That factual position must be acknowledged and, in my view, that answers the point raised by Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <P>All Members have adopted a very responsible approach to this matter.  We all accept it is a very difficult juncture but that it is one we can resolve if we adopt a steady attitude towards this matter.  I am seeking to do that, as is the Taoiseach, and I respect the fact that the leaders of all the parties <Col N="2318" /> who have spoken in the House this afternoon want to do that.  I respect the fact that the leaders of the minority constitutional party in Northern Ireland, the SDLP, are of the same view and that the British Government, and the Opposition in Westminster, take the view.  We should try to make progress when there is, in my view, a broad area of agreement.  The one heartening thing at present is that there is a broad area of agreement.  We should seek to work on that and ensure that the process which is now working and marks a very interesting development in Anglo-Irish relations and, above all else, in inter-community relations in Northern Ireland, is allowed to flourish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 20 and Priority Question No. 42 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always supported the adoption by the UN of selective mandatory sanctions against South Africa.  The Government considers that effective selective sanctions, carefully chosen, properly imposed by the UN Security Council and fully implemented are an effective means of putting pressure on the South African Government peacefully to abandon apartheid and to end its blocking of the plan for Namibian independence enshrined in Security Council Resolution 435.  The Government will continue to work for the adoption of such sanctions by the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be effective, sanctions, whether <Col N="2322" /> selective or comprehensive, require wide international support.  In our appreciation, this wide international support is at present not available for comprehensive sanctions.  The Government, therefore, doubts the feasibility of comprehensive sanctions at present and have no plans to take steps to bring the matter before the UN Security Council, of which Ireland is not a member.  Apart from our efforts at the UN, Ireland has already taken selective sanctions represented by our ban on fruit and vegetable imports from South Africa as well as by the actions taken together with our partners in the Twelve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is considering new initiatives.  I should like to think that the rather limited form of sanction which Ireland has decided to take would be extended.  Is it not far more unrealistic to expect countries that have no intention of implementing sanctions, such as Britain and others, to get into place first with their proposals, and for us then to follow? Has the advice offered to the Minister in his meetings with the different international agencies within and outside South Africa been unequivocally that the only strategy is that of international <Col N="2323" /> mandatory sanctions?  Did they request that Ireland should take an initiative and give a moral lead in this regard?</P>

We have taken certain steps in regard to fruit and vegetables and in the last Government Deputy Quinn was very influential in that regard.  We are looking at other measures but they must be taken on a practical, selective basis.  There is no point in adopting a grand principle of comprehensive sanctions if they cannot be enforced or will be flouted by business and/or national interests.  These are the facts of life of which the Deputy should be aware.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Question refers to the publication &ldquo;The Single European Act, An Explanatory Guide&rdquo; published in November 1986 and the publication &ldquo;The Single European Act, a Government information booklet&rdquo; published in May 1987.</P>
      <P>Twenty thousand copies each of the Explanatory Guide and the Information Booklet were printed.</P>
      <P>The explanatory guide was made available in November 1986 and to date approximately eighteen thousand copies have been distributed.  The information booklet was made available in May 1987 and to date approximately sixteen thousand copies have been distributed.</P>
      <P>Approximately two thousand copies of the November explanatory guide and four thousand copies of the May 1987 information booklet remain, to serve as a basic stock, from which requests from educational bodies, schools, colleges, interested societies <i>et cetera,</i> may be met on a continuing basis in the future.</P>
      <P>The cost of producing the 1986 explanatory guide was £13,680.  The cost of producing the 1987 information booklet was £6,695.29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contract for printing the explanatory guide published in November 1986 was awarded to Cahill Printers Ltd.  As I indicated in my reply to questions in this House on 16 June last, the information booklet was a revised and up-dated booklet, similar in nature and scope to the explanatory guide issued in November <Col N="2326" /> 1986.  It was decided to award the contract for printing the information booklet to the firm which had printed the explanatory guide, namely, Cahill Printers Ltd. This was done with a view to minimising delay in production and printing costs. Cahill Printers Ltd already had on film record the text of the explanatory guide. A considerable saving in printing costs was therefore technically possible by awarding them the contract for printing the information booklet.  This can be readily seen from the figures I have just provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious to do everything I can to help the employees of the H. Williams Group to secure any statutory payments due to them.  My Department is in contact with the receiver of the company and the unions concerned about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My responsibilities in this area arise under the Redundancy Payments Acts which cover the statutory redundancy <Col N="2327" /> payments entitlements and the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 which protects, within certain limits, contractual entitlements of employees of insolvent employers including unpaid wages, holiday pay and Employment Appeals Tribunal awards under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.</P>
    <P>So far as statutory redundancy payments are concerned lump sum payments fall due to be paid on the date or dates on which the redundancies take effect in individual cases.  The receiver has indicated that the company will not be in a position to make these payments and, consequently, they will fall to be paid from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  So far, my Department has not received formal redundancy notices but it is making the necessary preparations so that payments can be made as quickly as possible.  I expect that these payments will be made within two to three weeks of receipt of individual applications for payment supported by the necessary redundancy certificates from the receiver.</P>
    <P>In relation to payments under the 1984 Act, my Department will also deal with any applications as quickly as possible. The applications must be submitted by the receiver together with an appropriate certificate of inability of the company to make the payments and all relevant details of individual entitlements.  I expect that any such applications will be processed and payments made within three to four weeks of receipt provided they are properly certified by the receiver.  However, all applications for payments under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act must, in accordance with the provisions of the 1984 Act, be submitted to the EAT for determination.  Payments of any minimum notice awards will be made as soon as possible after the determinations of the EAT become available.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this question today as it affects a considerable number of <Col N="2328" /> workers.  At the beginning of the problem with H. Williams the receiver made an arrangement with the employees that he would take their IOUs for three days money they were due by the company and that he would in turn seek to recover that money from the insolvency fund. Would the Minister undertake to put it to the receiver that a similar arrangement could be made in relation to the payments due to the staff at this point in time and that as it is in his hands to issue the various certificates and so on to have the moneys paid, it would be quite a simple matter to accept the IOUs of the staff and claim in his own name for a refund of the money?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a straight answer to that because I am not sure that can be done, but I will raise it.  I am as anxious as other Deputies to try to assist the workers.  For a number of weeks back, in our talks with the unions we have assured the workers that we will move as quickly as we can, if it came to a doomsday situation such as that which a number of the staff are now in.  We are in contact with both the receiver and the unions and I will do anything I can to expedite matters.  I am not sure if what the Deputy says is possible but I will take note of it.  I have already arranged for the deployment of extra staff to that section of the Department because they will be receiving a great number of applications and in that way they can be dealt with as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that what I have suggested was done at the initial stages of the problems with the H. Williams group?  Obviously at that stage the staff were needed in order to keep the shops open but apparently the receiver now considers that they are dispensable and he is not prepared at this point to enter into this arrangement. I would appreciate if the Minister would raise this matter with the receiver.  I also ask the Minister, if that approach does not work, whether he can give an undertaking, assuming that all the various certificates are supplied by the receiver, that <Col N="2329" /> payments from the redundancy fund and the insolvency fund would be made before Christmas?  Some of the workers have been informed that, at least in the case of the insolvency fund, it could be the New Year before the money will be paid.</P>

It will take three to four weeks before some of the other payments are made.  I do not have much control over the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the appeals process will take some further time.  Most of the people should be paid before Christmas, and I say this subject to the fact that we have received no information from the receiver but I hope he delivers and, if so, the Department of Labour will deal with all the data prior to Christmas.</P>

First, can the Minister ensure that his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is kept fully briefed on the position of the workers in relation to the redundancy and the offer that has been made to the receiver by an individual which is subject to approval by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Can the concerns and the interests of the Department of Labour ride in tandem with the process of approval which the Minister for Industry <Col N="2330" /> and Commerce can exercise?  I know there is no legal basis for that but there is a political basis for it.  Secondly, having regard to the large volume of money in the employers' redundancy insolvency fund would it not be possible, subject to exploring the details, for the Department of Labour to lean on the bank that holds that account with a view to ensuring that some interim form of loan or cash payment could be made to the employees pending the completion of the process of appeal, through the time delays to which the Minister has referred?</P>

In regard to the second question, I would rather deal with the matter fully and properly with the co-operation of the staff in the relevant sections of the Department who have given me an undertaking to try to clear a large amount of the applications in the first two to three weeks and the remainder in three to four weeks.

      <P>Arising from what the Minister has said this morning in connection with the port facilities &mdash; I also said this on Second Stage &mdash; if this plan is to succeed we badly need a portal plan as this is seen as one of the ways of developing shipping.  The Minister, Deputy Daly, more or less agreed with that.  Therefore I fundamentally disagree with the Minister's assertion in his speech and ask him if he has any response to that.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Minister when he says that there are adequate port facilities here.  In conjunction with this Bill which is seen as a development of the whole area of shipping I ask the Minister if he will consider a proper overall policy for the development of the ports.

      <P>Has the Minister had time to consider the point I made before lunch in relation to section 6 (2) and the possibility of omitting the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; but allowing for a broader interpretation the parliamentary draftsman feels one can in terms of the inclusion of loss if circumstances so warrant.  Rather than presume that in the case of the natural loss the grant must be repaid, could be we just turn that on its head?  I think the parliamentary draftsman gave us an opening in his interpretation of an earlier situation.  I would like the Minister's view on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher):</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the development of the ports, there is no doubt that many of our ports are in need of repairs and maintenance and there are areas where we would like to extend our ports.  These are matters of finance and the finance available, while the four or five major shipping ports are a matter for the Department of the Marine and now the commercial harbours are also a matter for the Department.  There is some £3 million in the Estimates this year and, hopefully, some of these moneys could be used to update harbours. I feel that facilities are adequate to cater for existing and short-term future levels.  I will look at the question of what can be done in relation to the operation <Col N="2373" /> of ports generally, whether to cater for this type of boat or smaller boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>A plan could be drawn up.  It is obvious to all of us that even in the absence of a plan the ports that are necessary for the berthing of ships of the type we are referring to need to be developed.  While I am not opposed to a development plan, there are so few of the type we are talking about that if I find it necessary to prepare a plan and to give priority to the ports that require financial investment, then we can do that but the plan is available off the top of any of our heads.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the matter raised by Deputy Doyle and the amendment circulated and her suggestion that we should, in section 6 (2) delete the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo;.  The advice to me is that to do this would leave the State's investment vulnerable in the event of a grant-aided vessel being lost whether accidentally or otherwise.  In any case, each shipowner who is grant-aided in respect of a particular ship will be required in advance of payment of the grant to produce documentary evidence to show that the vessel has been fully insured.  It will be one of the conditions of the scheme that the grantee should record the interest of the Minister in insurance cover for the vessel. This insurance will cover the vessels against all eventualities, including its total loss and its replacement cost including the portion of its cost which was met by the State's investment grant.  That may overcome the difficulty which Deputy Doyle has in relation to the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that the principal purpose of the grant scheme would be to increase the size of the Irish fleet. Securing this objective is of overriding importance and must be safeguarded under the terms of the enabling legislation. I accept there were fears in regard <Col N="2374" /> to the replacement cost but I am happy, on the advice available to me, that the boat will be insured and that the Minister's interest will be included; the insurance will cover the vessel against all eventualities, including its total loss and its replacement cost including the portion of its cost which was met by the State's investment grant.  I hope that covers the point raised by Deputy Doyle.  The powers of the Minister will be broad and all of the points raised will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister because he has gone to some considerable trouble to meet our reservations in relation to this.  This has been the only area where there has been some small element of quibble in relation to the provisions. The Minister, on advice, has not been able to accommodate the management because it was not in order, or our request that the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; be dropped, and I accept that.  I hope that within the conditions that this or any further Minister may or may not lay down in regard to such an eventuality, that is, a natural disaster involving the loss of one of these grant-aided ships, the Minister can if he sees fit allow roll over and not claw back the grant and the shipowner who has borne the loss is going to re-invest in another ship that complies with all the necessary conditions.  If he should insist on the repayment of the grant or portion thereof, depending on the length of time the grant had been paid, priority will be given in terms of a grant to the man who has lost his ship to replace that ship if the £7.5 million has already been spoken for.  There are two ways to protect in the case of this eventuality now that, for different reasons, the Minister cannot accommodate what we ask.  I would like to thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials for coming down the road as far as they could in relation to this point that has been causing concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate my general welcome for the Bill which is very timely.  I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials for having brought it with reasonable haste to the House.  The Government are in office only since last March.  I thank my colleague, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Mitchell, for the groundwork he did and which has been generously recognised by the Minister and Minister of State already.  I acknowledge also the groundwork that the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements did in relation to the provisions we are now discussing and which we hope will shortly be enacted.  These were all published by Deputy Mitchell some time ago in the form of the Green Paper on Transport. It is quite rewarding to find that there are issues such as these which follow through on a change of administration and that basically what we all want is to ensure that the shipping industry has the structure in which to thrive and expand.  We want to rejuvenate our fleet and increase it.  We want to ensure, apart from the trade aspects, that in any eventuality we would have a strategic fleet on which we can call if and when it may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2376" /> There is the employment aspect and that of the training of merchant seamen and many other aspects which are most important and which are all contiguous to the different parts of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that subject to budgetary constraint at least £1.03 million will be made available under the scheme next year, the first year of its full operation, with about £500,000 this year, I understand, which will possibly suffice for the applications that are on hand awaiting the processing of this legislation.  May I take it that there will be no question that the budgetary constraints will suddenly arrive upon us next year and that there may be no grant aid to make applications under this Bill feasible for next year?  The Minister of State confirmed that the £1.03 million is included in the Book of Estimates under the relevant subhead and will be there for such applications in 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will agree that the way in which this debate has been conducted shows that we have been trying to encourage him in this area, particularly in the development of an Irish fishing fleet.  I hope that he would see this as a signal for further development. As the Minister and the Minister of State have said, this is a first step.  I hope that the Minister would see that this constructive approach will be taken into account and that he will be anxious to bring forward even more enlightened development in the whole area of shipping.</P>
      <P>In the area of employment which is my concern with this Bill, would he at all times give great serious consideration to that aspect of the development?  We have in this country today people who, unfortunately, are unemployed but are very able seafaring people, many as a result of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  We have that skilled workforce available to us and when giving grant aid in the months ahead every effort should be made to ensure that as many people as possible are re-employed in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, with regard to insurance I thank the Minister for looking into that <Col N="2377" /> aspect and satisfying the House with regard to the matters under query with regard to the possible loss of a ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Doyle that £1.03 million is included under the appropriate subhead in the Estimate for 1988 and, of course, £515,000 is available this year.  It is hoped this Bill will get as speedy a passage through the Seanad as it has got in this House in order that it will be enacted as quickly as possible.  It is in everyone's interest that the shipping industry should be assisted.</P>
      <P>I overlooked a point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe who suggested that we should tie in payments of grants with training, that this was a feasible proposition.  It is an interesting point and we shall certainly examine the Deputy's proposal.  The training capacity of grantees will be considered in the procedures.</P>
      <P>The question of insurance is of vital importance, not just for the Minister but for the grantees.  It is in their interest that we ensure that there is available a proper insurance policy in the event of any difficulties arising but particularly the one referred to earlier which caused some anxiety, that was the question of loss, that the insurance would cover the replacement value including the grant made available by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment is a vitally important element in the entire package.  That will be of paramount importance when we are vetting each application.  Of course, there are guidelines available and we shall be guided by the Marine Surveyor. All things being equal, the question of employment is vitally important.  We have former employees of Irish Shipping whom we have been unable to help by extra statutory redundancy repayments. These now could benefit from the additional employment opportunities afforded by the incentives in this Bill. The strategic fleet will be increased in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements to approximately 158,000 deadweight tonnes.  The income earned could be used to expand the national fleet <Col N="2378" /> which would result in a net balance of payments improvement through foreign earnings and import substitution.  Irish companies would be paying Irish shipowners to transport the materials where at present overseas shipping enjoy the business.  We are now carrying only 20 per cent of our own goods.  Employment prospects for seamen and shore based personnel would be improved.</P>
    <P>The necessary marine training facilities refered to by Deputy O'Keeffe, including access to sea time experience will continue to be available to seagoing cadets, thereby ensuring the continuation in Ireland of the necessary marine skills for the future.  The shipping industry would receive a stimulus which might fuel further expansion in both the size and scope of their service.  It is of particular interest to me as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine that I am looking forward to the day when these grants will assist individuals or companies in the purchase of refrigerated vessels which would carry our frozen products from the country more than to the country.</P>

The Bill as drafted contains a very wide definition of what is a clinical trial and I welcome that.  Can the Minister tell the House whether this definition which is extremely broad will cover health and homeopathic products?  I would like to ask another question which relates to the impact this Bill will have on the National Drugs Advisory Board and on the Minister's Department.  In that context, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that this scheme would replace the existing voluntary arrangements for the clearance of proposals for such trials through the National Drugs Advisory Board and that it would now become a statutory system of controlling clinicial trials.  Would the Minister clarfiy what the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board will be and to what extent their work in this area will be superseded by the work done by his Department or does he see the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board expanding?</P>

Will there be an increase in the number of staff employed in the section which deals with this area in the Minister's Department? The Minister says that the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board will be an advisory one but is this not in conflict with his intention of reducing duplication?  I accept that the Minister inherited this Bill but I have felt since the drafting of this Bill that the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board was inadequately thought out and I feel that they should be more involved in the day to day running of the scheme.  Many of my amendments will be to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>I page 4, subsection (2), lines 28 to 30, to delete paragraph (b), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the conditions under which the product authorisation was granted are held by the National Drugs Advisory Board to comply with the limits of the condition under which the produce may be used.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be very familiar with the arguments in regard to this amendment as they were teased out on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  On that occasion an amendment which attempted to do something similar to what I am seeking to do here was not accepted despite the fact that many Senators felt there was a problem in this area.  I would like to refer to the problem which this amendment seeks to deal with.  The Bill as originally drafted contained no section dealing with existing drugs.  Subsequently, this section was inserted into the Bill.  It was felt that all of the existing drugs would have to be retested and this section was inserted to deal with that problem.  But a problem remained and this amendment seeks to deal with it.  It relates to the variations in the way in which drugs are administered.  Authorisations are rarely updated and in practice a doctor may decide to prescribe a slightly lower dosage or prescribe two tablets instead of one.  That may not be the best example but in the case of an elderly person a doctor may decide to prescribe a lower dose than what is normally prescribed for an average adult. This is being done regularly.  Without some form of amendment what would happen is that, unless, say, doctors, chemists or whoever prescribing medicines confine themselves to the strict limits of an authorisation, which may be outdated, they would then have to undergo the full rigours of applying for a <Col N="2383" /> new clinical trial in order to change it.</P>
    <P>The former Minister, in replying to the Seanad debate, indicated that it was open to the person conducting the trial to go back and seek a change in the authorisation. Is that redress open to the person conducting the trial, to every general practitioner, every consultant in a hospital or anybody who may wish to use the medication?  If it is not written into this Bill then it is possible that these people might see themselves in law being obliged to go through the full rigours of a clinical trial.  Why can the provision not be written into the Bill in some form, for example, by way of what is advocated in my amendment?  It does not afford great freedom.  It involves the National Drugs Advisory Board in deciding perhaps on some alternative dosage which might be slightly out of line with the original authorisation but which would be seen to be well within the limits allowable for the drug in question.  Has the Minister given this much further thought?  Would he consider accepting this amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a lot of thought to this amendment and indeed this section.  I would be concerned to ensure that we would not impede legitimate trials in any way.  At the same time there is an obligation on us to ensure that we protect the interests of participants. This is a highly technical area worthy of further consideration.  I acknowledge that there must be provision in the Bill for clinical trials conducted on existing products or drugs which have been authorised and which may have been on the market for many years.  What I am concerned about is that the wording in Deputy Flaherty's amendment would leave the situation uncontrolled when many trials are conducted using such products, for example, if somebody were to use a much higher dosage than that authorised by the National Drugs Advisory Board or in terms of bio-availability, use a higher amount of the pharmaceutical preparation in whatever drug is being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern that we <Col N="2384" /> would not impede legitimate trials. Nevertheless it is important that we protect the interests of participants in a trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's willingness to examine this section and to consider the issues involved.  I gather the Minister is willing to consider what he believes to be an improved draft which would achieve the same objective. The point the Minister made &mdash; that somebody might seriously abuse the limits of an authorisation &mdash; is not possible under the provisions of my amendment. The only way in which that authorisation could be varied is on request to the National Drugs Advisory Board and, under the terms of my amendment, any variation can take place only if they allow it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it will be seen that the provisions of my amendment are not very loose.  They are quite specific and involve the National Drugs Advisory Board in any deviation from an authorisation.  I would ask the Minister to examine this matter closely.  My fear would be that many groups here, representing the universities, some of the clinics involved in a good deal of research and so on might be involved in a huge bureaucratic process of setting up a whole new trial. Indeed, the ultimate result would be for the National Drugs Advisory Board simply to say that it could be tried.  In fact, under the terms of current procedures this can take place outside the law.  I contend that of the writing in of the permission of the National Drugs Advisoty Board affords sufficient protection.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that we would not impede legitimate trials.  A further consideration in relation to Deputy Flaherty's proposal is that it would give the National Drugs Advisory Board a statutory role and considerable discretion in taking decisions in relation to trials using existing products. As in the case of drugs and medicines controlled under other legislation, it is the Minister for Health who is the competent authority in deciding issues of <Col N="2385" /> importance like this.  It is appropriate that his role should be reflected in any amendment along these lines.  I acknowledge that the National Drugs Advisory Board have made a major contribution in controlling clinical trials under the existing voluntary arrangements but, within a statutory framework, it is the Minister who will have primary responsibility.  I propose to provide this and a consultative role for the National Drugs Advisory Board.  I am prepared to take a look at this section and to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which I hope will satisfy Deputy Flaherty's and my concern about this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 40 and 41, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of ethics committees is the one about which there is most central concern in the House.  The ethics committee is a central feature of the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill is dependent on its being effective.  To a large extent the protection of volunteers or patients is in the hands of the ethics committee. It is extremely important that the way in which members of that committee are appointed is above question in terms of their commitment to supervise trials, in an independent way and to protect the public and personal interests involved. Therefore it would be totally inappropriate &mdash; I know many other people share this view &mdash; that a person who is proposing to arrange for a trial should be the person who names the ethics committee for that trial.  Hence I suggest the deletion of this subsection.  Here I gather I may run into the same problem I did with regard to amendment No. 1 in relation to the role I am giving the National Drugs Advisory Board.  In reality the Minister will be relying on them and their expertise by way of their consultative role.  I am worried that we may be setting up a layer of bureaucracy that, ultimately, may not involve a great deal more supervision but much more bureacuracy, delay in decisions and the handling of trials and may not achieve a great deal more.  It is important for us to produce a tightly-worded Bill which will introduce extra controls and impose them on the body which will be providing most of the expert advice and supervision in this area, in other words, the National Drugs Advisory Board, unless I can draw the Minister more on my first question which was: What expansion of staffing, recruitment of new talent or development of talent does he envisage to handle the increased workload involved for his Department in taking on this fairly <Col N="2387" /> specialised area?  For the purposes we are concerned about, it is not beyond the comprehension of any person of average intelligence.  Therefore, it is fundamentally wrong that the person who is going to conduct a trial should in any way nominate members of the ethics committee.</P>
    <P>This was debated in the Seanad where an amendment on the lines proposed by The Workers' Party was considered and rejected.  The amendment proposed the formation of a national committee.  In its place I suggested that another way of solving this problem was that a person who wishes to conduct a clinical trial should apply to the National Drugs Advisory Board &mdash; the Minister could say to the Department &mdash; for the nomination of an ethics committee to supervise the trial who would normally be either the existing ethics committee for the larger hospitals or ethics committees appointed by the health boards for smaller hospitals or individuals or private companies.</P>
    <P>The desire here is clear and I think it is shared by speakers in the other House. Deputy De Rossa can speak for himself but I think that desire is behind The Workers' Party's amendment in this area, namely, that ethics committees should be seen to be appointed by a body with public accountability such as the health boards.  Many hospitals have their own ethics committees, and many hospitals where a good deal of research goes on at the moment would be unhappy to have any committee other than their own ethics committee decide ethics for that hospital or supervise activities which have ethical considerations in that hospital. How are these concerns to be balanced?</P>
    <P>Some improvement on the current process is necessary.  The only reference in the Bill to the appointment of an ethics committee is in section 3 (1) (c) which provides that the identity is detailed by the conductor of the trial and the Minister must approve of it.  That is inadequate. It is a fundamental flaw in the Bill which needs to be amended substantially so that all concerned can see clearly that there is public participation in the selection of <Col N="2388" /> ethics committees.  Confidence must be engendered that ethics committees are selected in a way that will enable them to perform all the functions that will be given to them under this Bill, to protect the interests of the volunteers and not make the ethics committee a tool of the conductor of the trial.  Matters must not be left as unspecified and obscure as they are in the legislation currently.</P>

      <P>The question of an ethics committee is central to this Bill and is of concern to everybody who is involved, either the people who might be participants in clinical trials or people engaged in the trials.  It is not good enough that the companies, hospitals or universities who will be proposing to engage in such trials would have the right to appoint the ethics committees.  I do not see that Deputy Flaherty's amendment No. 3 would overcome the problem. She is suggesting that the ethics committees of existing large hospitals, health boards where smaller hospitals are involved, or private companies would be adequate.  Certainly if hospitals are appointing their own ethics committees you would have no greater protection there then you would under the present terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The only way of ensuring confidence in an ethics committee and ensuring that there is no question about the way they operate is to have a national committee appointed by the Minister.  This would lift the whole matter out of the area of localised problems with regard to ethics committees which we have seen arising in hospitals of one kind or another, where there are disputes about ethics committees having the right to take certain actions or whether the views they express or the decisions they make are fully in line with the rights of the patient concerned and not dictated by some other consideration.  Therefore, it is essential that a national ethics committee be established who would be above all that and who would, as other bodies have suggested, include not only medical people of standing but also lay people of responsibility and standing.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 5 as a way of resolving the difficulties which I see arising with the Bill and with Deputy Flaherty's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputy Flaherty, an important amendment was incorporated into the Bill on Committee stage in the Seanad which provided that an application for permission to carry out a clinical trial shall <Col N="2390" /> be accompanied by &ldquo;the identity (which includes the qualification of each member) of the ethics committee&rdquo;.  This is in section 31 (1) (c) of the Bill.  The proposal by the NDAB that they should nominate the ethics committee might lead to undue delay in processing aplications and would not, in my view, add to the control required at this time.  The guidelines which will be drawn up by the Minister in relation to ethics committees will guarantee adequately the impartiality and independence of such committees. Nevertheless, it might be desirable, in the light of experience of operating the system, to give the NDAB a role on the lines proposed by Deputy Flaherty if the Bill as drafted does not include such a provision in the future.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendment proposed by Deputy De Rossa, the nature of an ethics committee is such that they require to have close involvement in the supervision of all aspects of the trial.  Clearly it is impracticable for a single national body to assume that sort of function.  The NDAB will, of course, be the adviser to the Minister on the general acceptability of each proposal.  This will, I believe, meet the intention behind the Deputy's proposal.  However, it must be borne in mind that in striving to achieve a framework to protect participants in clinical trials it is appropriate that each individual trial be supervised to the greatest possible extent.  This would not be possible if we had a single national ethics committee. For these reasons I feel that the amendment would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aware of the problems with a single national committee because of the scale and number of trials conducted.  The localised alternative is probably the health boards on which there are locally elected representatives. If the legislation stands as it is, every person proposing to conduct a trial will have to name an ethics committee.  What number of ethics committees are envisaged? Will there simply be a recognition of the status quo in regard to ethics committees which operate for hospitals and institutions such as ICP?  Are these the <Col N="2391" /> kind of committees which the Minister envisages?  It is a weakness in the Bill that the matter of ethics committees is left unspecified and many of the central issues are to be dealt with by regulation.  This is unfortunate.  The, Bill should be more specific as to the make-up of ethics committees. As it stands, it will be outside the ambit of the legislation.  Functions are being allocated to these committees, but we do not know how the committees will be made up.  We must have a clear indication that these committees will not be the tools of individuals carrying out particular trials and that they will be seen to be independent,.  It is not good enough to depend on the goodwill of a Minister who may at some stage &mdash; God forbid &mdash; have a vested interest.  The legislation must stand by itself and must not be dependent on the goodwill of an officer of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister regards the establishment of a national ethics committee as impracticable on the basis that it could not oversee all the individual trials going on at any time, whether in hospitals, pharmacology companies or universities.  Committees by their nature tend to sit around tables, discussing things and making decisions. They do not as a body monitor activities. The argument against a national committee does not stand up if we are talking about the practical operations of the committee. Any ethics committee, whether it be a local ethics committee or a university ethics committee, will operate on the basis of reports it receives from perhaps one or two committee members who carry out on-site inspections.  It is quite feasible to have a national ethics committee where a number of people would have the right to visit clinical trials in order to monitor what was going on.  They should have the right to do so without giving any prior notice to the people promoting the trials.  The Minister is not on sound ground when arguing on the basis of impracticality.  I have been involved with quite a number of committees at various times and I am aware that the <Col N="2392" /> role of a committee is to discuss and monitor on the basis of reports received from individuals on the spot.</P>
      <P>Regarding section 8, which I seek to amend, the role set out for ethics committees is to decide on the correctness of the applications and the procedures to be adopted.  As far as I can see, there is nothing in that section which gives the ethics committee the right to monitor the trial as it goes on.  The Minister might clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many hospitals have an ethics committee, as do many of the institutes carrying out clinical trials.  It is laid down in the legislation that the names of the committee will be submitted to the Minister when an application is made to carry out such trials.  The Minister will then decide whether he approves of the ethics committee.  While the constitution of the ethics committee will vary depending on the nature of the trial, it is proposed to formulate guidelines in connection with the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This is for the information of applicants so that they will know what the Minister might be expected to approve of in terms of an ethics committee.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board would regard the following composition as a minimum: two medical practitioners, neither of whom is personally involved in the study to be conducted; one practitioner at least should be independent of the institution in which the study is to be conducted and one at least should also be personally familiar with the conduct of clinical trials.  There should also be a nurse actively involved in patient care and one professional, non-medical person who is involved in administration or business.  There should be one person with legal training and one member of the lay public whose competence and integrity the public might be expected to respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the ethics committee would represent the various sectors who should have an interest and it would be for the Minister to decide the competence <Col N="2393" /> of the committee.  If he was not satisfied in that regard, then he would not approve the committee.</P>
    <P>A local ethics committee would provide a better safeguard for the participants than a national committee.  It would be very difficult for one committee to cope with the large number of trials going on at different locations throughout the country.  In 1986 there were 218 applications to the National Drugs Advisory Board under the non-statutory arrangements. With the provision of the Bill requiring detailed information about the composition of an ethics committee, I feel that independence and impartiality are guaranteed in respect of each individual trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the specifics of my amendment, I ask the Minister to give it further consideration.  In the context of the operation of clinical trials the ethics committees in hospitals have operated with a 100 per cent protection record so far as one can gauge.  I asked the Minister earlier this year if there has been any claims arising out of clinical trials in hospitals and the answer was that there has been none.  I gather that the reporting of side effects has been minimal according to the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>Members of an ethics committee should understand clinical trials and what is involved.  Some of these members would be lay people and others would have a business background understanding inducements and the financial implications of decisions made.  We might criticise decisions made by ethics committees in our hospitals but so far as clinical trials are concerned, they have operated fairly successfully.  However, there was one case which led to this legislation. It involved an independent commerical organisation engaged in clinical trials which was making a great deal of money out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think it appropriate that such institutions could selectively appoint their own ethics committee and under this Bill they will still do so, although the <Col N="2394" /> Minister will have the right to agree or turn down the nominations.  I do not consider that is adequate.  There should be a second tier of protection, and it should not be left to the institution concerned to name those committees without any other guidance than the broad guidelines which are laid down.</P>
    <P>The people who deal most closely with the ethics committees are the National Drugs advisory Board and officials in the Department.  I believe the National Drugs Advisory Board are happy with some committees but not with others. In a very short time we could develop, through the National Drugs Advisory Board or through the Department, a panel for ethics committees.  It should be set down in law and not left to the individual to name a person for membership on such a committee, simply depending on the Minister's yes or no. This is not adequate protection because it does not deal with the question of ethics committees sufficiently strongly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look again at my amendment which says that a person who proposes to arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial shall apply to the National Drugs Advisory Board for the nomination of an ethics committee to supervise the trial, which shall normally be either the existing ethics committee of the larger hospitals or an ethics committee appointed by the health board where smaller hospitals, individuals, or private companies are involved.  I believe the health board would be able to provide the necessary expertise and decisions would be taken at a level where there would be public representatives as well as representatives of the medical profession. It is important that private companies should not be the primary mover in setting up their own ethics committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister has set his mind against the idea of a national committee.  With regard to the guidelines which he says will be prepared in consultation with the National Drugs Advisory Board, is he using the suggestions in the report of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, who <Col N="2395" /> made recommendations on page 12 of their document with regard to the membership and appointment of ethics committees? Section (d) of that report says that both sexes should be represented on that committee.  Would the Minister accept that as one of the guidelines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines will indicate the type of committee which might be approved by the Minister.  Therefore those who wish to carry out clinical trials will be aware of what would be expected. The National Drugs Advisory Board will be advising the Minister for Health, who will also have his own medical and pharmaceutical staff in the Department. Having received that advice, if the Minister is concerned about the impartiality, independence or competence of any member of an ethics committee, he may refuse to accept the ethics committee.  I believe there is a sufficient safeguard there to ensure that the rights of participants will be protected.</P>
      <P>On Deputy De Rossa's point, the general guidelines I read out were recommendations by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to accept that paragraph because it need not necessarily be so.  What the Minister will be concerned with is the expertise, competence and independence of the ethics committee.  The members of that committee may be all men or all women but the important criterion is their expertise, competence and independence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is saying with regard to expertise, competence and independence, but there is a very strong body of opinion that in order to get a balanced view of any particular trial, there should be people from both sexes on the committee. It could happen that trials being <Col N="2396" /> carried out could affect one or other of the sexes and have an emotional effect which would not necessarily be clear to an all male or an all female committee. I think the possibility of an all female committee is next to nil, not that I would agree that it would be right to have an all female committee, but there is a necessity to ensure that there is representation of both sexes on the committee.</P>
      <P>In referring to the guidelines which would be issued, I think the Minister mentioned a lay person who would be a professional.  Is that right?  He mentioned a legal person, two medical people and a lay person who would be a professional. Is there any reason why that person needs to be a professional?</P>

I also mentioned a nurse actively involved in patient care, one professional non-medical person who is involved in administration of business, one person with legal training and a member of the lay public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Deputy De Rossa's point that in certain clinical trials there may be a reason why a person of one or other sex should be represented.  That is something the Minister would take into account and if he believes, for example that there should be a woman on the ethics committee he can refuse to approve of the ethics committee submitted to him and make the point that he will not approve of it until the name of a woman who has the expertise, competence and independence is appointed.  The Minister may <Col N="2397" /> also consider it necessary to have a man on an ethics committee.

      <P>It is obvious that the Minister is working from the guidelines relating to ethics committees produced by the National Drugs Advisory Board. I should like to know why the Minister, and his predecessor, decided against including such a provision in the Bill. There is unease in our party about depending on the Minister rejecting an ethics committee if they are unsuitable. Would it not be better to have the independence of such a committee established at the outset by insuring that they are appointed by outside interested parties? There has been public concern about the adequacy of the supervision of trials.  In the course of the Seanad debate the Minister indicated that he might deal with this by way of an informal regulation and not by way of a statutory one.  Will the Minister give the House his views on this matter?  It is important that he should do so because it will have a bearing on our views on the amendment.  The Bill will be flawed if this matter is not resolved.</P>

The difficulty about writing them into legislation is that an ethics committee may have a different composition depending on the nature of the trial. Deputy De Rossa has raised a point that would have to be taken into account in that regard.  The Minister, with the advice available to him and his Department, and the expert advice from the National Drugs Advisory Board, will be in a position to critically assess the expertise, competence and independence of the ethics committee.  I am satisfied that there will be sufficient safeguards to ensure that the interests of the participants are protected.</P>

      <P>The amendment in my name states that the ethics committee for a proposed clinical trial shall be entitled to inspect the place where the trial is to be conducted at any time during the preparation for and conduct of the trial. I agree that it should be taken with the other amendments.  There is a gap after permission is given to undertake a trial. I understand that in a later section the Minister or a person nominated by him which could be the ethics committee has power to inspect but in my view we should specify that the ethics committee and the National Drugs Advisory Board should have the power to inspect.  That would greatly strengthen the supervision of trials.</P>

      <P>Amendment <Col N="2399" /> No. 5 in my name proposes that the Minister should appoint an ethics committee which shall be responsible for the supervision of all clinical trials conducted in the State.  That amendment seeks to establish a national committee for the purpose and to have a committee which will supervise all trials and section 8 of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>Where the Minister is satisfied that a proposed ethics committee for a clinical trial is competent to consider the justification for conducting the proposed clinical trial and the circumstances under which it is to be conducted, he shall give his approval of the proposed committee...</P>
      <P>The section goes on to outline the criteria which the committee should consider before giving approval.  However, there is no provision in the Bill for the ethics committee to monitor what is taking place or provide protection for the participants which the Minister said will be given to local committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The sections dealing with the ethics committee are of paramount importance.  Section 8 (4) lays down the matters which the ethics committee should have regard to the coming to a decision as to whether there is justification for the proposed trial and the circumstances under which it is to be conducted.  Obviously the ethics committee, as already stated, will have to be approved by the Minister.  The section says that the committee must satisfy themselves as to the qualifications and competence of the doctors and dentists conducting the proposed trial and also to the resources available to such people. Such resources would include supporting staff, accommodation and equipment. The committee, as well as the Minister, must satisfy themselves as to the criteria used for the recruitment and selection of participants.  The committee will have a responsibility to ensure that the recruitment of persons as participants is done in a proper, ethical manner.  They will also have a pivotal role in ensuring that the <Col N="2400" /> provisions of the Bill in relation to obtaining the consent of participants in trials are fully observed.  It is also required that the ethics committee must have regard to the policy of insurance proposed for the cover of participants.  The ethics committee must satisfy themselves as to the nature and extent of the medical examination of proposed participants in each case.  Generally, this would include consultation with the family doctor but this would not always be appropriate.  For example, an applicant may not have a family doctor in which case the committee must ensure that an independent medical examination is arranged for the participant who may be a patient in a hospital and that his medical condition is fully monitored there.</P>
      <P>Specific reference to independent medical examination covers situations where the medical examiner might be deemed by the committee to have a direct involvement in the trial or perhaps to be a member of the staff of the company carrying out the trial.  The ethics committee must also satisfy themselves as to the arrangements for monitoring the health of participants during the actual trial and afterwards.  They, as well as the Minister, must also have regard to details of any proposed inducements or awards, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for becoming or being a participant. These details must also accompany the application to the Minister for permission to carry out such a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (j) requires the ethics committee to have regard to any payment, monetary or otherwise, to be paid to doctors or dentists conducting the trial or any part of the trial.  The committee will have to consider, from an ethical viewpoint, whether such payments will be appropriate.  They must also satisfy themselves as to the arrangement for ensuring that the identity of each participant in clinical trials remains confidential.  Publication of the results of a trial should not breach this confidentiality and the ethics committee must have regard to any payment, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for facilities used during the <Col N="2401" /> clinical trials.  This was designed to bring out whether, for instance, in the case of a clinical trial to be conducted in a hospital, it is appropriate that the hospital authorities be compensated for the use of some of their facilities during the trials.</P>
    <P>The question of inspection is dealt with in section 11 which permits any person authorised by the Minister, to inspect the place at which the trial is conducted.  Such a person could include a member of the ethics committee.  It goes without saying that, in practice, every facility sought by the ethics committee in considering a proposal for a clinical trial would have to be given to them in this regard.  Section 4 (2) (a) also gives the ethics committee a major say in relation to whether the final ministerial approval may be given to a clinical tiral.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, in relation to section 11, that he has the power to seek information and that he may appoint a member of the ethics committee to make inquiries and to carry out inspections.  I made the point earlier that the ethics committee should be separated from the centre, company, university or hospital which was carrying out the trial so that there would be absolute confidence in the ethics committee and that there was no question of staff of a company or university, who would be under pressure from such companies and institutions not to rock the boat, becoming involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the seriousness of the issue with which we are dealing, it is absolutely essential that we have this demonstration of impartiality.  In response to my point, the Minister said he felt it was impracticable to have a national committee because they could not monitor all the trials in progress.  The Minister now says that they do not have a role in monitoring trials in progress, it is only if he decides to appoint one of them to carry out inspections that they would have a role in that regard.  He argued that the ethics committee nominated by the body carrying out the trial would have a better role in protecting the participants.  My understanding <Col N="2402" /> of what the Minister said is that the ethics committee effectively have no role in protecting the participants other than giving adjudication on whether the proposed trial is properly laid out, that the people carrying it out are professional and so on.  However, they have no role in monitoring the clinical trial when it is in progress.  That undermines the Minister's argument <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national ethics committee but I know the Minister has set his mind against that approach.  I urge him to rethink his position and to take the point I am making, that a national committee would be in a better position with regard to independence to ensure that there would be a supervisory role for a start under my amendment.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>It is laid down in section 4 that the local ethics committee must have regard to the extent to which the health of participants is proposed to be monitored during and after clinical trials. This, combined with the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board in advising the Minister and with the Minister's own responsibility to ensure that he is satisfied that the interests of the participant are protected, are sufficient to ensure that that will be the case.</P>

      <P>What about section 4 (d)?  I wish to stress that the role of the committee is to adjudicate, they must satisfy themselves that the proposed protection of the participant before and after is properly and adequately provided for in the proposal.  There is no role for them to carry out a monitoring function once the clearance has been given.  That is a function of the Minister and, therefore, the argument against national ethics committees does not stand.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendment No. 2 which proposes to delete paragraph (c), those Deputies who have been involved in the consideration of this remain concerned about the independence of ethics committees so appointed.  The protection which the Minister is offering to the public, and his <Col N="2403" /> reassurance, related to the guidelines the Minister will lay down.  As the Minister did not reply to a previous question I asked, I would ask him again if he will tell us what the status of these guidelines will be.  Will they be statutory regulations or informal regulations?  We wish to be satisfied that they will be statutory regulations laying down the kind of guidelines referred to by the Minister and drawn up by the National Drugs Advisory Board which would take consideration of the issues referred to in section 8, the justification of the proposed trial, the acceptability of the proposed study, the acceptability of the correct actions of those undertaking it and so on.  The guidelines should also relate to an issue which is not really dealt with in section 8, the issue of the adequacy of experimental studies and relevant available literature defining potential risks to participants, methods of recruitment, the consent of the participant and compliance with the protocol assurance of accepting financial arrangements to pay appropriate insurance cover and the encouragement and facilitation of good bio-medical research.  The statutory regulations should also cover regulations governing the appointment and the make-up of the committee.  Will these be statutory regulations or informal guidelines?  This is crucial and if we had a categoric assurance that this would be on a statutory basis it might obviate some of the concern in relation to the committee.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to ensure as speedy as possible a processing of trials. This is particularly important where trials are being conducted on terminally ill people.  In the treatment of cancer new drugs are emerging each day.  When a person is terminally ill he, his doctor and his family may be anxious that advantage be taken of new drugs which may help. Speed can be of the essence in these cases.  A minimal requirement of 12 weeks could mean that a group of patients suffering from terminal illnesses would not be treated with new drugs.  I know that in optimum conditions the Department, the National Drugs Advisory Board and doctors may be able to cooperate, but 12 weeks is too long of an outside limit.  Six weeks would be more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Twelve weeks is the maximum time limit permissible.  While I hope that in practice it will be possible to process applications in less than 12 weeks, it is important to make sure that there is sufficient leeway to provide for the occasion when a full 12 weeks of consideration might be necessary.  The National Drugs Advisory Board might be caused problems if we were to reduce the time to six weeks.  We should retain 12 weeks as the maximum time permissible under the Bill.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that the National Drugs Advisory Board pride themselves on not having been caught up in the bureaucratic delays that are a feature of departmental handling of matters.  The appeal of the body set up as a semi-State body is that there has been flexibility and an ability to deal on a one to one basis with doctors working in hospitals to the benefit of patients. While much treatment will not be affected by the Bill in that it will be direct treatment of individual patients and has been excluded specifically from the Bill, there will be occasions where flexibility and speedy handling of the trials on patients will be important.  The speedy processing of various applications has not been a problem for the National Drugs Advisory Board and I understand that they would not find it difficult to cope with a shorter time limit.  Whether or not they find it difficult, it is a desirable objective.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy on the need to expedite the processing of clinical trials and I recognise the record of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  I have no doubt that they would not want to delay unnecessarily the processing of applications but the 12 weeks is about the right balance as the maximum time limit permissible.  Six weeks could cause problems for the board and for the person or persons who wish to carry out the trial. If the Minister or the National Drugs Advisory Board did not have sufficient information within the six weeks they would have to refuse permission for the <Col N="2406" /> trial and it would necessitate a new application and perhaps a new fee from the person or persons wishing to carry out the trial.  While I share the Deputy's concern that the processing of trial applications should be expedited, if we were to reduce it below 12 weeks it might not be in the interests of the persons wishing to carry out the trial.  We should leave it at 12 weeks.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minister's reply that he and the Department are committed to minimum rather than maximum limits being observed where possible.  At times in the past there were serious problems with delays in other areas of the National Drugs Advisory Board's responsibilities, but in recent times there has been a speedy processing of applications.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would undertake to allow flexibility so that there would be an ability to respond speedily as the National Drugs Advisory Board often deal with what are almost emergencies.  The Minister should ensure that his Department in undertaking so many extra responsibilities under this Bill, should consider that matter also, while obviously guaranteeing the protection of the patient or individuals involved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (4), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  details of the proposed method or methods by which participants are to be recruited;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try to ensure that the methods to recruit participants in drug trials are not used in a way which would induce people to participate who would not normally want to engage in these trials and to ensure, for instance, that there are no payments to third parties to encourage people to take part.  One of the fears of those of us who have been concerned with this area is that the attraction to participate is greatest among those who are least well off. People with no income or very little income may be attracted to participate by offers of money or other inducements when they might not normally consider doing so.</P>
      <P>As mentioned earlier, there are a number of criteria set out in this section. It lays down the various matters which the ethics committee will consider before recommending approval of a trial.  This is one criterion which should be included with the others.  I am not suggesting that the people organising a trial would put financial pressure on prospective participants, but that their own cirumstances may be such that there is financial pressure on them to participate.  It may be possible for some of these institutions to engage a third party and pay them to recruit.  That should not be allowed.  For that reason I am putting forward this amendment which details that the proposed method or methods by which participants are to be recruited should be included as one of the criteria which the ethics committee would consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment and one which I hope the Minister might consider accepting.  There has been concern, in particular, about persons being recruited from hostels in the city of Dublin for participation in these trials.  This amendment would strengthen the Bill and would help to specify this area, although I appreciate that it is touched on directly.  We will be supporting the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the extent of this proposed amendment is already provided for in the Bill.  Under section 8 (4) (c) and (i) the ethics committee have to satisfy themselves as to the criteria to be used for the recruitment and the selection of participants and as <Col N="2411" /> to details of any proposed inducements or awards, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for becoming or for being a participant.</P>
      <P>In addition, under section 3 (1) (e) and (f) it is stated that persons who wish to conduct a clinical trial must inform the Minister of the criteria to be used for the recruitment and the selection of participants and the details of any proposed inducements or rewards, whether monetary or otherwise, to be made for becoming or being a participant.  It is, therefore, not necessary to amend the Bill in view of the fact that this matter is already covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is quite conceivable that an institution may have difficulty in finding participants for particular trials or indeed that the criteria imposed by the ethics committee or the Minister may restrict the recruitment of participants.  This may lead these institutions to circumvent the criteria by using third parties to pay, recruit, or offer inducements to prospective participants.  For that reason I urge the Minister to make it necessary that the ethics committee inquire into the methods which an institution would use for recruitment.  I know there are sections in the Bill which deal with direct inducements to prospective participants but the amendment is aimed at trying to ensure that other behind-the-door methods would not be used.  If the institutions had to specify the methods being used and went outside those, clearly they would be in breach of their conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a member of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Pharmacology, since advertising is now permitted for volunteers there is no question of using third parties &mdash; unless the newspapers would be regarded as third parties &mdash; to recommend or even to bring along others who volunteer.  The small allowance, which is a modest one, which is offered as an inducement to volunteers is well deserved.  An inducement was given to those in the FCA to do a couple of weeks duty each year, even if it was <Col N="2412" /> only two weeks off work for which they were fully paid.</P>
      <P>Let us remember if a public representative sits on an ethics committee and something goes wrong people will immediately descend on him.  I am satisfied that this Bill will not only affect the Institute of Pharmacology but all other places where drugs are tested.  Since the embargo on advertising for volunteers was lifted recently a large number of people have volunteered, and let me say that each volunteer is fully aware there are risks involved.  People sometimes worry about the person who volunteers many times, the professional volunteer, but it is important to remember that the institutes themselves recognise that if anything goes wrong unwanted attention will be focussed on their activities.  They are very careful to ensure that there is nothing underhand in their dealings and that everything is open and above board. On many occasions Members of this House have been invited to visit the centre in Dublin and to question the staff. I first became involved in this area when I was invited by the staff of that centre to visit it.</P>

      <P>I am sure that everything Deputy Briscoe has said is true and that the institutes have nothing to fear from this requirement being in the Bill. It is only proper that this should be a matter of concern to ethics committees and it is desirable that we have more people volunteering to take part in these trials.  The clinics need not fear these restrictions and this amendment in no way threatens the clinical research which is being undertaken and which we wish to see being carried on.  One of the problems which I have is that the requirement on the ethics committee is rather loosely drafted in that it states they should have regard to a whole list of things and this could mean any one of one hundred things.  I do not know what the legal interpretations of having regard to inducements is and what it would require them to do.  It is a very loose definition and that is why a more specific definition should be inserted.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the points which were raised by both Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Flaherty are covered in the Bill.  There is a provision in section 7 of the Bill for the Minister to revoke the permission which was given to undertake a clinical trial if he is not satisfied with the manner in which it is being carried out.  As I say, I am satisfied that the points raised are covered in the Bill but I will be pleased to accept the amendment if the Deputies are anxious that it should be accepted.

      <P>Amendment No. 7a to section 9 is necessary in that section 9 has perhaps the tightest regulations in relation to consent and participation in a clinical trial.  Section 8, which gives broad guidelines, provides that the ethics committee must have regard to persons selected as participants undergoing independent medical examination before, during or after the clinical trial. This is a broad requirement and is loosely drafted.  It does not indicate a specific requirement.  The NDAB draft guidelines on informed consent participants specify that a central feature of all proper, informed consent should be an independent medical examination.  If the NDAB consider that to be a practical requirement I do not see how it would be severely intrusive on any conductor of a trial or would inhibit in any way the conduct of a proper trial.  It would simply be a safeguard that they would welcome and it would benefit people who, against their own interest, might seek to be involved in a trial for financial or other reasons. Therefore, this amendment is desirable to ensure that the volunteers are protected and that the trials are conducted properly.  I gather that it would have the approval of the NDAB and the WHO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2418" /> Amendment No. 8a proposes that consent as outlined in section 9 (3) will be valid only if given in the presence of a disinterested but informed witness. Again this is a desirable safeguard.  It should not prove difficult to implement, and it would ensure that this Bill does two tasks.  One is to ensure that desirable medical research will continue and be encouraged and welcomed.  Secondly while we are addressing this issue in a total absence of any statutory regulation of the conduct of trials, we should do it properly.  Therefore we must ensure that there is an element of independent investigation. Both of these amendments will help to achieve that.  I hope the Minister will accept them and that the House will support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in my name and that of Deputy Mac Giolla, Deputy Sherlock and Deputy McCartan seeks to provide that the responsibility for ensuring that the participant comprehends the nature of the consent he is giving lies with the institution who propose to carry out the trials.  As far as I can find in my reading of the Bill, there is no indication anywhere of where the responsibility lies for ensuring that the participant comprehends what is going on.  One section provides that no trial shall be carreid out unless the person comprehends, but there is no implication in the Bill of where the onus lies for accepting responsibility for assuring that that comprehension is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 of the Bill obliges the ethics committee to satisfy themselves on the circumstances under which the trial is to be conducted.  In considering these circumstances it is the responsibility of the committee to have regard to a number of issues including the following: the criteria to be used for the recruitment and selection of participants, the extent and nature of the medical examination that persons selected as participants are to undergo before participating in the clinical trial, and whether the persons selected as participants are to undergo independent <Col N="2419" /> medical examination before, during or after a clinical trial.</P>
      <P>The onus is on the ethics committee under section 8 (4) (d) to ensure that the procedures proposed by the person conducting a clinical trial for complying with section 9 are sufficient to protect the participants.  This would not preclude the assessment of participants by general practitioners if the ethics committee felt that this was desirable and section 8 (4) (h) provides effectively for the issues raised by Deputy Flaherty in her amendment No. 7a.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is presumably designed to ensure that participants are not coerced into participating in a clinical trial.  The totality of section 9 is to ensure that potential participants are left in no doubt as to where they stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> the nature of the trial, its details, the possible risks and benefits.  There is a cooling off period of six days provided for within which a participant can assess his position and perhaps decide not to participate in the trial.  He can also opt out at any stage during the trial without penalty.  The framework contained in section 9 provides ample protection for the participant by avoiding coercion or undue pressure and it ensures that the fullest information is made to each participant.  I do not see need to introduce a provision which would involve disinterested but informed witnesses, but I acknowledge that in certain cases witnessses would have to be involved.  I have already provided for such a requirement in section 9 (6), (a) and (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 8a, a key provision in section 9 (3) is that the consent given by the participant to the person conducting the trial, or to a person acting on behalf of the person conducting the trial, can only be given if the participant is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his or her consent. Implicit in this provision is that the person conducting a trial must be satisfied that the person so consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his or her consent.  For these reasons I feel that the concern expressed <Col N="2420" /> by the Deputy is adequately reflected in the Bill as it stands.  I do not see the need to have these amendments inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister feels it is necessary in section 9 (6) to include provision for a witness, why does he believe that a similar provision is not necessary in the case of trials involving volunteers?  What difficulty does he see in accepting the amendment relating to supervision by a medical practitioner, a medical examination and the involvement of a disinterested but informed witness in supervising both the consent and the explanation?  It gives a double check so that people know what they are entering into and ensures that the consent is given in a proper environment following a clear explanation.  It strengthens the protective part of the Bill.  If it is desirable in the case of a person who is ill in hospital, surely it is equally desirable in the case of a volunteer.  I know we are breaking new ground by legislating in this area but it is important that we do so properly.  These rules and regulations would be in the interest of all and would allay much public concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to my amendment, No. 8. Under section 8 (4) (d) the ethics committee must take into account the procedures proposed for compliance with section 9.  I do not regard that as an adequate protection.  There is no clear definition as to where the responsibility lies, though the Minister says it is implicit in section 9.  The section states that a person shall not be a participant in a clinical trial unless a consent to such participation has been given in accordance with this section.  It goes on to list the requirements.  The consent of the participant must be given in writing and shall not be valid for the purposes of this section unless the person so consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent, which must be obtained by or on behalf of the person conducting the clinical trial.  The implication is that if something goes wrong it will then be found that the consent was invalid.  That is not <Col N="2421" /> sufficient protection.  I know it is not possible to cover every loophole but we must try as far as we can to put the onus on the people who are conducting the trial to ensure that the person to whom they have given the written form containing all the details is capable of comprehending what is involved.  As the Bill stands, if something goes wrong and a person is damaged or dies, there will be a claim against the institution.  We must try to ensure that this kind of situation is avoided.  It must be clearly stated that it is the responsibility of the institution involved to ensure that the person consenting to the trial is capable of comprehending the risks involved.  It is not enough that this should be implicit.</P>

      <P>Any consent given for the purposes of this section shall not be valid unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the person so consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent, and</P>
      <P>(b)  it is obtained by or on behalf of the person conducting the clinical trial.</P>
      <P>That would appear clearly to deal with the issue raised by Deputy De Rossa.  It is very positive and points out very clearly that the consent is not valid unless the person is clearly capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent.  The person also has a six-day cooling off period during which he may decide not to participate in the clinical trial.  Even during the trial he can opt out at any time without penalty.</P>
      <P>On the matter raised by Deputy Flaherty, it is only right that a person who is incapable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent should have an independent person present who is competent to give such a decision on his behalf.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to press these amendments because these are important practical regulations which would ensure that the volunteer is protected. The Minister did not reply specifically to my question as to why it was necessary to have independent witnesses in the case of a person suffering from an illness but not in the case of a volunteer.  These people would be covered by my amendment which is similar to the guidelines already issued by the National Drugs Advisory Board to those who seek advice from them to ensure an informed consent.  I believe this reasonable amendment will strengthen this legislation because it will provide protection for the volunteers about whom Deputy De Rossa and I are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal again with the point raised by Deputy Flaherty.  It is only right that a person who is not in a position to understand fully the nature, significance and scope of the consent should have somebody competent to make such a decision on their behalf.  I have in mind, for example, a person who might be unconscious from a stroke and his doctor might decide to try a certain form of treatment which would be in the nature of a clinical trial.  That person would not be competent to make a decision for himself and, in his interests, it would be only right that somebody who is competent to do so should make that decision on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that section 9 (3) (a) and (b) ensures that the interests of the participant are protected and that no such trial can be carried out unless the person <Col N="2423" /> so consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty:</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to a person who is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of the consent but it requires two witnesses to the consent to be given to the medical practitioner.  I believe it would be desirable to have two forms of independent assessment as to suitability, as can be seen in my amendments.  I realise this would be an extra responsibility for patients but, given the traditional type of volunteer who participates in clinical trials, we have a social obligation to ensure that they are given every chance <Col N="2424" /> to know exactly what they are doing. We can only benefit from such a move particularly when we are opening up this area, taking it out of the dark world and trying to attract more healthy volunteers. We must provide protection in this legislation for those people and we should do a good job now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Hussey for bringing this important Bill before the House.  Deputy Hussey will go down as one of the most <Col N="2427" /> innovative Ministers the country has produced in this century.  History will rank her among the great Ministers for Education and she will be placed on the same pedestal as John Marcus O'Sullivan and Donogh O'Malley.  She will also be remembered as a great reformist.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hussey opened the door for the debate on curriculum change and assessment and, without her efforts, the debate would not have reached this stage. We would still be back in the early eighties.  As someone who has a professional background in education, I warmly welcome the Bill.  It will have an historic impact on our educational system at primary and second levels.</P>
      <P>The Bill is comprehensive and encompasses all aspects of curriculum reform and the means for its implementation. It is of crucial importance that the board proposed by Deputy Hussey be appointed on a statutory basis which will guarantee their independence from the Department of Education.  The work of such a board can be measured against the highly professional and well-researched reports published by the now defunct Curriculum and Examinations Board. The board throught their system of committees provided invaluable service to our educational system.  The main focus of their research dealt with curriculum content and assessment in post-primary schools.  The advantages and shortcomings of the present system were clearly outlined and the need for change adequately stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth in numbers in post-primary schools has been quite staggering. Indeed, it has increased four-fold since 1961.  In spite of this dramatic change, however, there has not been a corresponding change in the method of assessment of curriculum content in schools.  The education process, by its very nature, is rather conservative and somewhat resistant to change.  A statutory board, working with an innovative and progressive Minister for Education, <Col N="2428" /> would harness the expertise of educational interests and bring about the necessary reform which is so desirable.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with certian aspects of our education system. Thousands of students are currently being funnelled through a system which clearly is not meeting their needs.  This is evident in the annual national frenzy during late August regarding entry to third level education and the dreaded points race.  The whole focus of the leaving certificate is as an entry requirement for third level education; yet two-thirds of students do not go on to third level and have no aspirations to do so.  These students enter the workforce, remain unemployed or, sadly, emigrate.  They are probably badly prepared for all these outlets.  The Department of Labour recently issued a pack for emigrants which is most informative.  However, I cannot understand why this pack was not distributed to career guidance teachers in schools.  Instead, copies were sent out to the various National Manpower Offices around the country with specific instructions not to give it to the schools.  If people wanted it they had to go to their local Manpower office.  This was very unfair to the unfortunate young people and it should have been given to the career guidance teachers to distribute.</P>
    <P>The shortcomings of the leaving certificate as a preparation for the working world is evident in the huge demand for vocational preparation and training programmes. Recent rumours that funding for these programmes will be curtailed or withdrawn have caused great anxiety among students and teachers.  If these courses are withdrawn, students would have to revert to the leaving certificate cycle which is clearly unsuitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>Radical reform of the leaving certificate is urgently required.  Due to the huge expansion in numbers there is now a great range of ability levels among students at second level and the leaving certificate programme should be adapted to cater for their increasingly diverse needs. A practical approach to the teaching of mathematics is necessary.  There should <Col N="2429" /> also be a more linguistic orientation in regard to teaching English.  The position regarding the competence achieved in Irish is very disturbing.  I estimate that a student who sits his or her leaving certificate will have had approximately 2,000 hours instruction &mdash; at primary and second level &mdash; but the effort and investment is poorly rewarded.  It is most disturbing that such a high percentage failed the leaving certificate pass paper in 1983. Over 20 per cent of boys and 80 per cent of girls failed.  When one considers the amount of tuition given to students it puts a huge question mark on our system of teaching Irish.  Future developments in the teaching of Irish should concentrate on oral work and fluency rather than on literature and the written language.  This should apply particularly at primary level.  I am pleased that the proposed board is to have regard to the status of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Our system must reflect the ongoing changes in society, whether social, cultural or economic.  We are witnessing a significant change in the nature of jobs. Labour based industries are being replaced by skill based industries and these in turn will be replaced by knowledge based industries.  Our commercial future lies in information, in the creation of knowledge, its application and its communication. This covers a wide range of activities from consultancy and financial services to research and development education, to tourism and the arts.  The new curriculum board must confront these issues and introduce the appropriate changes to the curriculum.  The school curriculum must reflect these times of rapid change.  It should not be 20 years behind as it is at the moment. When I was going through college in the early seventies an effort was being made to widen the scope of the school curriculum but we have not made much progress since then.  That reflects on our education system and on our emphasis on the points system.  Professor Charles Handy in his book <i>The Future of Work</i> said that an education system is a mirror of society, that it adjusts this mirror quickly enough to reflect the world that <Col N="2430" /> is springing up around us rather than the world that used to be, that all the opportunities of the future of work depend upon a population with access to education, a people geared to think and act for themselves, and that if we do not get education right we will be faced with a scenario of lost opportunities and a generation of whom it might be said of one day that &ldquo;they have a bright future behind them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will now look more closely at the provisions contained in the Bill as we probably will not have an opportunity to discuss them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill will fulfil a long felt need in second level education.  All the parties interested in education have through the years called for this type of body.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto for the last general election promised that if elected the Government would set up a statutory body.  It is unfortunate that this promise has not been kept.  Everyone involved in education agrees that a statutory body should be set up.  This proposition would not diminish the role of the inspectorate who at present are the Minister's principal agency for advice.  It would liberate the inspectorate to fulfil their role of visiting schools so as to give advice and to sample the quality of education.  At the moment schools are not visited often enough by inspectors because they are too busy.</P>
    <P>The Bill would preserve the independence and autonomy of the Minister for Education and it would strengthen the vital pivotal role of the Department. The Bill would also provide for new methods of assessment to be introduced into the examanations system so that credit could be given for skills and aptitudes not being tested in the present examinations system.  Some of the most successful people in the country did not come through our examinations system. Many people who failed public examinations have come to the top in politics, in business and in other areas.  That points to the fact that our examinations system does not adequately test the ability of the people going through it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> The constitution of the board shows an awareness of the need for partnership in education.  All the major education interests will be represented.  The concept of designated bodies is welcome as it ensures the widest possible type of free flowing communication.  It will be possible to float new concepts and ideas to the interested parties and one hopes that the final decisions will have a broad degree of consensus.</P>
    <P>The structures and committees which will be set up by the board would provide an opportunity for practising teachers to advance their views and ideas on curriculum development and to make a sizeable input into the future shape of education at post primary level.  Many teachers have been frustrated by being totally tied down to an examination oriented curriculum.  Such a curriculum allows neither teachers nor students to express their views.  Whatever reform takes place will have to take the views of teachers and pupils into consideration. The proposed composition of the board shows that the Minister recognises this.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of examination and assessment returns would lead to improved efficiency of the system. Schools constantly complain about late results.  This year the intermediate certificate results were a week later than they were last year.  This delay will continue until results are computerised. Computerisation would lead to huge savings in personnel and finance.  Because of the lateness of intermediate certificate results this year a number of school principals had difficulty drawing up their curriculum and in slotting pupils into their appropriate subject areas.  We should make an earnest effort next year to ensure that the results are out as soon as possible after the leaving certificate results.  We should make it an objective to get the results out before students return to school so that they can decide on subjects with a view to their future aspirations.</P>
    <P>The Bill would allow for a very orderly transfer of responsibilities and thereby <Col N="2432" /> eliminate any possibility of disruption to schools or to the Department of Education. It would also allow for a greater alignment of curricula between first and second level education and would remove much of the anxiety which exists at present in the transition from primary to post primary schools.  The Bill would ensure greater relevance in the curriculum and that is very important. Through constant ongoing review it would ensure that what is taught is meaningful and relevant to the students and to their needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as proposed by Deputy Hussey, would provide the Minister with a body or board in position at all times capable of being called on by her to undertake investigation into any area of first and second level curricula which the Minister recommends or demands.  The Bill also recognises the constitutional and inalienable rights of parents and students and gives a unity and solidarity to the educational needs of the nation for students in first and second level education. I appeal to the Minister to change her attitude to the Bill on the lines proposed by Deputy Hussey.  Unless the Curriculum and Examinations Board get statutory recognition they will lack the clout, status and political strength to influence change.  The board proposed by the Minister is welcome but basically it will take over from the previous board.  I am sure there will be many recommendations and proposals but very little action.  Young people today deserve the kind of action we are proposing.  For their sake the Minister should seriously consider changing her mind in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the only reason the Minister will not accept this Bill is that it was brought forward by Deputy Hussey, that is wrong.  In order to meet the needs of the present generation in several different ways we must have change as soon as possible.  I would like to point out to the Minister that education must be seen as an investment and not as a cost.  The question has been asked in this debate as to what this board will cost.  Education is one area that never should be subject to <Col N="2433" /> cutbacks as it is at present.  We should look on it in a very positive way as being a definite investment in the future of our country and in our young people and not from the point of view of cost or expenditure.</P>

      <P>Technically it is not a great idea to leave one such as Deputy Higgins to have all the shots to fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I welcome the contributions that have been made to this legislation both last night and tonight, all of which have been constructive.  While I may not agree with much of what has been said I believe that this debate has been a very useful one in the context of the curriculum reform which is in progress.  I compliment Deputy Hussey for her initiative, while Minister for Education, in opening up the whole area of curriculum reform and <Col N="2434" /> development for examination.  I agree with the other speakers that this was required to be done and was overdue.</P>
    <P>It is worth having a look at what happened since Deputy Hussey, as Minister, set up the interim curriculum review board.  It was her intention to proceed with the setting up of that statutory board but for four years she did not do so.  One must ask why, when she as Minister for Education, or indeed her successor, did not proceed with the setting up of this board.  It is clear that one of the main reasons was that a great amount of financial resources would have been required for such a development.  Apart from other factors that would have to be considered to be the main reason.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties I see with this Bill is that it now proposes setting up a statutory board to do a task which can be quite easily done by the curriculum council which is being set up by the Minister for Education.  There is no necessity to set up a statutory body to reform the curriculum in primary and secondary schools.  We do not need any further structures in education or elsewhere.  I am quite satisfied that to set up another statutory structure would amount to setting up a bureaucracy which, rather than solving the problem and bringing about the development we all wish to see, would put the whole debate into a tailspin, would waste huge amounts of money and would probably leave us in a position where in years to come we would not have achieved the developments to which we all aspire.</P>
    <P>The other interesting aspect of the debate last night was the effort made by Deputy Hussey and Deputy Quill to prove that the most efficient way to bring about those developments was through the setting up of a statutory body.  While I agree with much of the sentiments that were expressed as to the objectives to be achieved, I am not at all convinced, having heard both Deputies, that the proposals as outlined in this Bill would achieve those objectives.  It is clear to me that this Bill is not the most cost effective way of developing first and second level schools curricula or of implementing the <Col N="2435" /> most appropriate examination assessment techniques.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill advocated investment in education and pledged her party's support of the Bill for that purpose.  There is no conflict here.  I, too, want to see the maximum resources which the State can provide invested in education.  The difference between us is that the Government's concern is to ensure, as far as is in their power, that any State investment in education is put to the best possible use within the system.  There is some misunderstanding on Deputy Quill's part that the £500,000 additional funding proposed in the explanatory and financial memorandum which accompanied the 1986 Bill was to be applied to support the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment.  The fact is that more than 50 per cent of this £500,000 additional funding represented the estimated requirements to support the various committees of the board.  There were to be subject and course committees, curriculum committees, an assessment and certification committee.  These would, of course, be working committees but whether the cost represented value for money is a question I am unable to answer.</P>
    <P>The potential running costs of the board might not even have stopped there because the board had asked the Department to pay substitution allowances to replace teachers away from the classroom on board business.  The whole thing seemed to becoming a new industry.  If Deputies Quill and Hussey think that the £500,000 which would have been spent in this way was a good investment in education then I beg to disagree with both of them.  I emphasise that none of this money would have been used to implement any recommendations for curriculum reform which the board might make.  The board made no estimate of the anticipated cost of its recommendations such as school-based assessment, in-service training, procedural proposals for validation and certification of courses, to name a few.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan mentioned that we should never fail to make an investment <Col N="2436" /> in education.  Deputy Quill last night talked about the need for investment in education.  But, alas, I must bring both Deputies Deenihan and Quill back to a very important point and that is that investment in education, like investment in every other area of current and capital expenditure, has to be governed by the overall financial situation.  I have to take Deputy Quill to task because I fail to understand her call for increased investment in education by the setting up of yet another statutory committee as she belongs to a party which was founded on the very principle that current expenditure must be sharply reduced.  My understanding of Deputy Quill's party policies are that we must reduce current expenditure.  I fail to understand how Deputy Quill, like other Deputies in this party, continually come to the Dáil to tell us that we should increase investment in current expenditure.  There is a very basic contradiction in that.  I wish the Progressive Democrats would sort themselves out and either take the line that they want cuts in public expenditure or that they want to continue to increase public expenditure.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to clarify for the House the nature and extent of the expenditure envisaged for the National Board for Curriculum and Assessment.  It is important that people who support this Bill should be fully aware of the type of investment in education which is intended.  They should ask themselves whether the type of investment envisaged in the Bill is in agreement with their philosophy on such issues as efficiency and effectiveness in State and semi-State agencies.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the curriculum council recently established by the Minister for Education are broad and comprehensive.  They encompass, for the first time, all the work of all the agencies involved in curriculum research and development funded by the State.  In addition the curriculum council will also have three specific tasks:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2437" /> 1.  To oversee the completion of the review of primary school curriculum;</P>
    <P>2.  The revision of the junior cycle syllabi for the new combined group and intermediate certificate examinations;</P>
    <P>3.  The revision of Rialacha agus Clár na Meanscoileanna.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments of Deputy Quill that the position of Irish and of modern continental languages other than French in our schools is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Tá sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas go ndéanfaí gach iarracht líofacht agus tuiscint sa Ghaeilge a chothú sna daltaí.  Ní mór áit na Gaeilge a chaomhnú agus a chur ar aghaidh díreach mar a thugtar cothrom na Féinne do na hábhair eile sa churaclam.</P>
    <P>Thar aon ní eile tá aontas forleathan gur ceart béim a chur ar an bhfocal labhartha agus gach iarracht a dhéanamh ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge ó bhéal a chur ar aghaidh.  Tá sé i gceist ag an Roinn tionscadal píolota a bhunú i roinnt beag scoileanna.  Bunófar an tionscadal ar na prionsobail seo a leanas: Tábhacht an dalta aonair; tús áite na teanga labhartha; tábhacht na cumarsáide; freastal na scoileanna ar riachtanais foghlamtha na ndaltaí; agus rannpháirtíocht na dtuismitheoirí. Déanfar maoirseacht chothromach ar dhul ar aghaidh na scéime le súil gur féidir foghlaim na Gaeilge a chur ar bhonn níos eolaíochta as seo amach.</P>
    <P>Not enough pupils in post-primary schools study modern continental languages other than French.  Unfortunately our involvement in Europe has not resulted to date in any major take-up of German, Spanish or Italian in our schools despite the fact that the syllabi for those languages have been recently revised and much emphasis is now placed on understanding the spoken language and on developing accuracy and fluency in oral expression.  The format of the examinations in modern languages has also been changed and now includes oral and aural tests in the leaving certificate examination and optional oral tests in the intermediate certificate examination.  It is necessary to convince school managers <Col N="2438" /> of the need to offer a second modern continental language as part of their subject options to their pupils and for school authorities to convince parents and pupils of the benefit accruing from having fluency in a continental language other than French.  Various strategies for increasing the participation rates in modern languages are being actively considered and it is hoped to have proposals for new initiatives in the near future.  I emphasise again that there is no necessity to set up a statutory curriculum board to bring about those developments and improvements.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in physical education and sport and in this area there is a need to bring about fundamental changes in the curricula of both the primary and secondary schools.  It is my personal ambition to see physical education become an integral part of the curriculum with the same status and importance as other subjects.  We have neglected physical education in our education system.  Most young people go through the school system without appreciating the value and enjoyment of sport and its usefulness to the well-being of every person.  It is my ambition to see the curriculum council address itself to this subject so that we can bring about significant developments and improvements in regard to the teaching of physical education and sport in both our primary and post-primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that we had a little laugh from the gallery because of the fact that part of the problem with our education system at the moment is that for any child who is not athletic, not able to go out on to the rugby or soccer field, sport is a non-runner.  There are approximately eight sports for which athletic ability, as we commonly know it, is not necessary.  In the area of curriculum development it is required that we bring those sports into our schools, that we give our young people an appreciation of them.  You do not necessarily need more <Col N="2440" /> teachers for that.  This kind of development is part of education for life, where you educate young people to enjoy their leisure time.  A grave drawback in our present curriculum is that we are educating young people to try to score points in the leaving certificate or whatever.  We are allowing them to leave school without an appreciation of the enjoyment they can get from sport and physical activity. It is important that our curricula would address this aspect of the make-up and education of a young person.  That is the whole purpose of the council we are setting up.  It does not have to be statutory to bring about these changes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill has also referred to the need for curricular reform in the primary area and the need for a continuation between primary and senior cycle.  I agree entirely and part of the remit of the primary review body established by the Minister is that specific attention would be paid to the last two years of primary school and their alignment to the post-primary curriculum and you do not need a statutory body to do that.</P>

The curriculum council will perform a co-ordinating role in this area.  This will ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources, human, physical and financial, which are available for curriculum reform and development.  I do not know if Deputy Quill heard the comments I had to make about the resources before she arrived, but certainly I want <Col N="2441" /> to remind all Deputies in the House that while we would all like to make more investment in this area we must be guided by the most important objective at the moment and that is to get the State finances into order.</P>

Much of the expenditure &mdash; and I outlined expenditure of £500,000 would be spent in areas which have nothing to do with curriculum development.  In fact, a fundamental flaw in the Bill now before the House is to give the board advisory functions in relation to curricular matters at primary and post-primary levels and executive functions in relation to examinations and assessments and the issuing of certificates.  There is a real danger that the executive function will become the dominant one, with the result that the curricular advice would be too greatly influenced by considerations of an assessment nature.  It is not without due reason that most developed countries have advisory groups similar to the curriculum council whose functions do not include any examining or validating function.</P>

The curriculum council will not have any executive role in the administration and organisation of examinations.  As a result, it will be free from the day-to-day operational activities of a time-consuming nature and will be able to concentrate on purely curricular and related matters.  Before taking any decision on the restructuring of curriculum development work, a careful assessment was made of the various developments and changes which have taken place over the years.  We have seen an explosion in post-primary education. In 1960 there were 8,000 candidates approximately for the leaving certificate examination, while in 1987 there were 55,000 &mdash; an increase of almost 700 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the intervening period there have been significant changes in the post-primary curriculum. Changes have taken place in order to achieve specific objectives.  At all times the primary concern was &mdash; and, I might add, still is &mdash; to enable each pupil in the system to identify his or her weaknesses, <Col N="2444" /> to nurture his or her latent abilities and talents and to realise as fully as possible his or her true potential.  At the same time, the needs of society were taken into account.  Education endeavoured to provide pupils with the skills, attitude and competency which were perceived to meet social needs.  The curricula and syllabi have been kept under review and both minor and major changes have been introduced wherever necessary.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the recent past the views of industry, commercial and trading interests were sought and obtained when reviewing relevant subjects such as physics, chemistry and commerce etc. Recently, we have seen significant changes being implemented in many subjects in the post-primary education area, including mathematics, physics, chemistry engineering, metalwork, commerce, English and physical education etc.  In the case of modern languages new syllabi and examination formats have been introduced as outlined earlier.  Special programmes have also been devised and implemented for the mildly mentally handicapped pupils attending post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>Perhaps nowhere is the continuous nature of curriculum reform and development better illustrated than in the area of new information technologies and in particular in the impact which computers have made at all educational levels, especially is post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Their introduction into post-primary schools in the eighties is bringing about a quiet revolution in educational processes and practices.  Computers are being used as educational aids in the teaching of many subjects as a diagnostic tool to identify and eliminate, where possible, barriers to learning in pupils and by school managers and principals to assist them in their administrative tasks.  Pupils are now able at both junior and senior cycles to take <Col N="2445" /> optional programmes in computer studies. Indeed, Deputy Hussey is to be complimented for the innovations she introduced to this area while she was Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>It is important that a sustained effort be made to reassess the needs of all pupils and to develop more effective and more efficient ways of catering for these diverse needs.  It is necessary to make greater efforts to achieve equality of outcome and to ensure that every individual has a right to benefit from education in the sense of his or her meeting their own particular needs and aptitudes.  It has become evident in this country and indeed in other countries also that despite the egalitarian and comprehensive system with co-ordinated remedial and counselling services, pupils from lower socio-economic groupings have fared much less than pupils from other groupings at all levels of the educational system.  Many reasons have been suggested for this including the cultural gap between the pupil and teacher, the apparent dichotomy between home and school environments, the lack of adequate resources due to economic constraints, inadequate commitment on the part of school authorities, social interests and so on.  However, there is no conclusive evidence to indicate what were the causes of failure in this regard in the past.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to evolve strategies to rectify this imbalance, as strategies which will be effective during primary and junior second level cycles, as many pupils from the lower socio-economic groupings leave the formal educational system after completing compulsory schooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the broadening of the school curriculum by the inclusion of additional subjects many post-primary schools are even today modelled on the elitist academic schools of the past and offer rather limited programmes.  Of course, there are a number of pressures on post-primary school authorities to offer mainly academic programmes during compulsory schooling.  The demands of the senior <Col N="2446" /> cycle and of the tertiary level institutions &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;percolate downwards with the result that there is often a bias in the academic direction even in the junior cycle.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not do justice to our excellent educational system and its proposed structure for curriculum development and reform would not in any way accelerate but would rather retard the process of educational reform in the primary and post-primary schools.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, curriculum reform is one of the priorities of the Minister for Education and a priority of this Government.  The curriculum council which has been established will have streamlined, cost effective and efficient structures.  I have no doubt that the curriculum council will provide a practical and dynamic method of operation which will structure reform and identify those stages which are capable of being put into effect immediately as well as producing phased developments for the continual improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of the eduction service within the limits of available resources.  The Bill before the House fails in many respects but in particular it fails to recognise the limits of existing resources, both human and fianancial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by taking up some of the points which have been made by the Minister of State. One in particular strikes me as being a very dangerous, new, imported fallacious piece of rubbish from the United States. The Department of Education seem to have the notion which I have detected surfacing in their reports of recent years that the real reason children in the lower socio-economic group do not perform as well as children in the other socio-economic groupings is due to some reasons of culture.  The Minister of State in his speech spoke about a cultural gap.  I am <Col N="2447" /> very familiar with this argument.  It had its origins in the United States, as I have said, among those people who argued that blacks had slower learning abilities than whites.  It is as old and as bankrupt as that.  Unfortunately, it has found a few people not very critical in their scholarship who have been anxious to purvey it.  It is associated with the views of Burt and of a number of other people who argued that there are such things as innate learning abilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State tonight and the Minister last night said they were opposing this Bill and in doing so they drew on the omniscience of the Minister of the day, supported by the Department of Education on all matters in relation to curriculum reform.  This is not their first hairy opinion if I may put it like that. The Department of Education have held wonderful views about education and innate abilities.  I want to be accurate about this matter.  In 1960 the Department of Education published a report on education and learning.  That report was drawn up by the Council of Education and contains the conclusion, for example, that there were three types of students &mdash; the slow, the average and the really bright.  They dismissed the ideal of free secondary education for all by saying it was an untenable suggestion and they also argued, curiously, unlike the Minister and the Minister of State who argue that the reason for not bringing in curriculum reform is the absence of resources, that free secondary education would be extended to those with limited talents.  They claimed that only a minority of pupils would be capable of profiting by secondary or grammar school education. There are other gems I could quote from, going back to the sixties, for example, the teachers' handbook which made reference to the fact &mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister of State reads the teachers' handbook, for which he has <Col N="2448" /> responsibility, he will find instructions relating to the teaching of singing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State had a whole half hour to speak about curriculum but I did not hear very much about it.  Let us talk about the curriculum. Now I will touch on some more as well in so far as the Minister of State has encouraged me.  I sometimes wonder whether we are talking about the curriculum and education in Mars or some planet other than the Republic of Ireland, such as it is.  I find it interesting that people can for hours discuss the curriculum without adverting to the fact that what we have in this country is a denominational educational system.  Perhaps the Minister is very happy &mdash; I am not saying I am unhappy or whatever &mdash; but I do say that it has an influence on the curriculum at primary level, that the good old Teacher's Handbook, rule 68, says that religious instruction is, therefore, a fundamental part of the school course and a religious spirit should inform and vivify the whole work of the school, presumably also geography, history, nature, all these things, Irish, English.  The same handbook goes on to say that teachers <Col N="2449" /> should encourage pupils to observe in their relations with God and with their neighbour the laws which God directly through the dictates of natural reason and through Revelation, and indirectly through the ordinance of lawful authority, imposes on mankind.  I respect that tradition in the history of ideas but there is such a tradition also as rationalism, science and a more open view of the world.</P>
      <P>I do not want to waste much more of my time except to use that example and say one cannot begin to discuss curriculum reform without discussing the issue of ideology.  Effectively, curriculum is all about ideology.  I remember in socialist circles people used say that if socialists ever got control of education they would poison the minds of young people.  Indeed, the Minister of State's party one time won an election by printing on the front page of <i>The Irish Press</i> the suggestion that Jim Larkin, who had been educated in Leningrad, was going to become Minister for Education and that the Catholic schools of Ireland would be closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The points I want to <Col N="2450" /> make, very simply, are these.  There were a few other little gems in the course of the Minister of State's remarks.  He said he believed &mdash; and I believe he holds this view sincerely &mdash; that an individual should be free to develop his or her talents as best they can.  Let me put it like this: it presumes what used to be regarded the purposes of education and these were raised, correctly, last evening.  The question was posed: what is the purpose of education?  Is it to be useful in society in a particular condition of the economy?  Is it to be able to participate in leisure in any society that does not value work and wants to have a high level of unemployment, like the present one, so that people can be physically fit while they are unemployed, or whatever?  Is it to be able to relate to others with respect?  Is it to be able to live in a sufficient sense of fear that one will be stuck to the ground if one does not adhere to particular dictates?</P>
      <P>There are assumptions in what is involved in education.  Recently these were reviewed in a very fine paper by Dr. Kathleen Lynch of The Economic and Social Research Institute and published in <i>The Economic and Social Review, Volume 18, No. 2, January 1987</i>.  I can but summarise some of her views.  She suggested that, in Ireland, there were really three major ideologies governing education that has influenced educational thinking and ideas.  One of these was kind of consensualism.  This was the assumption that everybody was in agreement about the basic values of society.  She teased out the origins of this.  Another view was a kind of essentialism which is the view really of the Minister &mdash; that is what reminded me of it &mdash; the notion that each individual has some kind of innate talents and that is what the purpose of education is addressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Lynch's paper was reviewing the publications of the Department of Education and one finds that that is the predominant prejudice they have.  That is what led them to say that we would be wasting resources on extending secondary education in their day.  It is also the view that leads them to view with suspicion the notion of spending money <Col N="2451" /> or resources on developing education in a way that took account of the social setting of creativity.  It is a highly personalised individual view of creativity. What it really assumes is rather like this: that the individual has a certain amount of capacity inherent in him or her and that it must be released into society.  It reminds me of someone who would say, &ldquo;she had it in her&rdquo; or that &ldquo;the piano would stand to them.&rdquo;  It ignores the fact that creativity in the modern world world is a socially-negotiated experience, that it involves the use of symbols, that it involves taking the concerns and the reactions of others into account.  That thinking is not present in any publication.</P>
    <P>The last kind of dominant view the paper discussed was the notion of some kind of meritocratic individualism, that is, that individuals should be prepared, if you like, to take as much advantage as they can in an unequal society and that they should be prepared for it.  I would add more of my own because, running through the education debate in recent times, I notice a certain kind of utilitarianism. It is as if one was picking out from the environment &mdash; no more than the Minister's reference to computers which reminds me of people being interested in dalek toys or whatever &mdash; but the fact of the matter is that it is useful that people be literate in electronics, computers and whatever.  It is very important that the overall development of the individual child, adult or whoever, be placed as the preliminary, prior and purposeful aim of education.</P>
    <P>In a way what I feel about all of this is that if I wanted to see changes taking place in the curriculum &mdash; and I have not the time to list all the changes I would like to see &mdash; I would like to see individual students and adults able to see themselves as collectively competent to participate in society, to be able to develop a critical awareness of their society.  If I were to choose between the different philosophies in education, I do not believe in romantic views of education that would be entirely personal-centred or ones which would be strongly heavily dogmatic or whatever.  I would always choose that <Col N="2452" /> it be a critical experience in which a person developed the capacity to raise the significant questions that will confront them in life and that will enable them to be open towards developing, through and with others, a responsible participation in life.</P>
    <P>If that is my view, then, I must ask myself certain questions.  Those questions are: in what kind of atmosphere will that develop?  With the greatest respect in the world to the many friends I have in the Department of Education and those in the teaching professions wherever, the fact is I feel the handing back of decisions on the curriculum to a Minister who may or may not last &mdash; let us be charitable, anything from four days to four and a half years or whatever &mdash; is in itself not a good idea.  Neither is it appropriate to lodge the whole responsibility for curriculum reform in the Department which is, of its nature, a more slow-moving, less innovative place than the independent statutory council.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State posed a question in the course of his remarks &mdash; as he is putting so many more now &mdash; and I will answer one of them.  He said: why make it statutory?  There is a good answer to that &mdash; so as to make it more difficult to be abolished, as Alice in Wonderland might say.  That is exactly that &mdash; so that it would be able to remain in existence, that it would not be able to be demolished due to the whim of the day or due to obstructions.  There is a great merit in doing that.  For example, it has been the way in which different professions have evolved historically.  They have set up outside bodies to see what is required in relation to the content of the professions and so forth and they have sought statutory independence separate from practitioners and administrators.</P>
    <P>I find this argument about resources very interesting.  Some figures are never quoted.  For example, the Minister mentions the proportion of GNP that has been spent on education.  It has been wavering around 6.2 per cent for the last five or six years.  Equally a good question to ask is who controls the expenditure in education?  The top income quintile in <Col N="2453" /> Ireland, that is the top fifth of income earners, consume 30.6 per cent of all educational expenditure.  The bottom 20 per cent of income earners consume 9.1 per cent.  If you wanted to reduce inequality in society, not to speak of reducing inequality of experience in education, you would put resources into those areas of disadvantage and particularly the primary sector where large classes very often complicate other deprivation factors and lead to later dropouts and non-participation at third level.  I ask the Minister of State and all the people working in the Department of Education not to visit on us, 20 years after it was debunked in the US, the notion that the poor are somehow innately less able to learn or achieve than people in the other socio-economic groups.  That has been debunked so often and resurrected here from time to time that I feel often a great heaviness when I hear this argument.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the questions and let me answer one of them.  I and my party will support Deputy Hussey's Bill on Second Stage.  I will propose some amendments later particularly in relation to the composition of the board and the definition of some terms and references in the Bill.  The question arises about costing.  The Minister last night and the Minister of State this evening made the case that it is all a matter of what the market can afford at present.  How can, say, the average PAYE family go on accepting a kind of unusual citizenship? They universally qualify to pay their tax deducted at source, yet they know that people who are in the top quintile set of income spend on their children something like three to four times the amount that is taken in tax.  They know that their children have a totally unequal opportunity of participating in education that they all pay for.  This comes to the nub of the matter.</P>
    <P>An independent, statutory curriculum board could be a very embarrassing board for a Minister who did not want really to implement their proposals or to explain how their proposals could not be implemented for cost reasons.  That is not <Col N="2454" /> an argument for or against the board.  If the Minister of State insists, I will refer to some remarks of his senior Minister from the booklet <i>Disavantage, Learning and Young People &mdash; The Implications for Education and Training</i> published in Dublin in July 1987.  The present Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, is recorded on page 1 as paying fulsome tribute to the members of the curriculum development unit who produced this tome just before she abolished them.</P>
    <P>What are the requirements for implementing curriculum reform?  It requires a particular philosophy in education which has to be made very clear.  It is a clear choice at present.  Is education to be an opportunity for a pluralistic approach towards society?  Will it emphasise the values of egalitarianism?  I have to place on record my admiration and recognition of the work of the former Minister, Deputy Hussey, in tackling the problem of sexism in education.  These are all values.  They are part of the philosophy of education.  If you are going to say that you want to prosecute these, then you must decide on the appropriate institutional structure for advancing this new kind of thinking in education, and you have to take risks.  I wonder if in the eighties it is not a very dangerous form of indoctrination to invite people to the sole view of the world represented in Revelation.  People are watching TV. People see scientists even if they never study anything like science.  We should be courageous, but courage is a commodity very thin in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us see how this advisory body who are being proposed will work.  The body will advise the Minister, the Minister will consult with her officials and her officials will draw from the long tradition I have quoted that is well documented as to their thinking in education, and then she will meet the advisory council and tell them that she is either giving consideration or deep consideration to their proposals, and that will be the end of that.  The rejection on a statutory basis of the body means that the body will have no real power.  It is returning the decision-making and all of the innovative work to <Col N="2455" /> the administration.  Equally it is establishing an enormous rupture between the genuinely innovative work, first class work, that has gone on in relation to possible curriculum reform for several years.  The initiative now to appoint a body on which people may or may not be willing to serve has undermined the work and the continuity of the work of the previous board.  There will be celebration. The inspectors have won.  Once they have won they will not lose another battle.  The Minister has made sure that they will win.  When I sat on committees they were the very people whom I could advise on the expenditure applications of curriculum reform.  Let me give another one to sleep on overnight.  In relation to physical education I had the honour of being chairman of the Galway-Mayo Regional Arts Committee for eight long years.  We organised a seminar on movement. We suggested that we would have a weekend on dance and movement for people who were teaching physical education. We received a definitive answer from the Department of Education that physical education has nothing to do with dance and movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment of the House the question of the reconstruction and extension of Corracrin School, County Monaghan.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for coming to listen to this debate.  I hope he will give me an assurance that the contract for the new work may be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original school at Corracrin, <Col N="2457" /> adjacent to St. Patrick's Church, was built in 1835 shortly after Catholic Emancipation. It is situated about four miles from Monaghan town on the main Dungannon road.  This school was replaced by a new school on the same site in 1955, the old school having been condemned several years previously.  The new school was a two-roomed, two-teacher school built to accommodate 50 children and two teachers.  Therein lies the beginning of the shocking problem I am trying to have remedied this evening.</P>
    <P>In 1972 another school in the parish of Killyraine was closed and amalgamated with Coracrin school.  The 71 pupils and two teachers from Killyraine came to Coracrin.  I should say that the Coracrin catchment area could be described as a dormitory area for Monaghan town, which is only four miles away.  It is a thickly populated area where the people are well housed.  They take a pride in their homes and in their area generally. In the old days it used to be the case that children went from very inadequate housing with poor sanitary accommodation etc. to schools which were an improvement on what they had at home. To ask the children in this area to go from good modern homes and spend several hours a week in this most unsuitable building is just unbearable.</P>
    <P>In 1972 when the two schools were amalgamated two pre-fab rooms were provided with a life span of ten years.  By 1976, only four years later, attendance had increased to 154 pupils.  The very reverend manager was authorised to purchase another pre-fab to cater for the additional students.  On this occasion he was told to buy a secondhand pre-fab because a new extension would be provided by 1979, three years later.  The secondhand pre-fab would then have outlived its usefulness.  It has certainly outlived its usefulness but no extension has been carried out.  That secondhand pre-fab purchased in 1976 has a history which is given locally as having been used for housing greyhounds before it was purchased for use as a school.</P>
    <P>It is almost 20 years since these first <Col N="2458" /> pre-fabs were acquired and the only change is that they have deteriorated and are crumbling down.  Enrolment at the school has increased to 184 pupils with five teachers.  A sixth teacher is due to be appointed next January.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell the Minister that the accommodation at Corracrin school is absolutely unsuitable for a school building and is a health hazard for the children and teachers.  The Minister knows it and has said so.  The building is grossly overcrowded. The two rooms in the 1955 building which were built for 50 pupils are now housing 80 people, plus furniture and fittings which were never even heard of in 1955.  The result is that the entire building is crowded and the children are like sardines in a tin.  There are 20 desks in one room for 40 pupils &mdash; that is two pupils are crammed into each desk.  The ceilings of the building in general are falling down.</P>
    <P>The sanitary arrangements are quite inadequate.  Apart from being inadequate for the children, there is one toilet for six teachers, male and female.  The three pre-fab rooms have outlived their usefulness, two being provided in 1972 with a life expectancy of ten years and the dog house, as I call it, being provided in 1976 with a life span of three years. These buildings are falling asunder and are quite unsuitable as schoolrooms.</P>
    <P>The most alarming point is that the sanitary arrangements, such as they are, are serviced by a septic tank which is situated just beside the playground, only a few yard's from the main school building and the pre-fabs.  That septic tank was provided to serve 50 pupils and two teachers.  The same septic tank is serving 183 pupils and five teachers.  The result is that it is overflowing and seeping out into the playground.  There is a most malodorous smell coming from it which has to be endured at the school building.  That is very alarming and out of keeping with the age in which we live.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the fire officers remarks given by the county council that the building in its present state is a fire hazard.  The medical man who examined the school concluded his recent report by saying <Col N="2459" /> that in his opinion the children in this school are exposed to excessive and unnecessary health risks.  He says the school buildings should be condemned and replaced with a new school.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister for a brand new school.  The 1955 building can be made serviceable but we are asking him to reconstruct it and to provide an extension of six rooms, as well as a new septic tank.  The Minister is not prevented from doing this by any arrangements he has recently entered into because this extension was promised before any such cutbacks were made.  This extension was first promised in 1976 to the then parish priest.  In 1982 it was promised in writing and in 1985 and 1986 plans were drawn up and eventually approved by the Department.  Between the end of last year and January this year, permission was given to put the project to tender. Tenders were invited and by the end of February a number of tenders had been received, some of them suitable, and were sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>I understand an acceptable tender has been found but the Minister says he cannot approve the placing of the contract because he does not have the money.  At the same time, his Department are prepared to authorise more pre-fabs, if you do not mind.  Pre-fabs were erected in 1972 and in 1976 and now he is prepared to spend £100,000 providing more pre-fabs.  That is not acceptable and it is terrible economics because the total cost of the reconstruction and extension is less than £300,000.  Yet, the Minister is prepared to throw another £100,000 down the drain.  The parents will not accept this.  They are responsible parents. There have been no strikes but they want justice as they see it and as any reasonable person would see it.</P>
    <P>With a deputation of myself, Deputy Jimmy Leonard, Deputy Boylan and others, met the Minister on 10 June last and put our case to him.  He accepted without question that the conditions in the school were appalling.  The Principal officer, Mr. Rowley, was there and saw <Col N="2460" /> the school.  There was no question about the inadequacy of the school accommodation or about the need to go ahead with the contract.  The only question was whether the school would go to contract at the end of this year or, at the very latest, before Easter of next year.  We got a clear and unqualified assurance from the Minister and he was to send a letter home with the deputation that evening, but there was a little bit of &ldquo;wobbling&rdquo; about the writing of the letter when they went back to his office.  We got a letter and if it means anything to a reasonable person it means that on 10 June last the Minister gave an undertaking that he hoped to place the contract before the end of 1987, but he gave an assurance that it would be placed at the latest before Easter of next year.  I put down a parliamentary question on this today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the letter:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. McCormack,</P>
      <P>I refer to your visit today when you were accompanied by a deputation from Corracrin.  As I said the urgency of the provision of the new school is fully accepted but I am constrained at this point for financial reasons from giving an exact date for the approval and placing of the contract.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present undertaking a complete review of the national schools building programme in the light of expenditure.  If the outcome of this review is favourable it may be possible to give the project the `go-ahead' later this year.  While it is almost impossible to give absolute commitments when the financial situation is as uncertain as it is, I am strongly confident that the placing of the contract will be approved by the end of Spring 1988 at the latest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That letter did not measure up to what the Minister promised in his office and when he went back to his Department he gave us this letter.  The deputation spent <Col N="2461" /> four hours arguing with him to try to get him to give the exact letter he promised but it did not appear and they brought that letter home.  If it means anything, it means the Minister committed himself to replacing an entirely unsuitable, unsanitary, unhealthy school with the school provided for in the plans and specifications before Easter 1988.  I want the Minister to confirm this evening that he will do just that.  I will conclude now as I want to give some of my time to my colleague, Mr. Boylan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for giving us this opportunity to raise this very serious problem.  I can assure the Minister that he will not have a more serious problem in a national school than that at Corracrin.</P>
      <P>I have had in excess of 70 letters from concerned parents over the summer and I took it on myself to visit the school.  I was alarmed at what I saw.  I thought the parents might have been exaggerating to get us to make a stronger case for them, but they had in no way exaggerated their case.  I was very concerned about what I saw there and I hope Deputy Fitzpatrick and I can get our concern across to the Minister.  If anything bad happened there it would be on our heads because we had not done enough to secure an improvement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick dealt with health matters and I have a report from a local practitioner, Dr. Michael McDonell.  He makes no fewer than 14 points saying that this school should be condemned and replaced.  He says that earlier this year the school came to a standstill because of an outbreak of smallpox.  If any of the pupils had contracted that disease, I have no doubt it would have spread like wildfire. My primary concern is that the health of these children is not put at risk because conditions in this school are not ideal for learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very concerned when I walked into the classroom and saw all the desks together.  There were no aisles.  These children are packed into prefabs &mdash; one of which had recently been used as a dog <Col N="2462" /> kennel.  These junior infants, very young children who would not understand what to do in an emergency, are packed into these rooms.  If there was a fire in one of these prefabs in the morning these children could not be evacuated.  I have here the fire officer's report.  He is concerned about the electric wiring in the school.  That, too, is a danger because there is a very great risk of a fire starting. If that were to happen all the money in the Department of Education would not compensate for the loss of even one life.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister to be a concerned person who is trying to do his best and in saying that I am not backslapping him in an effort to get a commitment from him. However, I cannot understand the attitude of the Department when they say that they are prepared to spend up to £100,000 on extensions.  They are throwing good money after bad.  They should not get involved in such an exercise.  I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to building a new school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies Fitzpatrick and Boylan for their constructive contributions on this issue.  I agree with what has been said.  During the summer I visited the school which is one of a number in the country that has acute problems.  I have done everything possible to make progress in regard to replacing the school. Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the meeting on 10 June, and a subsequent letter, but he did not mention an important point, which I was at pains to make on 10 June, that my commitment to have a contract placed was a definite one but subject to the financial position.  The Deputy will recall that on that day I outlined to the deputation the position with regard to the Estimate of £30 million being available last year and my desire, and demand, to have £30 million available this year.  It was on the basis of receiving that sum of money that I made the commitment mentioned by the Deputy.  However, instead of £30 million <Col N="2463" /> being available £15 million will be available. That means that no new school starts can be made in 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>However, because the position in regard to the school is so bad and because my officials and I are so anxious to correct it, we have tried to bring about a solution to the problem. We offered semi-permanent buildings, described as prefabricated classrooms, at a cost of roughly £100,000 as replacements for the existing classrooms.  The new classrooms we are offering are not of the prefab type used in schools up to now.  There seems to have been a misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Fitzpatrick about that.  We are talking about concrete permanent buildings, a very different standard of building to the timber temporary prefabs that are there at the moment.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the House that we are proposing to carry out this work as a special measure, despite the financial position, in an effort to alleviate the difficulties that exist at Corracrin.  Deputy Boylan told us that he has received 70 letters about this problem but I should like to point out to him that local people, however they found me, were able to send me about 170 letters to Kilbeacanty. I have had Corracrin on my breakfast table for the past 12 weeks and I can assure the Deputies I am familiar with the views of all parents in the district. They wrote me some nice and not so nice letters during that period.</P>

The offer we have made is a genuine one in the present climate and one which I wish I could make to other schools which are in a bad state.  We have also told the school authorities at <Col N="2464" /> Corracrin that if they do not want the pre-fabricated type of building we are prepared to accommodate their proposals for a permanent traditional type structure provided they are prepared to come up with the extra money that will be required to do that.</P>

      <P>Spending in the region of £40,000 per classroom was a waste of resources.  There is no reason why we cannot provide adequate school buildings for half the cost of buildings erected in recent year.  When I was appointed Minister of State one of the first questions I asked was how long it would take to carry out the building programme on the basis of the progress made in the previous 12 months.  My officials told me that it would take nine years to do that work.  It is intolerable to have to go at that slow pace and immediately I initiated a policy to cut down the high cost.  I am pleased to be able to report that we have succeeded and that we are able to provide satisfactory accommodation at half the cost up to now.  The difficulty we are facing now is that the Government have decided we will be getting half the amount of money that was allocated last year.  As a result we are in a difficult position, one we do not like to be in but one which I accept.  It is important that I state that the financial position of the country is the biggest problem we have to sort out and we will succeed in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are anxious to make progress in regard to the condition of many bad schools.  We have decided to give the <Col N="2465" /> school authorities in Corracrin the option of a substantial amount of money for the provision of semi-permanent accommodation or providing the traditional type of construction at a cost that will come within the limitations placed upon us.  In addition, we are prepared to carry out the necessary improvements to the existing facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include doing away with the present prefabs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  We are prepared to replace the present prefabs with the new type of prefabricated concrete accommodation or, as an alternative, if the local people are able to come within the cost limitations imposed on us, to approve the traditional type of structure.  In my view that is a fair offer and I hope it will be accepted.  I found Deputy Fitzpatrick to be a very reasonable person when he was Ceann Comhairle and I hope he considers my offer to be reasonable.  I hope he accepts it in the good faith it is made bearing in mind the limitations under which I must work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick should recommend acceptance of this offer to the local people so that we can proceed quickly with the project.  In my view I am adhering to the commitment I made, perhaps not to the letter but that is not possible in today's circumstances.  It is not possible to stick to the letter of that commitment at present, a commitment that was made in good faith, but I am doing the next best thing.  There is still some time to go before the end of spring 1988 if the Deputy wishes to wait but I do not think <Col N="2466" /> I will be able to give a commitment then. I hope we can sort out this problem.  It is my desire that we should come to a satisfactory conclusion in regard to this school.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has entered into direct consultation with other member states of the European Community concerning the impact of the completion of the internal market upon those peripheral nations within the community whose level of economic development is similar to Ireland; if he will give details of such discussions and of their outcome and conclusions which may have emerged with a view to outlining what co-ordinated course of action the Government propose to take to ensure that the provision of the Single European Act with regards to social cohesion would be effectively put in place in a timetable co-terminous with the achievement of the completion of the internal market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Single European Act provides in the new Article 130B which is inserted into the EC Treaty that the implementation of the internal market must take into account and contribute to the achievement of the cohesion objectives set out elsewhere in the Act.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, the Government have pursued a consistent policy of ensuring that the achievement of economic and social cohesion, now established by the Single European Act as one of the Community's principal objectives, is pursued in parallel with the completion of the internal market.  In its <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published last month, the Government stated that:</P>
      <P>We are anxious that Ireland should play the fullest part possible in the completion of the internal market, subject to full account being taken of the possible serious difficulties for our economy from an insensitive application of some of the proposals involved and also, of course, to market-opening measures being matched by more effective Community action to achieve greater economic and social cohesion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the Commission's <Col N="2333" /> proposals in February of this year negotiations have been in progress on what President Delors calls &ldquo;Making a success of the Single European Act&rdquo;.  These negotiations have taken place at the European Council and at the Foreign Affairs Council and they are continuing. In addition there has been a series of bilateral contacts with other member states both by way of visits by members of the Government to other capitals and visits to Dublin by community colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate from his knowledge of how government operates that the Government pursues its interests through every means available to it, and Irish Ministers have of course taken every opportunity to advise our partners in Europe of Ireland's concerns in these negotiations.  However, he will also appreciate that to reveal details of specific contacts or their outcome could be counterproductive to the negotiating process.</P>
    <P>I would, finally, draw the Deputy's attention to the conclusions of the June European Council, to which the Heads of Government of 11 member states subscribed and which agreed that the objectives of the Single European Act could not be pursued in isolation from each other.  They also spoke of the need to strike a balance between achieving the internal market and strengthening cohesion.</P>

      <P>The Government received no prior notification of the recent military action by the United States against an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf.</P>
      <P>I am aware of reports that the United States Government consulted certain of its allies prior to the events referred to. It is normal that, not being a member of the North Atlantic Alliance, Ireland was not so consulted.  I do not accept that our exclusion from such a process of consultation imposes constraints of the kind implied in the Deputy's question.  In Ireland's view the UN is the appropriate forum for dealing with international conflicts such as the Iran-Iraq war.  Irish efforts are concentrated in that framework and it is this priority in Irish foreign policy which has made Ireland an acceptable participant in most UN peacekeeping operations.</P>
      <P>We see the United Nations, and in particular the efforts of the Secretary General, in seeking to secure the acceptance and implementation of Resolution 598 as offering the best hope of a solution. This resolution, unanimously adopted by the Security Council, calls for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to internationally recognised boundaries.  We encourage Iran and Iraq to co-operate with the UN Secretary General in securing the rapid implementation of Resolution 598 as the sole basis, in the UN framework, for a comprehensive, just, honourable and durable settlement.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question on this matter in Dáil Éireann on 16 June 1987.  It is my understanding <Col N="2335" /> that police reports of this kind are not normally published.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the completed report, which contains several parts, has been submitted to the relevant authorities, including, where appropriate, the Director of Public Prosecutions. The ruling of the DPP on the outcome of the report is currently awaited.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on 15 July, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced in the House of Commons that, in response to one particular recommendation of the Sampson Report, a special inspection into certain matters of RUC organisation and procedure would be carried out by an inspector of constabulary. Mr. Charles McLachlen of the South East Inspectorate of Constabulary (In Britain) was subsequently appointed to undertake this inquiry.  The Secretary of State has also indicated in the House of Commons that at the earliest appropriate time he himself will make a statement on any matters arising from the Sampson report that fall within his responsibilities. He will take account of Mr. McLachlen's findings in this statement.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the whole range of issues surrounding the Stalker/Sampson inquiry and I believe that it is essential from all points of view that the matter is cleared up, and the necessary follow-up action taken, as quickly as possible.

I am aware that this report calls for closer collaboration on defence matters between the EC and the Twelve on the one hand and the Western European Union on the other.  The report and resolution are not binding on any Government.  The Government cannot accept the report and resolution.  The Government's position on this matter is that co-operation with our partners covers only the political and economic aspects of security.  As set out in the Declaration made on the occasion of ratification of the Single European Act co-ordination of positions on the political and economic aspects of security does not include the military aspects of security or procurement for military purposes and does not affect Ireland's right to act or refrain from acting in any way which might affect Ireland's international status of military neutrality.</P>

A recent Norwegian White Paper concentrates on ways of intensifying the existing close relationship with the Community.  In Austria discussion has also focussed on strengthening existing relations with the Community rather than on possible membership.  We are following developments closely in both countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Single European Act codifies and formalises the existing process of political co-operation in treaty form.  That process and the nature of our involvement in it are essentially unchanged.  The coming into force of the Single European Act does not, therefore, call for any particular steps by the member states of the European Community.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the six-monthly reports on developments within the European Communities is to inform the Oireachtas of the main developments in the Community framework and in European political co-operation.  The Deputy can be assured that these reports will continue to cover those developments adequately.</P>
      <P>Title III of the Single European Act explicitly limits co-operation on security matters to their political and economic aspects.  The Single European Act does not, therefore, affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality and the Declaration made by the Government at the time of ratifications underscores this.</P>

      <P>As soon as we became aware of reports of Mr. Tricot's mistreatment we expressed our concern to the Chilean Government and asked for details of the charges against him.  We have been informed that, although he is still in custody, he is allowed to receive visitors in hospital.  Representatives of the Red Cross and his lawyer see him regularly. The Red Cross say that he has suffered spinal injuries since his arrest but offer no explanation as to how these occurred. The Chilean authorities suggest that the injuries are linked to epilepsy from which they say he suffers.  They understand that he suffered similar injuries as a result of an epileptic fit while he was in Ireland.  I am not aware of any evidence of mistreatment or torture.  Mr. Tricot is charged with the illegal possession of explosives.</P>

      <P>The Irish delegation at the United Nations General Assembly has close contact with the delegations of the other European neutral states mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; except in the case of Switzerland <Col N="2343" /> which, of course, is not a member of the Organisation.  The approach of those states is close to our own on many issues.  Our positions are especially close in the field of arms control and disarmament. We intend to maintain contact with these delegations: a special meeting is not necessary.</P>

      <P>As Nicaragua is not one of the priority countries for the receipt of development assistance under our Bilateral Aid Programme such assistance as is given takes the form of funding support for the development projects of Irish nonGovernmental organisations which are active in Nicaragua and scholarships under the Bilateral Aid Fellowships Programme. About twenty-five thousand pounds (£25,000) was provided in 1986 and about eleven thousand five hundred pounds (£11,500) has been provided so far this year.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua is the largest recipient of EC aid in Central America.</P>
      <P>I assume that the report referred to in Deputy Higgins's question is that prepared by HEDCO (Higher Education for Development Co-operation), a body which promotes development assistance by Irish colleges of third-level education. Following a visit to Nicaragua by representatives of HEDCO in 1985 to assess how Irish colleges might assist universities there, two project proposals were submitted to my Department, both of which were approved and funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> The position regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations with Nicaragua is as already set out in my reply of 24 March 1987 to a question from Deputy Higgins.</P>

      <P>The next European Council is due to take place on 4 and 5 December. Although the agenda for the meeting has not yet been established, it is highly likely that, in the general context of discussion of East-West relations, developments in the field of disarmament may receive the attention of the Council.</P>
      <P>Matters relating to disarmament are raised and discussed by all partners, including Ireland, in the context of the meetings which take place in this area within the framework of European Political Co-operation (EPC).  This continues to be the case since the ratification of the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be impossible to put a figure on the number of meetings which have taken place within the framework of EPC since 1 July as this would have to include the many hundreds of meetings which take place between EC missions in third countries, within the United Nations and other fora.  At the centre of EPC, however, is a network of working groups involving experts from capitals.  There have been about twenty-five such meetings since the beginning of the Danish Presidency.  Their agenda has included disarmament issues before the UN, including the non-proliferation of nuclear <Col N="2345" /> weapons, and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe as well as a wide variety of regional and other issues.</P>

The Government look forward to the signature of a treaty on the complete elimination of intermediaterange nuclear weapons, and hope that progress can be made on achieving major reductions in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Superpowers, as agreed at the Reykjavik Summit meeting last year, and also on preventing the further militarisation of outer space.</P>

      <P>The national debt is usually taken to refer to Exchequer debt.  It does not include the accumulated debt of State-sponsored bodies and other public authorities. Government Departments do not have any borrowing in their own right as all Exchequer borrowing is undertaken by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As of 31 December 1986 the national debt was £24,416 million.  The separate accumulated debt of State-sponsored bodies was £4,519 million and that of other public authorities was £85 million.</P>
      <P>In the ten year period to end 1986 the national debt increased almost seven fold; this represents an average annual increase of 21 per cent.  This gives the clearest indication of the need to reduce our reliance on borrowing and to restore order to the public finances.  A start was made on this task by the Government in the March 1987 budget and the process will be continued under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>A full list of the species of wildlife occurring in Ireland is not available, but information is available for certain groups of species.  The definitive list for mammals, amphibians and reptiles is <i>A Provisional Distribution Atlas of Amphibians, Reptiles and Mammals in Ireland</i> by E. Ní Lamhna and available from An Foras Forbartha.</P>
      <P>For birds, the definitive work is <i>Birds of Ireland</i> by Kennedy, Rutledge and Scroup which is available from commercial bookstores.</P>
      <P>The number of species of plants occurring runs into several thousands and no complete listing has been compiled. However, the <i>Census Catalogue of the Flora of Ireland</i> by Scannell and Synnott lists the higher species of plants occurring in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of species of invertebrates to be found in Ireland is in the tens of thousands and no systematic work in listing <Col N="2351" /> them has been undertaken.  Comparative lists for the years mentioned are not available.</P>
    <P>In relation to the population sizes of species, the critical factors are the general status of any population of animals and the degree to which any existing threats may adversely affect that status.  Precise censusing is not therefore generally undertaken and the numbers of individuals of species is not known.  The corncrake population is recorded as declining and the pine marten is increasing.  Sandmartins are a common species and the golden eagle is not resident, but is recorded as a rare visitor.</P>
    <P>Plans for the conservation of these and all other protected species are based on two main strategies, which are the regulation of exploitation and the protection of habitats.  Exploitation is regulated under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and enforced by a corps of wildlife officers. Protection of habitat is undertaken within the general policy objective of the creation of a network of nature reserves representative of all ecosystems to be found in the country.</P>
    <P>The species protected at present under the Wildlife Act are as follows:</P>
    <P>Wild Birds:</P>
    <P>All species.</P>
    <P>Wild Animals:</P>
    <P>Badger, Bat Species, Deer Species, Hare Species, Hedgehog, Otter, Pine Marten, Red Squirrel, Dolphin Species, Porpoise Species, Seal Species, Whale Species, Natterjack Toad, Frog, Lizard, Newt, Pygmy Shrew and Stoat.</P>
    <P>Flora:</P>
    <P>Fifty-two species as listed in the attached Flora Protection Order, 1980.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Since the resumption of the design of a comprehensive arterial drainage scheme for the Owenmore and Arrow river catchment, it has been possible, by the assignment of one engineer, full time, and one engineer, part time, together with the back-up services provided by the hydrology, hydrometric and other specialist units within the Office of Public Works, to bring the design to approximately 40 per cent completion.  As a considerable amount of work remains to be done, I have allocated sufficient resources in 1988 to ensure that a preliminary design for this major scheme will be completed in the summer of 1989.  In the absence of design details, it is not possible to accurately assess the likely duration of the cost/benefit and environmental analyses or to say when scheme works might be commenced.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit was issued to the person concerned from 21 May 1987 until 31 August 1987 on foot of weekly medical certification forwarded by her.  Payment was suspended when a first certificate of incapacity was received at the end of August which intimated that the person concerned was only incapacitated from 21 August 1987.  Consequently, a question arose as to the precise period of incapacity for work and inquiries were duly instigated.  It has now been established that the person concerned has been continuously incapacitated since May 1987 and all arrears of disability benefit (totalling £415.90) from 1 September 1987 to 26 October 1987, the date of her latest medical certificate received, have been issued to her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned most recently claimed disability benefit from 16 September to 20 October 1987 but benefit was not payable as he no longer satisfies the contribution conditions for receipt of benefit.  Where a person has less than 208 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  According to the records of the Department the person concerned has <Col N="2356" /> only 83 contributions paid on his behalf since entry into insurance and he does not appear to have paid any contributions since the year 1981-82.  He has exceeded his maximum entitlement to benefit on an earlier claim which expired when he was found capable of work by a medical referee of the Department.  In order to requalify for disability benefit the conditions of the scheme require him to have at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions are paid.</P>

      <P>Environmental control of operations of this kind is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority, in this case Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Control of Atmospheric Pollution (Licensing) Regulations, 1985 (S.I. No. 178 of 1985), a licence from the appropriate local authority is required for the process of recovering metals through smelting.  The Air Pollution Act, 1987, contains provisions which, when brought <Col N="2360" /> into operation in the new year, will replace these regulations and provide enhanced powers for local authorities in relation to polluting emissions.  General planning powers are also available for the environmental control of industrial plant.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Dublin Corporation that no application has been made for a licence under the 1985 regulations for this particular operation and that no licensable activity has been taking place on the premises.  The corporation's Environmental Pollution Report for 1986/87, as well as more recent monitoring, indicates that levels of atmospheric lead in the Ranelagh area are well below the air quality standard which I recently prescribed for the protection of human health and the environment.</P>
    <P>I have no function in the relocation of industrial premises.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 96 together.  Under the terms of the Department's middle-level technician programme, special training grants <Col N="2368" /> are paid to participants monthly, in arrears.  While some delays have occurred, I understand that, aside from the participants in programmes operated by colleges under the auspices of the city of Dublin VEC, payments have been made in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  In this context the Deputy will be aware that it is a matter for each VEC to order its priorities to ensure the early payments of the grants in question.  In regard to delay in payment of ESF grants by the City of Dublin VEC my Department is endeavouring to resolve this issue through normal negotiating procedures. Grants will be paid at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Rules for National Schools the number of teachers on the staff is directly related to the number of pupils attending the schools.  According to the Department's records the teaching staff at St. Joseph's School for Hearing Impaired Boy's, Cabra, Dublin 7 has been reduced by seven since the commencement of the 1984-85 school-year and the school authorities have recently indicated that another teacher will resign in the near future.  This will mean a total reduction of eight teachers since the 1984-85 school year.  This reduction is a direct result of the decline in pupil numbers from an average enrolment of 297 pupils in 1984-85 to 232 pupils enrolled as at 30 September 1987.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the question of the number of specialist teachers employed is that for some considerable time the school has been allowed three teachers more than its normal quota to cater for special needs and subjects.  This concession continues to be allowed.  It is a matter for the school authorities to ensure that the staff available is deployed to the best advantage to cater for all subjects of the curriculum.  The overall position is that the school continues to have more than a full quota of staff as determined by the pupil/teacher ratio applicable and in view of this it is not possible to consider any further appointments to the staff at this time.  However, the matter of the staffing generally is being kept under constant review in consultation with the school management.</P>
