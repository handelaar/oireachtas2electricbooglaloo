      <P>In view of the fact that it is one of the major theatres in the capital city, will the Taoiseach expedite the consideration being given by the Arts Council or by himself?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the theatre is in danger of not remaining in operation as a viable theatre and may be in danger of closing?

      <P>In view of the fact that this document has remained unpublished for 20 years &mdash; by now it should have been lodged in the Public Records Office &mdash; may I ask the Taoiseach if he thinks it would be a useful contribution to the prospective discussion about constitutional reform and that the report should be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to acknowledge that a great deal has happened since that committee sat.  We have had constitutional referenda since then. I am not sure that the relevance of that report at this stage would justify the <Col N="841" /> expenditure in publishing it.

      <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence in view of the substantial reduction of finance to the Defence Forces, the areas in which cutbacks will occur and where economies will take place; if a reduction in the level of personnel resulting from the serious cutback in finances will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> There has not been a substantial reduction in the financial allocation to Defence in 1987.  The sum allocated to Defence in 1987 is £260,270,000 (net) which is a reduction of 1 per cent only compared with the 1986 outturn figure of £262,870,000.  I shall make a detailed statement on the matter when I present the Estimate for discussion and approval by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a 1 per cent reduction on the outturn for 1986 effectively represents a reduction of 3 per cent, taking into account the pay and pensions allocation on the 25th round for 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I do not agree because the provision of £65,958,000 for non-pay is a reduction of £10 million or 14 per cent on the 1986 outturn.  This reduction arises mainly under subhead 0.2, aircraft provision, <Col N="844" /> which in 1987 amounts to £9 million compared with the 1986 outturn of £19,534,000.  The 1986 figure includes exceptional expenditure amounting to £13,850,000 on helicopter purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, notwithstanding the exceptional expenditure on helicopter purchases in 1986, there is a substantial reduction in the provision for Army transport on the capital side, that further reductions are evident from the Government decision not to have any recruitment in 1987 and that overall a 1 per cent decrease over the 1986 outturn shows a substantial reduction in the provision for the Defence Vote in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I do not agree.  Furthermore, I should like to remind the Deputy that there was no recruitment in 1986 and, as I already stated in reply to a previous question, there is no decision as of yet with regard to recruitment in 1987.  Having regard to the present constraints on public expenditure programmes, the allocation for Defence is considered adequate to meet Defence Forces requirements in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there was no increase in Army strength in 1986, and that none is projected for 1987 on the basis of the budgetary provision, would the Minister not agree that we are reaching the stage where the Army, at the end of this year, will be seriously below the regular requirement.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that a 1 per cent reduction in nominal expenditure for the Defence Forces, coupled with a 3 per cent inflation rate, represents close on a 5 per cent reduction in real terms over the amount expended last year and is, to use Deputy Desmond's phrase, a substantial reduction?  Would he like to correct his first statement to the House that there was not a substantial reduction?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, in view of the very severe budgetary constraints on the Army in the period 1984 to 1986, and the even more severe constraints this year, there is a growing concern in the Army that in terms of supplies, transport equipping, Border duties &mdash; which are currently under great stress &mdash; there is an urgent need to provide greater resources particularly in 1988?  Will the Minister ensure that the review will not be scuppered by the Department of Finance in 1987?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to give the Deputy a few examples of what I am looking at at the moment.  The decentralisation of part of my Department is ongoing.  I have proposals for computerisation in the Department, military training and educational programmes and overseas military service. Since I assumed office as Minister for Defence I have taken it upon myself to see at first hand the various military establishments.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the pressures on the Army are so severe that successive Governments had to consider bringing home troops from the Lebanon, which no Government wished to do, because of the very substantial budgetary reductions for the Army arising from, for example, a growing Border security problem over the past month?</P>

As regards decentralisation, where does he propose to get the money to build new offices and shift people from one part of the country to another?

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Because of the extensive back up services required to maintain a helicopter on permanent standby it would not be possible in present circumstances to locate a helicopter for rescue purposes at a place other than Casement Aerodrome.</P>
      <P>Three of the five Dauphin helicopters are designated to search and rescue and when these become fully operational in early 1988, they should considerably improve operational flexibility in so far as rescue operations are concerned, particularly as these helicopters will have a night flying capability.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that in the case of sea rescue, time is a crucial element?  Over the last week or two, two people crossing from Tory Island to the mainland were saved in the nick of time.  In view of the fact that it takes such a long time to fly from Baldonnel to the north west, does the Minister agree that there is some urgency in having such a facility based at Finner Camp?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current ESB dispute centres around the unions' claim in respect of the 26th pay round.  The 25th pay round ended on <Col N="860" /> 30 September 1986 for craft and general workers and on 30 November 1986 for remaining staff.</P>
      <P>The ATGWU representing over 4,500 general workers in the ESB submitted a claim for an increase of £35 per week on salaries up to £250 per week; 4 per cent increase on the balance of salaries over £250 per week and changes in the superannuation scheme to allow for retirement on full pension after 30 years' service, that is instead of 40 years' as at present.</P>
      <P>The group of unions representing about 7,000 workers in the craft, clerical, administrative and technical areas submitted a claim for an increase of 12 per cent for 12 months with a minimum increase of £20 per week.</P>
      <P>In direct negotiations the ESB offered the unions an 18 month agreement incorporating a six months' pay pause and a 3 per cent increase for 12 months, the costs to be recovered by internal economies.</P>
      <P>Those proposals were rejected by all the unions and the matter was referred to the ESB's joint industrial council, which, as Members of the House will know, is the procedure which has been in place since 1970 and is the settling machinery made up of unions and management under an independent chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Maurice Cosgrave is the present chairman.  He was a former chairman of the Labour Court.  The Industrial Council's recommendation of 17 February 1987 was for a 3 months' pay pause, then 4 per cent on the first £100 of basic weekly pay or equivalent, with a minimum increase of £4 per week; 3 per cent on the next £200 of basic weekly pay or equivalent; 2 per cent on the remainder and a review in September 1987 in the light of the circumstances then prevailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendation of the Joint Industrial Council amounts to equalling inflation, with even better provision for the lower paid.  The agreement would end in September, subject to the review <Col N="861" /> provided for.  Both the ESB group of unions and the ATGWU separetely rejected the industrial council recommendation and all unions agreed that industrial action would commence on 5 May 1987.</P>
    <P>In an effort to avert industrial action the Employer Labour Conference had a series of meetings with the parties.  These meetings got under way last Friday and continued well into Saturday and Sunday. The chairman of the conference issued a statement on Sunday 3 May, indicating that no acceptable basis for a resolution of the dispute existed at that time.</P>
    <P>Early on Monday 4 May, the ESB wrote to all unions calling on them to accept the industrial council's recommendations and to withdraw the strike notice and all the restrictions.  In return, the ESB offered immediately to enter into negotiations on all other existing claims, including the matter of a staff electricity discount.  The ESB emphasised that the outcome of negotiations would have to be self financing and make a contribution to lowering the price of electricity.  In these negotiations, the ESB would allow the unions to set the priorities.  The discussions could also take place under an independent chairperson whom I would nominate.</P>
    <P>The ESB saw this offer as providing all the members of the ESB unions with a pay increase up front; a process for final determination of the 25th pay round in the ESB in September and a framework for concluding negotiations on all existing claims including the claim for a staff electricity discount.</P>
    <P>Under the auspices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, discussion reopened at 5 p.m. on Monday, 4 May and continued throughout the night and early morning but failed to avert the industrial action scheduled for Tuesday, 5 May.  Pickets have now been placed on all locations and power cuts have already been implemented.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House last week the ESB have their own unique dispute settling machinery which has proven its worth over the years.  All along, I have <Col N="862" /> kept in close touch with the developments leading up to this dispute.  In a statement which I issued yesterday, I stressed the serious implications which this dispute has for everybody.  I would again urge the parties to continue their search for a solution.  This strike is one for resolution between the ESB and their trade unions.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Labour for repeating verbatim his answer to me on Thursday last.  May I now ask him what specific role he sees for himself in this situation, or does he propose to stand aside?  Does he see a role for the Labour Court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the same answer, because at that stage the Employer Labour Conference had not been involved.  It was not a question of the direct negotiations which took place yesterday, albeit for a short period, between management and the unions and there had not been the intervention of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at senior level.  Those three major events have happened since I spoke here on Thursday evening last.  I said last week and I repeat; I see the Joint Industrial Council as a unique machinery for settling disputes.  It has proved this in the past.  It is within that framework that this dispute can be resolved.</P>

The senior representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions acted as intermediaries for 12 hours.  I do not at this stage see any point in trying to assist in bringing both sides together.  If the sides wish to go back to the Joint Industrial Council, or wish to have a fresh initiative from the Employer Labour conference, that is open to them.</P>

Are the guidelines to be held for everybody right through the year in the interest of equity for all workers or are we going to make fish of one and flesh of the other and make this distinction which the Minister for Finance talked about between commercial and non-commercial semi-State bodies on the basis of &ldquo;not now but in September when everything else is fixed&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the substance of the Bill I should say by way of background that the Bill was introduced by my predecessor as Minister for Defence during the life of the previous Dáil.  I would like to acknowledge and place on record that the necessary preparatory work including the drafting of the Bill was undertaken during the period in office of my two immediate predecessors.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce certain reforms and updating into the existing code of military law as contained in the Defence Acts.  The need for such revision has become evident over the years since the principal Act &mdash; the Defence Act, 1954 &mdash; was passed by the Oireachtas more than 30 years ago. While, in general, the existing legislation has stood the test of time it is inevitable that legislative provisions which were designed to meet the circumstances of a particular time will not all remain adequate for the needs of more than 30 years later.</P>
      <P>In the intervening years there has been a number of substantial amendments to the 1954 Act.  The first of these was the amending legislation in 1960 which provided for overseas service with the United Nations on peacekeeping missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last major reform in the field of military law was introduced by the Courts Martial Appeals Act, 1983.  That Act provided for the establishment of a special <Col N="965" /> court to hear appeals against the findings and sentences of courts martial by persons convicted of offences against military law.  The Act also made provision for the grant of free legal aid at court martial hearings and hearings by the Appeal Court, on conditions similar to those applicable to the grant of free legal aid in the civil criminal courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House represents the fruits of a further review of military law which has been under way for some time.  Section 1 deals with interpretation. Section 2 updates the level of maximum fines which may be imposed by the District Court for a variety of offences in relation to military affairs and service property.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 provide for increases in the levels of the maximum fines which may be imposed for offences against military law and in the maximum amounts which an offender may be ordered to pay by way of compensation where compensation is appropriate.  They also provide for the linking of those maximum amounts to the daily rate of pay of the offender.  The maximum financial penalties prescribed in the 1954 Act are now of nominal value only and have little if any deterrent effect.  Military tribunals have for some time been faced with difficulty in imposing appropriate punishments having regard to these restrictive limits.  The revised penalities proposed are maximum amounts and, as heretofore, the actual penalities to be imposed will be at the discretion of the relevant tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides for the introduction of a new punishment of reduction in rank for commissioned officers.  Such punishment already exists for non-commissioned officers.  This will provide an alternative penalty in appropriate cases between the very severe punishment of dismissal and the lesser punishment of forfeiture of seniority; an alteration in the order of the punishments which may be imposed on men of the Defence Forces so as to make &ldquo;detention&rdquo; a lesser punishment than &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; or &ldquo;discharge with ignominy&rdquo;; modification of the existing total disqualification for State <Col N="966" /> employment of persons dismissed or discharged with ignominy from the Defence Forces.  In future there will be a time limit of seven years in so far as civil employment is concerned and the Government will have power to lift this part of the disqualification at any time.</P>
    <P>These amendments are designed in the first two instances to avoid, in appropriate cases, the necessity for dismissal or discharge and in the third instance represent a relaxation of the present inflexible provision.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the creation of a new offence against military law, namely, that of being under the disabling influence of any drug or volatile substance.  It will be a defence to a charge under the section to prove that the drug or substance was prescribed by a medical doctor or was used in good faith for medical reasons.  The need for prescribing the offence arises from the fact that military personnel are armed, are liable for duty at all times and must be capable of undertaking such duty at any time.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7, 9 and 14 deal with different safety aspects of the flying and navigation of service aircraft.  The new powers being sought are particularly relevant to the operation of the sophisticated aircraft and helicopters now available to the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides express power for the captain of a service aircraft to take appropriate measures in relation to non-military passengers who may jeopardise the safety of the aircraft or of other passengers or property on board the aircraft. The section reflects powers already in existance in relation to the safety of civilian aircraft.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides power to lop, cut or remove any tree or shrub on land in the vicinity of a military aerodrome which obstructs the safe take-off of landing of aircraft.  It will be necessary to give not less than 21 days' notice of such intention to the occupier of the land concerned who will be entitled to undertake the work himself, if he so wishes, and be paid his reasonable expenses for so doing.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the extension of the existing powers to erect and maintain <Col N="967" /> signalling apparatus on lands or buildings in the vicinity of a military aerodrome so as to enable such apparatus, if required for air navigation purposes, to be placed on land or buildings in the vicinity of any military post &mdash; not necessarily an aerodrome.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the expansion of the existing powers to make regulations in relation to the flying of service aircraft and for the certification and maintenance of such aircraft and aircraft material.  Section 8 provides for the production of documents by civilians who are witnesses before military tribunals.</P>
    <P>Section 10 restricts the protection from imprisonment for debt which has in the past had the effect of lowering the credit rating of non-commissioned service personnel seeking facilities from banks and other financial institutions.  At present the protection against imprisonment for non-payment of debt applies to non-commissioned personnel without restriction and to reservists on permanent service. In future in the case of non-commissioned personnel of the Permanent Defence Force it will apply only while they are on active service.</P>
    <P>Section 12 regularises the procedure for the prosecution of civilian witnesses before courts martial who are charged with contempt.</P>
    <P>Section 13 increases the penalty for wearing, without the Minister's permission, any uniform of the Defence Forces, including any distinctive part of a uniform.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions are self explanatory.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the Bill before us is non-controversial. Many of its provisions though appearing minor are important to the overall efficient running of the Army. Military matters are always important and should always be understood to be so.  The introduction of this Bill affords us an opportunity to examine how its provisions will affect the overall performance of the Army.  Some people seem to take it for granted that there should be no problems encountered in the day-to-day operations of the Army, that no rules should be broken and that it may not be necessary to change many of the procedures relating to their operations. I am surprised at the number of people who are still of that opinion.  In any organisation with personnel numbering 13,500 approximately, whether that be in Army or civilian life, there will be problems encountered daily affecting such personnel.  Many of the provisions of this Bill are necessary to cover such personnel matters.</P>
      <P>It is no harm on an occasion such as this for us to reflect on the main business of the Army in the sense that they provide protection for Seán Citizen against external aggression of any kind.  As the years pass one can readily understand why certain priorities must be identified.  Of course protection of citizens remains the Army's primary task.  Coming second in order of priorities probably would be their contribution to peace-keeping worldwide.  As the Minister pointed out in his opening remarks, substantial legislation was introduced in 1960 to allow our Army personnel take up such peace-keeping duties: it is only fair to say that our contribution in that area has been good.  It is acknowledged by the free world that, as a small nation, we have played a significant role in peace-keeping operations all over the world wherever our forces were located.  Recognition of that fact is important not alone to our people but to Army personnel, it being seen as an extension of their code.  It is important that there be that extension of Army activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major objective of any Army in a <Col N="969" /> civilised society like ours is its back-up service in aid of the civil power.  It is now in this facet of Army activity that most people come in contact with the Army in the course of their daily lives.  In an ideal world I suppose such back-up service would not be necessary but we are no different in this respect from any other democracy.  Over the past five to ten years the presence of the Army on our streets has become daily more obvious. They perform a vital role in this area.  At the same time one must express regret that the crime rate has risen to the degree that there is need of this back-up service by the Army in aid of the civil power.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the Department of Defence have been an easy target in any cost-cutting exercise.  For many reasons I would not share that view, particularly bearing in mind the various check-points sited all over the country, the number of robberies taking place daily in relation to money in transit and so on.  Probably ten or 15 years ago we were totally unaccustomed to seeing the Army perform that role.</P>
    <P>I find rather disquieting the alarming decrease in numbers in the regular Army. Total Army strength at present is approximately 13,500, decreasing further by approximately 500 per annum.  There is no recruitment taking place and, if one is to judge by budgetary figures, there will not be any further recruitment for a long time.  In so far as I can interpret budgetary provisions with regard to the Army I am led to believe that there will be much cost cutting.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will place more pressure on individual members of the Army who will be fewer in number to carry out their many tasks.  It is against that background that it has been found necessary to update some of the procedures relating to Army operations generally. Bearing in mind the constant haemorrhage out of the Army, currently running at approximately 50 per month, with no recruitment taking place, they will have a high age profile, indeed too high for the modern technology in which all armies must engage.  That is something to which I should like the Minister to <Col N="970" /> devote attention not alone in his Department but, more importantly, around the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>I must confess that many things happen within the operations of the Army that I do not understand but I have every intention of acquainting myself with them.  In that respect I might thank the Minister and Chief of Staff publicly for having given me an opportunity recently of being briefed on many such matters. It is only reasonable that I place my appreciation on record.</P>
    <P>In my view section 4 constitutes the cornerstone of the provisions of this Bill. I was intrigued to ascertain that, in this day and age, soldiers are fined in military courts on the basis of a day's pay; that is the measurement of the fines to be imposed on them.  I understand that the actual rate has not changed in the past 30 years.  I can well foresee how the various military courts would encounter problems dishing out meaningful sentences based on fines calculated perhaps 30 years ago.  I presume the words &ldquo;a day's pay&rdquo; are Army terminology.  I cannot understand why we do not say a maximum fine will be imposed for a particular offence.  The words &ldquo;a day's pay&rdquo; intrigue me.  I presume that when you are in Rome you do as the Romans do and when you are in the Army, you do as the Army do.</P>
    <P>A new punishment of a reduction in rank and a modification of existing total disqualification from State employment are being introduced under the provisions in section 4.  A reduction in rank seems to be a most commonsense way of imposing punishment.  I cannot understand why it has not been done before now.  However, I would like the Minister to explain to the House the disqualification from State employment of somebody who is dismissed from the Army for whatever reasons.  Do I take it that until now he would have found it almost impossible to get employment outside the Army if he was so disqualified?  I was not aware of that.  That is a severe sentence and the soldiers who got this punishment must have committed a very grievous sin. Under the legislation now before us, a person would only have to serve a <Col N="971" /> maximum of seven years in exile, if I can put it that way, or the Government of the day could decide to have that sentence shortened.  I hope the Minister will clarify this point in his reply.  Most of the sentences seems to be commonsense.  They appear to be fair and give greater scope to the person who is at the receiving end. I am sure the people in the Army believe it is a fairer method of sentencing.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a new offence in military law.  It relates to people being under the disabling influence of any drug or volatile substance.  Any organisation with 13,500 human beings on their payroll would have all types of problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> personnel matters.  In keeping with the rest of society in the western world, obviously the question of drugs has to be mentioned.  I mention this because the Army are no different from any other organisation and I am surprised that this was not already provided for.  Because our military personnel are on call at a moment's notice and are always armed, it is important that they always be in control of their faculties.  Therefore, this new provision is a very important part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 7 in regard to safe landing and take-off procedures at military aerodromes make good sense.  I assume some flaw was found in the law <i>vis-à-vis</i> property adjoining aerodromes.  I am sure that down through the years every effort that could be made was made to ensure the safety of crews but I would like to know what loophole was found. Obviously if a beech tree is in the wrong place it will have to be removed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that any civilian summoned to attend as a witness before a court-martial may be compelled to produce documents as evidence.  I am surprised that this provision has not been there for a long time.  Perhaps I do not know much about the background to this but I would have thought that any evidence that was necessary under section 8 would have to be made available in the interests of fair play for everybody.  It is against that background that I wonder why it has to be introduced at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> Section 13 increases the penalty for wearing, without the Minister's permission, any uniform of the Defence Forces, including any distinctive part of the uniform.  The Garda Síochána would have the same problem in relation to this. It is obvious why we should have this provision but can the Minister say if there is any reason as of now that Army uniforms are confiscated or robbed for ulterior motives.  It makes good sense to increase the penalties to whatever level seems appropriate.  I would have thought this was of top priority so far as the Army are concerned.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I intend to raise on Committee Stage.  The sections make good sense but I would like clarification on some of them.  It is important that we discuss and tease them out in Dáil Éireann.  The Army command respect and so far as we in Dáil Éireann are concerned we want to make sure that what we do is right not alone for the Army, but for the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Noonan on his promotion to Minister for Defence.  I hope as a fellow County Limerick man, that our views will always be on the same wavelength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I want to say that we very much welcome the opportunity to discuss the operation of the Defence Act, 1954, as we believe that military law is in need of major revison.  The Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1986, at present before the House is a very limited attempt to update military law dealing in the main with increases in the levels of maximum fines awardable and in certain cases compensation payable on conviction for offences under the Defence Act, 1954. As the fines fixed by the 1954 Act have become quite unrealistic in 1987 money terms it is obviously time to update them and the surprising thing is this had not been done up to now.  These fines were fixed at a time when £5 represented almost a month's wages for a soldier. Under the Minister's proposals, the fines in future will relate to a day's pay which <Col N="973" /> is a welcome move as it will eliminate the cumbersome procedure of having to introduce a Bill in Parliament to update money fines.</P>
    <P>However, in regard to forfeiture of pay, I would like to ask the Minister if the practice of imposing forfeiture of overseas allowance in addition to pay is being operated for units in receipt of such an allowance.  The general rule is that where a soldier is sentenced to detention for any period he must forfeit pay &ldquo;for every day of detention&rdquo;.  In the past, the finance branch of the Department of Defence interpreted pay &ldquo;as including overseas allowance&rdquo; and accordingly directed forfeiture of the allowance as well as the pay.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this interpretation was improper.  In practice this meant that a soldier sentenced to, say, seven days detention for a disciplinary offence would suffer a disproportionately large monetary punishment as well as the loss of liberty, in this case, perhaps £200 or more.  I would like the Minister in his reply to confirm whether overseas allowances are still being forfeited and if so, I would like him to state the exact statutory authority for such forfeiture.  In general, however, the Minister can take it that the Progressive Democrats support the new system for assessing fines awardable by courts martial or lesser disciplinary proceedings.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals in the Bill with which we would be in general agreement are the proposals in section 12 to revise the law governing contempt of court martial. The present procedures have already been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the famous Committee of Public Accounts case.  We support the provision in section 8 making an addition to the law governing the summoning of civilian witnesses before courts martial or other military legal proceedings.  We also support the proposal in section 6 giving additional powers to the captain of a service aircraft in relation to civilian passengers. This is merely extending the same powers as already exist in the case of civilian aircraft and is a very necessary <Col N="974" /> addition to section 154 of the Defence Act.</P>
    <P>Having stated the areas where we are in general agreement with the Minister, I want to make it clear that the Progressive Democrats have serious reservations about a number of other proposals. Among these are, in section 4, the introduction in the scale of punishment for officers of an additional form of punishment awardable by general court martial. This is reduction to a lower commissioned rank.  There is the additional proposal in section 4 allowing some relaxation of the prohibition against State employment in the case of persons sentenced to be discharged with ignominy.</P>
    <P>We have some reservations about proposals in section 5 which introduce a new disciplinary offence relating to the use of illegal drugs and we also have reservations about the operation of section 10 which deals with an alteration in the Defence Act that exempts soldiers from imprisonment under certain Acts.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are not in favour of the proposal in section 4 of an additional form of punishment.  We believe that there is an adequate range of punishments already available.  An officer reduced by courts martial to a lower commissioned rank would in a small Army such as ours, be of doubtful value as an officer for the rest of his service.  Under normal conditions it is doubtful if he could clear himself of stigma of such a punishment and his authority over subordinates would be seriously weakened.  We see no need for the introduction of this punishment.</P>
    <P>The other proposal in section 4 allowing relaxation of the prohibition against State employment in the case of persons sentenced to be discharged with ignominy which in itself can be welcomed does not alter us from our views in that the punishment of &ldquo;discharged with ingnominy&rdquo; should be abolished.  We believe this to be archaic and barbaric.  Under the existing military code an officer can be sentenced <i>inter alia</i> to death, imprisonment or dismissal, and we do not see <Col N="975" /> any necessity for this additional sentence of &ldquo;discharged with ignominy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 introduces a new disciplinary offence relating to the use of illegal drugs. We agree that the introduction of this offence is necessary.  However, the second of the statutory defences &mdash;&ldquo;used by him in good faith for medical reasons&rdquo;&mdash; seems to be unnecessary and we believe that it should be left to the tribunal trying the offence to decide whether the necessary criminal intent had been established.</P>
    <P>Section 10 proposes an alternation in the section of the Defence Act that exempts soldiers from imprisonment under certain Acts.  We believe, however, that the exemption of soldiers from imprisonment under the Debtors Act or the enforcement of court orders, far from being an advantage to them, has had the effect of reducing their creditworthiness, particularly in the obtaining of house purchase, loans and in hire purchase transactions. The exemption in the case of the Debtors Act in this Bill is now applied only where a regular soldier is on active service or a reservist called up on permanent service. This seems to us to be just tinkering with an exemption which has not benefited members of the Defence Forces at all and consideration should be given as to whether it is necessary to retain the exemption.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the proposed Defence Bill as far as it goes is necessary.  We have outlined our reservations about some of the matters contained in it.  However, we believe that the Defence Bill in general does not go far enough and leaves military law still in need of a major revision.  Indeed, it is a sad fact that no action was taken to remedy the greatest defect of all in our military law code, the absence of a system of appeal from sentence of courts martial, until a soldier was charged with the murder of three of his comrades in the Lebanon.  It was Private McAleevy who was responsible for the first major revision of military law since 1954.  The Progressive Democrats consider that some other matters should have been <Col N="976" /> dealt with in this Bill, for example the promotion of officers.  Up to June 1975 the promotion of an officer by the Minister for Defence depended <i>inter alia</i> on his being recommended for promotion by the Chief of Staff.  In June 1975 the then Minister, Paddy Donegan, wished to promote an officer not recommended by the then Chief of Staff, the late General T. L. O'Carroll.  Rather than operate within the law the Minister, in order to get his own man appointed, changed the law. Under the Donegan amendment, as it became known, it is only necessary now that the Minister should consider any recommendations made by the Chief of Staff and then promote an officer notwithstanding possible objection by the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>When this amendment of regulation A15 was introduced it was bitterly opposed by the Fianna Fáil Opposition and pledges were given that it would be repealed at the first opportunity.  This has not been done.  It is the opinion of the Progressive Democrats that the so-called Donegan amendment should now be repealed as it gives the Minister dangerously wide powers in the matter of the promotion of officers, particularly to the senior ranks, and introduces a political patronage in a profession of which the members have sworn allegiance to the State and have sworn not to become members of any political party.  I will return to this matter on Committee Stage where we will propose an amendment to cover this point.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe too, that we should introduce a system of trial of military offences by a court consisting of a legally qualified officer sitting alone, a person who in some armies is called a military magistrate. Such a system exists in the United States army and, more importantly, in the Canadian army on whose Defence Act our Defence Act, 1954, was largely modelled. In the United States army 90 per cent of all trials were hitherto conducted by courts martial.  That was an antiquated and time-wasting system inherited from the pre-1914 British army, a system which has changed little since then.  I would like <Col N="977" /> the Minister when replying to give his considered opinion on the magistrate system.  This will help me to decide on whether to put forward an amendment seeking to have this system introduced into our military code.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the Progressive Democrats feel is of great importance is the question of free legal aid.  In most armies now the principle of legal aid for soldiers charged with serious offences has been accepted.  However, despite some promises to do so, the provision of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act have not yet been applied to the members of the Defence Forces here.  This is a disgrace. In fact some special unofficial arrangements had to be made I understand to provide Private McAleevy with lawyers when he was charged with murder.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the Progressive Democrats feel should have been dealt with in the Defence Bill is the question of admonishment of officers.  There are occasions on which an officer is considered to have committed a breach of discipline or to have been guilty of some neglect but not to be deserving of trial by court martial or by way of summary proceedings.  In such a case the practice is to have him formally &ldquo;admonished&rdquo; by a superior officer.  This is a source of injustice and a procedure of doubtful legality because in practice it amounts to imposing a punishment without the safeguards that would be inherent in a more formal trial.  So long as the practice is permitted in this form there is always the possibility that a superior may be tempted, in cases where the publicity of a trial would be unwelcome or where the proof to sustain a charge was not sufficient, to punish an officer by this means.  The record of the admonishment is placed on the officer's file and there it remains forever like a timebomb.  It is possible that an admonishment for some indiscretion on the part of a young lieutenant may be decisive in denying that officer promotion to a senior appointment 20 years afterwards.  The Progressive Democrats believe that this procedure should be revised so as to <Col N="978" /> make provision for safeguarding against possible injustice.  We submit that the record of the admonishment or reproof should be given a life of not more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the Progressive Democrats feel is in need of revision is the procedures for &ldquo;redress of wrongs&rdquo;. Section 114 of the Defence Act was designed to give every member of the Defence Forces a simple and direct route to the Minister in cases where a person believes himself to have been wronged by a superior.  In practice the administration of this section of the Act has given rise to much complaint by all ranks who feel, and, in our opinion justifiably so, that the original complaint gathers too many opinions from superiors and civil servants before it reaches the Minister, who in fact is given the complaint complete with advice as to how it should be dealt with, which in a few honourable exceptions has been invariably accepted by the Minister.  The Progressive Democrats feel that this practice has departed a long way from the spirit and intention of section 114.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats also believe that a legal officer of the Defence Forces should be appointed as adviser to the Navy.  He should be an expert in law of the sea and fishery law.  The work of the Navy is becoming increasingly more responsible and complex and it lacks the assistance of such an expert at present.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats also believe there is a need to distinguish in military law between what are strictly disciplinary offences and those of a criminal nature.  At present all offences, having regard to the punishments they carry, have to be classified as criminal and therefore the effect of a bad military disciplinary record can have a quite disproportionate effect on a soldier's subsequent career in civilian life and on the type of discharge and reference he gets when he leaves the Army.  This is the area in which the notorious black list came into being as soldiers who were being discharged from the Army with what was officially a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; record, but which nonetheless contained only disciplinary <Col N="979" /> offences, had his name placed on the list.  If this scandalous practice is still in operation we believe it should cease immediately.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would like to extend the compliments of my party to the officers, the men and the women of the Permanent Defence Forces who have given such loyal service to this State both at home and overseas in the service of the United Nations in the cause of peace and stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Defence, I am pleased to endorse the Minister's commendation of this Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>The Defence Act, 1954, was, I understand, the culmination of many years of work on a consolidated measure to replace and update the various Temporary Provisions Acts under which the Defence Forces had been administered since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The fact that the provisions of the 1954 Act have &mdash; without requiring any radical amendments &mdash; served the country and the Defence Forces well for over 30 years is in itself a tribute to the several Administrations which, through the late 1940s and early 1950s were involved in its preparation and enactment.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, however, no set of legislative provisions can be expected to remain adequate for all time and the review of the Defence Act, 1954, which has now concluded and whose results are reflected in this Bill, is timely and will, I hope, be welcomed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces are a large organisation and, of necessity, a complicated one.  Troops are stationed in a very wide geographical spread from the Border to Haulbowline and the cohesive administration by the Minister for Defence and the civil and military branches of his Department of such a widespread body of diverse units demands that the statutory basis for this task should be the best that <Col N="980" /> the Oireachtas can provide.</P>
    <P>The various amendments and extensions of the Principal Act which are now before us represent the changes which those who are responsible for the efficient administration of the Defence Forces consider necessary in the light of experience to meet the requirements of the present day and of future years.  I am confident that the Minister will have the goodwill and co-operation of the House in relation to this measure.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sections in the Bill which, I think, deserve to be highlighted. Section 4(2)(c) provides for an easing of the very punitive provisions of sections 209 and 210 of the Principal Act which debar forever a person dismissed or discharged with ignominy from serving the State in any capacity whatsoever.  I am very glad to see the humane measure now being proposed which will limit the disqualification in the case of civil State employment to a period of seven years, or shorter at the discretion of the Government. While it is appropriate that persons in this category should be regarded as being unsuitable to serve in the Defence Forces again, there are many areas of civil State employment in which they could make a useful contribution, and I welcome the fact that they will now have at least limited eligibility for such public service.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with a problem which in the times when the Principal Act was going through the Oireachtas was, happily, non-existent in this country.  I refer, of course, to the scourge of drug addiction which as, the House is well aware, is in these days a continuing and seemingly intractable problem in almost every country in the world.  While members of the Defence Forces are, in common with all other citizens, subject to the ordinary criminal law in regard to drug abuse, it is proper that drug abuse should be made a specific offence under military law so that it can be dealt with expeditiously, in any instances in which it arises, as a matter of internal military discipline.  Drug abuse is not, I understand, a problem in the Defence Forces at the present time, and it would be my fervent wish that there <Col N="981" /> will be no change in this situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sections of the Bill which relate to the safety of aircraft.  Section 6 is a very necessary provision.  It brings the power of the captain of a military aircraft into line with the powers which the captain of a civil aircraft already enjoys in relation to ensuring that the safety of the aircraft and its passengers and crew will not be jeopardised by unruly or aberrant conduct by anyone on board.  While the possibility of this type of conduct occurring on a military aircraft is remote, it is, nevertheless, vital that there should be powers available to the captain to deal with it if the necessity should arise.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 9 are also geared towards the safety of aircraft and, of course, towards the safety of persons who may live or work in the immediate vicinity of military aerodromes and other locations where military planes and helicopters may take off and land.  All the measures concerned will, when enacted, help to maintain the very high and well deserved reputation which Ireland enjoys in regard to safe and efficient air transport operations.</P>
    <P>Section 8 fills a gap in the court-martial system which, as far as I am aware, does not exist in the civil courts.  It is only proper that where a court-martial requires as evidence any document, etc., it should have the same power to ensure that this is produced as any other court would have in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also relates to the conduct of courts-martial and is, I understand, an amendment designed to regularise the procedure for dealing with persons who may be in contempt of such courts.</P>
    <P>Finally &mdash; and I know that I can safely speak for all sides of the House in this regard &mdash; I would like to pay tribute to all members of the Defence Forces, at all levels for the excellent service which they have rendered to the nation both at home and abroad over the years since the forces were first established.</P>
    <P>Since the commencement of the troubles in Northern Ireland, they have been asked to undertake many duties in support of the Garda Síochána in their <Col N="982" /> efforts to counteract the spate of illegal activities mainly arising from the northern situation.  The cheerfulness and efficiency with which they undertake these and many other tasks related to service to the community at large should be an inspiration to the general public.</P>
    <P>The contribution of our troops to the cause of world peace in the service of the United Nations needs no elaboration by me.  Suffice it to say that on all occasions on which the United Nations requested a contingent of Irish troops, there has never been any shortage of volunteers for service and the high standards of behaviour and efficiency to which those troops have aspired and which they have attained are a justified source of pride to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>As we are dealing here with a Defence Bill, the scope of the debate is naturally confined in a way in which it will not be when the Defence Estimate comes before the House.  The Estimate debate will afford us an opportunity to deal at length with the various matters which impinge on that portfolio.  In the meantime I again support the Minister's commendation of the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I publicly congratulate the Minister on his appointment and welcome him to the office of Minister for Defence.  I speak from experience when I say that I am quite satisfied he will have a very happy and satisfying tenure in that office because he will have the pleasure of dealing with a very efficient Department of State, on the civil and military side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last true professionals are the members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  I define a professional as a person giving service who, in all circumstances, puts his client's interest above his personal interests.  If we examine the other groupings in society briefly, we will see that none of the so called professionals measure up to that appropriate definition. For example, last year the teachers were prepared to throw their pupils to the wolves because of their pay claim; there have been instances of doctors <Col N="983" /> withdrawing or curtailing their services and the same applied in regard to nurses. Engineers have also withdrawn their services and my own profession is not without fault as barristers and solicitors have refused to co-operate in administering State schemes of legal aid in pursuance of an industrial claim.  The result of all those instances was that the clients, whom those groupings were supposed to serve, were put secondary to the particular vested interest of the groups concerned.</P>
    <P>Professionals are in an enhanced position in society.  They have status by virtue of their profession and their average pay is higher than that of the average industrial worker.  Because society puts them in that position, they have a special responsibility which has not been lived up to by any profession in the past.  The only profession that can claim to be truly professional is that of the soldier.  One can say that it is an enforced professionalism because of the demands and dictates of the disciplinary code. However, that is not a response because that code is voluntarily accepted by these people when they enlist in the Permanent Defence Forces.  They are true professionals and, whenever an emergency arises, <i>pace</i> the current emergency, the thoughts of the citizens immediately turn to what assistance they can get from the Army.  If we look back over the past number of years they have been called out to do the most varied range of tasks, all of which have been discharged with consummate efficiency and success.</P>
    <P>There is a limit to what the Army can do because of their size and resources. They are not capable of dealing with the present emergency and those who look to the Army to be the catalyst to break the present impasse will look in vain.  It is no fault of the Army as they do not have the resources to do a particularly specialised task.  Again, because we have tended to look on the Army in the role of coming to the aid of the civil power when it is in difficulty, we are glad to overlook their true essential professional <Col N="984" /> nature as a military force.  It is because they are a highly disciplined, highly professional military force and they are able to respond to a great variety of contingencies, not necessarily military in character.  It is because they are professionals, used to obeying orders, highly organised and efficient in their methodology that they are able to respond efficiently and with success as can be seen in example after example.</P>
    <P>In order that that happy situation should continue, it is essential that the morale of the Permanent Defence Forces should at all times be kept high.  A number of factors affects morale.  The history of the Defence Forces is one and the present incumbents can take pride in a great tradition of service from the foundation of the State when an infant Army had to protect an infant democracy from the attacks of irregular forces.  In that connection it is apposite to recall that the father of the Taoiseach was a distinguished officer during that period in the National Army.  The Army saw their role then &mdash; and continued to play it &mdash; as being supportive of democracy.  They were secondary to the State and that was the role the Army saw for themselves and played in the letter and the spirit through many difficult times in our political history. The result is that today we have total trust in the loyalty of our Permanent Defence Forces to the institutions of the State.  That is a happy position to be in because, should our democracy be ultimately challenged, its last defender will be the Permanent Defence Forces.  It is incumbent on us, the guardians of democracy here in this House, to ensure that that ultimate defender is given the best possible ambiance in which to work so that its morale will always be at the highest level.</P>
    <P>A proud history is one important factor in the building of morale but there are other, more practical, factors which have to be taken into account.  Unfortunately, in recent years, we have been somewhat careless in the resources and attention we have provided for the Permanent Defence Forces.  In the matter of pay, while they have got the various increases <Col N="985" /> of the national rounds, nevertheless groups that were comparative with them have gone ahead.  I refer in particular to the comparisons that existed between certain ranks of the Garda Síochána and some officer commissioned ranks of the Permanent Defence Forces.  The pay and conditions of the former have now gone significantly ahead of those of their colleagues in the Permanent Defence Forces, something which should be addressed at the earliest possible moment.  I commend it most strongly to the Minister.  I am sure people would argue that one reason for this is the members of the Garda Síochána have the advantage of having representative associations to make their case for them. That has been an important factor in their progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Army have never sought, and do not want, to have associations representing them because they see them as being antipathetical to their role as total professional, loyal servants of the State. In the absence of any such associations, they have to depend on Members of this House, principally on the Minister of the day.  He, of course, needs our support expressed in the House of the importance of the Army and maintaining them as a professional body with high morale, capable of responding to whatever calls the State makes on them within their resources.</P>
    <P>It is also incumbent on us to ensure that the Army have the very best of modern military equipment because, by possessing modern, military equipment, they become up to date and top class in their profession.  It is also good for their sense of self-esteem that they are as good as any other defence forces or military grouping in the western world.  It is important that there should be a proper sense of self-esteem among the members of the Defence Forces because that, of course, is a critical component in the intangible thing we call morale and which we all know is so important.</P>
    <P>The conditions of service have to be equitable, fair and satisfying.  The Bill touches on conditions of service of the members of the Permanent Defence <Col N="986" /> Forces.  As the Minister said, this Bill was initially prepared when I was in office and pursued and introduced to the House by my colleague, the former Deputy Paddy O'Toole.  In effect, the purpose of the Bill is to update the sanction which can be imposed for breaches of military and other law by members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  When I say &ldquo;update&rdquo; I am speaking euphemistically because the measure is increasing the punishments which can be imposed.  While I was responsible for initiating the drafting of the Bill I would have some hesitation at this juncture about introducing it when the numbers in the Army are dropping, when the equipment being offered to the Army is being curtailed and when the pressures on the individual members by virtue of the drop in numbers and inadequate equipment are increasing enormously, thereby bringing the possibility of an increased incidence of acts of indiscipline resulting, if this Bill were to become law, in increased penalties.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is a proper time for us to introduce heavier sanctions when the climate is unfavourable for the serving soldier through no fault of his own.  I do not oppose the Bill but I mention that point to the Minister for consideration on completion of Second Stage as to when we might proceed further with the Bill. The provisions in the Bill are entirely logical because the original proposals are now literally outdated.  In particular, I fully approve of the change made as regards the prohibition on State employment from making it an open-ended punishment to one with a time limit because it was incongrous that people who had been convicted under the Offences Against the State Act for subversion suffered a penalty of exclusion from State employment for a set number of years whereas a member of the Defence Forces having joined to serve his country and got in trouble could find himself excluded.  I am glad that change is being made.</P>
    <P>Another change which I think is significant is the taking of power to recommend a reduction in the ranks of commissioned officers.  We will have to <Col N="987" /> consider this in more detail on Committee Stage if the Minister decides to proceed with Committee Stage.  Deputy Clohessy mentioned the redress of wrongs procedure.  I have to say to him that he has got it all wrong.  I can speak from personal experience that when a file containing an application for a redress of wrongs comes before the Minister it comes in such a way that the Minister can take a totally unbiased view of the case. Obviously, if there are technical matters concerned he will have to have advice from both the civil and military sides of his Department.  That is normal in any submission which comes to any Minister in any Department on any issue.  That is not to say that the Minister's independence is thereby frustrated, curtailed or inhibited.  I am quite certain that Deputy Power had the same experience as I and knows that when a file containing an application for a redress of wrongs is received, the Minister is a totally independent person examining that and he will make his decision on the issues and not to please either the civil or military sides of his Department.  That has been the tradition in the redress of wrongs procedure and I am satisfied that it has worked well and will continue to work well in the future.  Therefore I would take issue with Deputy Clohessy on that matter.  Whatever myths have permeated the Defence Forces with regard to that matter which might have caused him to have been briefed in the way he was, I would like to say that those beliefs are mythical and have no foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy also mentioned the black list.  I am not aware of this black list.  I remember while I was Minister for Justice there was a suggestion that the Department of Justice maintained a black list.  That was another of these myths which gets propagated in this country. It is an attractive ominous sounding thing and it is good copy but it is a myth. Likewise, people who are convicted of military offences being put on a so called black list, to the detriment of their employment opportunities is also a myth. <Col N="988" /> There is no such thing and I am glad to have the opportunity to scotch that belief.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to repeat what the Minister, the Minister of State and other speakers have said about the Permanent Defence Forces.  The manner in which they serve at home and abroad is a great credit to them, to their professionalism and to their traditions.  It is very important that we recognise that and we in this House and the Executive of the day, so far as is possible in terms of the resources available, should ensure that the maximum possible resources are made available to the members of the Defence Forces so that the numbers will be kept up and that their equipment will be kept at the very highest level.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude and I am glad to be able to acknowledge that here publicly this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> First of all, I must thank the Deputies for their good wishes on my appointment as Minister for Defence and for their contributions to this debate.  I know that there is a great fund of goodwill, as was expressed here this evening, on both sides of the House, towards the Defence Forces.  I look forward to further discussions in this House with regard to defence matters when the Estimates come up for discussion and when we will have an opportunity of going into greater detail.  As indicated this evening, the Defence Forces are held in high regard both at home and abroad, and rightly so. I acknowledge the expression of praise and appreciation of the Defence Forces by the Deputies who have spoken in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has already been indicated, we hope to have in the not too distant future a more wide-ranging discussion on the Estimates for the Department of Defence on the various other matters which were raised and which affect the Defence Forces &mdash; matters such as peacekeeping, aid to the civil power and the strength of the Defence Forces.  I will be in a position <Col N="989" /> to put forward proposals on that occasion.  As I indicated when introducing the Bill, it was prepared and introduced to the House and brought to its present stage by my two immediate predecessors, Deputy Cooney and O'Toole. As indicated by Deputy Cooney, quite rightly, this is a Bill which has been under consideration in the Department for some time.  It contains many important amendments from the military point of view.  By way of reply to the points which have been raised in the debate, I wish to make further comments on the issues involved and also on the points raised by Deputies.</P>
    <P>First, as regards the level of increases in fines, etc., it is well to remember that the fines which may be imposed for offences against military law have now been in force since 1955.  I am sure the House will agree that they are totally unrealistic, having regard to the change in the value of money since then.  For example, the amount of £5 which is the maximum fine which a court-martial may impose on a private soldier represented about two weeks' pay in 1955.  In present-day terms the average weekly pay for a private would be in the region of £305, so one can see that there is quite a discrepancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the pay that high?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy should stay here.  The maximum fine proposed for a private under the Bill is six days' pay, or about £130 in current terms.  Fixing fines by reference to so many days' pay also means that the amount of the fines will be self-adjusting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 35 offences in relation to military affairs and military property <Col N="990" /> which are punishable in the District Court.  In the case of 25 of these offences, a tenfold increase in the levels of the fines at present prescribed is proposed.  Since the Defence Act of 1954 was enacted, the consumer price index has increased more than elevenfold.  In seven other cases the increase is less than, or about the same as, the increase since 1955 in the level of the average industrial wage, while in the remaining three cases the increases proposed are substantially greater. However, these increases are regarded as justified because of the nature of the offences concerned &mdash; wrongful sale, etc. of equipment, offences in relation to manoeuvres, including unauthorised entry into places in which arms, ammunition, etc., are stored and, indeed, as I have already stated, the unlawful wearing of military uniform or imitation of the uniform.  These offences have obviously more serious implications in current circumstances than they had 30 years ago and there should be no reasonable objection &mdash; indeed there is not &mdash; to more severe penalties for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy referred to the punishment of reduction in rank and said this was unacceptable by his party.  Punishment of reduction in rank at present may be imposed by a court-martial on a non-commissioned officer.  The introduction of a similar penalty in the case of an officer would provide courts-martial with an alternative to the severe punishment of dismissal or the lesser punishment of forfeiture of seniority.  It was maintained there is a considerable gap between those two punishments and the new punishment is regarded as an appropriate means of filling this void.  This is the purpose of introducing this amendment.  We felt that one was too lenient and the other too severe and the occasion might be appropriate to introduce this type of punishment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to helicopters. When the Defence Act of 1954 was enacted the Defence Forces had no helicopters.  Now military helicopters land in and take off from military installations other than aerodromes and, therefore, it may be necessary to erect an <Col N="991" /> apparatus for signalling on lands or buildings adjacent to such installations. Section 9 would provide power to do just that.  Power already exists, under section 35 of the 1954 Act, to erect and maintain signalling apparatus in the vicinity of military aerodromes.  That is the purpose of this provision.</P>
    <P>With reference to a point raised by both Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Clohessy, the present disqualification from State employment arising from dismissal in certain circumstances lasts a lifetime.  This applied to employment with the State, not to civilian employment. In the case of semi-State employment, it is proposed in the Bill that the disqualification should be modified to seven years and also the Bill gives power to the Government to remove the disqualification at any time.  No change, however, is proposed in the disqualification from employment in a military capacity.</P>
    <P>A point was also raised in the course of their contributions by several Deputies with regard to drugs.  As Deputy Connaughton has rightly pointed out, drugs were not an issue, or not as great an issue, when this legislation was introduced 30 years ago as they are now.  Members of the Defence Forces must be fit and very fit indeed to undertake military duties at all times and we must remember that many of those duties are performed under arms.  Therefore, one can see the importance of the introduction of this provision.  In these circumstances, the abuse of drugs would have extremely serious implications.  It is considered that the offence should be made a specific and clearly identifiable offence against military law.  I am sure the House will agree that it is important that this be done in the context of this enabling and amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies also spoke about the attendance of witnesses at courts-martial. The position at present is that a person may be summoned to attend as a witness at the investigation of a charge or at a court-martial.  There is, however, no <Col N="992" /> power to compel a witness to produce documents, except where required as evidence. It is considered desirable that such power should exist and there seems to be no objection to this part of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton was concerned about the lopping of trees on private lands.  In the 1954 legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trees were there at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The trees were there but not helicopters, to any great extent.  In recent years difficulties have arisen with regard to trees on private lands which pose a danger to aircraft operations.  It is desirable that the Minister should have power to ensure that hazards of this type are removed as quickly as possible.  The landowner will be invited to do the necessary work himself and he will be paid reasonable expenses.  If he is not prepared to carry out the work himself, it will be done by the Department.  The section makes it an offence to obstruct or impede the work of removing or lopping trees.  I am sure that is acceptable to everyone.</P>
      <P>It has also been represented that the protection against legal proceedings which is contained in section 107 of the 1954 Defence Act works to the disadvantage of members of the Permanent Defence Force in that their credit rating can be adversely affected.  This protection is now being modified so as to be available in future to Permanent Defence Force personnel only when they are on active service.  The protection applies at present to Reserve Defence Force personnel only when they are called out on permanent service.  This is the equivalent of active service and no modification is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sections of the Bill will become law on the day it is signed by the President. Sections 2, 3, 4, 8 (4), 12 and 13 relate to offences already provided for in the 1954 Act but increased punishments are being specified.  These increased punishments will come into force only when the Bill becomes law and the purpose of section <Col N="993" /> 15 is to make the situation clear.  It relates to any court which may, after the day on which the Bill becomes law, be trying an offence committed before that date and to any court hearing an appeal or to any superior authority considering a petition relating to such an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 208 (1) of the 1954 Act authorises the president of a court martial to certify to the High Court in the case of a person not subject to military law that the person is in contempt of the court martial by reason of certain behaviour on his part.  The corresponding provisions in the civil law have been found to be unconstitutional.  Section 12 therefore adopts the provisions of the civil law which were enacted to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy referred to the promotion of officers.  The promoting authority under section 45 of the 1954 Act is the Minister for Defence, subject to Defence force regulations.  Promotions are made following consideration by the Chief-of-Staff in accordance with those regulations.</P>
    <P>If there are any matters to which I have not referred, they can be brought up on Committee Stage.  I thank Deputies for their good wishes and for their positive contributions.  I look forward to a constructive Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In resuming discussion on the 1987 budget I want to express a few thoughts that are on my mind.  When one is given a spokesmanship in a particular area one does not always have the opportunity to cross the boundaries of that spokesmanship, but the budget debate is very wide ranging and gives Deputies on all sides an opportunity to express their opinions on various matters.</P>
      <P>This is a sad day for Ireland, a day on which great calamity could befall us in terms of the consequences of the present industrial dispute which is causing great uncertainty and confusion in the public mind.  It demands a firm but fair response on all sides and I trust that will be the eventual outcome, that wisdom will prevail and that those who are in positions to influence those events will do so in the most beneficial and speedy manner possible.</P>
      <P>Today I attended on behalf of my party at the last farewell to a true servant of this House, the late Deputy Eugene Gilhawley of Sligo who gave his people long, dedicated service.  They remembered him in great numbers today.  Travelling to Dublin from Sligo afterwards one could sense the degree of uncertainty when passing through the towns and villages which look very well on the outside but which have at heart great problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Deputy James Dillon once said that politics is a vocation that draws one into stormy waters and that while it is OK to dream dreams and have visions, it is always well to remember that pragmatism is an essential part of any true vocation.  We are now beginning the fifth month of 1987 discussing the budget that is to get us through the remaining seven months.  We have a newly installed, convened Government who are forced by reality, probably for the first time ever in <Col N="995" /> the history of their party, to contend with severe economic difficulties which require tough but fair decisions.  The smiles the Government displayed on their acquisition of power have been replaced in some cases already by the lines of worry and the stooping of shoulders as they bend under the relentless pressure from outside.  The Government are under seige already in many respects.  As this is the first time a Fianna Fáil Government have faced problems of this nature, problems accumulated over the years, they are finding it difficult to cope in the initial stages of their administration.  They are already a Government of clarification and modification.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are politicians in this House who do not want to be in Government at present.  There are politicians in power who do not want to be in power because they see what faces them now. Regarding the approach to the solution of the economic difficulties which have emerged in the course of some years, does anybody really have the answer to our problems?  Is the approach being adopted by this Government too radical in the short term or are they playing the political card in an attempt to get the rough stuff over before the summer recess in the hope that the population may have gone away or forgotten about it by the end of summer so that the Government can attempt in their deliberations next October or November to frame a budget for 1988?  There are politicians in this House who are exhausted and fatigued after the crushing burden of office of the past five years.  They have had their difficulties, too.  Possibly many of them in their personal ways understand intimately the difficulties that their successors face in attempting to sort out the problems of the nation.  The signs of the burning desire for power and the thirst for responsibility have diminished in the faces, eyes and minds of some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I get the impression that already around the Cabinet table there are those who would like to see their Taoiseach cast in the benevolent mould of a master who might <Col N="996" /> be able to give out financial assistance to his beleaguered minions who, like Oliver, continually ask for more, be they in Education, Health, Social Welfare or whatever Department might be under discussion at any time.  Of course, the master has nothing else to give them this time and those who took up the various Departments now find that it is not as easy as it sounded when they were in Opposition and when they could legitimately call for the sun, moon and stars without having to deliver on them.</P>
    <P>Employment, taxation and the various budget targets have been discussed here during the last few weeks by speakers more eminent than me.  I want to address myself to a few matters that are reasonably relevant.  In budget contributions most Deputies in this House after some time tend to drift into the solution of peripheral problems which they see as important, sometimes problems with relevance only to their own areas.  In relation to employment, business and industry many people have lived on the fringe of company law in the past few decades.  Because of the payment to the Government of various taxes, business people who might find it difficult to make ends meet are under some pressure to stash away any profits they might make in areas where these moneys might not be found by the various agencies of Government.  Business people with motivation and flair and who have money to invest will invest only if there is a reward for the risk involved and if they know they will not be savaged by the bureaucracy of the Revenue Commissioners and the Government of the day in terms of the filling of forms and of the payment of various taxes.  Otherwise, those who have the ideas and the ability to implement them may well decide to take them elsewhere.  I referred the other day to companies who are making ends meet and even more in these very difficult times.  Those who do not match world and international standards in that regard fall by the wayside very quickly.</P>
    <P>Father McVerry referred in an article recently to politicians putting away their files in filing cabinets after they hold their <Col N="997" /> various political clinics and he asked whether they really understand what goes on in the minds and hearts of the people who come before them &mdash; the sick, the old, the lonely and the poor.  That is a valid question.  I find it increasingly difficult as a public representative to have answers particularly for young people who are highly educated, with degrees in their back pockets, when they say to me that I am a public representative, a legislator, and ask what can be done either about finding a position for them or pointing out to them where they can find a position on their own merit.  They ask if I can give any indication of where they might find employment.  It is exceedingly frustrating for all politicians and agencies to have to cope with such questions.  I feel genuinely sorry for young people who do their various examinations, qualify in various categories and then find themselves competing with an enormous number of applicants, an increased standard, higher pressures and various other ancillary difficulties.  For instance, health boards have interviewed several hundred applicants for jobs that do not even exist but because the interviews are passages into the incremental salaries scales the interviewers must go through the motion of interviewing every applicant to see whether he or she is suitable?  That creates pressures for parents who have to fork out money for new dresses and new suits for attendance at interviews and so on in the forlorn hope that their son or daughter might be the chosen one and without the knowledge in many cases that the jobs are being put on panel only and might not come into existence at all.</P>
    <P>I referred the other day to the standard of our education system and the difficulties our young people face in attempting to find jobs.  I was amused today to listen to the Minister for Social Welfare on a phone-in programme on the national airwaves speaking of the Jobsearch initiative of the Government where it is hoped to interview 150,000 unemployed people by the end of the year.  In six months 25,000 people have to be interviewed, that is an average of 6,000 people to be interviewed each <Col N="998" /> week.  I do not know what the officials in the manpower offices will say to these 6,000 unemployed people each week. Will they ask them for further details to add to what they already have on file, or will they point out that it would be easier to find a job elsewhere?  Will the officials just make lists to comply with the requirements under this scheme?  Where are the 40,000 Manpower scheme opportunities that are to be created by the Department? I listened to Fianna Fáil spokespersons when they were on this side of the House decry anything to do with temporary work schemes.  They said they were of no value and that in very few instances was permanent employment created.  The Fianna Fáil Government reduced the rate of pay under the social employment scheme from £70 to £60.  This scheme was of value to the people but the most Fianna Fáil can offer them is the prospect of interviews for 150,000 before the end of the year.  It will be interesting to see at the end of October-November what has actually resulted from the Minister's initiative.  It would be far better if the Minister decided to implement some of the options on his desk at the present time with regard to social welfare, which were being implemented despite great difficulty by the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>People should not say our young people have not the motivation or ability to fend for themselves.  They have reached a high educational standard and their caring attitude towards their peers and their elders in society leaves nothing to be desired.  Those young people who have become involved in social work are a credit to their parents and to the educational system.</P>
    <P>With the destruction of the local youth service boards the delicate balance between voluntary and statutory involvement in the affairs of young people was terminated by this Government.  I regret to say it has retarded youth work by at least 20 years.  Over the past two decades voluntary organisations have been screaming for a national youth policy and all Governments worked diligently to create such a policy.  A youth policy with <Col N="999" /> a budget of £2 million which was subsequently reduced was implemented last year to the satisfaction of all concerned. It was a very progesssive move involving a great number of representatives of young people.  I regret it has been done away with and I would ask the Minister for Education to look at that seriously and not set up a series of talking shops which will disintegrate into bickering and confusion.  The diplomatic onslaught referred to by the Government when in Opposition has only been initiated.  It will be interesting to see what will result from the Governments impact on Capitol Hill in terms of permanent visas for illegal immigrants who have left here on holiday visas.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of the fastest growing markets in the world.  We must all work together in marketing Ireland abroad. The efforts of any Government in this regard must be followed through.  The recent announcement by the Minister has some valuable points.  Of value is the reduction in the cost of access to this country.  This was a difficulty for Europeans and for visitors from the US. Depending on currency fluctuations, our tourism season could be good or bad irrespective of the weather.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport should contact Irish-based organisations in every country in Europe and in the States urging them to contact their home organisations in an effort to build up a new generation of tourists who will want to come back.  The office of the Minister for Tourism and Transport demands flair, imagination, motivation and a high degree of energy and ability.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Wilson, will do his best to encourage more people to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;clean up Ireland&rdquo; campaign introduced by the Minister for the Environment is in full swing and is to be complimented. Local authorities should do their utmost in this campaign, although it will never work until the attitude of the people is changed, until they have pride in their environment and in what they own so that they will look after it.  It is a <Col N="1000" /> desecration of what has developed over 25 million years in a natural state to find broken bottles and rubbish of all descriptions defiling the countryside.  The rubbish is thrown about in the beauty spots around our coastlines by Irish people.  It is sickening and despicable.  Many beautiful areas have been destroyed by mindless people who drive out from the towns to dump refuse.  I cannot understand why it is done.  It brings one back to the responsibility of parents, teachers and individuals for the environment.  When people leave Ireland they obey hygiene and refuse regulations everywhere else, because if they do not they are tapped on the shoulder by ordinary citizens and told to obey the common law.  That is not done here.  When we arrive at the stage of a public perception of what ought to be done, there will be no need for a &ldquo;clean up Ireland&rdquo; campaign.  We will have enough civic pride to look after our environment so that this will be a place to which people like to come.</P>
    <P>In terms of marketing, Irish firms who measure up on the international front do so very well.  We maintain embassies in many countries. However, we do not have an embassy between Washington and Buenos Aires and for marketing we rely solely on the efforts of CTT.  It would be statistically interesting to compare the relevancy and the cost of some of our embassies in smaller countries with the economic advantage of sending out teams who could sell quality Irish goods wherever there is a market capable of absorbing hundreds of millions of pounds of craft goods from Ireland.  I know that is something in which the Minister of State at the Department of Industry is interested.  The Government should carry out an economic, marketing and industrial onslaught in such areas where there is a ready market.  We have quality goods for sale at competitive prices and there is no reason for us not having teams out there representing our commercial interests.</P>
    <P>The national lottery was referred to by other speakers.  It appeared to be almost a craze for the first few weeks.  It appears <Col N="1001" /> that proceeds to date amount to much more than has been awarded in prizes. The sporting area is deserving of proper consideration by the Department of Education, something I know the Minister and Minister of State seriously examine. There have been various schemes in operation over the years for sponsorship of sports centres, community centres and so on.  Like other Deputies, I should like to see such schemes streamlined so that those who apply for funds under the various headings will know what is available to them and thus set targets for meeting their objectives.</P>
    <P>As a person raised in the tradition of the Gaelic Athletic Association &mdash; it being part of what I am &mdash; last year was not a good year for my relations with the association.  I regret that relations became politicised in terms of problems arising out of VAT on hurleys, the deposit interest retention tax and rates on buildings.  It was not conducive to good relations to have to attend many provincial finals, see placards which were blatantly anti-Government and listen to speeches, even at the opening of various sports centres, strongly opposed to the then Coalition Government, culminating in the then Taoiseach not being invited to attend the all-Ireland final.  I hold no particular brief for Ministers, Ministers of State, or indeed high officials being given tickets for sporting occasions or free access to the Ard Comhairle box in Croke Park.  I am sure those who are interested are quite prepared to buy tickets themselves but it was an injustice to the office of the Taoiseach of the day that the policy adopted over some 50 or 60 years ago was not adhered to.  It was a source of regret that that was so.  Had the Taoiseach wanted to attend the match he could have gone himself, but in his position as Taoiseach it was not conducive to good relations.  I hope that the authorities of the GAA will maintain logic and consistency in this regard.  It will be interesting to see what will happen under the new presidency at the all-Ireland finals this year.  One wonders whether we will witness the same spectacle. I did note that ex-Taoisigh were <Col N="1002" /> invited on the last occasion.  The present Taoiseach could also be deemed to be an ex-Taoiseach and he might be invited on that basis.</P>
    <P>In the past two years there has been much controversy about the availability of GAA pitches to members of other codes.  I do not hold any brief for any other sporting organisation but there has been much confusion about this issue. One might well pose the question: for instance, are Kevin Moran or Liam Brady any less Irish than, say, Willie Joe Padden or Jack O'Shea?  After all, they came from the same soil and one would have suppose, the same aspirations.  Just because they are adept at playing a different code should not mean they be denied access to GAA pitches.  I hope the sporting allocation in the budget will take cognisance of what we have to offer in the sporting arena.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget contribution said that decentralisation was an initiative Fianna Fáil were anxious to pursue. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has consistently promoted his home town for the decentralisation of offices, a worthy aspiration. I was interested in notices which appeared in the papers the other day which appeared to bait contractors or would-be promoters who might follow that initiative through.  The budgetary allocation this year amounts to £1 million only.  I do not really know what that means in terms of prospective applications to the Department on the part of those interested.  My own home town has been the worthy recipient of decentralised offices which has been economically advantageous to the west.  Such decentralisation has been socially advantageous in that certain civil servants wishing to be transferred to their home areas were given an opportunity of working there.  It is economically and socially advantageous all around.  I hope this initiative is followed through seriously by the Government and is not a token commitment only, putting notices in the papers making £1 million available in 1987 and doing nothing more about it. I assume the Minister of State at the <Col N="1003" /> Department of Foreign Affairs will be equally vociferous with his senior Ministers in ensuring that a decent allocation is made available for this purpose in the budget of 1988, ensuring that bricks, mortar and concrete are made available in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>I did notice placards and hoardings of various types around the country at election time.  Probably the one that struck everybody most was the one that said &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the lonely&rdquo;.  It has now reached the stage when members of the Fianna Fáil Party are keeping their heads as low as possible.  I have attended several health board meetings.  When one visits hospitals, clinics and the like one discovers that people are shell-shocked by the cuts now being proposed.  There will be redundancy notices in the post this week for many hundreds of temporary employees in the health services around the country.  The Government have gone too far on this occasion and will be remembered for what they are doing. Had the former Minister for Health or Government even attempted to talk about implementing one-tenth of these cuts there would have been riots in the streets with effigies of every Minister being burned outside every public office, with the public absolutely up in arms. Now they have become quiet and timid, the vociferous Fianna Fáil supporters we met at every meeting having gone into hiding.  They cannot believe it themselves. Ministers are loath to receive deputations and protest groups.  I cannot say I blame them.  That conjures up a picture of Ministers around the Cabinet table asking for more funds which are just not there to be given out to the Olivers on this occasion.  People are afraid that if they become ill they will not be able to afford hospitalisation and may <Col N="1004" /> well die in their homes.  There are all sorts of fears being generated by everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit as a phost nua.  Is é Meastachán na Gaeltachta an t-aon Mheastachán amháin nár ísligh an Rialtas seo.  Tá sé sin go maith agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh siad ar aghaidh leis an sórt oibre a bhí ar siúl ag an iar-Aire Gaeltachta, an Teachta O'Toole. Is trua nach bhfuil sé linn faoi láthair.

      <P>Cuirfidh mé neart ceisteanna síos chuig an Taoiseach féin, mar is i Roinn an Taoisigh atá an tAire Stáit agus beidh seans agam labhairt faoi sin as seo amach.</P>
      <P>A former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, once said that in the years ahead it would be great to be alive, to be young and to be Irish.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It may sound &ldquo;corny&rdquo; but I think this is the most important budget that was ever framed in the history of this country because the alternatives to it being successful are so horrendous that they do not bear thinking about.  When we talk about this budget we must never lose sight of the daunting task that faced <Col N="1005" /> Deputy Ray MacSharry and the Fianna Fáil Cabinet when they met and had three short weeks to undo the damage of over four years; four years during which there was continuous deterioration in the public finances and stagnation in our economy.  Our first major tasks are to evaluate the extent of the damage, to ensure that the disease will not prove terminal, to create the climate for industry to grow and to tackle the millstone that is around this nation's neck, that is, our increasing national debt.</P>
      <P>The national debt is now a colossal £24 billion.  It would have grown to £36 billion by 1990 if Coalition policies had been allowed to continue.  So much for fiscal rectitude though that is possibly a term that has now been removed from the Coalition dictionary.  We now owe £7,000 for every person in this State down to the youngest child.  When the Coalition took office we paid £94 in capital interest to our creditors for every £100 we produced. That was bad for any debtor.  In 1986 we paid £145 to our creditors for every £100 we produced.  That gives some idea of the fire brigade measures we were faced with in preparing a budget and also in getting acceptance for it in the House.</P>
      <P>The Coalition felt that this task was beyond them and Labour refused to accept the social welfare policy that was proposed in the January budget.  They pulled out and an election was called. Every sensible person appreciated that there had to be spending cuts in this budget &mdash; current expenditure and capital expenditure had to be cut.  The alternative would be to hand over the country to people outside the State.  Everyone is being asked to make sacrifices.  We have done our best to cushion the less well off from the swingeing cuts that are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be cries from many sectional interests but I think it is a case of, &ldquo;save me Lord but not yet&rdquo;.  These cuts have to be across the board.  We now hear the dismayed baying of the various sectional interests but 1987 is D-day so far as this country is concerned.  I am glad Fianna Fáil have faced up to their responsibilities in this decade.  To have failed to do so <Col N="1006" /> would have meant that there would be no country for future generations.  We are all prepared to make sacrifices for our children.  The country is now being asked to do the same on a national scale.  I believe people will respond positively. Practical patriotism is needed now in Ireland.  It is high time that sectional interests stopped trying to squeeze the last drop of blood out of the economy. Many of these people have already got their pound of flesh and I advise them to leave it at that.  In spite of all the threats I want the Government to stand firm. Every decent person in the land wants the same.  The test that started today will be only the first round in this battle and we must win all the rounds.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to hear Deputy Kenny say that this was the first time the Fianna Fáil Party faced an economic crisis.  He is a young man but as a teacher I would have expected him to have been aware that Fianna Fáil came into power and faced a crisis in the economic war the minute they took office.  Fianna Fáil took on the might of an Empire of which it was said at the time that the sun never set on and they won.  They faced a bigger crisis in 1939 during the Second World War.  The crisis we have today could only be classified as a storm in a teacup compared to the one in 1939.  Fianna Fáil were in power at that time and they brought us through that crisis.  I can understand Deputy Kenny saying that Fianna Fáil are never in power when there is a crisis. Any time his party have been in power there has always been a crisis &mdash; the Suez crisis, the oil crisis or the Korean crisis.</P>

      <P>There were such crises that their services were dispensed with the minute the people got an opportunity of doing so.  Deputy Kenny made his little joke about clarification and modification. Before we go out of power he will realise that we are a Government of determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To show our concern for the poorer sections of the community and to illustrate the concern of this Government for <Col N="1007" /> the less well off, no better example can be found than the social welfare elements in the budget.  The increases in social welfare rates are probably in line with inflation and are as high as any reasonable person could expect.  The fact that we brought these forward to July rather than November is a tribute to our party.  We succeeded in making other modifications which can be appreciated.  For instance, the family income supplement was supposed to increase from one third to a half from April.  We increased the rate from one third to a half in the income bands from July when it was not supposed to come into operation until November. The extension of treatment benefits to dependent spouses is good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>You were going to do that as well.  I will give you credit for that. There was a suggestion by the Coalition that unemployment benefit would reduce from the maximum duration of 15 to 12 months from July.  We are not implementing that so we were in a position not to implement some of the changes we felt would not be helpful.  Indeed there were things we did not introduce.  The Coalition were proposing, for instance, to introduce a living alone allowance for long term unemployment assistance recipients who were over 45 years of age. That was to come into operation in April. It was a ridiculous proposal. I know one of the reasons for it was to placate Deputy Bermingham but this is not now being implemented.</P>

      <P>The number of waiting days for disability benefit was to be increased from three to six by the Coalition Government.  That is not being implemented either nor are we adopting the proposal by the Coalition Government to introduce a waiting period of six days for claims for disability benefits following maternity.  The Labour Party pulled out in relation to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> A very big challenge faced the new Government.  When we look at what we have done so far as social welfare is concerned we must get ten out of ten.  The main priority of this or any other Government must be the provision of jobs for the unemployed.  There is national, party and countrywide agreement on this.  We have identified our strengths and we must build on them.</P>
    <P>First, we must build on our agriculture industry, on the food we produce and process and on the image we have, and which we must maintain, of clear unpolluted countryside where our food grows. Our climate must enable us to produce beef and lamb as good and as cheaply as anywhere else in the Community but we have fallen down on our marketing and presentation and in giving added value to our own good food, the added value which it deserves.  There is a sad situation in relation to the stop-go policy in our meat factories with gluts for short periods and then long lay-offs.  I have come to the belief that intervention has been very bad and has not done our beef industry any long term good.  We should capture the year-round markets and should take the seasonality out of the meat industry. About 20 per cent of our meat goes to the United Kingdom supermarkets where it probably makes the best price.  We must get a greater share of this for our meat and dairy industries.  If we build up our markets abroad we must maintain them and give them continuity of supply if we are to hold on to those markets.</P>
    <P>How do we keep up our cow numbers and our herd numbers in the face of the super-levies and the milk quotas that have been accepted as part of Irish life in the last few years?  Parnell once said that no-one had a right to set a boundary to the onward march of a nation, but the meek acceptance of super-levies and quotas meant in reality that we were saying to the under-developed agri-industry &ldquo;thus far shall you go and no further&rdquo;. I wonder where is the young farmer to look today if he wants a living or if he is to have long term prospects of development. Prospects in farming are very bleak.  I am delighted that extra emphasis <Col N="1009" /> has been placed by the Government on horticulture.  There is terrific scope in this area for import substitution.  We should try to supply our home needs to the maximum and look for markets abroad for our surplus.  The policies enunciated by our spokesperson in this regard are well thought out, realistic and attainable.</P>
    <P>After agriculture the next greatest potential money spinner we have is tourism. I am glad that recent announcements have shared that view with me. Even hitherto unknown areas such as my own county of Kildare are waking up to that fact.  Recently I attended a meeting on tourism in Kildare and we were told that Irish visitors to mainland Britain spent £300 million there last year.  That is not the same as £300 million in cross-Border smuggling or buying duty free goods but it is money spent by Irish people across the Irish Sea.  We need to be positive and to sell the advantages we have, the clear air, the good fishing, the wholesome food and a way of life that is different but we must not price ourselves out of business.</P>
    <P>Restaurateurs expected us to introduce legislation which would give them licences to provide beer, wine and spirits. I know many people who spent much time and energy building up their guesthouses and selling Kildare abroad.  Two of them are based in Prosperous and Kilcullen and are now planning to emigrate unless something is done about the matter.  They asked me to impress upon the Minister to reactivate the Bill to give restaurants licences to provide beer, wine and spirits.  It is unusual that in an Irish restaurant one is in a position to sell French wine but not to sell an Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>In County Kildare great emphasis is placed on sport, particularly horse racing which is an indigenous industry with a worldwide reputation and with a modern aggressive marketing system that is an example to others.  We can produce and train good race horses.  Sometimes we sell them to owners who have them trained abroad and then they win the big prizes which we would like to win but, that does not matter because those people <Col N="1010" /> will come back to buy more horses.  This industry deserves every support.</P>
    <P>I give the new Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Alan Dukes, credit for reducing the tax on betting from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  It was very welcome and produced good results.  It kept our betting money at home.  There was less inclination for people to phone their bets to England.  More recently British-based high-powered companies established themselves here inthe bookmaking business and bought into chains of offices here.  They are marketing themselves to the extent that they are cutting out local bookies.  They now have a new gimmick; they say &ldquo;do not worry, we will pay the tax for you&rdquo;.  That is very dangerous ground because it leads to monopolies and stifles competition.  This is a matter that needs close attention.  At one stage legislation was introduced to deal with below cost selling in supermarkets.</P>
    <P>It was pleasant to think that the Government gave an injection to national hunt racing last year.  It is appropriate that we talk about that because there has been a great upsurge recently in private sponsorship which means that there have been highly prestigious races at home.  We have had some of the richest national hunt races in the course of this year.  While many people might be foolish enough to consider it merely the sport of kings, we need wealthy owners to keep horses.  It means jobs and wages to many people.  The bloodstock industry is well worth nurturing.  Any help given to racing in the bloodstock industry will be repaid a hundredfold in our economy.  It is the one big employer in Kildare that stood the test of time.  In spite of the recession and the cutbacks &mdash; unfortunately foreign industrialists have come and gone &mdash; horse racing still exists.</P>
    <P>I am worried, as I think we all are, about energy.  Gradually we seem to have placed a disproportionate emphasis on Moneypoint and the import of foreign cheap coal to produce electricity.  Perhaps it will help to reduce energy costs and restore competitiveness to our industry and if so it will be very welcome.  It increasingly makes us less masters of our <Col N="1011" /> own destiny and does not leave us in control of our supplies.  Those of us old enough to remember the last world war will understand the implications of that. I am glad the extension of our natural gas grid is getting under way again.  It was brought to Dublin under the Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, but a limbo-like situation has come about since then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now being extended along the coast.  It will help industry in particular.  It is better that we should use it now when belts are being tightened rather than to leave it lying under the seabed.  The same can be said about our oil.  We must have a more imaginative programme to bring oil ashore.  Many promises have been made from time to time but there is still no sign of oil.</P>
      <P>In the midlands Bord na Móna and the ESB have combined successfully for the last 40 years to provide energy from peat. This century will see the closure of some of our bogs.  There must be co-ordination and co-operation between the two bodies.  We want to see them running in tandem until the bogs have reached the end of their natural lives.  The ESB should not be allowed to break relations with Bord na Móna if they still have supplies to keep their turf-fired stations operational. A study should be carried out to pinpoint the true potential of these bogs and the latest possible date for closure without encroaching on the long term use of the bogs for horticulture, agriculture, forestry or leisure amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allenwood bog and others like it will have to close some time in the nineties but now is the time to find alternative employment for those areas.  We cannot tell these people, as somebody said years ago, to &ldquo;go to hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  Most of the families came from Connacht over 200 years ago to help build the canals. They settled down, built houses and reared families in villages that have depended on the bogs.  I welcome the new programme for the peat stations which <Col N="1012" /> produce machine turf, milled peat and briquettes.  It will have a very marginal impact in Kildare because only Ballyfermot on the Offaly border and Rathangan will benefit.  It would be wrong for anyone to imagine that we are well off in Kildare.  We have huge tracts of bogs nearing the end of their useful lives.  We are now entering the post-peat era and we need jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.</P>
    <P>We have a social commitment to see that the next generation will have work in these areas.  I believe the IDA should pinpoint the midlands as an area for special promotion.  That area would be suitable for tourism with its canals and lakelands, and there is also potential for heavy industry.  We have the expertise, well trained technicians and an excellent workforce, but time is running out.  I have been mentioning this for many years but I cannot see any great activity which would lead me to believe there will be a transition from the time these jobs disappear until other jobs are found.</P>
    <P>I have seen many industries close down in this area but I have not seen any new ones.  We have our black spots in Kildare. Polaroid never officially opened, Black and Decker closed, Irish Meat Packers in Leixlip closed recently, factories in Sallins and Kildare are on short time and the French factory, CECA, in Allenwood closed.  The subsidiary industries which serviced those companies have also lost workers and that has led to emigration. Thankfully, a Japanese company is coming to the Polaroid factory in Newbridge. We have the highest young population outside Dublin and we must provide jobs for them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed finances did not allow us to do something for the building industry.  The demand for local authority houses has dried up in most areas.  We have a huge expenditure in respect of land for arterial roads and by-passes.  I do not fault this because it is money well spent.  It has been said that the Naas by-pass which was opened some years ago has paid for itself because there is a 20 per cent return on the outlay every year in time saving for industry, transport costs, <Col N="1013" /> accessibility to ports and so on.  This bypass has proved its worth.  Any bypass or arterial road will pay for itself in the long run.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the crisis in local authority funding.  We are very heavily in debt and there is no possibility of raising the money we need in County Kildare.  Our county roads have deteriorated to the extent that they are full of potholes and are dangerous.  We have made a huge investment in these roads which is being eroded.  The local improvement schemes, which were once a feature of most counties, have been discontinued in our area and people who paid considerable sums of money 20 years ago to bring the roads up to standard now find the roads which are under the aegis of the county councils, have been allowed to deteriorate again.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we channel a percentage of the money for arterial roads into county roads.  The comparisons that can be made in my county are odious.  Money is being spent on the by-pass, kerbing and landscaping the centre median, while our other roads are in a frightful condition. With the best will in the world it is hard to explain to the average motorist driving on the bad roads that we cannot change this state of affairs.  I realise the EC provide grants for arterial roads but we need £2 million to £3 million over the next five years to bring our county roads up to the required standard.  The Minister is aware of this and the question of local authority funding will have to be thought out.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago when I first became a member of Kildare County Council it was a pleasure to be a member because you could get things done but now it is a nightmare.  It is soul destroying, especially for public representatives, and even more so for the workers.  It must be admitted that the removal of rates and car tax was a mistake.  It looked good at the time but it has proved very costly.  I asked the Minister to give this matter his full attention and he promised us he will. I hope he will come up with a solution to the problem in the lifetime of the present Dáil, as well as a system to allow us to monitor if we are getting value for the money we give local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Recently a deputation from my county visited the Minister and found he was very much on the ball.  He decided to double the allocation for county roads. As I said, I hope he will find a solution to the problem of providing funds for local authorities after next year.</P>
    <P>I have some experience in regard to forests because I was Minister with responsibility for them for a while.  At that time it was looked on as a bit of a backwater, but it is very different today. Everybody wants to get in on the act. Deputy Noonan, when he spoke on budget day, mentioned the teddybears' picnic.  If you go down to the woods today you will find that every politician is trying to get in on the act.  I will not get into the argument but I should like to talk about privatisation and State involvement.  It is vital for us to get the thousands of acres which are at present unproductive and uneconomic, particularly in the West, planted with trees.  I do not care who plants them as long as they are planted. The country and the national wealth will grow and this, in turn, will provide jobs in the future.  If private investors or pension funds have spare cash and want to buy and plant trees, they should be helped in every way.  That has not been the case up to now.  There appears always to have been a tug of war between the private investors and the Department.</P>
    <P>Private foresters, particularly in Clare, have shown what can be done.  Trees have been planted further up the mountain slopes and nearer the sea than the experts ever thought possible.  We need to raise money to spend on our forests.  Well and good if it means selling some of our immature forests, so long as the proceeds are ploughed back into providing the infrastructure and roads to help us extract our timber.  It was easy to carry in a tree and plant it in 1952, but to bring out the mature tree now is a different matter.  We need roads and machinery for extraction and we need more money for proper forestry work in pruning and thinning.  Any extension in our State forests can have a big tourist spin-off.  Anyone who wants confirmation of that need only take a trip to the Slieve Blooms.  This will convince <Col N="1015" /> any Doubting Thomas of the beauty of our State forests.</P>
    <P>In my contribution on the Social Welfare Bill I referred to the Jobsearch programme. I commend this idea.  I noted Deputy Kenny was scornful about its results but I hope this programme will be pursued vigorously.  I got a document from the Minister's office today which convinced me that he, too, is serious about this.</P>
    <P>It is vital we show our 150,000 unemployed that they are not being consigned to the rubbish heap, but that we are anxious to restore to them the dignity of a wage earner and bring back the work ethos.  The vast majority would be delighted to get back to work.  There may be some black sheep among them who do not want to work but want to remain as parasites in the community but I trust we will identify them.  I hope this Jobsearch programme will help to defeat the bigger offenders in the black economy who are drawing social welfare and working. We must succeed in this objective and I wish it every success.</P>
    <P>We have heard for many years of the plight of traders in Border towns because of cross-Border shopping expeditions. Even the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, was alerted to the position during the election campaign.  I do not know whether it was a moment of distraction, academic reverie or if he was carried away on a bout of North-South co-operation, but he advised shoppers to go North to shop.  Minister MacSharry felt that this was carrying the friendly neighbour act a bit too far and he introduced the 48-hour stipulation.  The amount at stake is £300 million and the effort is well worth while.  Some people said that it would not succeed but it is already having its effect.  We can review the position when next year's budget is framed.</P>
    <P>I detect a welcome change of policy in the Government's anxiety to make full use of our EC membership and to explore new avenues for the betterment of the country.  The regional imbalance in the Community has grown and I am sure that the standard of living in Bonn was greater <Col N="1016" /> than in Ballina when we joined the EC. We will work for an extension of the disadvantaged areas and assistance for development schemes and environmental projects.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a meeting some years ago of the Council of Europe where a mountain in Sicily was recognised as a natural habitat for flora and fauna and particularly migratory birds.  It was grantaided by the EC to the tune of £1 million because the Sicilians assured the EC that the cost of maintaining it would be £2 million.  I will not pursue that but I asked why a similar application had not been received from Ireland.  It was felt that we could not make such an application because we could not match the EC subvention pound for pound.  That is the wrong attitude because we have bog land, varieties of peat and rare fenlands such as Pollardstown, which are internationally recognised as the last remaining examples still intact in Europe, and there should be international fundings available for such projects.  Why does it take so long to get results?  Have we ever presented a proper case abroad in this regard?  Whether it is in relation to County Wexford sloblands, a lake in County Donegal or the Bog of Allen we should be on the ball in looking for international funding and assistance.</P>
    <P>As a teacher, it would be wrong of me not to mention education.  I welcome the retention of the career guidance teachers above the quota.  It was a big issue before the election when educational cutbacks were mentioned.  Labour politicians were quick to announce that they were against these cutbacks and they were very anxious to cut themselves adrift from the policies they pursued when in Government. I am sure the Labour Party have now re-assumed their traditional role in opposition and that they will now tell the electorate that they are not in favour of cuts.  They will give everything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party did the <Col N="1017" /> same and, indeed, his leader even advised people to vote for the Progressive Democrats although that did not pay any great dividends.  The Labour Party use the policy of giving everything and cutting out nothing as a protective cloak.  It fits much more easily than the mantle of responsibility.</P>
      <P>School buildings were neglected during the term of office of the Coalition.  I am sure that every parish has difficulties in this regard.  Our Minister inherited a legacy of neglect.  I visited my own school in Caragh today.  Fourteen years ago Clongorey, a local school in the parish, was closed and the pupils were sent to Caragh.  Four prefabs were erected there and they are still in existence although the floor has collapsed in one and sanitary services are diabolical.  Children have to use the facilities in a shop across the road. They also had to spend some time in a community hall and the position is dreadful. We must all take the blame for it and maybe the natural politeness and quietness of the people in Kildare is a contributory factor.  However, we cannot rely on those qualities any longer because the position is now so bad that there will be a big blow-up.</P>
      <P>We also need a new second level school in Confey.  On the eve of the election, the Minister said that a site had been bought for this purpose; it was blatant political opportunism.  The policies pursued have succeeded in setting people at one another's throats over places.  The site is still a green field although we need buildings by next September.  It is the same all over the country.  The Convent of Mercy in Naas built a new school but, because of the increase in population, they had no room for pupils outside the area.  The Department pleaded with them to stretch a point by taking in 30 pupils this year and said that they would help them to facilitate more pupils in the future.  They acceded to the Department's request but nothing has been done since in regard to extra room.  Schools have been abandoned and a construction programme is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his budget speech said that he intended to recommence the decentralisation programme.  He mentioned <Col N="1018" /> the development of the Custom House docks site and said it would create several thousand jobs in the construction industry.  I am sure that will help the people of Dublin and indeed people will commute daily from Kildare to work. However, the real decentralisation programme will have to move away from the capital.  Even Dublin people will agree with that because the city is top heavy; one third of the population live in the 01 telephone directory area.  That is not good for Dublin or the rest of the country. Kildare now has a population of 120,000 people.  We use the third level colleges and universities in Dublin although we are glad to have Maynooth.  We need another third level college to fill the vacuum between Carlow and Athlone. I cannot accept the suggestion by the Department of Education that the third level college in Tallaght will fill our needs. I am sure that there will be plenty of pupils in Tallaght to fill the vacancies without taking them from County Kildare.</P>
    <P>I know that the health cuts pose problems but we must face them.  In the present climate, we cannot afford escalating health charges.  The proposals of Fianna Fáil &mdash; although they will be criticised &mdash; are better than those made by the previous Government in January.  If we want to make progress, we must act responsibly.  TDs set a headline by foregoing an increase but not many gave us credit for doing so.  It does not seem to merit the same number of printed lines in the newspapers as an acceptance of such an increase would secure.  I remember a great wave of criticism when we were awarded our last increase.  The public were told that they should be outraged but I remember as a member of the Cabinet that we did not accept an increase in ministerial salaries.  No one ever clapped me on the back for doing that.  The begrudgers' guide to politics is predictable when it comes to pay rises for TDs or Ministers.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to pay increases is correct and responsible and should meet with the same degree of responsibiliy from the trade unions and others.  To illustrate what I am talking about let me give an <Col N="1019" /> example from the recent radiographers' dispute and the consequent disruption of hospital services.  Radiographers on call were told by their unions to look for a taxi to bring them to and from the hospital no matter how short the journey might be. I am sure this only helped to increase the patient's blood pressure especially when he realised that it was his tax which was paying for the radiographer's salary and taxi and it hardly hastened his recovery. We all need to be more responsible and realistic in these difficult times and not accept a situation such as that.</P>
    <P>This is a budget which is not very palatable. It contains items which are bitter pills for me to swallow but, I can accept and defend them as short term interim measures to restore confidence in this country, to get the basic foundations of our economy in order, to control our borrowing requirements and our national debt, and to bring interest rates down to a level which will restore our competitiveness, encourage investment and hopefully get people back to work.  I expect that we will have gone some of the way down the road in that regard during the coming year.  I hope that before the end of this year we will see the growth and expansion which we forecast.</P>
    <P>We need to pull this country up by its boot laces out of the minor depression which engulfs it today.  Once we have pointed it towards the goals we have set for it the Fianna Fáil budget of March 1987 will in years to come be viewed as the date on which we turned the corner and which gave hope back to a depressed land.  I remind the hurlers on the ditch now on the opposite benches who have had the audacity to give us the benefit of their advice and collective thinking that a few short months ago they were over here and had no policies or cure to offer. They criticised the Fianna Fáil budget as not having a sense of direction.  When the country is down as low as the Coalition plunged it there is only one direction in which it can go and that is upwards.  We are now on the way up and when we surface we will be on the way forward.</P>

      <P>Deputy Power's contribution was a <i>tour de force</i> of the economy of County Kildare and had next to no relevance to the economy of the country. He ended his contribution by saying that the Fianna Fáil budget of March 1987 would mark the turning of the corner for this country.  Yet, in the weeks which have passed since their return to office unemployment has again gone over the 250,000 mark at a time when always in the past unemployment fell.  We speak at a time when there are 250,000 people unemployed and during a power strike. It was evident from the exchanges which took place on Question Time today that the Government simply have no clue about how to tackle the immediate problem of the power strike or the overwhelming problem of unemployment. The fact is the economy is becalmed just like this debate.  Here we are with the country in an economic crisis using this budget debate as a filler-in of parliamentary time and there is not one member of the Progressive Democratic Party, The Labour Party or The Workers' Party present.  Fianna Fáil are sending in speakers who go through, as their budget contributions, a list of problems in every parish in their own constituencies and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This economy is becalmed.  However, it is not sinking.  We need to remind ourselves that there are very substantial strengths in the economy.  Inflation is almost at an all-time low which in turn led us to have a balance of trade surplus, reached in 1985, for the first time in 40 years.  We maintained that position in 1986 and I hope we will do so again in 1987.  That is substantial progress compared to the position five years ago when we had a huge balance of trade deficit, when money borrowed by Fianna Fáil poured out of the country on imports and when inflation was over 20 per cent. Because of those basic strengths in the economy, because of our balance of trade surplus and because of our low inflation we are still able, notwithstanding the Exchequer's financial position, to attract substantial foreign loans at favourable <Col N="1021" /> rates as we did in the past few days in Japan.</P>
    <P>It is clear, as it is only a few minutes to Private Members' time, that it will not be possible for me today to give the substance of my contribution but I do want to say that it is evident that the Government and this parliament have not got the answers to restoring economic growth and thereby reducing and eliminating the budget deficit and its concomitant child, our very serious unemployment.  The prevailing wisdom of the three main parties in this House is that we must cut, cut, cut public expenditure. I am not saying that is wrong. As Minister for Communications for four and a half years I cut my Department by more than any other Department in the State.  The only difference is that the cuts in the Department of Communications did not lead to massive unemployment. They were achieved by genuine reorganisation and greater efficiency so that the State companies for which I was responsible were turned around with the exception of one from being loss making to profit making in those four and a half years.</P>
    <P>The conventional wisdom of all economists and all sides of this House is that we must cut, cut, cut public expenditure.  We must not, and this is obvious from the way the Government are going about their business, have any regard to the effects of those cuts.  Briefly, let us talk about the cuts in the health service.  There is no doubt that the health services are over-used.  For instance, we go to hospital more frequently than most other countries in Europe, we stay in hospital longer than most other countries in Europe, we go to the doctor more frequently than most other countries in Europe and we draw more prescriptions than most other countries in Europe.  For people on medical cards there are even more prescriptions again.  In the last 10 years the percentage of GNP spent on health has doubled in real terms.  It is obvious there is over use of the health services. However, that does not justify a totally pernicious attack on the health services <Col N="1022" /> where they are delivered to the public without any regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The main provisions in the Adoption Bill, 1987, extend the categories of children who may be legally adopted.  In particular the Bill provides for the adoption of legitimate children who are destined to remain in either residential or fostercare for all or most of their childhood and whose parents have failed in their contitutional duty towards them.  The Bill will also permit the adoption of an illegitimate child abandoned by his or her natural mother in circumstances in which such child cannot currently be adopted.  Other changes are also made in the Adoption Acts which derive from a recent judicial decision determining that widows and widowers cannot be treated differently in the area of adoption and from the lowering of the age of majority to 18 years.</P>
      <P>The adoption of children currently is governed by the Adoption Acts of 1952 and 1976.  Under these Acts an adoption order can be made only in respect of a child who (i) is an orphan, or (ii) is illegitimate, or (iii) has been legitimated by the marriage of his parents after his birth but whose birth has not been re-registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A child's mother or guardian or any person having control over him must consent to his adoption.  In the case of a legitimated child whose birth has not been re-registered, the consent of both mother and father is required.  There is a two stage procedure involved in the adoption process.  There must be an <Col N="1023" /> initial agreement to place the child for adoption and there must be a subsequent consent given to the making of an adoption order after a child has been placed with prospective adoptive parents, before the Adoption Board can make such order.  This latter consent can currently be dispensed with in certain circumstances by direction of the High Court.  These circumstances would normally relate to a situation where the court considers that the mother has unreasonably withheld her consent to adopt or has withdrawn a consent already given and where the court believes that the child has bonded with its proposed adoptive parents and it is in the best interests of the child that an adoption order be made.</P>
    <P>Children who are not eligible for adoption at present are: 1. A legitimate child with a parent or parents alive; 2.  An illegitimate child whose mother has not agreed to its placement for adoption.  3. A foundling infant where it cannot be established that such infant is illegitimate.</P>
    <P>For many years there have been calls to amend the law to permit the adoption of such children in circumstances where they have been separated from or abandoned by parents who are unlikely to resume or incapable of resuming their parental roles.  The majority of those children for whom a change in the law is required are legitimate children in long-term residential or fostercare, placed in such care by or with the assistance of a health board or voluntary body.  There are also children who fall within this category who have been placed directly by parents with relatives or friends without the formal intervention of any health board or other body or organisation.</P>
    <P>In 1980 a survey carried out by the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children among its member organisations which comprise statutory, religious and voluntary bodies dealing with child welfare showed that 100 per cent of the respondents to the survey favoured the adoption of legitimate children.  Whilst the majority of the members of the Task Force on Child Care <Col N="1024" /> Services inexplicably in their final report to the Minister for Health in September of 1980 did not make any recommendation to reform the adoption laws, a minority of the members of that body formed the view that adoption fell within the area to be covered by their report and referred expressly to the need to extend the possibility of adoption to children currently excluded from it.  Emphasising that adoption is one of the alternatives which must be considered when the future care of a child who has no family of his own to care for him is being planned they stated &ldquo;we do not think the law should continue to discriminate in relation to eligibility of children for legal adoption on the basis of the marital status of the childs parents&rdquo;.  They emphasised that a result of the current law in so far as it prevents the adoption of abandoned legitimate children is &ldquo;that some children will stay in care throughout their childhood who could instead be growing up happily in adoptive families&rdquo; and recommended that the law should be changed to permit the adoption of legitimate children.</P>
    <P>The need to change the law was again emphasised by the Review Committee on Adoption Services in their report published in May of 1984.  In their report they state:</P>
    <P>We are firmly of the view that a child's eligibility for adoption should not be determined on the basis of the marital status of his parents.  A major defect of the present law is that it excludes from adoption many children who may be in need of the benefits which it can offer.  There are children in the care of the Health Boards and religious and voluntary organisations who have never experienced the happiness of growing up in a stable home environment with legal security and who, under our present laws, are denied the likelihood of ever being able to do so.  These are children born legitimate with a parent or parents alive; some have been abandoned by parents unable or unwilling to discharge their parental obligations; others have been <Col N="1025" /> left effectively parentless as a result of the chronic illness of a father or mother or both.  There are some such children who may be in fostercare and who will therefore usually have the benefits of a settled home.  The disability in this instance is that they cannot be legally integrated into their foster family or into another family who might like to adopt them.</P>
    <P>The committee further on in their report make the startling disclosure that while such children cannot be adopted in Ireland, in order to circumvent the law and to extend the possibility of a normal family life to such children in submissions made to them, the committee were &ldquo;informed that some legitimate children are being sent out of the jurisdiction &mdash; that is, out of this country &mdash; because of the present restriction on their adoption here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the members of the Adoption Review Committee who recommended that the possibility of adoption be extended to abandoned legitimate children consisted of a cross-section of persons involved with children in care, particularly the adoption services and including health administrators, social workers, an adoptive parent, legal experts, a child psychiatrist and a priest. Following publication of their report, this recommendation received widespread support from bodies and individuals interested in child welfare, including the Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies, the Adoptive Parents' Association, Cherish and the Irish Association of Social Workers.  There is consequently general agreement on the part of all those working in the child care area and, I believe, general agreement across the community that the law should be amended in the way provided for by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I now turn to outline the specific provisions of the Bill as published.  The Bill will permit in certain severely restricted circumstances the adoption of a legitimate child with a parent or parents alive or of an illegitimate child whose mother has not agreed to its placement for adoption. <Col N="1026" /> It will allow such adoptions only in those instances where for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding the time of the making of the adoption application, the parents of a child, for physical or moral reasons, have failed in their duty towards the child; that it is likely that such failure will continue without interruption until the child attains the age of 18 years and that such failure constitutes an abandonment on the part of the parents of all parental rights, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, with respect to the child.</P>
    <P>On the question of failure of duty, it will be a matter for the High Court to interpret each particular instance.  In this regard the wording of the relevant section reflects the wording of Article 42.5 of the Constitution which permits the State to supply the place of the parents in certain exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 5, inclusive, establish the procedures for the adoption of those children to whom this Bill is relevant.  The procedure outlined is as follows: persons making an application for the adoption of such a child must have had custody of the child in their home for a continuous period of not less than 12 months immediately before the making of the application. This is provided for under section 2 (1) (b). Secondly, where a child has been placed in foster care by a health board, the board must give their consent to the application for an adoption order, in accordance with section 2 (1) (d). Thirdly, the applicants must make two applications, an application to the Adoption Board for the making of an adoption order and an application to the High Court to authorise the Adoption Board to make an adoption order.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board will deal with the matter first.  They will examine the application for an adoption order using the same criteria as applies at present to normal applications.  For example, they will look at the eligibility of the proposed adoptive parents, their suitability as adopters, whether the child has successfully become part of their family and other matters of relevance.  If the Adoption <Col N="1027" /> Board are satisfied that an adoption order would be appropriate, they will make a declaration stating that they would be prepared to make such an order if the High Court approved of the application before it.</P>
    <P>The High Court then examines the matter and if it is satisfied that the parents have failed in their duty and that the failure is likely to continue without interruption until the child is 18 and that having due regard to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child it would be in the best interests of the child that an adoption order should be made, it authorises the Adoption Board to make such order.  The court will be obliged before the making of its authorisation to hear the evidence of the natural parents if they are willing to give such evidence. If their identity is unknown, of course no such evidence will be available.  If such parents refuse to give evidence or simply cannot be found, it will also be possible for the court to make the appropriate order.  It will also as far as practicable give due consideration to the wishes of the child.  This will be a matter of particular importance in the context of older children.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the High Court order the Adoption Board are empowered to make the adoption order.  If, however, in an exceptional situation, the board find that the circumstances of the prospective adopters have changed to the extent that they are no longer suitable or eligible, the board need not make the adoption order.</P>
    <P>The effect of the adoption order, as is the case in regard to all adoption orders, would be to terminate permanently the rights and duties of the natural parents in regard to the child.  Effectively the procedures I have described are laid down in sections 2 to 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for other changes. Under the present statutes a child cannot be legally adopted until he is at least six weeks old.  There is an upper age limit of seven years but the Adoption Board can, in effect set this limit aside and make an adoption order in respect of a person <Col N="1028" /> currently up to the age of 21 years.  Many such orders have been made in respect of children over seven years of age.  The new Bill will confine adoption in all future cases to single persons up to the age of 18 years, in line with the new age of majority.  There will be a transitional provision to cover applications pending under existing legislation in respect of persons up to the age of 21 years.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill seeks to provide for an equality of treatment as between men and women.  The Adoption Act, 1952 provided for widows to adopt but did not make provision for adoption orders to be made in favour of widowers. The Adoption Act, 1974 permitted widowers to adopt in certain restricted circumstances but in so far as different criteria were held to apply to widowers than applied to widows these were held by the High Court to be unconstitutional in the case of T. O'G versus the Attorney General and others, reported in <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly,</i> 1985, page 61. The provisions contained in section 7 make the necessary consequential amendments to the Adoption Acts to take into account the decision of the High Court made in this case and to place both widows and widowers in a position of equality under the Acts.  It is, of course, unusual for either a widow or a widower to adopt.  In the vast majority of instances adoption orders are made in favour of married couples.  Nevertheless, the changes proposed in this Bill bring the statutory provisions into line with the decision of the High Court in that case and remove a provision in the statutes which is at variance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 9 seeks to deal with problems which arise both under the main subject matter of this Bill and with difficulties which arise under the Adoption Act, 1974.  Section 3 of the 1974 Act currently permits prospective adopters to apply to the High Court for an order dispensing with the consent of a natural parent or guardian of a child adoptable under the existing Acts, where an agreement to place for adoption has been signed and <Col N="1029" /> such parent or guardian has either refused to consent to the making of an adoption order or has withdrawn a consent already given.  Such an order can only be made by the High Court where it is the best interests of the child.  In circumstances where a consent is either withheld or withdrawn, prospective adopters, through no fault of their own, may be forced to become involved in legal proceedings in order to finalise the adoption precess.  Since 1974 about 50 such cases have come before the High Court.  The risk of incurring legal costs may in many instances inhibit the initiation of court action under section 3 of the 1974 Act, even where such action is in the best interests of the child and where the social workers and the health board or adoption agency believe such action should be taken.</P>
    <P>While the State has in practice frequently discharged all or a portion of the legal expenses incurred by persons who have been party to such proceedings by way of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments through the Attorney General's office, following a court recommendation that the Attorney General meet such legal costs, there is at present no formal statutory provision to ensure that such costs will be discharged. The Review Committee on Adoption Services recommended that the current informal arrangement should be given a statutory basis and the provisions of this section so provide.</P>
    <P>The section also provides for legal costs incurred by applicants for adoption to be similarly discharged where an application is brought in good faith in the best interests of a child pursuant to section 2 (a) of this Bill.  Thus applicants to adopt a legitimate child in the circumstances prescribed in this Bill would be placed in a position whereby they could process the adoption application without being placed at risk of incurring large and unnecessary legal expense by having to seek a High Court authorisation to complete the adoption process.  The section further exempts adoption court proceedings from payment of court fees.  At present all such proceedings when they arise before the courts result in prospective <Col N="1030" /> adopters and natural parents of children being subjected to charges which many of them can ill afford and which I believe are indefensible in the context of court proceedings seeking to ensure that the welfare of children is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the constitutional implications of the provisions of this Bill.  The Review Committee on Adoption Services in recommending that the possibility of adoption be extended to legitimate children note that there are conflicting views as to whether to allow the adoption of such children in any circumstances of any nature whatsoever may be in violation of the Constitution. Section 2 of the Bill as drafted is designed to ensure that legitimate children will only become eligible for adoption in constitutionally permissible circumstances. The constitutional issue that arises derives from Articles 41 and 42 in which both the family and parents are stated to possess inalienable and imprescriptible rights.  It has been argued by some that if parental rights are inalienable they cannot be totally extinguished by an adoption order in any circumstances.  A contrary view, however, is that parents may by their behaviour surrender or abandon their rights to their children and where they do so the State has a duty under Article 42.5 &ldquo;to supply the place of parents&rdquo; by appropriate measures &ldquo;where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The latter view has been endorsed by Mr. Justice Walsh in the Supreme Court on the only occasion on which this specific issue has been averted to comprehensively by a member of the Irish judiciary.  In the case of G.v. An Bord Uchtála&mdash;(1978) Irish Reports&mdash;he stated:</P>
    <P>In my view there is nothing whatever in the Constitution to prevent a member of a family passing out of that family... I do not see any impediment in principle to a child's passing out of one family and becoming a member of another family in particular circumstances... <Col N="1031" /> parents are the natural guardians of the children of the family. Guardianship may be surrendered or abandoned provided that doing so does not infringe any constitutional rights of the child and is not inimical to the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>Further on, adverting to this issue, Judge Walsh said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Article 42.5 of the Constitution speaks of the case where parents fail in their duty towards their children for physical or moral reasons; it provides that the State as guardian of the common good by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  Under that section the State may very well by legislation provide for the failure of the parents, and in appropriate cases it may very well extend the law beyond simple provisions for a change of custody.  A parent may for physical or moral reasons decide to abandon his position as a parent or he or she may be deemed to have abandoned that position, a failure in parental duty may itself be evidence of such an abandonment... Where there is a complete abandonment of the parental right and duty, the State may be justified in taking measures by statute or otherwise to protect the rights of the child; these measures may include the enactment of adoption legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the basis of the view expressed by Mr. Justice Walsh not only is adoption permitted in circumstances prescribed in this Bill but I would suggest that there is a duty on the State pursuant to Article 42.5 of the Constitution to extend the possibility of adoption to such children and it is arguable that the failure of this House to do so to date is in violation of the constitutional duty imposed on it by Article 42.  In this context, the State's failure to do so to date can be seen to be in violation of the right that each legitimate child has to be part of a martial family <Col N="1032" /> and to grow up in a secure and certain environment in a family which it can call its own and with which it can identity by acquisition legally of that family's name.</P>
    <P>The only extensive reference of any nature made by the Irish Judiciary to the constitutionality of legislation permitting the adoption of legitimate children is that already referred to by Mr. Justice Walsh. It should also be noted, however, that in the recent Supreme Court decision delivered in a case entitled K.C. &amp; A.C.<i>v.</i> An Bord Uchtála (The Adoption Board) which is reported in 1985 <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i> and can also be found in 1985 <i>Irish Reports</i> under the name in re J.H. a Minor, the court accepted that the State can intervene to protect the welfare of children where there are &ldquo;compelling reasons&rdquo; for it to do so or where &ldquo;it is satisfied&rdquo; that it has been established that pursuant to Article 42.5 parents have failed in their constitutional duty towards their child.  Consequently it appears clear that the proposals contained in this Bill which seek to provide for the adoption of legitimate children within the context of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution fall fully within the parameters laid down and described by those Articles.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that any legislation providing for adoption be constitutionally sacrosanct.  It is essential that if this Bill is passed through this House and children are adopted pursuant to its provisions, no doubt can arise as to the constitutional validity of any adoption orders made pursuant to it.  Whilst I am satisfied that this Bill fully accords with the constitutional provisions laid down in Articles 41 and 42, in the light of recent experiences of this House in seeking to predict the outcome of court constitutional pronouncements, it is in the interests of ensuring a secure and certain law that upon the passage of this Bill by both the Dáil and the Seanad it be referred by the president to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution so that its constitutionality might be tested and determined.  It is to be noted that the Review Committee on the Adoption Services recommended <Col N="1033" /> that such a course of action be adopted with regard to any Bill containing measures such as that contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the context of referring to the Review Committee on Adoption Services it is worth stating that a vast number of worthwhile recommendations are contained in the report published by that committee.  This Bill seeks to implement only a small portion of those recommendations and there is no doubt that there is a need for a comprehensive overhaul of our adoption laws and adoption services taking into account the comprehensive recommendations for reform made by the review committee.  It is hoped that upon this Bill passing both this House and the Seanad and becoming law this party will have an opportunity again, through a further Private Members' Bill, to bring before this House other necessary changes required in our adoption laws.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that in reply to a Dáil question the Minister for Health on 30 April 1987 indicated that in the coming months he intends to study carefully the changes in the present adoption laws proposed by the review committee with a view to introducing appropriate amending legislation.  Any further or additional legislation that is required or any reviews that are required of the report of the review committee should not be an excuse or reason for postponing the introduction of legislation to extend the possibility of adoption of abandoned legitimate or illegitimate children as provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, like other parties in this House, attach great importance to the principle that children should, wherever possible, grow up in their natural families and that families should, where necessary, receive help to enable their children to do so.  Many parents have their children placed by health boards in residential or foster care because of emotional, financial, health or environmental difficulties of a temporary nature. The State must, of course, continue to provide such temporary care where required and do everything possible to assist families in short term difficulties <Col N="1034" /> to resolve their problem and to enable children temporarily living apart from their families to return home.  There are, however, a considerable number of children in long term residential or foster care who have long since ceased to have any relationship of any nature with their natural parents and who have to all intents and purposes lost contact with them.  Ireland is the only country in Western Europe that does not permit the adoption of such children.  I believe that no logical or rational reason can be given for refusing the possibility of adoption to an eight or nine year old child who has spent all or most of his or her childhood in care and who finds himself or herself living in a residential institution with no prospect of again returning to his or her family.  No logical or rational reason can be given for denying to a child in long term foster care the right to become a permanent part of a family caring for him or her and for denying to such child the security that adoption can extend.  I have not at any stage in this House since becoming a Member of it heard of a Member on any side of this House argue that abandoned children should for all time be confined to residential or foster care or arguing the merits of retaining the anachronistic and Dickensian approach that currently forms part of our legislation. The central provisions of this Bill extend to abandoned legitimate and abandoned illegitimate children the possibility of a secure family life in the home of adoptive parents, something that the current law at present makes impossible.  It is my hope that this Bill will have the full support of all Members of this House regardless of party.</P>

      <P>In view of the proposals in the Private Members' Bill now before us, it is obviously desirable that I should clarify for the House the Government's intention in regard to adoption legislation.  Deputies will recall that my predecessor, Deputy Desmond, introduced the Adoption Bill, 1986, last November.  It had not reached Second Stage when the Dáil was dissolved <Col N="1035" /> and it consequently lapsed.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks Deputy Shatter, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, introduced a somewhat similiar Bill &mdash; the Adoption Bill, 1987 &mdash; the Second Stage of which we are now debating.  These two Bills differ only in detail.  The main provision common to both of them permits the adoption of children without the consent of their parents or guardians in exceptional circumstances where, for example, they have been abandoned or ill-treated or where their parents are unfit to care for them.  The main group of children covered by both sets of proposals would include legitimate children with a parent or parents alive.</P>
      <P>The Government agree in principle with the proposal to provide for the adoption of legitimate children in exceptional circumstances.  This proposal was one of the principal recommendations in the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services and has been supported by a wide range of interested groups in the child care area.  I believe we are the only country in western Europe which lacks provision for the adoption of such children.  I am aware, of course, that there has been considerable hesitancy about introducing legislative change of this sort because of the fear that it might in some way be in conflict with the Constitution, particularly with those articles that protect the status of the natural family.</P>
      <P>Indeed Deputy Shatter in presenting his Bill has dealt in detail with that aspect of the legislation.  However, I am satisfied that as long as the laws permit the adoption of legitimate children only where it is clearly established that the normal child-parent relationship has ended and is unlikely to be restored there is no conflict involved.  Clearly, however, the legislation must be extremely carefully drafted to accord with the Constitution. I would be prepared to look at the suggestion of Deputy Shatter that the legislation might be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because such legislation would represent an important new social provision, <Col N="1036" /> and because great care must be taken to ensure its constitutional soundness the Government consider that it would be appropriate for them to initiate the legislation itself, rather than that it should be considered in Private Members' time.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, since I assumed office I have been examining the Bill introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Desmond and, with the Government's approval, I have decided to have a Bill prepared to revise the law on the adoption of children and to introduce it at the earliest possible date.  The Bill will, of course, require the most careful of drafting to take account of the provisions in the Constitution in relation both to the rights of the family and the rights of children.  For that reason, I shall be looking in particular at the possibility of strengthening the safeguards for the natural family contained in the original Bill.  I am also of the view that a number of comments and submissions made on the previous Bill should be carefully considered and that some of the suggestions made should be included in the new Bill.</P>
      <P>I have studied reports of the proceedings of a seminar on the Adoption Bill, 1986, which took place in Trinity College in January last.  There were many informed contributions to that seminar which are worthy of consideration.  In addition, a number of written submissions have been received by my Department.  I would like to place on record my thanks to those individuals and organisations who took the time to examine the Bill and to submit their views on it.  I am also studying their contributions in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I do not wish to anticipate the contents of my own Bill but I am anxious to help Deputy Shatter and the House by giving some indication of the options.  One change that might be made is in relation to the procedure for applying for an adoption order.  The two Bills already published provide that the foster parents, with whom a child had been <Col N="1037" /> living for a continuous period of at least one year, would apply for the necessary orders for his adoption.  I have studied the comments and submissions made on this matter and at this stage I am inclined to the view that it would be more appropriate that health boards should be the applicants in every case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would give health boards a veto over every application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also sympathetically disposed to a view which has been expressed that young married persons under 18 years of age should, where such exceptional applications might arise, be eligible for adoption.  The Bill now under discussion and its predecessor would permit the adoption of single persons only.  I feel that as it is likely that a number of applications will arise under the new Bill in respect of the adoption of teenagers and older children, that the exclusion of young married persons is unduly restrictive.</P>
      <P>An important difference between the Bill put forward by Deputy Shatter and that of the previous Government is the provision in section 9 which would empower the High Court to require the Adoption Board to meet the legal costs of applicants who take proceedings in these new cases.  This section would also charge the Adoption Board with meeting costs in certain cases arising where adoptive parents apply to the High Court for an order dispensing with the consent of a natural parent or guardian of a child adoptable under current adoption law. This is a significant new departure from existing practice which I would require time to consider and to consult with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree in principle with the general thrust of this Private Members' Bill. However, in view of the Government's intentions which I have indicated, the Deputy and his party might wish to reconsider their Bill.  I appreciate their concern and their keen interest in this matter and I would assure them that in relation to the Government's Bill I will consider all <Col N="1038" /> of their proposals as I am doing in the case of the former Government's Bill.  I would equally wish to assure the House that there will be no undue delay on my part in bringing forward a new Bill and having it placed before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at some disadvantage in responding at this stage to Deputy Shatter's contribution because I have to sort through what was the intended legislative measure and the explanatory memorandum which related thereto and I hope Deputy Shatter will not take umbrage at it.  Apart from the quite reasonable points that Deputy Shatter has now incorporated into his Bill which would involve the question of the Adoption Board meeting the legal costs of the applicants who take proceedings in the new cases, it is, of course, a replica of the Bill which was tabled before the House by both of us when we were in Government.  The new matter included in the Bill is worthy of consideration by the House on Committee Stage.  When the previous Bill was published there was widespread discussion of the provisions of the Bill and, generally speaking, it was warmly welcomed on all sides of the House and by those who are professionally involved.</P>
      <P>I shall confine my comments to one observation, that is, that within the framework of our Constitution, within the substantial constitutional advice received by the Government in the preparation of this Bill its complex provisions were framed.  It is no secret that there was great difficulty in keeping within the constraints of Article 42.5 of the Constitution. Even at that point the question of yet another referendum loomed large in the great difficulty facing the Department of Health, the legal advisers of that Department and indeed the Attorney General and his legal advisers.  There was great difficulty in reaching agreement on the very sensitive constitutional issues involved.  In the end this Bill was brought forward.  In due course it may well be that its constitutionality will be tested.  If that were to happen, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was slightly taken aback on reading <Col N="1039" /> the initial pages of Deputy Shatter's contribution. They reminded me so much of the explanatory memorandum, as published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to cavil because the important issue is that this Bill has been introduced after 15 years of agitation.  Indeed I remember writing an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> 15 years ago asking that this Bill be introduced.  What is most disturbing is the desperately slow pace of enactment of fundamental, necessary reforming legislation, such as this Bill before us this evening.  For that reason I commend Deputy Shatter on having kept the fire lighting under us and for having brought forward this Bill in Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>I know there are great pressures on the Minister at present, as there are on the staff in his Department.  I would urge him to come to a rapid conclusion in relation to the additional provision proposed by Deputy Shatter and in regard to any further thoughts he and the current Attorney General may have in relation to the procedures being proposed, procedures which have been strongly criticised as being very cumbersome but which are necessary if we are to remain within the awsome rigours of the Constitution. I have experienced great difficulty in explaining this to persons with a direct interest in adoption.  We will endeavour to remain within the rigours of the Constitution.  I am glad that Deputy Shatter in his competence has also decided that we should remain within them.  I shall be keenly interested in hearing from the other members of the legal profession in the House as to how they will judge whether we are remaining within the constraints of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and would urge the Minister to endeavour to have it enacted in 1987 &mdash; I will be as modest as that.  If there was one thing I learned from being in office it was to be very modest about one's time scales.</P>

When we resume mid-October we shall have then approximately seven weeks only to the end of the year.  I, for one, will be profoundly grateful if it has all been achieved by the end of 1987.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that Private Members' time is being put to such good use this evening.  I thank the Minister for his support of the principles of the Bill.  I thank Deputy Shatter for having brought forward the Bill in Private Members' time. His concern in relation to this fundamental issue is of very long standing. Those Members who have taken a particular interest in this Bill will have been pleased to have a fundamental airing of this reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset how utterly disappointed I am at the Minister's response to this Bill.  He seems to take the view&mdash;one often taken by people who occupy Government in this House &mdash; that unless something is initiated by the Government there is something inherently wrong in it.  To my knowledge the last two Bills challenged successfully in the Supreme Court were Bills initiated in this House and in the Seanad by Government parties, the last being that in relation to the Single European Act.  Prior to that there was the Bill permitting voting on the part of British citizens.  Both of those measures were introduced by the Government of the day, both successfully brought through this House by Government parties yet both failed on constitutional grounds or, in relation to that pertaining to the Single European Act, it being held that we were not in a position to ratify that Act.  Therefore the Minister is neither fair nor right. Indeed I do not think he believes it himself when he says he would prefer that the legislation had been initiated by him <Col N="1041" /> because of the need for careful drafting and so on.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Shatter said here this evening and what he said in his book on family law, that there is need for any legislation in this area to be brought before the Supreme Court in order to test its constitutionality.  The consequences of any adoption order being shot down as a result of this Bill, if passed, but being found to be unconstitutional, would be so horrendous for the children and families involved as to be beyond thought.  I hope that if this Bill is passed the President will see fit to refer it to the Supreme Court to clear up its constitutionality once and for all.</P>
      <P>Since we have a Government that do not have a majority it is a pity they would not take Private Members' time seriously, that they would not take the views of this House seriously, that they would not take this Bill on board and support it.  It is because so many people in Government in this country have failed to bring forward legislation of this type that it has been found necessary on many occasions in this House for individuals who are not in a position&mdash;because they are not in Government &mdash; to have to introduce Bills in Private Members' time or by whatever other means they see fit. Indeed it is a disgrace that this Government are this evening, for whatever reason, opposing this Bill.  It is not good enough for the Minister simply to say he needs more time to consider the serious matters involved.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, perhaps with the exception of one Independent Deputy, everybody else in Opposition supports legislation of this kind.  I hope all Members will be present when we vote on this matter on Wednesday week to ensure that this important Bill for children who are neglected and abondoned will receive its Second Reading and proceed to Committee Stage.  I hope that at that stage the Minister, I am others will have an opportunity of putting forward amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is a sign of the differences which exists in this House that the Minister <Col N="1042" /> seems to think that the measure is too liberal.  I take the view that the measure is far too restrictive.  I accept, however, that because of the constitutional difficulties which may be involved and the fears that are often engendered, when debates of this kind take place, by irresponsible people, some of whom like to call themselves part of the moral majority, that it may not be possible in the Ireland of 1987 to get anything more liberal through at this stage.  I regret that this is the case because there are many neglected children who will not be covered by the provisions of this Bill: children who are sent out by their parents to commit crimes; children who are allowed by their parents to roam the streets until very late hours of the night; and children who are neglected in regard to normal parental obligations. Under the provisions of this Bill these children could not be put up for adoption, could not belong to a happy and secure family and have all the things we would like to see them have.</P>
    <P>Ireland was 26 years behind England and Wales in introducing adoption laws. They were introduced in those countries in 1926 and it was not until 1952 that adoption legislation was introduced in this country.  We have come a long way since 1951 when the then Minister for Justice in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 February 1951 said: &ldquo;A law that would compel a mother to waive for all time her rights to her child would be against charity and against the common law of justice.&rdquo; I am delighted that we have come a long way but unfortunately as a result of what the Minister has said this evening we have not come far enough.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when the rights and interests of children will take precedence over their parents' rights and before = "1" = "-1"interests and when we will not have court decisions that simply seem to imply, as I understand it, that the rights of children are almost always in the interests of those children who remain with their natural parents.  I do not accept that the rights of all children exist with those children who stay with their natural parents.  I regret that some court decisions have seen fit to <Col N="1043" /> take children away from their adoptive parents.  In one case a child who had been with people for up to three years and because his or her &mdash; I do not know whether it was male or female &mdash; natural parents subsequently married that child was taken away from the people they had been living with and sent back to their natural parents.  That was done because the courts upheld that the interests of that child were best served by being with their natural parents.  That may be the case in some circumstances but I do not think it is necessarily the case that a child's best interests are served by being with their natural parents.  In that regard the remarks of Justice Walsh which are covered on page 13 of the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services are interesting.  If views of this kind were taken by more people it would lead us to a situation where more children could have the opportunity of growing up in a happy and secure family.  Justice Walsh said:</P>
    <P>Where there is a complete abandonment of the parental right and duty, the State may be justified in taking measures by statute or otherwise to protect the rights of the child.  These measures may include the enactment of adoption legislation.  It has always to be borne in mind that some inalienable rights are absolutely inalienable while others are relatively inalienable.</P>
    <P>Although those are the views of Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court they are not the views of the court, they are simply the views of one person.</P>
    <P>As we have seen with regard to the Single European Act very important decisions are made on a three to two verdict.  Since that may be the outcome in similar cases being taken as a result of this legislation it is very desirable, as Deputy Shatter said, if this Bill is passed &mdash; and I hope it is passed through this House whatever about the Seanad&mdash;that its constitutionality will be tested before any adoption orders are made on foot of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said he did not think <Col N="1044" /> it was desirable that only the adoptive parents could bring applications before the court to have the child adopted.  He seems to think that right should be vested with the health boards and that they should have the monopoly of bringing such applications before the court. That would be to deny the adoptive parents the right to apply to the court and would be extremely unfair.  It would be wrong of the Minister to allow that application to be taken by the health board. It is wrong that institutions or State agencies should be the sole judges on this matter.  It is desirable that adoptive parents who have a child living with them for a continuous period of 12 months should, if they so wish, make an application to the adoption board and subsequently to the High Court to have that child legally adopted.</P>
    <P>One of the sad features of recent life in this country is that there are so few children available for adoption. Although there has been a huge increase in the number of births to unmarried mothers, there has not been anything like a similar increase in the number of children available for adoption.  While it may be a good thing that more and more unmarried mothers are keeping their children, possibly as a result of changes in social attitudes and changes in relation to unmarried mothers' allowances and so on, as somebody who deals frequently with children and unmarried mothers I do not believe that many unmarried mothers get the kind of expert help they require during their pregnancy and subsequently when the child is born.  Although wishing to keep their children many of them give them for adoption sometimes after three years.  If there was sufficient professional help and advice available to them, which I hope could be made available to them, many of them might choose in their own interests and in the interests of the child to have that child placed for adoption at an earlier age.  Many unmarried mothers feel that the advice which they were given by friends or whoever was not adequate, they did not have the kind of professional advice required by somebody having a baby on their own and they might have <Col N="1045" /> made a different decision if they had had professional advice.  It is regrettable that that kind of professional expertise is not available to them at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Many social workers will tell you that these children are often initially neglected and subsequently end up being placed for adoption.  It is a pity that that could not be done at an earlier stage.  It is in the interests of the child in particular that they are placed for adoption at as early an age as possible.  It is easier for the child and the circumstances in which they are going to grow up.  It is also better for the adoptive parents because the younger they get a child the better it will be for them and for the relationship and the bond which will exist between the parents and the child.</P>
    <P>In relation to the technical details of this Bill, the procedures that are outlined are rather cumbersome and unnecessarily difficult.  The Bill is very restrictive. I wish that we lived in a country where we would have a more liberal form of adoption law and where we could have more legitimate children adopted than is recommended by the provisions of this Bill.  As I said earlier, I recognise the climate we live in and that there are many people who like to terrorise and frighten people by telling them that under this Bill children will be taken from the poor and given to the rich and children will be grabbed from you if you let them out of your sight.  Unfortunately that kind of mentality exists.  It is regretable that people who have this mentality get so much attention and publicity.  They end up convincing and confusing many ordinary commonsense individuals who I believe share the views I have but who, because of the presentation of arguments when these matters come up for discussion, end up getting so confused that they prefer to say, what we have is probably better than what we might have so we had better stay with what we have got.  It is regrettable that that is the case.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions which I think is unduly restrictive &mdash; and I would like to hear Deputy Shatter's comments on this when he is summing up next week&mdash;is that the onus of proof is on the adoptive <Col N="1046" /> parents to prove that it is likely the natural parents will neglect the child right up to the age of 18 years and that they will continuously neglect that child.  I think that is going to be very difficult to prove. I would prefer if the onus of proof were switched and if it were the case, for example, that the court could make an order that the child be placed for adoption, unless it were to believe in commonsense and given the facts that are available, that the parents would resume their responsibilities and that they would be good parents.  Unless the court felt that the parents would resume their responsibilities and would be good and fit parents to look after their child I think that child should be placed for adoption. This should be the case rather than the adoptive parents having to prove that they will be bad parents and will neglect the child.  I submit if parents neglect their children for two or three years that is more than adequate to cause severe damage to the child and to cause those parents to forego their rights to have that child, and to allow that child to be placed for adoption.  The 18-year period is very restrictive, and I think it will cause a lot of damage and possibly make this Bill unworkable.</P>
    <P>The couple will have to have the child living with them for a continuous period of 12 months but what will happen if the child was in hospital during this period? Would that period be included as part of the 12 months?  It may well be; I do not know.  Perhaps Deputy Shatter would like to comment on that as it is certainly not clear from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many people suggest the minimum age for adoption should be lowered from 25 years, which is recommended in this Bill, to 21 years or even younger.  I do not accept that view.  There are few children available for adoption in this country. Nowadays most people marry in their mid-twenties and by the time they have exhausted the possibility of having children of their own, having gone through the various tests and the emotional trauma attached to that, they may be in their thirties before they turn to the <Col N="1047" /> question of adoption.  I think if they are to have a fair chance to adopt a child it would be unfair and undesirable to allow 20-years olds, 21 or 22-years olds&mdash;who previously would not have been married for a long period &mdash; to have the same kind of rights.  Twenty five years is a reasonable age.  The more mature people are, the better.  I would not share the views expressed by many people that the age limit should be lowered to 21 years or even 18 years.</P>
    <P>I feel also that adoption proceedings &mdash; both the proposed and the existing proceedings under the adoption laws &mdash; should be held in a family-type court, a family tribunal or a court of that nature. Of course, we do not have such courts in this country.  This type of court is needed not only to hear adoption cases but to hear the huge number of marital breakdown cases that are now coming before our courts.  Given the adversarial nature of our courts and the fact that very often they do not have the professional expertise that is needed to deal with family disputes or cases relating to children and adoption, I think it is highly undesirable that a court of that kind would hear adoption cases.  I would prefer if we had proper family tribunals, staffed by experts such as recommended by the all-party Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown when they made recommendations two years or so ago in this House.  Those kind of courts are badly needed, not just for adoption cases but for family disputes and marital breakdown cases.  Many people have told me they would prefer to go on living in misery rather than to go before our existing court structure, because of the nature of the courts and the fact that they drive people further apart rather than bring them together.  I am sure in adoption proceedings the court structure as it exists at present is not at all adequate to deal with adoption proceedings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to legal costs. Many of the people who are concerned about this area of our law, particularly adoptive parents, have told me that one of the most difficult things they have experienced is the high cost of taking <Col N="1048" /> legal action.  I am told that the cost of the average court proceedings varies from between £3,000 to £5,000 and I understand they can go way beyond that, depending on the length of time these proceedings are before the courts.  Obviously that is out of reach of the average person.  I think it is undesirable that it should be out of the reach of the average person and, therefore, I support what Deputy Shatter says in relation to having legal cost paid by the Attorney General's office or whatever.  At present this is done on a purely voluntary basis when the court so recommends.  I would like to think in all cases where couples cannot afford to pay for legal proceedings that a lenient and liberal view would be taken of their means and costs would be awarded to them on a statutory basis rather than the voluntary basis that exists at the moment.  Because of the prohibitive costs involved there are many people who would not be in a position to establish through the court procedure their right to adoption.</P>
    <P>In this Bill Deputy Shatter places widowers on the same footing as widows and I agree with that.  I do not support any legislation that discriminates against a person on the basis of their sex.  I feel it is a pity, however, that he did not place the natural father who is not married to the natural mother on the same basis as the natural mother.  I know this is a contentious issue but where such natural fathers exercise their rights in cases where their paternity has been established and their rights have been vested in them as a result of a court order, they should have to give permission, on the same basis as the natural mother, before their child is adopted.  I do not think it is fair or reasonable to continue with a procedure that discriminates against a person on the basis of their sex.  I think it is desirable, in so far as it is possible, that all natural fathers of children would exercise their rights and responsibilities to their children and would not run away and simply neglect their rights as they do at present.  Indeed when they do, we should make a greater effort to pursue such people and try to establish the <Col N="1049" /> fathers of such children and make them responsible rather than have all these responsibilities turned over to the State as happens in many cases.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to return to the comments made in this House this evening by the Minister for Health.  I am sure when his views are known outside this House they will cause the same disturbance as they caused inside this House.  It is a pity he is missing this opportunity and that he is going to put this legislation on the long finger.  I have no doubt, despite what was said earlier, that it will be many months&mdash; indeed it may well be years; it may not even be in the lifetime of this Government&mdash;before we see similar legislation through this House again.  We are missing an opportunity; we are being small-minded and petty simply because the Bill is being introduced in Private Members' time.  Deputy Desmond referred to the fact that in about six weeks' time we will be adjourning for the summer recess.  I disagree with that too, because I think we should have more regular and longer sittings of this House.  It is appalling that we will adjourn perhaps at the end of June and not reconvene until the middle of October when there is important legislation of this kind, and legislation in other areas, which remains to be done.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied that it is not simply a question of this Bill being a Private Members' Bill which is preventing the Minister from supporting it in this House this evening.  No doubt he will ensure that all his Deputies are whipped into line next week, despite the great sentiments expressed by many of them during the past few years, to vote down very reasonable and fair legislation. This legislation would help many of our abandoned and neglected children and would show them that the politicians were concerned about their rights and their welfare.  It is appalling in 1987 that so few people are concerned about such children simply because they are voiceless <Col N="1050" /> and do not have political clout.  They are not in a position to lobby outside the gate or send nicely written letters to their representatives but nonetheless their rights are very important and for too long they have been neglected.</P>
      <P>To night we have heard from a Government who are prepared to put this legislation on the long finger with the excuse that it might be unconstitutional or whatever. There is only one way of testing the constitutionality of this Bill or any other Bill.  No matter what Bill is introduced on this topic, it should be tested because it is very important that the constitutionality of such legislation be established before any adoption orders are made under it.  It is highly undersirable that the Government and the Minister are taking the attitude they are adopting here tonight.  During the course of the referendum debate on divorce last year many Deputies said they would bring in all kinds of legislation relating to children and material breakdown and would do everything to show they were caring.  I do not believe those words either because, like this legislation, that will prove to be difficult.  If it can be avoided and swept under the carpet that is what will happen because that is what happened for the last 15 or 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a suggestion in relation to 18-year-olds and under who might be married.  He felt that only single people should be affected by this legislation. I do not believe that under 18-year-olds should be married but in the exceptional circumstances where they are married &mdash; where, presumably they have established their own identity and are obviously in a position to look after themselves and have a family of their own &mdash; it is ludicrous they should be the subject of adoption proceedings.  I have no doubt that one such exceptional case might exist somewhere in the country where somebody would like to have his or her identity sorted out but to use that, as the Minister did tonight, is a poor, weak and very strange excuse.  Neither the Minister nor anybody in his Department could argue seriously that the provisions of this Bill <Col N="1051" /> should be extended to married persons.</P>
    <P>When the Task Force on Child Care Services reported two years ago they stated:</P>
    <P>The universal devotion of parents to their children is one of the strongest bonds known to the human race.  It is as unlikely to be weakened by permitting legal adoption as it is to be strengthened by prohibiting it.</P>
    <P>I agree with them.  The Review Committee on Adoption Services stated:</P>
    <P>In our view adoption should be one of the options available to provide care for all children, whether they are born in or out of wedlock, who cannot grow up in their natural families.  We have found general support for that view in the submissions received by us.  In all the circumstances that we have considered we recommend that all children should be eligible for adoption irrespective of the marital status of their parents.</P>
    <P>They also gave an interesting statistic but as it is two years out of date the situation may well have changed.  They said there were 250 legitimate children in long term foster care in this country &mdash; in foster care for at least five years &mdash; and that there were 650 children in health board residential care.  That is a total of 900 children but the number may now have risen to 1,000.  We are talking about 1,000 Irish children who have been neglected in some cases, abandoned in other cases and whose parents are not known in some cases.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter for introducing this Bill and for giving us an opportunity to debate it.  I, like others, could find plenty of things wrong with it if I wanted to or if I was so disposed to opposing it as the Minister is.  We in the Progressive Democrats support the rights of these children.  We will support the Bill and seek that it passes Second Stage and goes into Committee Stage.  We will seek to amend the Bill, to try to have it less restrictive and less cumbersome.  We will try to ensure above all else that the <Col N="1052" /> rights of these children take precedence and to that end we will do whatever we can subject to the Constitution.  Though it might be nice to do so, I would not recommend, in the present climate and only such a short time after the last referendum which dealt with an area not too far removed from this one, another referendum in the near future because I know what the result would be.  We would be told that we were taking children from the poor to give them to the rich.  People might think their children would be grabbed from them.  I do not wish that kind of debate ever to occur again.  I hope that attitudes may change and that people may become more sensible but having heard some of the remarks made in the course of the debate on the coming referendum I do not see any maturity on the part of some people and I certainly do not see much by way of changing attitudes.</P>
    <P>The Review Committee on Adoption Services made many excellent recommendations. It is a pity this Bill does not take more of them on board.  Greater care should be taken by the Department of Health to ensure that societies registered for the purposes of adopting children apply uniform standards, that those societies have expert professional people working with them, for example, that they would all have as a minimum a qualified social worker and that the same standards would apply across the board to all such societies.  In many of the submissions made to the Review Committee on Adoption Services there is criticism, the fact that in many cases the standards were very low.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I spoke with some people working in this area and they told me they are not taking any more applications for this year.  As far as they were aware the same applies to almost all adoption societies.  It is sad, when so many couples are available to adopt children, to give them a secure and stable home, that Members of this House will not see fit to pass even the Second Stage of this legislation and allow possibly only 1,000 more Irish children to be placed successfully for adoption and to be given <Col N="1053" /> the benefit of growing up in a stable family environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be afforded the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Private Members' Adoption Bill.  The introduction of legal adoption was undoubtedly one of the landmarks in the evolution of our social services during the last few decades.  I have no doubt that it has been an influence for enormous good in our society.  I am sure that the happiness it has brought to children &mdash; over 34,000 children have been adopted since the first Adoption Act in 1952 &mdash; and to their adoptive parents is incalculable.  There is no doubt at all that legal adoption has been beneficial and I consider it most appropriate that the Government should bring forward a proposal, which has already been outlined by the Minister for Health, to extend the circumstances in which children may be adopted.</P>
      <P>I think it would be true to say that over the 35 years since the introduction of legal adoption there has been a shift in emphasis in its philosophical basis. Initially the main thrust in the development of our policies came from a desire to help parents who had no children of their own and also to help the unmarried mother who did not wish or was unable due to various circumstances, to retain her child.  The new laws, commencing with the 1952 Act, which were then necessary, dealt with fundamental issues affecting the individual and the family and it was thought appropriate that the Minister for Justice should introduce the necessary supportive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now 35 years down the road we are still, of course, concerned about helping the childless couple and the unmarried mother but we are giving much greater emphasis to the needs and happiness of the child himself or herself.  Child care and welfare policies are now the main considerations in framing recommendations or legislation and this is reflected in the fact that responsibility for the adoption services was transferred <Col N="1054" /> from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health in 1983.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, One of Deputy Desmond's first decisions in relation to adoption, was to establish a review committee to consider the adoption services, responsibility for which had been passed to him.  The review committee, chaired by a senior official in the Department of Health, included representatives of the health services, legal profession, adoptive parents and the Adoption Board. The committee's report, which was published in 1984, was the first comprehensive review of the operation of the adoption system since legal adoption was introduced.  I compliment Deputy Desmond for initiating such a valuable report and of course we are all indebted to the members of the review committee for their thorough and professional approach to their task.  The method they adopted and the report they brought forward was speedy and effective.</P>
    <P>The report dealt with all aspects of the existing laws and procedures in relation to adoption and contained a number of recommendations which would radically alter the structure of the present system. The report will be the subject of careful consideration by the Minister for Health and myself in the coming months.  Our examination will, of course, take account of the many constructive and helpful submissions on the report made to my Department by a wide range of interested organisations.  We will also take into account the many speeches made on this Bill this evening and the discussion which will take place on Second Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations of the report related to the extension of eligibility for adoption to legitimate children with parents alive.  The former Government introduced an adoption Bill, last November to extend the circumstances in which children could be adopted to permit in exceptional cases the adoption of legitimate children.  The decision to proceed initially with this particular recommendation of the review <Col N="1055" /> committee was, I feel, wholly appropriate given the various complex constitutional issues surrounding the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already explained to the House that the Government agree in principle with the proposal to provide for the adoption of legitimate children in exceptional circumstances and I emphasise &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.  This, of course, is also the basic principle of Deputy Shatter's Private Member's Adoption Bill, 1987.  However, I am in full agreement with the Minister's submission to the House that because such legislation would represent an important new social provision and because great care must be taken to ensure its constitutional soundness, the Government consider it would be appropriate for them to initiate the legislation itself rather than that it should be considered in Private Members' time.  The Minister and I have been examining the Bill introduced by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Minister has been working on this legislation and, as the House is aware, the Department of Health have been extremely busy since the new Government took office.  Not a week has passed without the Minister or myself being active in some debate on the working of the Department.  This is a relatively small Department.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter who put so much time into preparing this legislation.  I know from experience that it is a very considered move to bring forward Private Members' legislation.  When Deputy Mitchell was Minister for Communications I was disappointed he was not prepared to accept our Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, this is a relatively small Department employing roughly 300 people, and since we came into office some weeks ago we have had so many demands on our time that it has not been possible to give this matter the full consideration it should be given.  Because this legislation is so sensitive, it is vitally important that it be scrutinised rigorously by the Department, the legal officers and the Government to ensure that what we bring forward is constitutional.</P>

      <P>The differences is that we have a new Government who must make up their minds on all legislation.  We are not tied to legislation brought forward by a previous administration, and the Opposition are aware of that.  It is only right and proper that the present Fianna Fáil Government should have an opportunity to carefully consider every aspect of this very important legislation.  In fairness to this legislation and to this House, I do not believe it should be rushed through or that we should think it must be passed in a very short time because it has major implications for legitimate children in difficult circumstances.  As Deputy Harney said, these children do not have their own political lobby.  We have to be conscious of the rights of children and the rights of parents when we are putting legislation through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that it will be necessary to <Col N="1057" /> consider carefully various options in the light of the submissions received in my Department since the Bill's publication. The Government accordingly have agreed to have a Bill prepared to revise the law on the adoption of children and to introduce it at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given the House a general outline of the options that might be incorporated in the Government's Bill.  For my own part, at this stage I would just wish to emphasise that our policy in the Department of Health is that every child should be brought up in his or her own family.  Nothing in our present policies or our proposals for the future diminishes that principle.  Every thoughtful and informed person involved with the child care services recognised the incomparable benefits of a family upbringing.  The main thrust of future developments will, therefore, be to provide family support services which will prevent or diminish the need for parents to part with their children on either a short term or long term basis.  There are, unfortunately, and will continue to be, unhappy, abused and neglected children from inadequate and broken families with multiple problems.  The State, representing our collective responsibility as citizens, has an obligation to seek a secure and happier future for such children.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls over the years for changes in the adoption laws to enable the adoption of children born within marriage who, for varying reasons, have been separated from or abandoned by parents who are unlikely to resume, or are incapable of resuming, their parental role.  Most of these children would at present be in the care of health boards and would be either with foster parents or in residential children's homes.  Some of the children would, however, have been placed previously with friends or relatives and would be unlikely to have come to the attention of the public child care system.</P>
    <P>The legislation which the Government intend to introduce shortly is not intended in any way to deter families in <Col N="1058" /> genuine difficulty seeking to have their children cared for temporarily either in a residential setting or with a foster family. The proposed legislation will only be appropriate in a small number of cases where all hopes of reconciliation between a child and his parents have been lost.</P>
    <P>The great majority of children placed in care will be reunited with their parents. This is the aim of the health boards and those caring for children.  However, where a child has no prospect of returning to his natural parents, his foster parents will now have an opportunity of offering the child integration within their own family.  This is of paramount importance. Like most Deputies, I am frustrated if there are delays in bringing forward legislation, especially when in Opposition. When one is interested in a particular subject, and one would like to see things moving faster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We would be concerned about the constitutional challenge to the legislation because it could be defective. Even though Deputy Shatter is a lawyer, the services available in my Department are far superior to anything he may have at this disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to discuss the threatened closure of the County and City Infirmary, Waterford city and Lismore District Hospital in west Waterford.  I was disappointed earlier this afternoon when you disallowed the Private Notice Question I tabled on the grounds that in accordance with Standing Orders there was no urgency attached to this issue.  However, there is great urgency in this matter particularly with regard to the threat to close the District Hospital, Lismore.</P>
      <P>These two hospitals are situated in the region of the South Eastern Health Board but they are quite different in their form of financing.  The District Hospital, Lismore, is financed totally by the South Eastern Health Board and the County and City Infirmary is financed by a direct subvention from the Department of Health.  My collegues, the people of Waterford and I take an extremely serious view of what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the District Hospital, Lismore, the urgency is all the greater because of the fact that a special meeting of the South Eastern Health Board has been called for Thursday, 7 May in an <Col N="1060" /> effort &mdash; I believe &mdash; to rescind or reverse the decision taken by the board last week whereby 14 of the 27 members present voted against the proposals put forward by the chief executive officer.  In other words, the closure of five hospitals in the area, including Lismore, was averted by a 14-13 vote.  As we know from reading the newspapers at the weekend, Deputy M. J. Nolan, from the Kilkenny-Carlow constituency, was summoned by the Taoiseach and apparently castigated for not having supported the proposals of the chief executive officer.  Certain moves are afoot at present to reverse that decision which would mean the death knell for Lismore District Hospital.  My colleague, Deputy Desmond, said that this is surgery of another kind.</P>
    <P>During our period in Government we had to make terribly difficult decisions. We made cutbacks in the health service and we accepted that in line with overall cutbacks in public expenditure.  I am not running away from that but it is a case of how it is done.  I maintain that the present proposals are draconian and should not be entertained.  The Minister for Health should ensure that savings are made without closing hospitals which are essential for the old, the infirm and the sick.  I know that you, a Cheann Comhairle, are familiar with the terrain of west Waterford and that you know how central Lismore is to that region.  It will be traumatic for the elderly people in the area if their local hospital is to be taken from them. The District Hospital in Dungarvan, the closest to them, will not be able to cater for them and it is quite likely that they will be hospitalised in Waterford city which, for many, is 40 or 50 miles away. Their relatives or friends will not be able to visit them, which is an awful thought.</P>
    <P>I visited Lismore District Hospital yesterday and the fear of closure had to be witnessed to be believed.  There are 21 beds in the hospital which are all occupied so it is not a question of low bed occupancy. I ask the Minister to ensure that the health board make cuts in a way which will ease the pain and trauma to which I referred.  I was a member of the <Col N="1061" /> South-Eastern Health Board for three-and-a-half years and, as a result, I am very doubtful as to the value of health boards.  I often wonder whether it was wise to move away from the old health authorities which had much greater local autonomy.  While health boards may seem to be a money saving device because of rationalisation, getting rid of duplication and so on, they have not worked out for the best.  I am told that spending on the health services at present is three times greater in real terms than it was in 1973.  However, the quality of service has not improved and if these cuts are implemented the cost will be reduced slightly but the hospital services will be reduced by 100 per cent in some cases, like Lismore.</P>
    <P>I will endeavour to give Deputy Cullen an opportunity to contribute if the Ceann Comhairle agrees.  The meeting of the health board on Thursday in Kilkenny is very important and I hope that a decision to close Lismore Hospital and others will not be taken.  Who is making these decisions?  Must they be as drastic as those required by some members of this board, the chief executive officer and his officials?  Is this the way to go about it? Must they put hundreds of people out of work?  Could they make cuts in administration? Could they do what has been suggested in Dublin over the last few days and look for a cut in working hours? Could they get people to work for one day a month without pay, thereby effecting the cuts?  I do not want to be cynical about the matter but the slogan at the election said that there is a better way. There must be a better way than closing essential hospitals.  Have other avenues been explored?  I have very serious reservations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The hospital in Lismore has a budget of about £250,000 per annum.  Can someone tell me what the saving would be if that hospital was closed and the patients transferred elsewhere?  The fact is that they cannot be accommodated elsewhere. Therefore, extra accommodation will have to be built wherever they are to be taken in, be it Waterford city or Cork city as some of the patients in Lismore <Col N="1062" /> County Hospital come from the eastern parts of County Cork.</P>
    <P>Is there going to be any saving?  I do not believe there will be and I would like to see the economics worked out.  Could it be that it is proposed to close a hospital with no money being saved, and with people having to go through the terrible suffering and pain of not knowing where they are going to be sent, which could be so far away that their relatives and friends may not be able to visit them.  I would like to have it explained how the savings are going to come about before something awful is done such as closing this hospital.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the County and City Infirmary in Waterford.  That hospital has its origins as far back as the 15th century. It is situated in its present location for the past 100 years.  It has a staff of 100 people and at any one time there could be up to 40 trainee nurses.  It is primarily an acute medical and surgical unit.  It carries out one-third of all operations in the greater Waterford area and together with Ardkeen General Hospital carries out all the surgical operations in the greater Waterford area.  At present, Ardkeen is working to its maximum and cannot carry out any more surgical operations as it is at present constituted. Where are those extra operations to be carried out?  Last year, there were 1,600 surgical operations carried out.  The surgical unit in Ardkeen is working to full capacity.  Therefore, I am asking where are those 1,600 operations going to take place?  Can money be saved by transfering the patients to Kilkenny, Kilcreene, Dublin or Cork?  I do not believe so.  It is false economy.</P>
    <P>Let me point out the background to the threatened closure of the County and City Infirmary.  Its allocation for 1987 as notified by the Department of Health is £1,065 million which is a reduction of £339,000 over 1986.  In percentage terms, that is a reduction of 24.1 per cent.  We have all read about reductions in the allocations to voluntary hospitals in other parts of the country, primarily in Dublin and Cork.  The North Infirmary in Cork has been particularly highlighted but <Col N="1063" /> none of the hospitals which I have seen highlighted has had a percentage cut in its allocation as great as 24.1 per cent. That is the percentage cut which is being sought in the case of the County and City Infirmary in Waterford.  To make matters worse, the infirmary is one of the few hospitals in the country which has year after year in recent times when cutbacks have been the order of the day conformed with the financial expenditure limits put on it by the Department of Health.  What do they get for good housekeeping?  They receive a savage cut in their allocation for 1987.  The injustice of it defies understanding and description.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that there is no alternative accommodation or personnel available for additional surgical operations in Ardkeen and there will not be for perhaps another seven or eight years. The new hospital at Ardkeen which was so badly needed only commenced operations four months ago and the hospital will not be fully completed for seven or eight years.  I could see the rationale of amalgamating the two hospitals and having all surgical operations carried out in one unit when the new general hospital at Ardkeen was completed, but at this stage I cannot see the sense of it and I do not believe there is any sense to it.  I ask the Minister to use a bit of commonsense and stop making false economies and pretending he can save £339,000 by just a stroke of a pen.  He cannot do it.</P>
    <P>If that hospital closes, which it almost certainly will as it cannot bear the brunt of a cut of 24.1 per cent on top of all the other cuts it has had to endure during the past number of years, the Minister will not save that kind of money if the patients have to be transferred to Cork, Kilcrene or Dublin.  It will probably cost him more. I would plead with the Minister to examine closely the case of the County and City Infirmary again and see that it gets a fair deal, which it is not getting at present.  The overall cut in the budget of the South-Eastern Health Board is 7 per cent.  Why should the infirmary in Waterford have to suffer a cut of 24.1 per cent? I ask the Minister to see to it that hospitals <Col N="1064" /> which are badly needed are not allowed to close because if those cuts are maintained they will have no option but to close.  Find those savings somewhere else.  There must be a better way.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank my colleague from Waterford, Deputy Deasy, for allowing me some of his time to speak on the Adjournment.  Last week, during the debate on a motion on Health, I had the opportunity of raising the matter of the County and City Infirmary.  One of the most important points in connection with that hospital is that in the Waterford area, it is an integral part of the general medical services provided there.  As Deputy Deasy has pointed out, there are three or four joint Departments being run between the infirmary and Ardkeen hospitals.  For instance, if the infirmary in Waterford is forced to close, and with these draconian cuts it could be, Ardkeen hospital would have 40 surgical beds to service a catchment area of 110,000 people.  Nowhere throughout Europe or anywhere in the civilised world today is that kind of service being made available.  That type of cut is putting our medical services in that area back 40 or 50 years.  It is nothing short of disgraceful.  I cannot believe the Minister took that fact into account when the decision to cut the allocation by 24.1 per cent was made.</P>
      <P>The infirmary is the only hospital in the area which provides a cancer treatment clinic which is run under the auspices of St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin.  Where are these people supposed to be treated? Where are the beds going to be provided? It has been pointed out that the county and city infirmary is one of the few hospitals which kept to its budget and worked in conjuction with the Department of Health in ensuring that the necessary direction was taken with regard to the spending of the moneys allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, Lismore County Hospital is the only hospital in that area.  If that hospital closes, where will those people get hospital beds?  If they have to move into Waterford city, it will entail a 60 mile drive and these are old people.  How will <Col N="1065" /> their spouses be able to travel to visit these people?  In effect, the Minister is locking them away from the local community in which they have lived all their lives, shutting them off from those who know them and making it impossible for their relatives and friends to visit them and give their lives any meaning in their latter years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met both the chief executive officers of the health boards and the chairman of the voluntary hospitals on 2 and 8 April to communicate to them their approved expenditure allocations in respect of 1987.  On those occasions I asked them to convey to my Department their proposals for the management of the health boards and the hospitals within the approved allocations.</P>
      <P>The County and City Infirmary, Waterford, is a voluntary hospital which is funded directly by my Department on behalf of the South Eastern Health Board.  The hospital provides a service in the specialties of general medicine and general surgery.  There is a joint department of surgery between the infirmary and Ardkeen Regional Hospital with three full time consultant surgeons who have a 33 per cent commitment to the infirmary.  The hospital also has one part time consultant physician, who has a 50 per cent commitment to Ardkeen.  Apart from these consultants the hospital has a total of 98 staff and has 76 beds.</P>
      <P>The infirmary's 1987 notified allocation is £1.065 million.  Officials from my Department met hospital management today to discuss options in relation to the hospital's 1987 budgetary proposals and any service measures required to meet this budget.  I understand that the board of the infirmary intend to meet tonight to discuss these proposals in detail.  It is expected that the hospital will furnish my Department with a submission on its considered proposals in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the hospital board are currently considering the matter, I must await receipt of their proposals before I can make any statement about how the <Col N="1066" /> hospital's 1987 approved expenditure allocation will affect the services provided by the hospital.</P>
    <P>However, the County and City Infirmary is only one of three acute hospitals in Waterford city.  The major centre is Ardkeen Regional Hospital which currently has 299 beds.  A completely new hospital is in the course of construction.  When completed it will contain 424 beds and be a modern regional hospital providing a full range of medical specialties.  So the hospital services available to the country and city of Waterford are not just being maintained, but are being developed and improved.</P>
    <P>Lismore District Hospital is situated in west County Waterford and has a total of 21 beds and a staff of about 13.  The bulk of its patients are long stay patients and the net budget for the hospital for 1986 was £0.16 million.</P>
    <P>Having received details of its allocation for 1987 of £92.2 million, the South Eastern Health Board discussed proposals to reduce services and costs to remain within this allocation.  That was at a special meeting on 30 April 1987.  These proposals included the closure of five district hospitals as inpatient centres, at a saving of £1.85 million.  Lismore is one of these district hospitals.  However, under this plan Lismore, with some of the others, will continue to provide day care facilities.  It is proposed that permanent staff working in the hospitals to be closed will as far as possible be offered posts in other nearby hospitals in replacement of temporary staff whose employment will be discontinued.</P>

      <P>However, these proposals were rejected by one vote at the meeting on 30 April 1987 and the board intend to hold another special meeting on 7 May 1987 to reconsider them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the board agree on their proposals and submit them to me I am accordingly not in a position to make any <Col N="1067" /> statement about the future of Lismore District Hospital.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has always had as one of its primary aims the provision of assistance and support towards the promotion of Ireland's economic interests abroad especially through the promotion of foreign earnings, a concept which embraces the attraction of foreign investment to Ireland and the development of foreign markets for the export of goods and services.  The degree and level of the Department's involvement <Col N="874" />&mdash; primarily through its embassies and diplomatic officers posted abroad &mdash; varies in accordance with different conditions and circumstances prevailing in various foreign countries and could depend on the nature of another country's economy, be it developed, State trading or developing, and the presence or not of officers of semi-State bodies in any particular country.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that constraints on financial resources require that maximum utilisation be made of existing resources and that efforts must in the first instance be focused on areas which can have the greatest return for minimum outlay.  With these objectives in mind my Department is actively conducting a review of its resources and considering in consultation with other Departments what changes may be necessary.</P>

      <P>The land holding in question did not appear on the classification list compiled by the Farm Tax Commissioner for County Waterford and sent to Waterford County Council in September 1986.  This was the first and only issue of a farm classification list as the Government have decided that farm tax is to be discontinued. Accordingly, the Commissioner has not determined the adjusted acreage of any further holdings and it is not intended to publish details of any reports made on holdings by the Commissioner's staff.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has, at present, gross fees (i.e. including VAT) outstanding in the amount of £570,414.07.  The breakdown of figures below represents amounts claimed by 43 consultants.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Office of Public Works to discharge claims for fees as quickly as possible in fulfilment of their obligations to consultants and to avoid carry forward of balances from year to year.  In the normal course accounts are cleared within a matter of weeks.  All of the figures listed below which are outstanding for more than one month are under query or are disputed and in some cases settlements will be substantially less than the amount claimed.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes has not yet received an application for a repayment of tax for 1986-87 from the taxpayer.  The question of the taxpayer's entitlement to a refund of tax for 1986-87 now falls to be determined by way of a review of his liability for that year.  The inspector has recently requested from the taxpayer's agents the information necessary to carry out the review.  On receipt of the required information the review will be carried out and any refund found to be due will be made.</P>

      <P>Health contributions and levies payable by full time farmers for years up to and including 1983-84 are collectable by health boards.

The South Eastern Health Board provided the information at Table B.

    <P>With regard to the information provided by the South Eastern Health Board at Table B, I have been advised (1) that the board are unable to indicate the <Col N="882" /> number of farmers in arrears on an annual basis, but that as at 7 April 1987 there were 3,294 farmers with outstanding balances in respect of health contributions and the levies, and (ii) no demands were issued by the health boards in 1983 for health contributions and the levies because of problems associated with the change over to a revised system of assessment.  The collection position is reflected in the low levels of payments received in that year.</P>

The number of temporary guide-information officers employed by the Commissioners of Public Works in 1986 was 106 and the corresponding figure for 1987 will be 109. This includes four temporary guide-information officers for Clonmacnoise, County Offaly and six for Cahir Castle, County Tipperary but does not include the 15 part time guides engaged at Kilmainham Gaol which was taken over by the Office of Public Works in 1986.</P>

    <P>The site for the new clubhouse was chosen following consultation between the Department of the Marine, who sponsored the development scheme, the Office of Public Works, Howth Yacht Club and the Planning Authority.  The choice of design of the building was a matter for the yacht club subject to the requirements of the Planning Authority. The site has been leased by the Office of <Col N="886" /> Public Works to the Yacht Club at a rent which takes fully into account the cost of the site and which is subject to periodic review; no public moneys have been made available for the construction of the premises.  In these circumstances, questions relative to access to the club and membership fees did not arise.</P>

      <P>Following a review of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned in September 1986, his means which had hitherto been assessed at nil, were reassessed at £61.75 a week.  His means were derived from the benefit of his wife's earnings.  This reassessment resulted in the reduction of his unemployment assistance from £87.60 to £25.85 a week.</P>
      <P>Resulting from the implementation in November 1986 of the second phase of the EC Directive on equal treatment for men and women in social welfare matters his payment was further reduced.  This arose because his wife works and is earning more than £50 a week and he is no longer entitled to an adult dependant allowance in respect of her.</P>
      <P>Thus his entitlement from 19 November 1986 was £17.75.  This comprised a personal rate of £35.50 plus half the appropriate child dependant increase in respect of three children, £13.15, a total of £48.65, less half the means, £30.90 (i.e. £61.75 divided by 2).</P>
      <P>Following the implementation of alleviation measures aimed at cushioning the losses to claimants arising from the new equality provisions the unemployment assistance rate of the person concerned was restored to the pre-equality rate of £25.85 in December 1986. Arrears amounting to £47.35, effective from 19 November 1986 were paid on 9 December 1986.  Further payments at this rate will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation governing the scheme of disability benefits provides that <Col N="900" /> persons may be disqualified for receiving benefit for up to nine weeks if they fail to observe certain prescribed rules of behaviour.  These rules are a necessary part of the Department's control procedures to ensure that there is no misuse of public funds.  The rules are reasonable ones which generally require persons on disability benefit not to engage in work, to follow their doctor's orders, to refrain from behaviour which would delay their recovery, not to unreasonably refuse to see the Department's sickness visitor and, if they are away from home when the sickness visitor calls, to leave word where they may be found.</P>
      <P>When a sickness visitor calls and the person is out a special card is left indicating the call took place and that the visitor will call again.  The rules of behaviour are set out on the card and it is also pointed our that failure to observe these rules could lead to payment being disallowed.  A sickness visitor called to the person's home on 20 February 1987, 10 March 1987 and 20 March 1987 but on each occasion she was absent without having left word as to where she could be found.  Accordingly payment was disallowed for a period of nine weeks from 13 April 1987 to 13 June 1987.</P>
      <P>While the person concerned was thus made aware on each occasion that an officer had called, there does not appear to have been any explanation forthcoming from her for her absence until her benefit was disallowed even though a month elapsed between the first and third visit.  She then apparently called to the employment exchange to see the officer concerned who advised her to submit her explanation in writing to the Disability Benefits Branch in Dublin.</P>
      <P>A letter was then received from her appealing against the decision to disallow payment and she was issued with a form on which to set out the grounds for appeal if she wished her case to be submitted to an appeals officer.  This form was issued on 24 April 1987 and the case will be reviewed when it is returned.</P>

      <P>A claim for unemployment assistance from a person who is pursuing an education course, whether the course is full time or part time is considered by reference to the legislation governing that scheme.  It is a statutory condition for entitlement to unemployment assistance that the claimant, in addition to the requirement of having to satisfy a means test, must also be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Each claim is considered on its merits and is determined by a statutorily appointed deciding officer.</P>
      <P>Fulltime attendance by day at a course of education is generally not regarded as consistent with the requirement of being available for employment during the academic year.</P>
      <P>However, within the limits of the legislation there is a considerable degree of scope for persons other than full time day students to engage in educational courses without affecting their entitlements.  Persons engaged in part time courses who are trying to improve their prospects of employment would generally be able to fulfil the availability for work condition.</P>
      <P>Similarly, unemployed people who attended evening classes or those who do not attend an educational institution but who present themselves for examination could also be eligible for unemployment assistance, provided always that they can show that they are making continuing efforts to secure employment and that the course being pursued does not unduly restrict them in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 to 71, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Nineteen persons were employed in the operation of the National Linkage Programme during 1986 and the total operating cost, which was borne by the State agencies participating, was £552,000.  The programme is solely concerned with the development of trade between Irish sub-suppliers and multinational companies based in Ireland and with improving sub-suppliers' competitiveness in export markets.  It is estimated that in 1986 approximately £40 million worth of additional business was won by Irish sub-suppliers as a result of the programme but information as to the number of jobs directly created as a result of the programme is not available.</P>
      <P>The marketing activities of the Irish Goods Council include the general promotion of industrial products and components of the home market by way of a sourcing service, exhibitions and other marketing activities.  Close liaison is maintained between the council and the National Linkage Programme to ensure that no overlaps in their separate but complementary activities occur.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether any rationalisation of these activities is necessary will be considered in the agency rationalisation review proposed in the recently published Review of Industrial Performance 1986.</P>

      <P>Ireland has submitted two separate recommendations for consideration at the June 1987 meeting of the Paris Commission dealing with the prevention of marine pollution from land based sources. The effect of the recommendations is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  The Contracting Parties, while respecting the system of dose limitation recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, declare their firm intention to use the best available technology in order to minimise and eliminate as soon as possible radioactive discharges from all nuclear industries, including reprocessing plants, into the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> (b)  The Contracting Parties recommend that the BNFL nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield should be closed and that waste already on site should be stored and managed in a safe condition in order to prevent the occurrence of any incident which would result in serious pollution of the Irish Sea and any other maritime areas within the scope of the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are currently in hand to convey to Contracting Parties to the Convention the concerns of the Irish Government which are the basis of the recommendations submitted by Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.  The Government consider that nuclear-powered electricity generation, as developed and operated to date, presents unacceptable risks to the public and that the operation of nuclear facilities associated with such forms of electricity generation should be phased out.  The Government firmly believe that every country has the right to be free from radioactive contamination arising from nuclear operations in another country and free from the threat of a nuclear accident in another country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> Ireland, as a member of the European Communities, is involved in the programme of research on controlled thermonuclear fusion, of which the JET programme is an element.  The generation of electricity from fusion is not expected to be technologically proven until the middle of the next century.  As the concept is unlike that of nuclear fission there are grounds to suggest that the generation of electricity from fusion would not entail the unacceptable risks that are associated at present with electricity generation from nuclear fission.</P>
    <P>As regard the pebble bed form of nuclear fission, I understand that there is no large industrial scale example of this design in operation.  Accordingly, it is premature to make a judgment on whether the risks associated with electricity generation based on this form of nuclear fission are acceptable.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic Acts, where a person is convicted of an offence and is disqualified from holding a driving licence, the court must by order direct that particulars of the conviction and the disqualification order be endorsed on the driving licence held by that person, or if <Col N="915" /> he is not the holder of a driving licence, but subsequently a driving licence is granted to him, on that driving licence. The Acts also provide that an endorsement must remain on a driving licence, and on any subsequent licence, for a period of not less than three years from the date of the endorsement, provided there is no break between the expiry date of one licence and the commencement date of the next one; otherwise the endorsement remains on the licence for a series of discontinuous periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years.</P>
      <P>I understand from Limerick corporation that the person referred to by the Deputy was disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of three years from 31 March 1984 to 30 March 1987.  He was granted a three year licence on 3 April 1987, which was correctly endorsed.  The person will not be entitled to a licence free from that endorsement before 3 April, 1990.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5, who was employed on a Teamwork scheme from February 1984, to February 1985, was obliged to pay PRSI both for himself and the employer's share; if this is standard practice under such a scheme, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was employed on a Teamwork project from February 1984 to February 1985.  The weekly grant rate at that time was £60.  The grant is paid to the project sponsor towards the employment costs of the young workers and is not a wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of the scheme at the time was that where organisations had resources of their own or where the organisation rather than the community benefited most from the project, they were required to pay the employer's share of PRSI from their own funds.  In the case of voluntary social organisations engaged in non-revenue generating activities, the employers were allowed to deduct the employer's PRSI contribution from the grant.  This applied to the majority of organisations funded under <Col N="937" /> Teamwork including the organisation in question.</P>
    <P>The present position is that all grants are towards employment costs, and the employer's PRSI contribution is deductible from the grant rate.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at present to introduce a pilot scheme in disadvantaged areas which would allow teachers to work in the community with young people who at present do not attend school.  However, a number of other initiatives have been taken in recent years to alleviate the problem of educationally disadvantaged children in socially deprived areas.  These have included the establishment of youth encounter projects and the promotion of a programme of special educational measures for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The youth encounter projects provide educational facilities for young people who have become alienated from the conventional school system and have become, or are in danger of becoming, involved in delinquency.  There are two such projects in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme of special measures for schools in disadvantaged areas was initiated in 1984 and since then a total of 155 schools, catering for approximately 50,000 pupils have been assisted.  The measures from which the schools benefit <Col N="960" /> include special grants for books and equipment; the sponsorship of home-school-community liaison initiatives and special in-service training for the teachers in the schools concerned.</P>
    <P>Specific provision is also made in the teaching staff allocations to a number of vocational education committees for servicing training centres for itinerants in the 12-15 years old age group.</P>
