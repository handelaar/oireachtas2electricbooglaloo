      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the areas for which he has official responsibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the responsibilities conferred on him by the Constitution, by statutes passed by the Oireachtas and those arising from the disbursement of funds voted by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that he has responsibility to the Dáil to reply to parliamentary questions properly tabled to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I need your guidance in that matter a Cheann Comhairle.  It is the practice here for the Taoiseach and Ministers to reply as adequately, as fully and as courteously as possible to all questions addressed to them.  I and all the Ministers of this Government endeavour to fulfil that obligation to the best of our ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then is the Taoiseach pursuing a policy of transferring such parliamentary questions properly tabled to him to other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the transfer of questions is not in order now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy that the practice which I am following in this regard is the time honoured practice which has been pursued by Taoisigh as long as I remember in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference to be drawn from the Taoiseach's reply is that he is in fact pursuing such a policy.  May I raise then with the Taoiseach whether he accepts that it is properly in accordance with democratic principles to have a Taoiseach in this House continually transferring questions from his own Department to other Departments and not answering in this House questions in relation to areas for which he is responsible or in relation to areas where he had been personally involved or expressed opinions himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that the practice in this House, and the practice of Governments over the years, has been that Ministers take questions which are directly related to their areas of responsibility.  That practice has not been changed by this Government. The practice being followed by this Government is exactly in accordance with precedent and practice as long as I am in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask for a further direction from the Taoiseach.  I have found, since this session started, that practically every single question I tabled to the Taoiseach has been transferred to other Departments even on occasions when the Taoiseach has made a speech, for example, on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill.  I have sought further information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice in this House was well established for many years long before the Deputy did us the honour of entering this House.  Questions which are directly related to the responsibility of particular Ministers are transferred to those Ministers.  Otherwise the Taoiseach of the day would be answering every single question and that is not the practice in this House.  Again, I repeat that what I do and the practice I follow is exactly in accordance with precedent and with what was done by every other Taoiseach whom I have known in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that and drawing on my ten years' experience here may I say that I have never seen such a shrinking violet of a Taoiseach as we have at present in relation to Dáil questions?  I should like to suggest to the Taoiseach that quoting precedent and relying on tradition does not, in fact, cover the exact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject that suggestion.  I repeat that what I am doing in the discharge of my duties and <Col N="1978" /> responsibilities as Taoiseach is exactly in accordance with what other Taoisigh have done before me.</P>

    <P>&dagger;Latest information available.</P>
    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>(1)  The numbers of Irish visitors travelling overseas cover all visits by Irish residents irrespective of the reason for journey.</P>
    <P>(2)  Analysis of Irish visitors travelling overseas is only available by route travelled and not by country of destination.</P>
    <P>(3)  The phrase &ldquo;holidays abroad&rdquo; has been interpreted in the sense of &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; i.e., excluding visits to Northern Ireland.  Whilst expenditure estimates are available for the Northern Ireland flow, data for numbers crossing the Border by car and non-scheduled bus are not available so that it is not possible to answer the question in respect of Northern Ireland traffic.</P>
    <P>(4)  The average expenditure data include international fare payments to both Irish and foreign registered transport companies.</P>
    <P>(5)  The data relating to average expenditures by Irish visitors abroad for the third quarter of 1987 will be available shortly.  However, data for the year 1987 will not be available until mid to late March 1988.</P>
    <P>(6)  The data are based on the estimated total expenditure estimates divided by numbers of Irish visitors overseas.  These data are derived from the sample passenger card inquiry and returns from the relevant international carriers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The collection of data in relation to such matters as the financial performance of individual CIE services is a matter for the board and the boards of the subsidiary companies.  The purpose of the annual report of CIE is to give an overall general view of the activities of the organisation during the preceding year and in the circumstances the inclusion of the detail sought would not be appropriate.  Futhermore, such publication would not be desirable for commercial reasons.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the board and their subsidiaries to manage in the most effective and efficient way possible the limited resources available to them.  As CIE are required to operate so as to achieve the financial targets set for the various sectors and as many of the CIE services are dependent on State subvention, the board are under pressure to reduce costs and effect whatever savings are possible.</P>

    <P>The general question of liberalisation in the provision of road passenger services, with its implications for competition, is being examined in the context of the review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, which regulates the bus passenger industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, to take Questions Nos. 7 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The examination of the applications from Iarnród Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann for a fares and rates increase was completed recently.  This took account of the conclusions of the Dublin Transport Authority which were furnished in accordance with section 28 (2) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, on the application of Bus Átha Cliath and that of Iarnród Éireann for Dublin suburban rail services.</P>
      <P>Details of the increases sought are set out in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The average increase in fares sought was about 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is policy to promote the wider and increased use of public transport. Accordingly, every effort is made to keep fares at the lowest possible levels, taking account of the costs of providing services and the financial resources of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>In line with this approach the Government have approved increases as follows: (i) increases for multiple journey tickets of about 6 per cent in relation to Dublin suburban rail services; (ii) increases of 5p in respect of stage fares in the range 25p to 120p and increases of 10p in respect of stage fares in the range 170p to 240p for the Dublin suburban rail services; and (iii) increases in the fares of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann on the basis of a maximum increase of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also decided that the increases could be implemented as soon as practicable.  The increases will not <Col N="1985" /> apply to the free travel schemes operated by CIE on behalf of the Departments of Social Welfare and Defence.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Fares Increases sought by Iarnród Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>1.  Iarnród Éireann</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann sought approval for an increase of 6 per cent (approximately) in Dublin suburban rail stage fares and multi journey fares.</P>
    <P>2.  Bus Átha Cliath</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath sought approval to increase</P>
    <P>(i) the single adult fares as follows:</P>

    <P>3.  Bus Éireann</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann sought approval.</P>
    <P>(i) in the case of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway cities for</P>
    <P>(a) increasing the adult fare from 52p to 55p and the child fare from 26p to 30p;</P>
    <P>(b) an increase of 7.7 per cent for weekly and between 4.3 per cent and 4.6 per cent for monthly adult commuter tickets, and</P>
    <P>(c) an increase of 9.1 per cent for weekly and between 4.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent for monthly student commuter tickets;</P>
    <P>(ii) for rationalisation of the fares <Col N="1986" /> structure for rural/Expressway services to give</P>
    <P>(a) an average increase of 4 per cent for journeys up to 50 miles;</P>
    <P>(b) no overall increase for journeys over 50 miles but modifications and simplification of the structure giving minor increases or reductions; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  for increases of 3.8 per cent, 5.9 per cent and 5.3 per cent in respect of medium, long and giant weekly commuter &ldquo;Hop&rdquo; tickets respectively and increases of 4.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent in respect of medium and long monthly commuter &ldquo;Hop&rdquo; tickets respectively in the Dublin region (radius of 20 to 50 miles).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see some sense in the Deputy's suggestion but I am convinced that the cost of the fares is not the only reason for the decline in numbers using public transport.  I know the Deputy realises that £113 million plus is provided in the Estimates for 1988 for CIE.  It is in the light of that that we have granted the increases which are as low as we could possibly make them, at 2.5 per cent for Bus Atha Cliath, just equal to the expected rate of inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>The initiative for air fares proposals on any particular route is, in the first instance, a matter for the commercial judgment of the airline concerned. In so far as North Atlantic air fares for the 1988 tourism season are concerned, my Department received yesterday, on 14 December, proposals from Aer Lingus in that regard.  None of the other airlines operating between the US and Ireland has yet filed their 1988 fares. I am very conscious of the need to ensure that air fares from the US are competitive and are sufficiently attractive to ensure that the number of tourists visiting Ireland each year continues to increase. It is by reference to these two issues in particular, that I will be examining the Aer Lingus proposals and those of the other carriers.</P>

      <P>Up to recently, transport investment planning for the Dublin area was at a standstill pending an assessment of the various infrastructure options for <Col N="1991" /> the area.  The log jam was broken following the Government decision that no further consideration should be given to the question of providing additional electrified rail services in the Dublin area. Instead, I instructed CIE to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area involving only bus-based options or diesel services on existing rail lines.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Task Force is being reconstituted on a non-statutory basis to take over from the Dublin Transport Authority functions formerly exercised by the original task force, whose main objective was to promote an environment in which private car commuters would transfer to public transport.  The experience gained by the DTA will be of benefit in this work.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to keep CIE fares at the lowest possible levels, taking account of the costs of providing services and the financial resources of CIE.  In this way, the wider and increased use of public transport in Dublin, in other large cities and throughout the country, is promoted.</P>
      <P>In relation to those other cities, it is a matter for the local authorities concerned, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and, where appropriate with his consent, to implement traffic management measures to reduce traffic congestion.  This will provide more favourable conditions for the operation of public transport services in those cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that central to his plans with regard to city transport is the encouragement of commuters to move from the car to public transport services.  Can the Minister explain why he took the extraordinary decision that CIE should develop no further DART services for the city?  Is the Minister not aware that research by CIE shows that the only appreciable area of transfer from private cars to public transport in recent decades has been on the DART system?  Would the Minister not accept that the development of DART services is the only serious proposal that <Col N="1992" /> would in any way encourage people out of their motor cars and on to public transport in the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that latter part of Deputy McCartan's thesis.  Undoubtedly the DART encouraged a change from private to public transport in the area which it covers.  To provide a similar type operation to other parts of Dublin and suburbs would mean the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds.  I am not in a position to make any plans on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is central to the development of public transport.  If the Minister does not commit the money needed to develop rapid transport systems like DART the alternative in the interim will be to spend as much money building and developing roads in Dublin in order to keep transport moving.  Does the Minister accept that at some stage the Government must make a decision to make a major capital investment in public transport as opposed to investing in road development?  Will the Minister say whether or not in his Department or within the Government there is any active consideration of that major political issue at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

Of the nine recommendations, six have been implemented or are in the course of being implemented and three, including one of those implemented, are the subject of industrial relations disputes which have been referred to the Labour Court.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 16, 17, 30 and 32 together. I welcome the opportunity presented by these question to inform the House of the action taken by the Government on Friday last in relation to the future of B &amp; I.  Deputies may recall that in May last I directed the board of the B &amp; I to submit to me as soon as possible a plan of action, for implementation in the autumn, aimed at restoring the company to viability.  I stressed to the board and to the B &amp; I unions whom I also met at that time the necessity for an agreed plan. Additional equity was made available from the Exchequer to give the company time to produce the necessary plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November the B &amp; I board submitted a five-year plan of action to me which had been accepted by the majority of the company's workforce.  The board informed me that they were unable to recommend implementation of the plan in the absence of agreement with the <Col N="1999" /> union representing marine officers.  Subsequent further negotiations between the company's management and representatives of the marine officers culminated last Friday in acceptance by the marine officers of revised proposals which provided for the necessary contribution from that section of the workforce to the board's plan of action.  The board of the B &amp; I confirmed to me last Friday that their plan had now got the across-the-board support of the workforce and the board recommended the plan to Government for support.</P>
    <P>Having noted the plan of action and its across-the-board support by the workforce the Government agreed, on the basis of the plan, to provide the company with up to £11 million in Exchequer equity in 1988.  The Government also decided to review the position not later than the autumn of 1988 on the basis of detailed comparisons of the company's performance against forecast.</P>
    <P>I emphasised in a statement last Friday and I repeat now that the company's future cannot be assured by Government support alone but is equally dependent on full co-operation by all concerned in the provision of a continuous, reliable and efficiet service.  I recognise the significant concessions made by the company's workforce in agreeing the plan of action with B &amp; I management and I trust that the combined efforts of board, management and staff will ensure that the new strategy of a slimmed down B &amp; I will help the company to achieve a cost-efficient operation, to exploit new business opportunities and to provide the low cost shipping services required for the development of trade, tourism and general economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the concessions made by the B &amp; I workforce are unprecedented and represent a major dimension in terms of the future of the company?  Will he ensure, by way of reciprocation, that the Government give a very firm commitment, in the medium <Col N="2000" /> to long term, to the continued viability of this company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already put on the record of this House my appreciation of the efforts made by the group of unions to reach agreement on a plan for a future viable B &amp; I.  I take this opportunity to reiterate what I said at that time.  The second part of the Deputy's supplementary related to a commitment.  In the severe financial circumstances obtaining at present I do not think there is any greater commitment than a Government decision allowing for the provision of this £11 million in equity for the B &amp; I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members of the House, I am sure, would like to compliment everybody concerned on this arrangement; common sense prevailed and a very mature attitude was adopted by the unions in particular.  Can the Minister give us some idea of the extent of the debts hanging over the B &amp; I shipping company at present?  Can he confirm for us that the vessel <i>The Connacht</i> is being sold to pay for the resultant redundancies? Can he also inform us approximately what will be the losses of the B &amp; I in the current year?  Furthermore, can he give us the best possible estimate of those losses?  Also, how does he envisage the losses working out for 1988?  Does he feel that £11 million will be sufficient to carry the company over for 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said about the mature attitude adopted by the unions.  Off the top of my head I would say that the debts amount to something between £40 million and £50 million.  It is difficult to assess what will be the losses for this year.  In May 1987, when I put forward the original proposal to management and unions, the Government made provision for up to £8 million in equity of which £5 million has been drawn down as of this date.  I could not give the Deputy a rounded figure for the losses in 1987.  No doubt they will become available and I will supply them to the Deputy.</P>

Will the Minister agree that it is very important &mdash; which is why I tabled Question No. 32 &mdash; to ensure that we maintain a strategic link for passengers and cargo between here and Britain?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to air transport, as part of the drive to complete the internal market in air transport by 1992, the European Transport Council on 7 December 1987 finalised the content of a Community air transport policy which will apply up to end June 1990.  The policy embraces more flexible regulatory arrangements in areas of air fares, capacity, market access and competition.</P>
      <P>The package is welcome on a number of counts.  New air services between Community countries can be inaugurated speedily and with minimum formalities. As an immediate benefit, Ryanair's direct service from Cork to Luton is now operating and the proposed service from Shannon to Luton has been approved by the UK authorities.</P>
      <P>I got in touch with the British Minister with regard to those two services and the British agreed that we would not have to wait until 1 January when the package comes into effect legally in Europe for that service to begin.  They agreed to an immediate start of that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feature of the package is that where major routes like London/Dublin are <Col N="2005" /> concerned, the restrictions on the number of operating carriers is now being lifted.  We can, therefore, expect new operators to show interest in serving the London to Dublin routes.  I welcome the prospect of additional services which should help to give a further boost to our efforts to increase the number of tourists from Britain visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>The package has important benefits for regional development in Ireland.  It facilitates the operation of services by airlines from other member states of the EC to Irish regional airports including Cork, Shannon, Horan, Waterford, Sligo, etc.</P>
    <P>The package should also have significant benefits for existing and potential users of air transportation.  It permits greater pricing flexibility for airlines and a limitation on the rights of Governments to intervene in the interest of their own airlines.  The travelling public can, therefore, look forward to a better service in terms of frequency of flights, quality of service and level of fares.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the package from an Irish perspective is the additional commercial development opportunities which will arise for Irish airlines.  Irish carries will be in a position to exercise traffic rights &mdash; i.e. fifth freedom rights &mdash; between airports of other Community members.  This will, for example, enable the recommencement of services on routes from, say, Manchester to European mainland destinations which the UK authorities withdrew some years ago.</P>
    <P>The additional fifth freedom rights involved are of course available to all Community airlines in so far as they relate to services between hub and regional airports.  However, additional rights have been won by Ireland under which an Irish carrier can exercise fifth freedom traffic rights between major European hubs, e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels.  This major concession &mdash; which is also available to Portugal &mdash; is a recognition by our Community partners of the particular difficulties which affect airlines of peripheral countries and represents a <Col N="2006" /> significant negotiating breakthrough for Ireland.  It was consoling to see the support we got in the Council for that concession.</P>
    <P>These developments herald a new era for the Community's 320 million consumers particularly in so far as their leisure activities are concerned.  I am quite confident that Irish tourism can prosper in this new environment.</P>
    <P>As regards road transport, the Council of Ministers had before it two proposals &mdash; one for the liberalisation of international road haulage operations by 1 January 1993 which includes an annual increase of 40 per cent in the Community quota authorisations and the other laying down conditions under which hauliers may engage in cabotage operations in another member state.  Adoption of the liberalisation proposal would mean that Ireland's allocation of Community quota authorisations would increase annually by 40 per cent up to 1992.  Thereafter the quota system would be abolished and Irish hauliers who are qualified uner EC Regulations to engage in international road haulage operations would be entitled to an EC licence.  The cabotage proposal would enable Irish hauliers to carry out internal haulage operations in other member state: equally, of course, hauliers from other member states could carry out similar operations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At the Council meeting on 7 December 1987, time did not allow for completion of difficult discussions on the road transport items.  The Council meeting will reconvene tomorrow 16 December 1987 and I am hopeful that a definitive decision will be taken on these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the latter part of the reply relating to road transport deregulation a bit incomprehensible.  Perhaps the Minister has problems with it himself.  We all welcome the further deregulation and so on.  Could the Minister tell us what price reductions this will lead to in reality?  Commentators have said that the price reductions might be as little as 5 per cent or 10 per cent, whereas <Col N="2007" /> it is obvious that some independent carriers operating from this country can offer a trip for virtually half the fares operating heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me comment on the first point the Deputy made in regard to road transport.  It has simply been held up by one major European country that is anxious to have harmonisation of all types of taxes and imposts in all the countries because it feels it suffers unduly from the fact that it is used for transport and is getting nothing out of it.  The second point was in regard to the cabotage, permission for a foreign country to pick up goods and drop them in another country.  With regard to the substantive supplementary on fares, it is fair to say that the structures have been put in place for competition, but the market will decide how much cutting of fares there will actually be.  I know that the editor of a very prestigious in flight magazine said that he did not expect great reductions in fares.  I listened carefully to what he said and he used the subjunctive mood right through all his statements and did not make any actual statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This breakthrough has been the result of long term pressure on Ireland's part.  I would like to know if, following on that, there have been any filings from any Irish airlines to commence fifth freedom operations through a second country to a third country?  Has he had any applications for routes through Europe?  Has there been any indication that routes already provisionally granted by Ireland will now be taken up by Irish airlines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment I have no applications but this only happened on 7 December and it takes a while to put the arrangements in place.  I expect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the Minister not only expects them but is using all the muscle he has to ensure that <Col N="2008" /> Ireland, having made a song and dance about market access for so long, will now avail of it and ensure that there are economic services to this country of a fairly high frequency?</P>
      <P>In relation to road transport liberalisation, will the Minister agree with me that the opportunities there are even greater than the opportunities in air transport?  Has he considered the responsibility of setting up an Irish transport centre somewhere in north western Europe to facilitate the opening opportunities in road transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the mood of the airlines we have here, there will be little delay in receiving applications and in seeing developments which are now permitted under the new package.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second point made by the Deputy I could not say quantitatively whether it will be better or worse than the air opportunities.  There are great opportunities in the area of road haulage. I take note of the Deputy's reference on Second Stage of the Transport Bill to a centre in Europe and I shall have my Department consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Deputy call for a point of order.  I wanted to ask if there is any time limit placed upon the special concession won by Ireland and, indeed, Portugal, with regard to the rights of traffic to major European hub cities.  Is there a time scale on Ireland taking up its options under that exception?  Have the year 1992 and the full integration of the single European market any implications for Ireland in this context?  Would the Minister accept that there is a greater onus on the Government to ensure that our national <Col N="2009" /> airline, if no other, takes up every available opportunity to develop their services and the service to the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This arrangement will be in place up to 1990 and provision is made in the agreement for pushing it a step further before 1990 has been reached. There is no limit with regard to starting off.  The third point made by the Deputy referred to my obligations in the matter. Certainly, the air companies operating in Ireland will be made aware of my intention that the opportunities should be fully exploited.</P>

Much more time should be given to this Bill both on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  We are opposing giving three and a half hours to Second Stage of this Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill.  There is much more in this than just dealing with employers who are fiddling.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise with you, Sir, and seek your guidance on a matter concerning a private notice question regarding the fire authorities of two different local authority areas.  I am not arguing with your ruling.  I have a problem, however, since two local authorities are concerned.  Is any Minister in the Government in charge of local authorities in general?  According to your ruling I will not be allowed to raise it on the Adjournment either and it concerns a very serious fire in Enniskerry about which there was great confusion between two local authorities about fire brigades with subsequent great danger to the lives of some small children.  I need your guidance. With whom am I to raise this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was replying to points made by Deputy Deasy.  I shall strive to move as quickly as I can through this phase as Deputy McCartan requested.  I have already had some fruitful discussions with regard to amendments with Deputy McCartan and I appreciate the urgency of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised a number of <Col N="2251" /> issues which I would like to address.  The Deputy said he was interested in seeing the railways maintained notwithstanding the very high costs to the Exchequer and I have taken note of what he said.  The Dublin Transport Authority are not the subject of this Bill and I will be introducing a Bill on that subject shortly.  This will give the House an opportunity to debate it.  I want to say one thing in as low a key as possible.  I take issue with Deputy Deasy in regard to his claim that the abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority was based on vindictiveness. I can assure the Deputy that the only reason for the termination of the Dublin Transport Authority is the scarcity of financial resources.  We will have an opportunity to discuss this matter in detail shortly.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed support for the liberalisation of transport in the bus policy area.  The relevant legislation and policy in that area have been under review in my Department.  I hope to come to conclusions in this area shortly.  In that connection, I will take account of the views expressed here on CIE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked me to explain the significance of the change proposed in relation to the communication cords.  The specific reference in the legislation is to an efficient means of communication between the passengers and the servants of the company in charge of the train. These means of communication generally relate to communication cords and, in this instance, this is what the amendment refers to.  Under the 1868 Act passenger trains which travel more than 20 miles without stopping are required to provide the communication cords.  The amendment extends the requirement to provide a means of communication to all passenger trains.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment to provide for the disposal of land linked to abandoned railway lines by tender, I would like to explain that this does not in any way interfere with the arrangements for <Col N="2252" /> selling such land to adjoining landowners or by auction.</P>
    <P>The next contribution came from Deputy Cullen.  I understand he is indisposed at the moment and I wish to send him best wishes for a speedy recovery and to comment on his contribution which was astounding in many ways.  I would ask him if he wishes to close down CIE tomorrow without taking any account of the travelling needs of the public.  He sees no social role for CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputies, but I wonder if the other meetings being held in the House would close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a completely irresponsible attitude.  We are all concerned with costs and the need to reduce them but the consequences of Deputy Cullen's approach to the financing of CIE could only lead to many of those dependent on public transport being immobilised.  I do not accept that approach.  That is not to say that CIE services are without fault and it is the responsibility of all of us to point out the shortcomings and to seek change.  We need a rational approach in order to improve things rather than demolish them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cullen also mentioned that this Bill would authorise CIE to engage in additional borrowing.  I would like to explain that, in the main, additional borrowing is not involved.  There will be a substitution of longer term borrowing for temporary borrowing to the extent of £45 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said that CIE are being allowed to walk away from £45 million they owe the Exchequer.  I would like to explain that the Bill discharges CIE's liability to repay State advances of that amount as an offset against arrears in the same amount due by the Exchequer to CIE.  These arrears relate to 1985, 1986 and 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A basic and to me fundamental flow in Deputy Cullen's contribution was that, while his remarks were based on the ideal of financial responsibility and curbing the costs of the transport system, they did not refer at all to the railway system <Col N="2253" /> which, as the House knows, takes up about 80 per cent of the subsidy we vote for CIE.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh would like to see greater investment in CIE.  While it is clear that CIE could benefit from increased investment, the resources available determine what the Exchequer can afford.  On the question of CIE leasing land and buildings, I would like to advise the Deputy that the board are very active in making the greatest possible use of all their land and building resources. The board's strategy is to use these resources for transport purposes in the first instance and, failing that, to use them in the best interest of the board.  This can be by developing or leasing the properties or else selling them to best advantage. This approach is not confined to physical resources but the board has also been active in providing consultancy services abroad using their staff resources.  I am satisfied that CIE has a very dynamic approach in this whole area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested that the maximum penalties should be increased to £800 and-or one year in prison.  Deputies Taylor and Dennehy also thought that the penalties were not being pitched at a sufficiently high level.  Since the debate on 26 November, I have re-examined the levels of penalties proposed in the Bill in the light of the comments of Members of the House on the adequacy of the proposals.  On reflection, I decided that perhaps my original proposals would not have quite the impact on offenders that I and the Members who contributed intended.  In the circumstances, on Committee Stage of the Bill I shall move amendments increasing the penalties for each of the classes of offences covered by the Bill.  All classes of offences dealt with in the Bill will no longer attract the same level of maximum penalty but all penalties are being increased on the basis of the relative seriousness of the offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan spoke of a number of important issues and his speech reflected his deeply felt concerns for public transport.  As he is aware, in a number of instances our concerns are common.  I cannot, however, agree that <Col N="2254" /> Exchequer support for CIE can be based on an indifference to profit and loss accounts.  Our attitude must be conditioned by what the Exchequer can afford having regard to the many important demands on it.  The social role of CIE is clearly recognised in the annual level of subvention made available to the board.  This represents what the country can afford.  As a corollary, it is necessary for CIE to live within the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan advocated the extension of the DART system to other Dublin areas.  This is a matter which has been under consideration by various interests for a number of years.  It is recognised &mdash; and I referred to this at Question Time &mdash; that such a development would cost hundreds of millions of pounds and, to be realistic, that type of financing will not be available from the Exchequer in the foreseeable future.  In the circumstances the chairman of CIE has been instructed to base plans for development in the Dublin area on bus solutions and diesel rail on existing lines. I was questioned at length about this during Question Time.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the current competitive efforts of the CIE services are a reflection of the freedom of CIE to compete as provided for in the transport legislation.</P>
    <P>I now come to Deputy Jim Mitchell's contribution.  He and other Deputies referred to the industrial relations situation in Bus Átha Cliath.  Their criticisms reflect the general public's response to being deprived unreasonably of the services they need for ordinary living. There is a clear, direct message for those concerned to the effect that the public's patience is nearing exhaustion, if not already exhausted.  A number of Deputies were critical of a particular union.  Deputy Jim Mitchell saw the lack of trust between management and workers as the main cause for the industrial relations problems.  The problem of interruptions to service is very serious and will clearly have to be resolved as a matter of urgency in the interests of Bus Átha Cliath, their employees and the <Col N="2255" /> travelling public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell laid some emphasis on rail safety.  The Deputy can rest assured that safety is still a major priority and Iarnród Éireann and their staff continue to maintain vigilance in regard to safety measures.</P>
    <P>As regards the change of route via Portarlington for the trains travelling with chemicals between Dublin and Ballina' this alteration was made after the company had given full consideration to all relevant factors.  The change improves the safety factor, because by operating via Portarlington it is possible for the train to remain in radio contact with Connolly Station for the greater part of the route.  These trains continue to be operated according to detailed operational instructions in compliance with safety standards.  All the local authorities on the route were notified of the change of route and the scheme of co-ordination of emergency services in the event of an incident is in place.  It will interest Members of the House to learn that mock exercises were held earlier this year to test the operation of the scheme and, in the light of these, certain improvements were made to it.  The safety aspects continue to be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell referred to many issues in relation to detailed activities of the CIE organisation.  No doubt, the board and their subsidiaries will take cognisance of what he said.  Nevertheless, there are some points to which I wish to reply.  The board of CIE are actively working &mdash; and with some success &mdash; to exploit to CIE's advantage their physical and human resources.  The board have no particular wish to create redundancies among their workforce.  That is a procedure which is resorted to only where there is no alternative viable course of action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell expressed some concern about the replacement of CIE locomotives and other rail equipment.  I wish to remind the Deputy that the last Government, of which he was a member, <Col N="2256" /> decided that a package of retrenchment measures would be implemented on the passenger rail side.  They explained that these measures would not affect the existing carriage replacement programme but would mean that there would be no new substantial investment in railways and that there would be strict cash limits on other expenditures.  I assure the Deputy that any proposals for capital investment put forward by CIE will be examined on their merits in the usual way and taking account of the limits of available resources.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Members of the House who made contributions on Second Stage.  It reflects their interest in the important question of the country's needs and the way they are met.  I welcome the support for the Bill from Members of the House and the support expressed for the chairman of CIE, his board, the boards of the subsidiary companies and the whole CIE organisation. Some Members of the House recognise the progress made in CIE over recent years.  As regards the criticisms of strikes in Bus Átha Cliath and some CIE services, I cannot but agree that there is scope for improvement in these areas.  The CIE organisation are working on the problems and deserve every encouragement in expanding the use of the board's extensive resources.</P>
    <P>There were many points raised of a detailed operational or local nature which it is not possible to deal with in the course of my reply.  I confined myself to responding to queries and criticisms of the proposals before the House and general CIE issues.  I will bring the report of this debate to the notice of the chairman of CIE so that he can take account of the many points made on detailed CIE matters.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. b1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, to delete &ldquo;£44,458,691&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£10,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of £44,458,691 which is referred to in the section and which I suggest be deleted and substituted by the lower figure relates to advances which have been made to CIE by the Exchequer under the Transport Act, 1964, and it is now proposed to write off that amount. If I heard the Minister correctly, he said this money is being written off because, as he put it, the Exchequer owed this amount of money to CIE out of moneys that apparently were earmarked for them and which they did not take up.  I was not aware that CIE did not take up any moneys.  Huge amounts of money are <Col N="2261" /> voted to them in this House each year: in recent years the figure has averaged around £100 million.</P>
    <P>I notice that on Second Stage Deputy Cullen referred to the figure proposed under the 1988 Estimates which were introduced in the House in October and suggested that an even larger figure be voted to CIE for next year &mdash; it is referred to at column 1948 of the Official Report of 26 November &mdash; a figure of £113,605,000.  In the few minutes that have elapsed since the Minister replied to Second Stage I have not had the opportunity to check out what he has said but I have a recollection of Supplementary Estimates being moved here in relation to CIE in recent years and that indicates that there was no underdrawing of the huge subsidies voted here for CIE each year.</P>
    <P>It seems to be wrong in principle that such a large sum of money as this can be just written off in a section at the wave of the Minister's hand or at the wave of this House's hand.  We know what the difficulties are in many areas at present because of a shortage of public money and shortage of resources in the Exchequer.  There has been a most painful situation in the past number of months in relation to primary education and for all of this year in relation to hospital closures and other restrictions on the delivery of health services.  Many of these matters could have been rectified for relatively small sums of money, very much smaller than the figure of £44.5 million that is mentioned in this section.</P>
    <P>It is a little facile to say that this money is owed by the Exchequer to CIE and, therefore, they should be allowed to write off this amount of their advances.  I do not think this House or the Exchequer owes CIE anything.  It has been heavily underwriting them for a long number of years and, unhappily, the situation seems to be getting worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>We all know what are the difficulties besetting the railway system but what has happened in more recent times in relation to the bus system, both in Dublin and with the provincial services, is a new dimension of horror.  I have read within <Col N="2262" /> the past few days that CIE's estimate of the loss on the Dublin Bus services for this year is in the region of £24 million, which is way above anything they lost on those services previously.  Therefore, it seems to be particularly inappropriate that at this time we should write off the huge sum of money proposed here, £44.5 million.</P>
    <P>In the earlier amendment which has been ruled out of order I sought to allow at least some of these bus services to be put out to public tender by the Minister. That is a view which would be shared by many Members of this House and certainly by many members of the public who feel it is the only sensible way to approach these matters.  The position in Dublin Bus in particular has now got completely out of hand.  The losses are astronomical and almost unbelievable and this is the kind of approach that should be taken rather than simply saying to CIE as we do in this section: &ldquo;Here is £45.5 million and you can write that off. Do not worry.  If you incur any losses in Dublin Bus or anywhere else, do not worry, you can come back to this House, and Dáil Éireann will look after you again as they have faithfully done over a long number of years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is inexplicible that the Dublin Bus service, a public transport system with a total monopoly and no competition should lose money at all.  This service must be unique among large cities in Europe in that respect.  That they should lose constantly increasing sums, including their own projection of £24 million this year is really extraordinary.  As Deputy Cullen said on Second Stage &mdash; and through no fault of his own he cannot be here today &mdash; it is time to begin to call a halt, instead of going through the normal performance that is gone through every couple of years of saying that CIE are about to turn the corner and all will be well.  Clearly all will not be well.  The provisions here will do nothing to improve the situation and it will continue the attitude that is so prevalent that it does not matter what CIE lose or how inefficient they are, they will be fully <Col N="2263" /> underwritten anyway with large sums of money.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to hand CIE money but it is another thing to make repayable advances available to them and then come along and write them off.  The point the Minister made, with all due respect to him, cannot be taken very seriously, because neither this House nor the Exchequer owe anything to CIE.  It is the other way around.  This must be looked at in the light of the current huge loss making operation of Dublin Bus, the almost impossible state of industrial relations, the constant withdrawal of services from the travelling public, and the latest new increase in fares for these services and for rail services which were announced here earlier today.  I ask the Minister to think again about the principle involved in this.  Even if the money cannot be repaid by CIE, it should at least be seen that the money is still owed by them rather than having them in this extraordinarily privileged position in which they get advances from the Exchequer which are written off at the drop of a hat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain to Deputy O'Malley what is meant by money due to CIE.  I accept the general principle that this House owes nothing to CIE, but if a company operating the national transport service are told they will get a certain amount of money in 1985, 1986 and 1987 and organise their affairs on that basis, there is an obligation on this House to provide that money.  That is precisely what happened.  In 1985, 1986 and 1987 there was £33.919 million of DART interest not paid and a normal subvention of £11.2 million was deferred from 1987 to 1988.  This adds up to the figure we have just been talking about.  This was almost the exact same figure as the repayable advances which up to 1982 had been made to CIE and the one was written off against the other.  One could argue that the House owes nothing to the public transport system but if the House indicated to the board that it was paying the DART interest in each of the three years, <Col N="2264" /> it is only fair to say that the House owes it to the board to make provision for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to have some figures clarified.  The advance in section 2 of the Bill of £44.5 million made to the board by the Government need not now be repaid by the board.  Over what period were these advances made?  Is it just a coincidence that the figure which the board are now being allowed to borrow is the same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave 1982 as the last year when advances were made available. Between 1965 and 1982 these repayable advances were made to CIE.  They add up to the figure that had been promised to CIE on foot of DART interest plus £11.2 million, the normal subvention that was postponed to 1988 from 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they just happened. A total of £44.459 million of the £45.119 million which we say is due to CIE because it was promised to them for underpayments in earlier years in respect of DART and the subvention was to be cancelled as an offset for the repayable advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained again to this House the implications of sections 2, 3 and 4.  We reject out of hand the amendment being proposed by the Progressive Democrats and we will support the Government on the original thrust of their Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is time to call a halt, it is time to call a halt to the attacks on CIE who provide an essential social service.  It is time to call a halt to the efforts by people to do away with CIE, which was certainly the thrust of Deputy Cullen's intervention on Second Stage on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  The importance of this Bill is that CIE currently need the facilities contained in sections 2, 3 and 4 to carry on as a viable operation.  The implication in what Deputy Cullen sought on Second Stage and in what these <Col N="2265" /> amendments seek to achieve is that CIE should close down without delay.  That is the response of the Progressive Democrats to this Bill.  It is a dismal response which should not receive any support from any other party in this House.</P>
    <P>CIE have the potential to provide a very efficient national service for all sectors in all areas irrespective of whether or not there is a competitive return.  We should be seeking an expanded commitment to have CIE developed and made competitive.  If CIE were allowed the free hand which Deputy O'Malley and his party want for private bus owners, CIE would have no difficulty in meeting the requirements expected of them as a social service.  That does not mean that CIE must run on profits.  Certainly we can argue that there cannot be an openended fund.</P>

We cannot afford a never ending source of funds for the development of roads, private transport and the private motor car.  At what stage are we ever going to balance that debate?  I thought we were going to get down to the implications and provisions of this Bill.  All these eleventh hour amendments could be taken together and very quickly disposed of to the dust bin, where they deserve to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what the view of the extreme Left is and I assure the House and anyone else who is interested that I am not particularly concerned about that view.  Our approach to this and the other there amendments is generally a common sense approach which would be shared by anyone who does not have extreme ideological hangups which are dictated to him by democratic centralism or whatever system he operates under.  The common sense view is that the present situation, particularly in relation to bus transport, is extremely unsuccessful.  Other companies or people should be allowed to compete and should be allocated some routes as appear appropriate to the Minister.  They should be allowed to tender for these routes and if they are successful they should be granted permission to serve them.</P>
      <P>There is no question of trying to close anything down.  The wild, idiotic statements made by Deputy McCartan are not worthy of any further notice.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that this figure is made up of £11.2 million which is the shortfall in the payment of the normal subvention for this year.  But this year is not over and there is nothing to stop the Minister paying the £11.2 million before 31 December.  It seems unusual before the end of the year to pay this figure in this indirect manner.  The other figure of £33.2 million relates to what the Minister describes as DART interest.  In respect of what period is that the interest on the capital construction side of the DART system?  Is it for one year or more?  It seems an extraordinarily large amount of money.  The DART system is regarded as a success but when one considers the amount of money it has cost and the fact that there is a huge built-in loss factor which will never be overcome because of the size of the capital cost, one wonders whether it was worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister reminded me that he and I were in Government together when this decision was made.  I remember it well. It was made after a debate that went on and on intermittently in the Cabinet for about four or five months, an unusually long time.  There were very strong views <Col N="2267" /> both ways.  I recall that the Cabinet were almost equally divided in relation to it. One of the things which swayed a couple of us finally to support this proposal against, perhaps, our better judgments, was the fact that we were assured by the then management of CIE that if we allowed them to go ahead with this proposal all the locomotives would be built in Ireland.  Substantial investment was to be made and substantial employment to be given.  Within quite a short time of the decision having been made it became evident that CIE had no intention of doing that.  The locomotives were built abroad with no benefit to Irish industry or to Irish employment.</P>
    <P>The overrun in the projected costs given to the Cabinet was absolutely enormous. I would classify it as being in the NET class as an example of a most appalling overrun.  For some years over £33 million is due in interest alone, apart from the repayment of capital and this is indicative of the overrun.  It seems very doubtful as to whether all these things should be written off yet again as another example of serious errors of the NET type: the Irish Exchequer is there, a bottomless pit which can be drawn upon. This is a great pity because it creates a mentality which causes State companies to have constant recourse to this bottomless pit.  While they feel it is there and that legislation like this can be promoted on their behalf, I do not believe sufficiently serious efforts will be made to overcome the problem.  It is particularly regrettable to hive off some of these services or create some competition in order to bring back some common sense and redress the ridiculous situation that a State company with a total monopoly can lose in one city alone as much as £24 million a year on public transport.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that Deputy O'Malley is standing by the constitutional collective responsibility with regard to the establishment of DART and that he realises that this money arises out of those decisions.  Let me say that I think it was <Col N="2268" /> a good decision which has provided a good service, the number of whose customers are increasing year by year.  I hope it will be a profitable as well as a highly socially successful venture as times goes on, something we can be proud of.</P>
      <P>The second point Deputy O'Malley raised was about the £11.2 million &mdash; that I could pay it before 31 December.  The decision was taken &mdash; before I assumed office &mdash; that the £11.2 million would be transferred to 1988 and for obvious reasons I rode with that decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley asked a question about the DART interest.  The DART interest is made up of £30.392 million arrears due and postponed in payment. To those arrears £3.527 million interest had to be added, giving approximately the sum I originally gave the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest.  I might make one further point, and I do not want to be categorical about this.  Deputy O'Malley said that it assumed the proportions of a NET situation.  I seem to recollect the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner, giving figures to this House indicating that, in real terms, the actual venture was made available to the public at the original estimated cost.  But, as the House knows, there was very heavy inflation obtaining at that time.</P>

      <P>For Deputy O'Malley's information, the acknowledged expert on the financing of DART is none other than Mr. Joe Rea.  From time to time I have heard him enunciate on it.  I am not on particularly good terms with the same gentleman so I shall have to depend on the Minister to explain the finances of the DART operation to me.  This is something I have not seen spelled out publicly, clearly, or both, ever, or at least for a very long time.  I should like to know what the DART cost initially, what it costs annually and the number of people the system is carrying.  Is it a worthwhile operation?  It is very difficult to evaluate <Col N="2269" /> that.  Probably it is incorrect to do a calculation based on the cost of carrying each individual passenger.  One must also take into account the amount of traffic being taken off the roads.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful if we could be given a rundown on the average number of passengers being carried daily.  This is always very difficult to ascertain because, as is the case in regard to any semi-State company, when one asks questions in the House, one is told it is none of one's business, or that it is none of the Minister's business, that it is a matter for the company itself.  Although I can understand how it evolves, it is a most unsatisfactory position.  It would be helpful if we could be told the cost of the DART system, the annual repayments on capital and interest and the numbers of passengers being carried.  I should also like to know from the Minister if the cost of the DART operation is included in the Government subvention of £113 million to CIE or is it quite separate?  I suspect it may be quite separate from the overall subvention of £113 million to CIE.  I should like to know if it is quite separate and, if it is, what it amounts to and for how long will it continue?  That warrants clarification.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy McCartan when he said that Deputy O'Malley was attacking CIE.  Nobody is attacking CIE. We were elected here by the citizens to oversee how public money is spent. Therefore when Members carry out a critical evaluation of the spending of that money they are merely doing what they were elected to do in this House.  Certainly I am one of those people who have been critical in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I said there must be a case for competition in regard to the bus services, whether they be provincial or based in Dublin city.  The Minister today at Question Time spoke of deregulation of road transport.  Would the Minister tell us whether deregulation of road transport, just as in the case of deregulation of air transport, means that competition will not be merely an option but a necessity.  Does it mean that monopolies contravene EC regulations?  That question needs to be answered: does deregulation of road transport mean that competition must be entertained?  I say &ldquo;must be&rdquo; rather than asking is there an option.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is hanging in mid-air and has never been properly answered.  If the monopoly position is no longer tenable under existing EC law can the Minister say whether it will be tenable when we reach 1992?  There is an extremely grey area there that has not been properly teased out.  There must be a question over the legality of a monopoly position at present and in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage also I made the point that I still favour the retention of the rail system.  Having said that I am not absolutely convinced I am right.  Again the matter warrants evaluation of the number of passengers carried and the effect that the passengers and goods at present carried by rail will have on our roads system which is at present rather inadequate as we all know.  For example, would it be seriously damaged if that traffic were transferred from the rail to <Col N="2271" /> the roads system?  We need to be advised expertly in that regard and ascertain whether we would be justified in saving £90 million a year because that is what the rail system is costing the Government at present.  That warrants critical examination. There is need for much evaluation before arriving at a final decision. In the absence of that evaluation I give the benefit of the doubt to the rail system, as it is constituted at present, but I am not convinced.</P>
    <P>I should appreciate it if the Minister could inform us of the cost of the DART system and, second, the significance of deregulation of road transport within the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should say these are round figures.  In the nature of things, I can answer only in round figures.  The cost was of the order of £80 million and the interest of the order of £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest accruing as the system was being laid was of the order of £30 million.  Of course, as the House knows, that interest and the capital cost were added together; the interest was capitalised.  The next question the Deputy asked was in relation to usage. In 1983 the system carried 5.4 million passengers, in 1986 13 million passengers and the estimation for 1987 is 14 million passengers.  I agree with the Deputy that, as far as possible, there should be full transparency with regard to questions relating to State companies.  A late former Taoiseach and Minister for Industry and Commerce would only put one block on that and that is where revelation of figures would interfere with the efficient running of the companies.  I expect the House would accept that as the general principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also asked about the deregulation of road transport.  It is hardly comparing like with like when comparing deregulation in the first country that deregulated, where there are millions of people and it was not really a total <Col N="2272" /> success as is agreed by the Americans themselves, and deregulation in the context of the EC where there are 320 million people.  It would be very difficult to assess what the effect would be in a country which is, by the standards of the countries I have been referring to, thinly populated, and this creates problems in the transport field.  It would require very careful assessment to give an indication of what total deregulation in road transport would bring.  But we do know that there was a system at one stage &mdash; and I think it was again the late Seán Lemass who had to do something about it &mdash; where there was unbridled competition and total confusion in the transport area. His legislation was designed to bring some kind of order to the situation. Admittedly, the basic law under which we are operating now is totally out of date in present circumstances.  That is under minute examination and study in my Department and that study is coming very near to its conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions that were not answered.  We have now determined that the cost of the DART system was really £110 million, between the initial cost and the £30 million in interest during construction.  I asked what the annual repayments would come to, for how long those repayments would continue, and if they were included in the subvention figure of £113 million.  I would appreciate an answer to those three questions.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would advise Members of the House on the implications of the amendment being proposed by the Progressive Democrats in terms of its implications for CIE &mdash; their capacity to continue to operate and staff levels and service levels within the company.  In addition there are the implications of cutting back on the write off by almost £35 million with the restriction on borrowing another £35 million &mdash; a gross figure of about £70 million.  Can the Minister advise us as to how constructive this amendment is and whether it represents an attack on future operations of CIE?  My impressions are that the current financial status of CIE is such that unless this Bill goes through all Stages by the end of this session the company cannot be properly run and that that is why we are having the Bill today in such a &ldquo;guillo-tine&rdquo; fashion?  There has been no response from the Minister yet as to the implications of this amendment.</P>

He said that if my amendment went through he would have to get £35 million more to pay CIE. So that is a further subsidy on top of the £100 million we have paid them already this year.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment c1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, line 4, to delete &ldquo;£45,000,000, and substitute &ldquo;£10,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the borrowing power of CIE which has been conferred on them by this section.  It gives the board power to borrow a sum of £45 million and the following section and the amendment in my name relate to the guarantee of that borrowing by the Minister for Finance which is very similar to the writing off by him of the £44.5 million which was written off by the previous section.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to what Deputy Collins and some others had to say about this £45 million, said &mdash; I think that I am paraphrasing him correctly &mdash; that it was not really another £45 million, that it was transferring existing short term borrowings amounting to that sum to longer term borrowing and legalising that.  That may be the internal departmental justification and it may very well be the case, for all I know.  However, there is nothing in this section which says that CIE are not free to borrow another £45 million, and the same applies to the next section with regard to the Minister for Finance not being free to guarantee another £45 million on top of what he has already guaranteed or on top of what is already written off, such as the £44.5 million that he wrote off in the previous section.  If the position is as the Minister says, that this is a transfer of short term borrowings which are repayable, in one, two or three years, to long term borrowings repayable over 15 or 20 years, then the section should say that.  As it is drafted under law, the board of CIE would be free to maintain their present short term borrowings, cope with them as best they could and incur a further £45 million of borrowings, whether short term or longer term and they would be within their statutory powers in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same argument relates to the <Col N="2276" /> guarantees.  The Minister for Finance may have already guaranteed the existing £45 million of borrowings that are apparently covered by this section.  The liability, therefore, of the Exchequer can be doubled by the provisions of these two sections if CIE choose to use them in that way.  It is only reasonable, if there is some explanation of the kind that the Minister gives for the large increase in borrowing powers and guaranteeing powers, that that explanation, or the circumstances in which it is given, should be written into the legislation, rather than that CIE be handed an almost blank cheque, limited only by £45 million and enabling them to borrow that amount on top of all their existing borrowings.  Assuming this sections is passed as it is, they would not be in breach of the law if they incurred a further £45 million borrowings while repaying any of the £45 million that they have of short term borrowings at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley may possibly be under a misapprehension. This is not a favour that the Minister is doing CIE.  He is actually penalising them.  In recent years a financial formula was devised by me in order to bring CIE's finances under control and this has been very successful.  From 1969 to 1982 the CIE deficit escalated from £3 million approximately to £109.2 million.  If it had gone up by the rate of inflation in that very inflationary period, the deficit in 1982 would have been £12.5 million approximately.  It ended up almost seven times the rate of inflation.  Things had seriously gone off the rails.  Each year the jump in the deficit was a multiple of the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1982, since the financial formula and the controls were instigated, CIE's deficit in real terms has fallen.  A certain figure was committed to them.  In my battles as Minister with the Department of Finance, rather than forego that fund &mdash; because Finance were never happy with it even when it was working, never having given commitments for more than one year in advance &mdash; I agreed, as did CIE, that some of one year's subvention <Col N="2277" /> would be paid in arrears in January of the following year and so on.  In addition, there was a sum due to CIE in relation to the cost of DART.  That was part of the money owed, part of CIE credits. Instead of giving that money to CIE, the Minister is now writing off the debts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall repeat what the purpose of the subsection is.  It is to empower the board to borrow money on a long term basis, that is for periods in excess of 12 months, for meeting their obligations and carrying out their duties. The need for this provision is so that CIE can finance, on the basis of term loans, the borrowings required to meet the arrears that I have been talking about since we started the debate, those that are being offset against the repayable State advances.  The borrowings incurred to date in this matter have been temporary in nature, in other words, awaiting payments of the arrears.  They will be converted now into term loans.  As is normal in provisions of this kind, the board will require to obtain the consent <Col N="2278" /> of the Minister for Tourism and Transport and of the Minister for Finance before undertaking any borrowings under this section.  Borrowings in a currency other than the currency of the State are also provided for.  The actual borrowings will be controlled by me and by the Minister for Finance.  What we are doing here is meeting the arrears that were up to now dealt with in a short term borrowing context, by providing for term loans.</P>

      <P>As I understand, the import of these two amendments extends to CIE the normal banking facilities that would apply and be available to any other company working in the private or other sector in order to carry on their business properly.  It defeats me entirely to understand how anybody can suggest that this facility should not be available to CIE, as is proposed by these provisions.  Lest the opportunity pass of drawing some relationship to reality in this debate, would the Minister be able to advise us of the implications of the Progressive Democrats' amendment to curtail the facility by £35 million?  What practical advantage or use would the facility to borrow in this way be to CIE, in the curtailed fashion proposed in this amendment? Would the ceiling maximum of £10 million be of any practical benefit to them?  Would the Minister explain from whence the figure of £45 million emanates and the reasons for it and how it relates to the current scale of operations in which CIE are involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>To repeat what I have said already, the company had to borrow on short term to deal with this arrears problem and had been doing so up to, as of now, about £40 million.  This provision enables the company to borrow on a longer term, on the basis of term loans rather than short borrowings.  They were borrowing over short periods because they were expecting the money that had been promised to them to come up.  The matter is as simple as that and I do not think I should have to go into the implications of what it would mean if they <Col N="2279" /> were deprived of this sum of money which is essential for the running of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat the point I made earlier because the Minister has not dealt with it.  If this money is borrowed now on short term borrowings and it is proposed to convert it, as the Minister said, into long term borrowings, why is it that the section does not say that?  The section simply gives a blanket power to the board, provided it gets the various consents, to borrow £45 million.  There are no conditions about long term, short term or anything else; it is just straightforward borrowing.  In the course of his second intervention the Minister said that the amount they borrowed under this heading so far was £40 million, not £45 million.  Presumably they will be allowed to increase it by a further £5 million.  What is that for?  The Minister said it was for the arrears.  Is it the arrears the company owe in relation to DART? I thought that was written off in the previous section which allowed for a writeoff of £44.5 million?  Is it for accumulated losses over the years, over and above the £100 million subsidy they get each year? How did that figure of £40 million short term borrowings accumulate to make it necessary to transfer it into long term borrowings or, more or less, semi-permanent capital?</P>

      <P>I have explained to the House that in 1985, 1986 and 1987 moneys were pushed forward, they were not paid.  As well as that the ordinary subvention, £11 million plus, was transferred from 1987 to 1988.  The aggregate of those make up the amount of money we have been talking about.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the question of the State guarantee of the borrowings by the board.  It is a very long section with about 12 subsections. I notice in it very elaborate provisions about the State guaranteeing the CIE position.  I suppose, unfortunately, all this is necessary but it is a great pity that the State has this extraordinarily wide degree of exposure notwithstanding the payment of enormous subsidies each year for countless years past, subsidies which seem to be getting bigger rather than smaller and while the loss involved, too, seems to be getting bigger rather than smaller.  The State, obviously, is going to continue to have substantial exposure to CIE losses and borrowings to cover the losses in respect of railways. There is a limit as to what can be done in relation to them.  I share some of the misgivings expressed by Deputy Deasy. It is a question that one has to balance up and I suppose that for strategic reasons it is better that we retain our railway system.</P>
      <P>However, the position in relation to the bus side of the operation is quite different.  There is no strategic or other necessity to maintain, for example, the Dublin City bus services the way they are at the moment.  In fact, all commonsense cries out to heaven for a radical change to be made.  It is particularly frightening that in this year, CIE's estimate of their likely loss on the Dublin City bus service is £24 million.  That has occurred in a city where they have a total monopoly, not just the usual commercial monopoly where they are the biggest operator and can dominate the market but where they do not have any competition at all.  It is illegal to compete with them and anybody who tries is liable to be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate to the Minister that if he is going to try to control in any way the borrowings of the board that <Col N="2281" /> arise from their losses and, therefore, the State guarantee of them, he will have to look at what in any other country would be regarded as plain commonsense, to allow other people to compete and bring the monopoly in Dublin City transport to an end.  He will have to consider letting others in to compete to the benefit of everybody, not least of CIE whose hand would be strengthened if there was competition available in Dublin.  Their hand would be strengthened in dealing with the kind of nonsense we have seen in recent weeks and months with the dropof-a-hat strikes in various bus garages in Dublin which appear to take place for the most trivial of reasons and with appalling consequences for the travelling public.</P>
    <P>The approach I have suggested cries out to be taken.  I have no doubt that within a year or two it will be adopted. That reminds me of my efforts to get changes made in certain other areas when I was told so vehemently that I was so wrong but those changes did take place in those other areas of transport a year or two after I advocated them.  I am equally confident that they will take place in regard to Dublin City because they have to.  It flies in the face of commonsense to retain the present system of bus transport in this city, and in the country as a whole, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.  However, he is a great man to keep up the pretence until he has decided to make the change.  In my view the Minister should indicate now that commonsense demands that radical changes be made, that the type of changes that have taken place in other countries should and will happen here as quickly as they can be brought about.  If that statement was made today &mdash; I invite the Minister to make it &mdash; it would make the job of CIE management a great deal easier than it is.  It would bring a degree of reality into the affairs of CIE where it is notoriously lacking.  It was lacking from, for example, the affairs of the B &amp; I until recently when the ultimate reality stared them in the face.  The same thing applies to a number of other companies.</P>
    <P>The board and management of CIE would be greatly helped if that sort of <Col N="2282" /> statement was made now.  It will happen and all that is required now is a formal confirmation of that by the Minister.  The Minister would be serving the country well, and, in particular CIE, if he said that commonsense will be allowed to prevail.</P>

      <P>I regret the opportunity cannot be let pass to respond in some way to remarks made by Deputy O'Malley.  I do so as a Dublin Deputy who appreciates full well the importance of the CIE service to the people of Dublin, particularly working people living in the outer suburbs.  The suggestion coming forward here is that CIE have a total monopoly of the transport services in the city.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Dublin transport is not a monopoly.  CIE are in a major contest with the private motor car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major difficulties in the development of any adequate bus related service is, as the Minister told us this afternoon, that the rapid transit system will not be developed as it should be to service the outer rim towns &mdash; this point must be brought home &mdash; and the development of transport services in the city will be based upon the bus and the diesel engine.</P>
      <P>In regard to road transport no serious improvement can ever be expected as long as such second place is given to the public bus.  Whether in private control or in CIE control will make not one iota of difference.  If buses are to be the mainstay of transport in the city they can be effective only if given some priority over the private motor car on the traffic congested roads.  That is a major political issue that must be addressed long before we begin to talk about whether the buses that then run efficiently are CIE owned or privately owned.  There is not a total monopoly and that point should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another suggestion which has come back is that CIE are plagued in some <Col N="2283" /> way by drop-of-the-hat strikes, as Deputy O'Malley calls them.  The position was very well illustrated by reference to CIE's annual reports of the very good history of industrial relations in CIE over the past number of years.  It is a remarkable history in fact, unfortunately, marred in recent times by two disputes neither of which was entered in at the drop of a hat.  No worker at any level engages in strikes involving stoppage of work, or protest without pay in all kinds of weather, at the drop of a hat.  There is a history behind all strikes and the point was made in this House that it takes two to create this type of trouble.  I was intimately and closely involved with the issue in Clontarf, probably the worst of the two that come to mind immediately. There was more than simply the issue of workers at fault there, and the issues were far more complex and involved than the &ldquo;drop of a hat&rdquo; remark this afternoon would suggest.  The problem is that on the one hand people have belly-ached from time immemorial about the inadequacies or otherwise of services but are not prepared to face up to the fundamental issues that will put right one way or another the inadequacies of our services by giving backing to the only effective way of providing transport in the city or country, that is through publicly owned, properly competing, directed companies such as CIE.</P>

      <P>I thought I was discussing section 4 but the thing spread out into a philosophic discussion about public and private transport.  I recommend to the House section 4 which deals with the State guarantee for borrowings by the board, and the limitation is £45 million as can be seen in section 4(2).  Also there is a reference to borrowings in foreign currency and that the rate that will be applied is the rate of exchange that applied at the time of the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4(4) is important in that it provides that the Minister for Finance has to lay before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas after the end of the financial year particulars of any guarantee given, <Col N="2284" /> the amount paid and the amount of principal guaranteed which is outstanding at the end of the year.  Subsections (5) to (11), inclusive, deal with the powers of the Minister for Finance in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is in section 4(12) a formula for quantifying value in Irish currency of moneys payable under guarantee given by the Minister for Finance.  It is a very carefully thought out section, rationally developed, and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>That means the State is now, if this section is passed, providing for £200 million approximately or a little over to CIE, which is not a very happy prospect.  That is why Deputy Cullen on Second Stage and I and the PDs generally and many people with common sense wonder when it is all going to stop.  We just come along every couple of years and pass Bills of this nature with more and more guarantees to allow this kind of operation to draw more and more money out of what has come to be regarded as a bottomless pit.  I have no doubt that some successor of the Minister will be along here in a few years more, unless common sense prevails in the meantime, looking for a further £45 million or £50 million guarantee.  It is time to break the vicious circle and that might be done by the Minister making a statement of the kind I indicated to him where he agreed that it was the place but not the time.  I am glad he did not disagree very vehemently with me that it is only a question of timing, which is what I thought it would be.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 2, to delete &ldquo;£300&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£400&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6, as drafted, increases the penalty for breaches of CIE's penal by-laws from a maximum fine of £10 to a fine not exceeding £300 and/or a maximum of three months imprisonment.  The amendment would increase the fine to a maximum of £400.  There are 33 penal by-laws covering matters ranging from conduct on trains and getting on and off trains to more serious offences, such as throwing lighted substances on the floors of railway carriages, wilful destuction of property and interference with railway operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I introduced the Bill I considered the maximum penalties proposed in section 6 to be adequate.  However, since then I have had the benefit of the views of Members of this House, the media coverage and a number of approaches made to me direct and to other Members of the Government. These convinced me that a higher maximum monetary fine is needed and as a result I propose to increase the <Col N="2289" /> maximum fine to £400.  I consider the maximum imprisonment term orginally proposed to be appropriate for the offences covered.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to Deputy McCartan for communicating with me with regard to this section and the advice he and the Minister for Social Welfare gave me.  They are <i>au fait</i> with a lot of what is happening on suburban trains, buses and so on.</P>

      <P>We support the amendments proposed by the Minister and take this opportunity to re-emphasise that sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 seek to bring up to date the laws regulating the conduct of persons travelling by rail or on the railway line.  This is of particular importance for a Deputy like myself coming from a constituency with a rail service, in this instance the rapid transit rail service which is powered by electricity.  This system has been plagued over a number of years with unlawful interference along the routes.  For too long people have considered the railway line as a means of easy movement, and because it generally runs in a straight line, as an easy way of getting from one point to another, a place of curiosity, a place for play, and so on. We have to bring it home to the people living near railway lines, that they are not areas where such activities should take place.  In fact, they are highly dangerous places and people should stay away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally important that we bring up to date the penalties covering serious offences committed along the railways.  One of The Workers' Party amendments relates to the possibility of empowering CIE inspectors to impose on the spot fines for offences detected or noted during a train journey.  I do not know if that will meet with the approval of the House, but it is an idea which should be aired at this stage.  As I said, we are trying to bring the legislation up to date so that the Garda Síochána, or CIE officials, have the means to adequately deal with transgressions.  In <Col N="2290" /> the age of electrification, with increased urbanisation development near railway lines and particularly because of the increased speed of trains through builtup areas, the throwing of a missile, the laying of an object, moving livestock or people along the railway line, can be a source of major danger not only to the people who are wrongfully on the railway line but to people travelling in the trains and to the train drivers.  A stone of reasonable size thrown at a train travelling at approximately 60 miles an hour will strike the window of the train with the same impact as a pellet from a shotgun and that, to someone travelling on the train &mdash; a driver, an employee or a passenger &mdash; can cause horrendous injuries. It is important to have effective legislation and the penalties included here are reasonable and fair.  Obviously they relate to transportation offences in that if the act involves more heinous consequences there are obviously wider and more serious crimes of which the offender may be accused with consequent important and more serious penalties. However, from the point of view of a fair regime in our transport legislation, these provisions are an effective and summary way of dealing with offenders and I support the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 9, to insert the following new section: &ldquo;9. &mdash; Section 59 (2) (b) of the Act of 1950 is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very short and effective amendment in helping the authorities, the Garda Síochána or CIE to deal effectively with offences relating to trespass on railway lines.  The amendment proposes to delete subsection (2) (b) of the Transport Act, 1950.  Under this subsection, where a person is charged with an offence in respect of a trespass, he shall not in any case be convicted of the offence unless the board prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that at the date of the trespass there was affixed at the station of the board and at the level crossing nearest to the spot where the trespass is alleged to have been committed, a <Col N="2292" /> notice painted on board, or printed, painted or enamelled on iron or any other material in legible characters warning persons not to trespass on the railways of the board.</P>
    <P>Throughout the transport legislation, there are provisions making it incumbent on CIE, otherwise known as the board, to display at all points of access, level crossings and so on, warning signs to persons that it is illegal to trespass on the railway line and indicating the penalty that may be imposed should a person trespass.  We support that provision and many of us can see these signs all around the country warning people of the dangers. If anything, these signs should be improved.  In the light of the amendments to which we have agreed and the new sections, the notices should be improved to bring home to people the inherent dangers in trespassing or interfering with the railway lines or carriages.  The problem arises at a stage when a prosecution is brought.  It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove that CIE mounted these signs, that they were there on the day the particular offence is alleged to have occurred, that they have not been interfered with and that they were available to be observed.  In addition, I understand that in the practicalities of prosecuting, CIE often have to bring numerous witnesses to court with maps to prove that the point where the signs was erected was the nearest point of crossing or access to the railway line.  Considerable time, energy and expense can be involved in proving this technical point.  The House will appreciate the minefield this presents for the prosecution and the goldmine, on the basis of what is presented for the defence, in trying to exploit and defeat a prosecution.  We are simply asking for that subsection to be deleted, in other words, not making it a prerequisite of a proof for conviction.  Where a person is found on a railway line, it should not be incumbent on CIE to prove all the matters contained in subsection (2) (b). It does not take away from CIE the obligation of erecting the signs and seeing <Col N="2293" /> that they are there.  The number of prosecutions brought for trespass are miniscule in any one year, no more than five in 1984, the last known figures.  This is because of the penalties on the one hand and the intricacies of the proof on the other which do not make it worth while bothering with prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that if the elements obliterate the sign and this becomes apparent after the prosecution is initiated or if made aware to the court by the defence, the prosecution fails because it is clear from the subsection that the person shall not be convicted of the offence unless the board prove to the satisfaction of the court all the other matters required.  Therefore, we propose that the subsection should be deleted but that the signs and the warnings should be available to members of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the intention behind the amendment put down by Deputy McCartan was to prevent, in so far as possible, people who commit these offences escaping conviction on a technicality. I cannot accept it because we are substantially changing the whole scene. We must give reasonable notice because of the steep increase in fines and concomitant prison sentences.  Indeed, some people have written to me indicating that the fines are not steep enough.  It is fair that this section of the Transport Act, 1950 should be allowed to remain until the new penalities form themselves into the consciousness of people who commit these offences on the railways.  They will be a reminder of the offence and I presume they will also be a reminder of the fines.  I had a private conversation with Deputy McCartan about this.  I accept fully that it causes difficulty in getting a conviction.  The sign may be, as the Deputy said, blown down by the wind, defaced or painted over and it does make for more difficulty in getting a conviction. But as we are changing now, I submit to the House that it would not be wise in the interests of fair play to remove section 59 (2) (b) of the Transport Act, 1950. Some people might say that the kind of vandalism about which we are talking <Col N="2294" /> here does not deserve much sympathy, but my contention is that we should retain that section as of now especially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said.  In section 25 (2) of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1971, there is the legislative requirement that:</P>
      <P>The Board shall erect a notice at every level crossing or passage to which this section applies warning users that a person failing to shut and fasten either such gate after using the level crossing or passage is liable to prosecution.</P>
      <P>Throughout the legislative procedures of the railways there is the active duty on the board to erect signs.  I am not suggesting in this amendment that that duty should be taken away from them.  We are dealing here with the proofs and subsequent court hearing on a prosecution. I accept the argument and the point made about changing the scene, increasing the penalties and that things will be made more realistic in the matter of dealing with transgressions and trespasses on the railway lines.</P>
      <P>However, the point dealing with adequate notice made by the Minister can and must be dealt with under existing law, irrespective of our amendment.  The signs must be there and consequent to this legislation all will have to altered to make it clear what the penalties will be. I see a practical problem arising.  If a young offender is found on a railway line &mdash; later on the Minister is giving powers of arrest to the Garda Síochána &mdash; arrested and taken to a local Garda station, charged and is released that evening or the next night, if he is street wise or railway wise all he has to do is head back to the nearest level crossing or sign and make sure that, when the inspectors come to check for the purpose of proving their case, the sign is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried that if this loophole is left the penalties will never be impressed on the minds of those who are constantly around the railway line.  I have worked in this area for a number of years and I think the officials and the Minister will <Col N="2295" /> agree that in Dublin there is a sub-culture which lives off and around the railway lines.  Going towards Finglas and from Shandon upwards, around Sheriff Street, East Wall and in Kilbarrack they know every twist and turn and they are the source of the problem for CIE in running a safe system through the city.  I regret to say that if the realities of the legislation come out there will not be a warning sign left on one square inch of railway lines. They will be systematically taken out.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister that the notices and obligations to sustain the notices and maintain them will still be there in the legislation and I take the point that people should be adequately warned.  I will not exploit the adage <i>igno-rantia juris haud excusat</i> but we should be a bit more realistic about the practicalities of implementing sanctions in court subsequently where this very wideranging type of defence is available and I have no doubt will be exploited.  I ask the Minister to consider it and maybe he would do a simple piece of surgery by taking out paragraph (b) of the 1950 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be a brief reply. In the case quoted by Deputy McCartan &mdash; he mentioned that I am giving the Garda powers of arrest without warrant &mdash; there is no reason why the garda who arrested this galoot who was trespassing on the railway should not call the attention of the said galoot to the notice before he took him to the local Garda station. That would be proof that it was there. The garda would have proof that it was there no matter what subsequently this particular person did.  I know that Deputy McCartan has put together a finely woven argument and it is a good one.  The only weakness in it as far as I am concerned is that we have a new departure here: we are raising the fines substantially and we are raising the prison sentences substantially. I have no doubt that down the road a little this particular section of the 1950 Act could be excised but not as of now.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;11. &mdash;A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrent where the member has reasonable cause for believing that such person is committing or has committed an offence under&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  section 59 (1) of the Act of 1950,</P>
      <P>(b) section 25 (1) of the Act of 1971,</P>

      <P>(d) section 22 of the Regulation of Railways Act, 1868 (in so far as it relates to offences by passengers).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for powers of arrest &mdash; this has been mentioned already by Deputy McCartan and myself &mdash; without warrant by a garda who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is commiting or has committed any of the offences mentioned in the amendment.  The offences covered are trespass on the railway, failure to close gates at certain railway level crossings &mdash; and I believe from the information supplied to me this is quite common and it is malicious &mdash; any act which would endanger a passenger, or a person, on the railway and misuse by a passenger of the communication cord on trains.  We are all well aware of the problems arising from vandalism on the railways.  During my contribution on Second Stage I said that I was examining the question of giving the Garda powers of arrest without warrant where a member of the force suspects commission of an offence.  A number of Deputies also referred during that debate to the problems of the Garda in this area.  Deputy McCartan put down an amendment to provide the Garda with powers of arrest in the case of trespass.  I <Col N="2298" /> hope that the Deputy will now be in a position to withdraw his amendment as my amendment goes further in the area of improved enforcement.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this amendment will prove to be a valuable aid in ensuring safety for all who travel or work on the railway.  Before I sit down I would like also to endorse the remarks made by Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  She and the Fine Gael spokesman on Second Stage said they supported increasing penalties for offences.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw amendment No. 12 in the name of The Workers' Party in favour of that of the Minister.  I thank him on behalf of the other groups and representatives in the Dublin NorthEast constituency who, along with the Garda Síochána, lobbied his Department in relation to this important point.  In particular, I would like to take the opportunity to express my thanks to Inspector Tom Muldoon of Raheny Garda station who, probably as his last act as an inspector, took this issue on board.  He has recently retired from the force and I wish him well in his retirement.  I have no doubt he will have as colourful a time in his new endeavours as he had as a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was at a meeting in the constituency called by the manager of the suburban rail service that this whole issue came to light.  Because of the recurring problems for CIE along the DART line, in particular from Sutton Cross to Raheny, the rail authorities have had to take some unfortunate but necessary steps of employing security.  They have been holding public meetings, visiting schools and distributing leaflets around the area advising people of the essential social nature of the service being provided.  It was pointed out that a great deal of the serious attacks on trains travelling through the constituency were carried <Col N="2299" /> out by young people after school hours who seem to have been entirely mindless of the extent of the dangers they were causing by interfering with the railway line.  Perhaps it reached a high water mark when a stupid naive young man who now appreciates fully his position climbed on to the bridge in the constituency and lowered a breeze block by rope to the level of the unfortunate train driver who was passing through.  This pendulum swung in front of the train nearly causing an incredibly serious accident. Thankfully, the driver has made a full recovery from that experience.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, was this whole culture, so to speak, that the railway line was a place of easy access which gave people an opportunity to travel along it in order to get from one place to another. The attitude was that it was open road to everyone.  The Garda and CIE were called in to sit down with local representatives and groups to discuss the problem and for the first time it became apparent that up to now the Garda Síochána did not have the power or authority to remove a person from the line unless they were called specifically by CIE and requested by an officer of CIE to take action to remove the person from the line.  Up to now the penalty for trespassing on a railway line has been £2 maximum, a non-arrestable offence.  No doubt that was reasonable at the time legislation was first brought into being. As I said earlier, at that time our rail traffic did not travel at the speeds they do now, they were not powered by electricity and they did not have huge suburban built-up areas around them but times have now changed.</P>
    <P>On many occasions the Garda Síochána were frustrated when they witnessed disturbances at or about the railway lines and did not have the power of arrest. I am glad the Minister has tabled this amendment and has taken the point.  I am assured by the Garda Síochána that they will put this power to good use.  I have no doubt that the message will come home to people, slowly but surely, that our railway lines are important areas providing <Col N="2300" /> an essential service and are not areas of recreational recourse for people seeking to travel along them other than by using the railways.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has expanded on the powers envisaged in our amendment but I bow to the better wisdom of the authorities in saying that it would be useful to have &mdash; and I can see the advantage of having &mdash; the powers in the other areas.  All powers of arrest must be exercised with due caution and on reasonable cause and this area will be no different.  I am sure that where there are minor transgressions that require simply a word of caution that will be given by the Garda Síochána.  Where serious offences have been committed or are likely to be committed, an effective remedy is available where the person can be brought into custody and the law will take its natural course thereafter.  I thank the Minister and I welcome his amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11. &mdash;(1)  This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations to be offences to which this Section applies, namely, any offence under the Act of 1950, the Act of 1971, the Regulation of Railways Act, 1868 and the Regulation of Railways Act, 1889.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where an Inspector of Iarnród Éireann-Irish Rail has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence to which this Section applies, he may deliver to the person a Notice in a form prescribed by Regulations made by the Minister stating:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> (a) that the person is alleged to have committed the offence,</P>
    <P>(b) that the person may, during the period of 21 days beginning on the date of the notice, make to larnród Éireann a payment of a prescribed amount, accompanied by the Notice,</P>
    <P>(c)  that a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will not be instituted during the period specified in the Notice and, if the payment specified in the Notice is made during that period, no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will be instituted.</P>
    <P>(3) Where a Notice is delivered under a sub-section (2):</P>
    <P>(a) a person to whom the Notice applies may, during the period specified in the Notice, make to Iarnród Éireann-Irish Rail the payment specified in the Notice, accompanied by the Notice,</P>
    <P>(b) Iarnród Éireann may receive the payment, issue a receipt for it and retain the money so paid in accordance with Regulations made by the Minister, and no payment so received shall in any circumstances be recoverable by the person who made it,</P>
    <P>(c)  a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence shall not be instituted during the period specified in the Notice, and, if the payment specified in the Notice is made during that period, no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence shall be instituted.</P>
    <P>(4)  Different amounts may be prescribed for the purposes of subsection (2) (b) of this Section in respect of different offences and offences alleged to have been committed in particular places or different areas.</P>
    <P>(5) In a prosecution for an offence to which Section applies the onus of showing that a payment pursuant to a Notice under this Section has been <Col N="2302" /> made shall be on the Defendant.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Minister may make Regulations prescribing any matter or thing referred to in this Section.</P>
    <P>(7) A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this Section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment on behalf of The Workers' Party.  It is a long and detailed amendment but one that can be very simply explained.  I do not propose to read it through entirely but I will take it in general terms section by section.  The amendment proposes to introduce a régime that allows a railway inspector, where he witnesses offences being committed in the course of a rail journey, to impose on-the-spot fines or notice of fines.  It is similar to the powers available to traffic wardens who deal with parking, tax and other offences relating to stationary motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>At present train fares can cost up to £30, if not more.  Clearly, because of the size of that fare there is a great incentive on a passenger to simply apply the traditional means of avoiding paying a fare and saying: &ldquo;I am sorry, I do not have money, I cannot pay, take my name and address&rdquo;.  I know this is an often-used device on buses and in particular on trains.  I do not believe CIE have ever successfully, if at all, prosecuted or pursued to any great extent a person for failure to pay a fare.  It would be very useful if an inspector who suspected he was dealing with someone who was merely trying to avoid the payment of the fare could issue the person with a notice of an on-the-post penalty.  That would lay on the person the onus to respond within 21 days by payment of the fine imposed or by electing, in the case of non-payment, to have the matter determined by a court of summary jurisdiction at a day appointed and to argue the matter before the judge of a District Court.</P>
    <P>This amendment is drafted along the <Col N="2303" /> lines of the provisions allowed for under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 and 1968, which creates powers for traffic wardens and establish their authority to impose on the-spot fines.  It has been suitably amended to deal with Iarnród Éireann and for that reason I do not think there should be any difficulty in the drafting.  I anticipate that the Minister may feel that there are practical difficulties attached to it but I understand from my inquiries that Iarnród Éireann would welcome this addition to the powers available to them to deal with people who do not give the rail service its due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The offences mentioned in subsection (1) and in the amendment are varied ones and they vary with regard to seriousness.  The amendment would cast me in the role of somebody who would have to codify the offences and while I would not mind being a Napoleon I do not want those powers of codifying various offences into separate categories for the purpose of laying down fines.  I wonder if the inspectors would welcome that in circumstances where somebody would hang a breeze block down and almost behead a driver.  The Deputy referred to traffic wardens but the traffic warden has a very simple task &mdash; a car either is or is not in a wrong place and he or she writes the chit and affixes it.  There is no place for subjectivity at all in that but in the many and varied things covered by the amendment there would be areas of subjectivity and consequently a fairly heavy burden, first, on the Minister and, secondly, on the inspector.  In is the function of the courts to assess an alleged offence having regard to the circumstances of each case and to determine the penalty.  We have substantially increased the penalties for offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendment, however much work went into it.  The amendment is inappropriate and it conflicts with the existing provisions of the law.  It would be setting up two systems. It would give the Garda powers of arrest without warrant and it would give powers also to CIE inspectors.  CIE inspectors <Col N="2304" /> would be put in a very difficult position which could attract hostility.  They would have to make qualitative type judgments as well.  This would not be appropriate. They themselves are employees of the company and consequently <i>nemo iudex in sua causa</i> would apply here as well.  The inspectors would be acting as judge and jury with regard to the offence. The purpose behind the amendment is to improve enforcement in relation to the business of the railways but on the basis that we have already accepted amendments providing for very substantial penalties I am afraid I am not willing to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not suggest that we set up a conflicting system of authority taking away from the Garda Síochána their role, as already agreed, in the previous amendments. What is suggested here is that the Minister, looking at the range of offences covered by the various Acts referred to and the regulations referred to can identify offences that could be covered by on-the-spot penalties.  I do not suggest for a moment that the unfortunate breeze block incident is one that would be appropriate for this.  What this amendment is trying to address is the proper order of persons who have recourse to a rail journey. We must remember that we are dealing with carriages travelling at speed and often nonstop from one city to another that there can be disturbances, that disrespect can be shown for other passengers or for the authority of inspectors on the train and that they would be assisted by an opportunity to impose a penalty.  An immediate offence that comes to mind is the non-payment of a fare.  The person in question can admit his error and can realise that he would have no cause if he went to court.  It is open to the person to say that he was wrong and this is the basis on which the whole on-the-spot fine system works.  I know that things are clear cut in so far as a tax disc must be displayed or that a car is in the wrong place, but a person can make a defence citing an emergency, or a mishap that can obviate the imposition of the penalty.  It is open to <Col N="2305" /> a motorist to refuse to pay the fine and to go to court and plead his case.  Equally, a person on a train can do the same. Offences like causing damage to fittings, interfering with property, scratching graffiti on the walls of toilets and putting feet on the seats should be dealt with by the inspector by the imposition of a fine. How often have we watched the spectacle on trains of some people refusing to respond to a request from an inspector to keep their feet off the seats?  That kind of thing can be dealt with effectively by this type of procedure.  The regimes on foreign rail services are far more strict and one dare not abuse the facilities because of the penalties that would be imposed if one did.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to press this amendment but I felt it important that the issue be aired because it is a question that will come back to this House in the future.  In that context will the Minister indicate whether his Department have had the opportunity to discuss the desirability of this suggestion with representatives of CIE?  I understand that CIE and Iarnród Éireann are anxious to have powers analagous to this and are anxious to introduce this into their regime because they do not have an effective way of dealing with people who do not show the appropriate respect to a social service like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The sentiments of the amendment are very noble but it could not be enforced.  It would be possible to enforce it if we were a very regular well disciplined society but when one considers the loutish behaviour that one has to endure on public transport there I despair of ever being able to enforce anything like this.  If an inspector handed one of these people a notice requiring a payment the person would use two words which we all know but which I will not repeat in the House and that would be the last one would see of him, the fine or anything else.  The fact that the Minister has increased the penalties in some of these latter section does not really matter because a system of enforcement is not there.  I wish somebody would contradict <Col N="2306" /> me and prove that I am wrong but my experience is that it is not there.</P>
      <P>I do not travel as much by train now as I once did but I expect to do so again shortly.  I have had so many bad experiences of that type of behaviour on Irish railways that I cannot see that the system would work.  It does not happen on the Continent or in Britain because people will immediately object and there will be law enforcement agencies on the spot to meet the train.  In this country we have a casual system where everybody takes things in their stride, whether good, bad or indifferent &mdash; and they are mainly bad and indifferent.  I do not see it succeeding, although I wish it would.  We need to bring discipline into our society.  I cannot envisage us catching a fellow who pulls a communication cord, breaks a window, spills drink over somebody or insults somebody.  We have not yet come to that mature stage as a society whereby we have the resources to apprehend culprits. Loutish behaviour is seen not just on public transport but in the streets and in restaurants.  It is everywhere.  It is most awful in the confines of a bus or train because one is stuck with it for the duration of the journey.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment is fine but I do not think it has a snowball's chance in hell of being implemented, nor have many of the fines and penalties in the Bill generally.  We are not dedicated to pursuing people who break the law. We accept as a matter of fact that they should get away.  It is totally wrong.  It is one of the greatest impediments in our society that we are so prepared to let people of this nature get away with it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be cynical but I do not see great justification for increasing the fines as proposed in the amendments and with the best will in the world I cannot see that what Deputy McCartan is proposing would work.  I would be quite happy to support it if I believed otherwise but I do not think there is any hope whatsoever.</P>

      <P>I had an experience in a neighbouring country which I never saw on the Dublin to Cork or Dublin to Belfast run.  As a student, I was very impressed by notices in railway stations in Spain which stated &ldquo;look after your train&rdquo; and &ldquo;look after your railway station&rdquo;. These signs carried a strong message of which we in this country could take cognisance.  The difficulty of dealing with people who in the first place break some kind of rule or refuse to pay fares would be as Deputy Deasy suggests.  If they were law abiding and socially responsible people they would not be in that state in the first place.  I have no doubt that the railway inspector would have grave difficulty in extracting a fare from somebody refusing to pay or in putting him under control.  We have put into the Bill sufficient penalties and powers for the Garda to see to it that some of these abuses will be wiped off our social map.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are three main elements of the Bill being discussed this evening &mdash; measures to counteract employer fraud and abuse, changes in contribution conditions and entitlements and trade dispute provisions.</P>
      <P>First, I am introducing a number of measures to tighten up the present legislation in regard to the abuse of social welfare.  These measures are directed at employers who are abusing the system or who collude in social welfare abuse by their employees.  We have made significant progress in tackling abuse this year and the new powers which I am seeking will close loopholes in the existing legislation.  Sections 2 to 7 of the Bill contain these measures.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill gives effect to certain of the measures which were announced at the time of publication of the 1988 Estimates and which have been provided for in those Estimates.  These involve mainly adjustments in the conditions for payments for long term disability and in the old maternity allowance scheme. They also include an improvement for disabled old age pensioners in exempting the mobility allowance from the means test.  These measures are contained in sections 8 to 11 of the Bill, the second part of section 16 and in section 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, the Bill provides for a significant improvement in the conditions for entitlement to unemployment payments during trade disputes by providing that only persons who are participating in or directly interested in the dispute will be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit or assistance.  The Bill <Col N="2309" /> also includes a provision which will enable workers to have their case reviewed by the Social Welfare Tribunal in the light of new facts or evidence. These provisions are included in sections 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill contain a number of provisions designed to rationalise and improve other aspects of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>At the outset I should like to say a few words about social welfare fraud and to put this issue into context.  Total expenditure in the social welfare area in the current year is over £2.6 billion, the equivalent of £7 million for each day of the year.  Each month, almost three million payment transactions are made.  The number of persons in receipt of unemployment payments each week is in the region of 230,000.  Seventy-three thousand persons receive disability benefit payments, 238,000 persons receive old age or retirement pensions and almost 100,000 receive widow's pensions.</P>
    <P>There is conclusive evidence that a certain amount of fraudulent claiming exists. Invariably, however, when action is taken to combat these abuses there are those who will suggest that those in need are being harassed or even discouraged from claiming their legitimate entitlements. There can be no doubt that the vast majority of claimants have a legitimate entitlement to their payment.  I am very conscious of my responsibilities, as Minister for Social Welfare, to ensure that such claimants receive an efficient and a courteous service.  I am equally conscious, however, of my responsibilities to taxpayers generally to ensure that any abuses of the system are rooted out and dealt with.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the true level of abuse vary, but our indicators suggest that between 5 and 10 per cent of claimants to unemployment and disability benefit payments abuse the system at some stage of their claim.  This is not, of course, the same as saying that 5-10 per cent of expenditure on those benefits is defrauded but refers to the number of claimants who engage in abuse at some stage in their claim.  This year, for <Col N="2310" /> instance, we are well on target to achieve savings in excess of £36 million within my Department through a series of measures, including some to eliminate fraud and abuse and others to achieve more effective use of resources, for example, by providing opportunities for the longterm unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am committed to continuing this work to reduce abuse to the greatest extent possible and I am satisfied that this can be done without adversely affecting in any way the quality of service provided to legitimate claimants.  In fact, it must be said that it is to the advantage of legitimate claimants that this be done as the elimination of fraud and abuse will serve to maximise the resources available to those genuinely in need.</P>
    <P>In this connection I was glad to be able to announce earlier this afternoon that the alleviating payments being paid to those affected by the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986 &mdash; which the Government has already extended to the end of 1987 &mdash; are being further extended to the end of March next at a cost of approximately £5 million.  The eventual phasing out of these payments will be considered in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>When I addressed the House in October during the debate on the 1988 Estimates I made known that the Government had decided to pursue an intensive campaign against fraud and abuse.  A great deal of work has already been done in this area particularly in dealing with abuse of the unemployment and disability benefit payment schemes.</P>
    <P>One of the most successful measures taken was the establishment of the Department's external control unit.  The principal activity of this unit, which now has a complement of 19 staff, is that of reviewing claims to unemployment payments, usually by way of interviewing claimants.  Because of the very close liaison between this unit and other divisions of my Department, claimants are interviewed where, in the light of the specific information obtained, there is reason to believe that the person may not have a legitimate entitlement.  In this way, legitimate <Col N="2311" /> claimants are not affected and, at the same time, the activities of the unit are much more productive.  Of 8,329 claimants called for interview by this unit in the current year to review their entitlement to unemployment payments, 1,255 ceased claiming, of which 915 did so voluntarily. The overall savings in 1987 arising from the activities of this unit are estimated at £2.7 million.</P>
    <P>There is also a special investigation unit within my Department assigned the specific task of the investigation of allegations of concurrent working and signing. This unit has been strengthened considerably in recent years and now consists of 42 staff.  Of 4,558 claims to unemployment payments investigated by the unit up to August of this year, 1,227 were disallowed.  The savings in 1987 arising from the overall activities of the special investigation unit are estimated at £4 million.</P>
    <P>One of the other significant measures taken in this area during the past year was the strengthening of my Department's internal audit unit.  This unit reviews on an ongoing basis the systems of internal control in the various branches of my Department so as to ensure that they are both adequate and functioning effectively. Where such reviews bring deficiencies to light remedial action is taken.  The continuing activities of the internal audit section are designed to bring about an overall improvement in the level of efficiency of the administration of the various schemes.</P>
    <P>In any organisation as big as my Department it is necessary to constantly review the internal control procedures in order to ensure that the scope for mistakes or deliberate fraud is minimised. There is always the danger that basic control procedures may be allowed to falter in the continuing effort to ensure that clients are paid as quickly as possible. The possibility of internal fraud must also be recognised and measures taken to prevent it.  There have been a small number of instances of internal fraud in the Department.  All such cases are dealt with <Col N="2312" /> in the same way as for external fraud, including prosecution.</P>
    <P>During recent years there has been a massive and rapid programme of computerisation within my Department which has given rise to significant benefits.  In July this year I signed a contract for £2.6 million worth of additional computers for the Department, mainly for the employment exchanges and to implement my plans for more localised delivery of services to claimants.  Computerisation in the area of unemployment payments and the greater integration of data across the schemes, which computerisation facilitates, will lead to improved control measures to prevent abuses such as duplicate claiming.  At this stage the preparation and calculation of all unemployment assistance claims in the Dublin area is computerised and work is proceeding on unemployment benefit claims.  This will be completed by mid1988. At the same time computerisation is being extended to a number of centres outside Dublin, notably Cork, where unemployment assistance claims will shortly be going on computer.  It is my intention to have a telecommunications network linking all the Department's local offices over the next four years.  This ongoing programme of computerisation will ultimately facilitate the cross-checking of applicants for all schemes administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>In the disability benefit scheme, the transfer of the operation of the system from the central computing service of the former Department of Public Service to my Department's computers has resulted in greater flexibility of operational control and development of the system.  It has also enabled the computerisation of the medical referral system.  This has allowed greater selectivity in the referral of claimants to medical referees.  The manual system of processing referrals was slow and cumbersome and, as a result, it was not possible to refer many short-duration cases for examination.  In addition to the improved efficiency achieved through the computerisation of the system, the number of medical referees has been increased from 18 to 22 and <Col N="2313" /> computerisation of the system has allowed greater selectivity in the referral of claimants to medical referees.  Of 88,000 claimants referred to a medical referee this year, 19,000 were found to be capable of work and 3,000 ceased to claim benefit.  A further 19,000 persons failed to attend for examination and, except in a small number of cases where there was good reason for their failure to attend, they were liable to a nine week disqualification and a second referral.</P>
    <P>These control measures have helped to bring about a significant reduction in the number of people claiming disability benefit this year.  The numbers claiming each week have in fact gone down from almost 82,000 early in the year, February, to 72,500 in December, a drop of over 9,000 a week.  There has been a saving of around £8.6 million on disability and invalidity payments this year.</P>
    <P>Further measures in the campaign against abuse of the system will be taken in the light of the final report of the independent consultants who have examined the whole range of controls and administrative practices applied to areas where we are most at risk.  The reports of the consultants highlight a number of policy issues which need to be addressed and contain specific recommendations relating to organisation and procedural matters.  Work on a detailed plan on foot of the consultants' findings has already commenced and the services of the consultants are being utilised in this work.</P>
    <P>My Department have made and will continue to make a determined effort to achieve the maximum deterrent effect by following a vigorous programme of pursuit of fraud cases through to prosecution. In the case of disability benefit for instance, 125 cases have already been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution this year as against 37 in all of 1986.  Of the 45 cases finalised in court this year, there were 12 suspended prison sentences and 17 prison sentences in total.  In one case a sentence of 12 months was imposed and in the other cases the sentences ranged from three to seven months.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to ensure that <Col N="2314" /> unscrupulous employers who abuse the social welfare system will be pursued through to prosecution with the same vigour as are fraudulent claimants.  While the majority of employers do not engage in such practices, there are others who do.  For example, we know that some unscrupulous employers collude with employees to facilitate fraudulent claiming of unemployment and disability benefit payments.  Certain cases have even come to light where the employer provided transport for employees to the local employment exchange.  In other instances, employers refuse to co-operate with or they may even obstruct social welfare officers in carrying out their investigations, for example, by delaying the inspector's examination of records of employees and their social insurance contributions.  My Department already have powers to take prosecutions in cases of collusion or obstruction and there are existing penalties of fines up to £1,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment on summary conviction and fines up to £3,000 and/or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment for employers who are found guilty of these offences. However, only a limited number of such prosecutions have been taken against employers in the past.  I intend to ensure that these powers will now be used to the greatest possible extent to prevent abuse.</P>
    <P>Similarily, I am determined that effective action be taken against employers who withhold or delay payment of PRSI contributions.  While the primary responsibility for the collection of contributions rests with the Revenue Commissioners I plan to ensure that the inspectorate of my Department will have a sufficiently active role in this area.  The investigation branch of my Department already carry out periodic surveys of employer's records so as to ensure compliance with the PRSI provisions.  In the current year to end-November underpayments by over 2,250 employers, totalling some £3.4 million have been detected and reported to the Revenue Commissioners.  Certain changes in administrative practices made in recent times will result in additional resources <Col N="2315" /> becoming available for this purpose. Recently also a joint inspection unit drawn from the Revenue and Social Welfare inspectorates was set up on a pilot basis to investigate enterprises which are known to have a high incidence of tax and social welfare fraud.  The pilot scheme is being evaluated at present to see how this type of joint action can be developed next year.  Furthermore the ongoing programme of computerisation to which I have referred will significantly increase the effectiveness of the inspection branch in detecting instances of abuse by enabling much more comprehensive information relating to the employer to be compiled in advance of the survey. This will help to ensure better targeting of resources in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of areas have been identified however, in which existing powers to pursue employers who abuse the system are inadequate and need to be strengthened. Sections 2 to 7 inclusive of this Bill are designed to meet these requirements.</P>
    <P>In many cases where fraud comes to light the employer and the employee collude to reduce substantially the period of overclaiming.  For example, the working and claiming may have been going on for several years before it is detected but both parties may represent that the employment is only of recent origin.  In some instances, employers take on new employees on the specific understanding that the person concerned will continue to draw unemployment payments.  The employee gains or perhaps more correctly, the Exchequer loses, through the non-payment of tax and social insurance contributions while the employer benefits through payment of reduced wages and often undercuts his legitimate competitors as a result.  This has to stop.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is designed to discourage such collusion by enabling the Minister to make regulations requiring employers to notify the Department of the commencement of employment for each new employee.  It is not intended that employers will be required to notify the Department of the commencement <Col N="2316" /> of employment in every case.  The circumstances in which notification shall be required and the manner of notification is to be prescribed in regulations.  As this provision is designed to counter the activities of unscrupulous employers every effort will be made in drafting the regulations to avoid placing any unnecessary burden on employers generally. For example, it is not envisaged that notification will be required in the case of employees changing employment where the employee produces the appropriate documentation provided by his previous employer.  The introduction of this requirement in the case of persons who, prior to taking up employment, were in receipt of unemployment payments will be an effective weapon in the elimination of collusion between employers and employees in fraudulently claiming unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of employees is essential if abuse of the system is to be effectively dealt with.  It is important that employers satisfy themselves that employees they engage are not at the same time claiming social welfare benefits. This is essentially what section 2 of the Bill is designed to achieve.  Another time at which co-operation by employers is necessary is when employees claim benefits under the system.  The Department regularly ask employers to confirm details of periods of employment or absence from work through illness so as to verify claims to benefit or assistance. In the case of disability benefit claims for instance, random checks of this nature have proved to be extremely effective in the detection of abuse.  For example of 14,000 inquiries sent out to employers to check on persons claiming disability benefit 1,100 cases of possible abuse were revealed and overpayments of £460,000 have been detected to date.  This year we have introduced a more effective system of following up these random checks by targeting particular industries.  For example, in one major recent fraud investigation where a claimant was in employment during the period in which he was claiming disability benefit, a check of other employees with the same employer <Col N="2317" /> established that 22 of them were also working and claiming.  Following on this a check on two other employers in the same industry in the same region brought to light a further 155 cases or fraudulent claiming, 177 altogether.  A number of successful prosecutions have already been taken and further court cases arising from these investigations are pending. The issue of medical certificates in these cases is also being investigated.  This resulted from the new approach adopted.</P>
    <P>Most employers co-operate with requests for information to facilitate these random checks and I wish to record my appreciation for the level of co-operation which exists.  However, some employers do not co-operate and sanctions are required against those employers who consistently fail to assist in these investigations.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for sanctions which can be applied in the case of employers who fail to assist in investigations of claims to insurance based payments and section 4 provides for a similar measure in the case of claims for assistance.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of co-operation with employers is in the area of inspection of employer records.  Under existing provisions, employers may be required to furnish such information and documents as may reasonably be required by a social welfare inspector for the purpose of investigation of claims.  Sometimes it happens that employers delay inspectors in their examination of the required records by claiming that they are held by accountants or solicitors, who, in turn may say that they only hold a portion of the records.  Section 5 is designed to counter evasive actions of this nature by imposing an obligation on employers to produce the required records at the employer's registered address or his principal place of business.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions, employers are required to keep such records in relation to the earnings of persons employed by them and the periods of employment.  There is no provision in existing legislation, however, specifying the time at which these details should be recorded.  While most reputable <Col N="2318" /> employers make the necessary entries in their records at regular intervals, some employers fail to maintain any records at all, or perhaps do so long after the event. Where this happens, it proves impossible to determine the true position in relation to such matters as the number of persons employed, the periods of employment, whether correct deductions of social insurance have been made and whether any other aspects of the social insurance scheme are being neglected or abused by the employer, or any of his employees. It also serves to prevent the detection of cases of employees who may also be concurrently signing for unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>Failure to record the prescribed particulars on time can mean that if and when the records are eventually compiled, they may not reflect the true position. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to thwart an inquiry, to lessen the employer's liability, or to cloak irregularities either by the employer or his employees.  Section 6 is designed to overcome these problems by providing that details of earnings and the periods to which they refer must be recorded at or before the time of payment of wages.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for an amendment so as to empower social welfare inspectors, for unemployment benefit purposes, to enter premises where self-employed persons are, or were, engaged in their occupations.  The existing provisions refer only to premises where records relating to persons in insurable employment are kept.  In recent years there has been a significant move towards contracting out work which up until now was performed by the employer's own employees, for instance, milk deliveries and the distribution of home fuels.  The powers contained in section 7 of the Bill are necessary to help counter abuses such as employees being represented as sub-contractors so as to avoid payment of social insurance provisions in respect of their employees, concurrent working and signing by sub-contractors and failure by sub-contractors to comply with the social insurance provisions in respect of their employees.  This amendment will bring <Col N="2319" /> the unemployment benefit provisions into line with those for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the additional powers which are being provided in this Bill are directed at unscrupulous employers and not at those who are running their business in an honest and legitimate way.  I value the operation of the system and I would appeal to those employers to maintain this level of co-operation in the future.  I want to appeal especially in this regard to those honest employers in industries and sectors in which abuse is known to be prevalent, because only in this way will we together be able to root out abuse effectively.</P>
    <P>In regard to changes in contribution conditions the second main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to certain changes in social welfare schemes which were provided for in the Estimates.  These include minor adjustments in contribution conditions for certain schemes and a number of changes in the old maternity allowance scheme.  In general, these measures are designed to help achieve better targeting of resources.  In adopting these measures, the Government were conscious of the need to ensure that existing claimants are not adversely affected and consequently the changes being made will apply to new claimants only.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill provide for changes in the contribution conditions for entitlement to certain insurance based benefits.  Section 8 provides that entitlement to extended duration of disability benefit, that is, beyond 12 months, for all new claimants from 4 January 1988 onwards, will require 260 paid contributions. These contributions entitle the claimant to disability benefit for as long as he is incapable of work and is under pensionable age.  This benefit can continue for some long term claimants for as long as 40 years.  Section 9 provides that entitlement to invalidity pension for new claimants after 4 January 1988 will also require 260 paid contributions. Under existing provisions.  208 paid contributions are required for both of these payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2320" /> These measures are designed to achieve more realistic contribution conditions for entitlement to these long term payments by requiring that claimants have a reasonable history of paid contributions. The increased contributions for extended duration of disability benefit and invalidity pension will apply to new claimants only.  Persons who make repeat claims on or after 4 July 1988 in the same period of interruption of employment, however, will have to satisfy the increased contribution conditions.  A number of changes in this area have been made in recent years and, in fact, the provisions of sections 8 and 9 of the Bill were included in the 1987 budget proposals of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>A further change to the disability benefit scheme is contained in Section 16 of the Bill which provides for the introduction of three waiting days from April 1988 onwards for claimants to disability benefit transferring directly from maternity allowance to disability benefit. All new claimants for disability benefit at present must serve three waiting days and this provision merely extends this requirement to cases where people transfer directly to disability benefit, having been in receipt of maternity allowance.</P>
    <P>A number of changes are being made to the old general scheme of maternity allowance.  There are two schemes of maternity allowance.  The old maternity allowance scheme which was introduced under the National Insurance Act, 1911, provided for a payment to insured women for a period of 12 weeks, subject to certain contribution conditions being met. The second scheme, the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment, was introduced by me as Minister for Social Welfare in April, 1981.  This scheme, which provides for a period of 14 weeks' payment is available to women who are on maternity leave from work under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981 and who are entitled to resume work with the same employer at the end of the period of maternity leave.  This scheme effectively superseded the old maternity scheme for <Col N="2321" /> women in employment.  In order to eliminate any confusion which may exist, I would emphasise that entitlements under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment remain in full and are not affected in any way by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that entitlement to maternity allowance under the old general maternity allowance scheme for new claims from 4 January 1988 will be restricted to claimants who have at least 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year.  Under existing provisions, a claimant may qualify for the allowance on the basis of only credited contributions in that year.  Section 10 also provides that from January next onwards, only contributions in the governing contribution year will be taken into account in determining eligibility for the allowance, as is already the case with unemployment benefit and disability benefit entitlement.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions, entitlement to the allowance may be established on the basis of 39 paid or credited contributions in the last complete contribution year before the beginning of the benefit year in which the claim is made, referred to as the governing contribution year, or in a subsequent complete contribution year, if any, before the allowance is due to commence.  For example, the governing contribution year in the case of a claim made in December, 1987 would be the income tax year ended 5 April 1986.  If the claimant is unable to satisfy the contribution conditions in this year, however, she may still qualify for the allowance on the basis of contributions in the contribution year, that is, the year ended 5 April 1987.  Section 10 provides that from January next onwards, the requirement that the claimant have 39 paid or credited contributions must be satisfied in the governing contribution year.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for the abolition of entitlement to pay-related benefit in the case of all new claims for the old maternity allowance scheme which commence on or after 4 April, 1988.  This will not affect the level of benefit payable <Col N="2322" /> under the new maternity allowance scheme, which will continue to be related to earnings.</P>
    <P>The changes which are being made to the old general scheme of maternity allowance are designed to ensure that only women with a recent attachment to the workforce will qualify for the allowance. Many of the claimants under the old scheme have been signing the register for credits only and claim on the basis of these credits and they have no real attachment to the workforce.  The need for the old scheme has, to a large extent, been superseded by the introduction of the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment and I expect that henceforth the needs of women in this area will be met by this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a technical amendment relating to the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment. Under existing provisions the maximum amount of the allowance payable is equal to 70 per cent of the claimant's weekly earnings up to the earnings limit prescribed for pay releated benefit purposes, currently £11,000 per year. Interpretation of existing provisions has been questioned however and the purpose of section 12 is to clarify the definition of &ldquo;reckonable weekly earnings&rdquo; applied in the calculation of the allowances. I emphasise however that this is a technical amendment which does not affect in any way entitlements under the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides for an amendment to the trade dispute provisions, under which persons who have lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work, may be disqualified for receiving unemployment payments or supplementary welfare allowance.  This amendment is being made as under existing provisions persons who do not stand to gain materially from a strike by fellow workers may be prevented from obtaining unemployment benefit or assistance and supplementary welfare allowance if they are, for example, regarded as being members of the same trade or class of workers engaged in the dispute.  Section <Col N="2323" /> 13 provides that persons will no longer be automatically disqualified from receiving unemployment payments or supplementary welfare allowance on such grounds.  The only circumstances in which the trade disputes disqualification will apply in future is where the person concerned is participating in or directly interested in the dispute.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for an amendment of the powers of the Social Welfare Tribunal which I established in 1982 as a result of a number of disputes in which a large number of workers were refused unemployment payments.  Representations have been made to the effect that it can happen at the time the tribunal is sitting, which often occurs during the actual course of a stoppage, that all the detailed facts and information surrounding the dispute may not be readily to hand.  In these circumstances it is felt that the tribunal should have power to review its decision.  This amendment is designed to allow the tribunal review its decision where new evidence or new facts are brought to its attention subsequent to the date of the original decision.  Under existing provisions the tribunal is only empowered to review an earlier decision where it is satisfied that a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the stoppage of work or the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work.  This amendment will bring the tribunal's powers of review generally into line with those of appeals officers.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of other miscellaneous provisions designed to rationalise and improve aspects of the social welfare system.  The provisions of section 15 arise from the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986, as part of the implementation of the EC Equality Directive, and provide for an amendment of the definition of &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo;, so as to preclude certain cateogories of person from qualifying as adult dependants.  The categories involved are persons who are disqualified from receiving unemployment payments in their own right, by virtue of their involvement in a trade dispute, and <Col N="2324" /> participants of certain fulltime AnCO non-craft training courses.</P>
    <P>Under existing provisions, persons disqualified from receiving unemployment payments, by virtue of their involvement in a trade dispute, may still qualify as adult dependants.  The payment of adult dependant allowances in respect of such persons breaches an accepted and long standing principal that the social welfare code should remain neutral in trade disputes. This problem did not effectively arise prior to the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986 as up until then women could only receive increases in respect of their husbands in very exceptional circumstances. At the same time, as women qualified as dependants of their husbands regardless of whether they were in employment, an adult dependant allowance payable in respect of a woman involved in a trade dispute would have been payable prior to the commencement of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The amendment affecting participants of certain full time AnCO non-craft training courses also arises as a consequence of the Equal Treatment Directive.  As a general rule, persons in receipt of an income maintenance payment in their own right may not be regarded as dependants. The payment of increases in respect of participants of certain AnCO courses conflicts with the provision.  As the rate of payment to participants of such courses was linked to the rate of unemployment benefit payments, it was necessary, following implementation of the Directive, to restructure payments made to participants of these courses to reflect the revised social welfare dependency arrangements.  As a result of these changes, a family in which one spouse is in receipt of a social welfare payment and the other is participating in a full time non-craft training course may, through the combination of social welfare and AnCO payments, receive the equivalent of two personal rates of payment together with the adult dependant allowance and one and a half times the child dependant allowance.  The effect of this amendment will be to prevent this double payment.</P>
    <P>The changes contained in section 17 <Col N="2325" /> of the Bill are also related to the EC Directive on equal treatment.  The existing provisions provide that, on the death of a person who is in receipt of benefit, the spouse is entitled to payment of that benefit for a period of six weeks after death.  While after death payments are regarded as a survivor's benefit and are therefore technically outside of the scope of the EC Directive on Equal Treatment, these provisions are nonetheless affected by the new dependency arrangements introduced in November 1986.  The purpose of section 17 is to apply the principle of equal treatment between men and women to the after death provisions by providing that such payments will in future be made where at the date of death the deceased was in receipt of an increase in respect of an adult dependant, whether that dependant was a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill makes provision for two minor but significant improvements in the social welfare code, one affecting claims to disability benefit and the other relating to old age pensioners.  Under existing provisions, a claimant is not entitled to disability benefit in respect of any period of paid holiday leave.  This causes a break in the claim where an insured person is on sick leave immediately before a period of paid holiday leave and, as a consequence, the claimant is obliged to serve a further three waiting days at the end of the holiday period. Section 16 (1) (a) is designed to relieve claimants of this obligation.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that income received by way of mobility allowance payable under the Health Act, 1970 will be disregarded in the assessment of means for the non-contributory old age pension.  This allowance which was introduced in 1979 under the Health Act, 1970 applies to severely handicapped persons over age 16 who are unable to walk and who would benefit from occasional trips away from home.  An earnings disregard of £6 per week is applied in the assessment of means for non-contributory pension. The amount of the mobility allowance when it was introduced was £150 per year and where there were no <Col N="2326" /> other means the allowance did not affect the rate of pension because of the £6 per week disregard.  This is no longer the case however as the allowance has since been increased to £320 per year.  This amendment provides that money received by way of the allowance will no longer be taken into account in the assessment for old age pension.  Income from other allowances payable under the Health Acts, such as the disabled person's maintenance allowance and the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, is already disregarded.</P>
    <P>The changes I am putting forward in this Bill are designed to improve in a number of respects the operation of the present social welfare system and the control mechanisms which operate.  I am also engaged in extending social insurance to the self-employed as well as in the introduction of statutory sick pay. The proposals in this Bill will bring about needed improvements in the present system and will help to achieve a more effective use of our resources.  It is extremely important that while these changes are being drawn up, we constantly try to improve and develop the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of existing services.  I commend the Bill to the House and I will be very glad to hear and to take into consideration the comments of Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the poverty that prevails in so many parishes it astounds me that the Minister for Social Welfare can address the House for 45 minutes without making a reference to the appalling need that exists in so many Irish homes today.  The presentation of the Bill, which was published last week, was dishonest.  It was presented to us as a measure designed to attack fraud among employers but there are five innocuous sections in the Bill which are superfluous to our present law and do not contain any provision for jail sentences for corrupt employers.  The description by the Minister was a smokescreen to cloud the retrenchment in social welfare that the Bill represents.  I wish the Minister had been more honest with us and if he had <Col N="2327" /> been he might have got wholehearted support from the House.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to table a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  I hope to be able to amend sections 2 to 6, inclusive, by the insertion of a provision for prison sentences and heavier fines on employers found guilty of fraud in regard to social welfare benefits. I am convinced that there is justification for that approach having heard the Minister's speech.  The recitation of detected fraud in his speech was such that there should be a special meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts convened as soon as possible to go through each line of the Minister's speech tonight and that delivered on Friday, when he presented a Supplementary Estimate to the House, to discover the extent of fraud in regard to social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not tell us that many of the officials in his Department whose job it is to detect fraud and who have been successful in, for instance, Arigna Mines and the Cooley Peninsula, have been grounded in the Department because of cutbacks.  The Minister, in the course of his reply, should tell the House if that is the case.  I understand that because of the cutbacks in travelling expenses those officials are doing very little detection work.  If my information is correct I can only describe those cutbacks as silly and typical of actions of the Department of Finance.  Is it any wonder that the country is in such a financial mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said that of 8,329 claimants called for interview by the detection unit in the current year to review their entitlements to unemployment payments 1,255 ceased claiming, of which 915 did so voluntarily. That represents 15 per cent.  I understand that officials of the special investigation unit of the Department are sitting on their hands in the various social welfare offices because they are not being paid travelling allowances.  According to the Minister, of 4,558 claims to unemployment payments investigated by that unit 1,227 were disallowed, or 30 per <Col N="2328" /> cent.  The Minister also said, in regard to the disability benefit scheme, that of 88,000 claimants referred to a medical referee this year 19,000 were found to be capable of work and 3,000 ceased to claim benefit.  That represents a total of 22,000 or 25 per cent.  The Minister went on to say that a further 19,000 persons, or 20 per cent, failed to attend for examination and except in a small number of cases where there was good reason for their failure to attend, they were liable to a nine week disqualification and a second referral.</P>
    <P>The Minister also told us that the numbers claiming disability benefit each week had gone down from 82,000 to 72,000, a drop of 12½ per cent, following the activities of the medical referees.  Dealing with prosecutions the Minister said that there were 125 cases referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office but it is worth bearing in mind that there are 1.3 million claimants.  Of that figure there were 12 suspended prison sentences and 17 prison sentences in total.  The Minister does not say how many of those who received prison sentences were employers but it is my guess that there were none.</P>
    <P>It is evident to me, and has been for some time &mdash; when in Government I pressed this very strongly &mdash; that there is widespread abuse of the social welfare system and that is apparent from the Minister's speech.  However, the Minister has not told us the results of other surveys conducted by his Department in relation to claimants for free telephone rental, free electricity allowance and free television licence.  The Minister should give the House the results of those surveys. Tonight the Minister did not tell us anything about the abuse of the unmarried mother's allowance or deserted wife's benefit.  I have a passionate anger about fraud in social welfare because it amounts to a defrauding of the poor of the country. People living on £35 per week were to get a special additional increase this year of £3.50 &mdash; that was provided by Fine Gael in their draft budget &mdash; but that was dropped by the Government.  The Minister has not told us that even one penny of the money saved as a result of <Col N="2329" /> the success of the war on fraud would be diverted to such poor unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the anger I have expressed about fraud in social welfare is misrepresented frequently by Members, particularly left wing Members, as an attack on social welfare.  I should like to make my position clear.  I am, and have always been, in favour of a progressive social welfare system.  If we are to have a generous and progressive social welfare system that will get the full support of our population we will have to produce one that will not be open to extensive fraud.  Our system has developed in a way that almost makes fraud unavoidable.  I should like to give some examples of how fraud comes about.</P>
    <P>Employers, some of whom I want to put in jail for breaches of the social welfare system, if they want to employ a person for a few weeks approach those on the unemployment register.  The person approached may say: &ldquo;I cannot take a job for a few weeks because if I do I will go back on short term payment.  I will also lose my Christmas bonus and may lose my medical card.  My differential rent may increase, so I will work for ten quid less provided you say nothing to Social Welfare.&rdquo;  Your man saves ten quid.  He works for a few weeks.  He avoids all those losses that he could not afford, he gets a few extra bob for his family and the losers, of course, are the Department of Social Welfare.  This is not just an extreme example.  This is happening in Ireland this week, as many TDs will know who are aware of people who took up jobs for five or six weeks for Christmas and found when the Christmas bonus was paid in the last few days they were not entitled to it.  They were the few honest fools who were so naive as to declare their employment.</P>
    <P>Another example is an old person living alone who has free telephone rental, free TV licence and free electricity allowance.  She is getting on and her family are concerned about her.  Maybe her daughter is living in a flat and comes to live with her.  If the mother declares that she loses all these allowances as well <Col N="2330" /> as her living alone allowance.  She may also lose the medical card.  She cannot afford to lose those things, but she needs her daughter in her house so she does not declare.  Therefore, the system is designed to encourage fraud.  Those are two examples.</P>
    <P>We know that unmarried mothers get £57 a week and are entitled to medical cards.  They may get a local authority house and help with their ESB bill, etc. They may have met a man they hope to marry but they cannot afford to marry because they are going to lose all of those things.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that the evident increase in the policing of the social welfare system is correct provided it does not get to the stage of hunting those who are truly entitled to social welfare and in need of it.  While it is correct, it is not enough. The system needs to be overhauled radically, much more radically than the Minister seems to be doing even in the Social Welfare Supplementary Estimate of last week or in this Bill before the House tonight.  This Bill is about retrenchment in social welfare, as I have said.  It does not include the sum total of retrenchments that this Minister has brought about in social welfare.  For instance, the Bill does not provide for something for which perhaps legislation is not required and I would like the Minister to tell us about this in his reply.  It does not cover his announcement which takes from poor, unfortunate widows who go out to work to keep their family together.  If they are unlucky enough to fall sick they will be without their half rate disability benefit for which up to now they qualified.  Likewise, deserted wives will lose that disability benefit.  If a widow who at the moment is working and in receipt of a widow's contributory pension goes sick she will have just her widow's pension.  She is going to lose full wages and she will have no disability benefit. The same applies to deserted wives who work.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the special increase of £3.50 for those on long term assistance and who are living alone and aged 45 or over &mdash; the most needy group in society &mdash; is <Col N="2331" /> not to be paid.  Those disimprovements, which are not the full story, on top of what is provided in this Bill show a complete emphasis on retrenchment but no emphasis at all on redirecting resources towards the most needy groups in our society.  If somebody falls on hard times that is truly horrendous.</P>
    <P>Take the wife whose husband does a dally; he flits away.  She has to apply for deserted wife's allowance and she will have to be means tested by the Department of Social Welfare.  However, they cannot even consider her application until she is at least three months deserted, so she is sent along to the community welfare officer at the health centre who will conduct a means test to assess her eligibility for supplementary welfare allowance.  If she wants a medical card that means test is not sufficient.  She has been through two means tests already, (1) for deserted wife's allowance which will not be decided for three months and, (2), for supplementary welfare allowance, perhaps with different criteria being used in each case.  Then when she applies for a medical card which undoubtedly she needs badly there will be a third and different means test with different criteria and different public officials involved.  We are not even half way there yet.  If she resides in a local authority house she will have to apply to the local authority for a reduction in her differential rent.  You know, Sir, what that means; another means test, assessed by different criteria yet again and by different officials of a different statutory authority. She is now about half way there, that is, after four means tests.  If she is not in a local authority house and has, for instance, a mortgage she has a few more courses open to her.  If it is a HFA mortgage she has to go to them to apply for a reduction in her mortgage repayments, and that means another means test to different criteria and, yes, by different officials of another statutory authority.  On the other hand, if she is renting her house she may be entitled to a rent supplement but that means another means test by other public officials in <Col N="2332" /> another statutory agency.  If she needs to take up civil legal aid in pursuit of her husband that means another means test to different criteria by another statutory agency and more officials.  That is not even the end because she might want footwear for her children and other help to which she is entitled.  She might want to apply for help under the national fuel scheme.  I will not regale the House any further with what she has to do.  The previous six or seven means tests will not do.  There are more means tests before she is considered.</P>
    <P>This is not only indignity and inconvenience to a woman already in great distress but it entails costs that she cannot meet &mdash; bus fares and so on and there is also the frustration of trying to make calls from public telephones that do not work and for which she has not got the money anyway or there may be the letters with stamps she can ill afford.  All these show that our social welfare system is designed in many cases to humiliate and inconvenience people who are at their most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I have suggested in this House several times that there should be one national means test.  The Minister for Finance some time ago told me this was a good idea and that an interdepartmental committee had been set up to look at it.  What progress has been made.  Why are there umpteen means tests?  As well as those I have mentioned, there is criminal legal aid where the courts decide the means, education grants given by the local authorities and so on.  Why not one basic eligibility test?  My second and most important proposal is, why cannot that eligibility certificate be used to remove the major anomalies and traps in the system?</P>
    <P>So far as eligibility for medical cards is concerned, a person who is £1 over the limit does not get it.  The same applies to education grants.  These and other measures almost force people to abuse the system.  Why not have a tapering system? This would mean that people within £10 or £15 of the limit would get 75 per cent eligibility and people within £30 of the limit would get 50 per cent eligibility for <Col N="2333" /> medical cards and other entitlements.  I would like these grants to be tapered off rather than cut off.  I am including in this old people who now have free electricity, free television licence and free telephone rental allowances.  If these people's circumstances change, they should not lose these allowances but they should taper off over two or three years.  Many old people are afraid to take a relative into their homes to look after them even though they are afraid to live alone because of crime.  Much needs to be done in our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>It is true that in these times of financial constraints it is very hard to see where the resources might come from to alleviate the awful poverty at the bottom of the spectrum.  I do not exaggerate when I tell the House what is happening in the area I get my votes, where almost all of my constituency is working class.  I do not ever remember &mdash; not even when I was a child when, on the face of it, people were worse off &mdash; so much distress at Christmas time.  I do not ever remember encountering so many people in need of money, not for toys or luxuries at Christmas but to put a decent meal on their table for their children.  These are the people who depend on unemployment assistance.  What disturbs me greatly is the lack of commitment, the lack of effort to target for special assistance these people on unemployment assistance, as well as those single women aged 58 living alone.</P>
    <P>The House is possibly bored hearing me say that I am against across-the-board percentage increases and across-the-board Christmas bonuses.  Across-the-board percentage increases give those who have more a big increase and those who have very little get a very small increase.  The same applies to the Christmas bonus.  I have often cited the case of retired bank managers, bank directors and company directors with substantial pensions, as well as the contributory old age pension, getting bonuses of £60 or £70 a week, money they do not need, while people in receipt of £35 or £37 a week get a bonus of £20. These people are in desperate need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2334" /> Since Deputy Woods became Minister for Social Welfare in March 1986 I cannot recall one step he has taken or one passionate word he has spoken to show his interest in or to acknowledge the existence of this problem.  The Minister told us today and last week that the saving on fraud this year will be £36 million.  If these savings continue for a full year, what will the figure be?  Will it be £50 million or £100 million?  I suspect it will be nearer the latter because according to the Minister's speech last Friday 10 per cent of all people interviewed under the Jobsearch scheme have been knocked off the unemployment register &mdash; 135,000 people interviewed and 13,200 off the register. I make a very strong plea that these resources be used to alleviate this awful poverty.</P>
    <P>Moneylenders are having a field day in the suburbs of Dublin, and probably in Cork as well, at the expense of the most vulnerable section in our society because they are the only people who must have recourse to moneylenders.  The Moneylenders Act, 1933, has never been amended, as far as I know, but it is not being enforced.  There is widespread extortion among the people who depend for their income on the Department of Social Welfare.  They are paying 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 50 per cent interest on those loans.  When it is difficult to repay one loan they are offered another to pay off the first and still have a few pounds in their pockets.  This means they are getting even further in debt.</P>
    <P>I am proposing another amendment to this Bill, which has already been submitted to the Bills Office.  I am aware of two cases where the community welfare officers were so distressed about certain moneylending cases that they negotiated with the moneylenders who had acted illegally.  I must give the community welfare officers full marks for initiative and for their concern.  They negotiated a reduction in the interest, they proposed to pay off the moneylender and they were allowing the unfortunate borrower to pay the health board £5 per week.  When those cases were put to the Department they were refused permission on the basis <Col N="2335" /> that there was no legislative provision.  I honestly believe that this problem needs to be tackled much more vigorously. Admittedly, moneylending comes under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice but the section of the population who are affected by this moneylending scourge are people who see the Minister for Social Welfare as their paymaster, people who are totally dependent on him.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare, in their very comprehensive report, highlighted the need for special payments, especially to the categories I mentioned. They suggested that payments should be made once every quarter.  I ask the Minister to give special consideration to some additional payments at Christmas to the worst off categories, especially those with dependent children.  People may ask where we will get the resources to pay for even that small part of the commission's report but I suggest we have found it in the savings made in 1987 from the detection of fraud.  I also suggest that provision should be made &mdash; or at least considered &mdash; in certain cases, defined by the Minister in regulations which he should have power to draft, for the community welfare service to lend money to certain categories of persons at times of exceptional need in addition to whatever supplementary welfare assistance to which they are entitled.  It would be infinitely better to get an interest free loan from the supplementary welfare system than to pay extortionate interest to moneylenders thereby worsening the problem they sought to avoid in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare spend £2.6 billion, there is a multiplicity of subheads, votes, benefits, entitlements and pensions.  One could speak for many hours in the House without really touching in any detail on all the important issues and concerns.  However, it behoves the Members of this House at least to try to give a more rational framework to the social welfare system, more sense of direction and purpose.  Perhaps when we <Col N="2336" /> deal with Bills concerning social welfare we should indicate the mission of the Department of Social Welfare because, looking back on how things have developed, particularly over the past decade, it is obvious that all sense of direction, purpose and mission has been lost.  Their mission should be to relieve and eliminate poverty: yet, the Minister in his 45 minute speech did not once mention poverty, which emphasises what I said.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare are a very big Department and in recent times have shown a new vigour and sense of purpose which had been lost for so long. How else could we have allowed the abuse of the system which the Minister highlighted tonight?  How else could we pay bigger bonuses to those with three and four incomes than to those with £35 per week?  How else can we pay the same child benefit to those on £50,000 per year as to people on £60 per week?  How else can we see so many people in poverty when others collect their children's allowance every six months and lodge it to their number two account?</P>
    <P>Perhaps there should be a special meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts to go through every paragraph of the Social Welfare Vote.  Two criteria should be applied: what does each paragraph do to relieve and eliminate poverty and to create fairness in the system?  The House has been asked to pass this Bill in the next few days.  I do not propose to delay its implementation because I know that in next February or March there will be a much more extensive Bill before the House, if we are to drop the disability benefit for working widows which the Minister proposes and to which I am totally opposed.  We will also need a new Bill if we extend to the self-employed the requirement to make pay-related contributions and if we extend to employers the responsibility for paying the first 13 weeks of disability benefit, thus making it taxable.  All these issues require major legislation and I hope that when the Minister next seeks our approval in this House for the reform of social welfare it will not be itsy-bitsy reform.  I hope, above all <Col N="2337" /> else, that special consideration will be given to the least well off categories of social welfare recipients and who are most dependent on the Minister to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing any Bill before the House I am always very conscious of the need to stand back and look at it objectively.  In dealing with a Bill concerning social welfare, one must be more conscious of the need to look at it objectively because such Bills usually affect the welfare of over one million people.</P>
      <P>In speaking about matters relating to social welfare, one must also be very conscious of the fact that this Department are responsible for expenditure of £2.6 billion.  While being conscious of the needs of individual recipients of social welfare payments, we must also be very conscious of the demands on the taxpayers who are expected to finance such arrangements.  In this regard, I should like to state categorically that if the Minister for Social Welfare wants to embark on a programme that will eliminate abuses in the social welfare system, he will have an ally in the Progressive Democrats. Unlike the Minister, who does not state what he will do with the money he saves from detecting abuses, the Progressive Democrats are very clear on what they intend to do with it, namely, to redistribute it among those who are on the lowest form of social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have very simple arithmetic explained to me.  The Minister announced to the House last Friday that almost £36 million has been saved because of the crack down on abuses of social welfare and yet in the same breath the Minister asked this House to approve a Supplementary Estimate for his Department of £10.5 million needed to pay the Christmas bonus to social welfare recipients.  The Minister further stated that this money would be found from savings in other Government Departments. I ask the Minister to state what he and the Department intend to do with the £36 million that has been saved by the Department.  On the other hand, is <Col N="2338" /> the Minister going to tell the House that if he had not saved the £36 million I have just referred to &mdash; and not taking into consideration the Christmas bonus &mdash; that his Department would have overspent by £36 million.  Was the original estimate for the year reduced by £36 million because the abuses were so obvious that a blind man would have been able to see them and count them.</P>
    <P>I have never seen a social welfare Bill incorporating so many bits and pieces being of such priority to a Government. I find it extremely difficult to understand why the Bill before us has to be rushed through in the manner proposed.  It makes me stand back and examine very thoroughly the provisions of the Bill and its implications for the people I and my party represent.  This Bill consists of 19 sections.  It commences by attempting to provide legislation to pursue employers who engage in or collude in abuses of the social welfare system.  It is designed to discourage collusion between employers and employees in cases of suspected fraud.  It imposes an obligation on employers whose employees are claiming benefit to provide such particulars as may be required to enable the proper determination or review of a claim.  It imposes a new obligation on employers to produce records at their registered address or principal place of business as may be demanded.  It requires details of earnings and the period to which they refer to be recorded at or before the time of payment of wages.  It extends the powers of social welfare inspectors for unemployment benefit purposes to enter premises, which includes premises where such employed persons are or were engaged.  It makes provision to bring inspections of unemployment benefit into line with those for unemployment assistance.  The measures are proposed in the hope that abuse will be curtailed and fraud eliminated from the system.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes substantial changes in the contribution conditions for disability benefit, invalidity pensions, maternity benefit and maternity allowances.  It provides for the abolition of pay-related benefit in certain cases.  It refers to <Col N="2339" /> reckonable weekly earnings, strikers, the social welfare tribunal, waiting days for people transferring from disability to maternity benefit or from disability benefit to holiday pay and <i>vice versa</i>.  It further refers to extending payment of benefit for six weeks after the death of a claimant who had been in receipt of an allowance in respect of an adult dependant. Finally, it addresses the question of means in relation to non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>In all my years in this House I have never seen so many bits and pieces of the social welfare system dragged together into a Bill, and a state of emergency almost declared to have it rushed through this House.  I will not be a party to any legislation being approved by this House that has the effect of imposing severe hardship on people who are in receipt of long-term disability benefit or invalidity pensions.  I will not allow sections 8 to 10 of this Bill to be approved by this House without having a proper and detailed debate on their effects.  I ask the Minister to tell this House how many of the 79,800 recipients of social welfare disability benefit will be affected by the changes proposed in this Bill and the total savings the Department expect to make as a result in 1988.  In addition, I ask the Minister to tell the House the total number of men and women, married and single, who will find themselves no longer eligible for benefits on 4 January 1988.  Will the Minister also tell the House how many will lose their eligibility at the same time because their 12 months benefit will have expired and they fail to have the necessary 260 contributions?  It is of vital importance that I have answers to these questions because the whole Bill is based on the replies I get to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to sections 1 to 7 which attempt to discourage fraud or collusion between employers and employees.  There is a need for a proper balance between the efficient delivery of social welfare services which has due regard for the dignity and sense of entitlement of claimants and necessary measures to control fraud.  We recognise that <Col N="2340" /> the opportunity for fraud exists in any system whether it be social welfare, grants to industry and agriculture or taxation, and that control measures are necessary especially where public funds are concerned.</P>
    <P>The occurrence of fraud in social welfare has to be considered in the context of almost 800,000 payments being made per week covering 1.2 million beneficiaries, with a total expenditure of £2.6 billion.  While recognising that control measures are necessary, we must also be concerned that the overwhelming majority of claimants are genuine and we should not stigmatise them under a régime that would infringe their dignity or sense of entitlement.  There is no doubt in my mind that social welfare fraud in Ireland is very serious indeed.  In a recent RTE radio interview, the Minister confirmed my worst fears when he stated that the Department would not release the recent Craig Gardner report which this Government commissioned to investigate fraud. This leaves me with no alternative but to conclude that fraud in the social welfare system is now completely out of control.</P>
    <P>Recent press reports of alleged fraud among 170 workers at the Arigna collieries in County Roscommon must be of serious concern to all politicians.  The fact that 170 workers were able to draw social welfare disability benefit for approximately four years at a staggering cost of £225,000 to the taxpayer while continuing in full time employment is nothing short of a national disgrace.  Not alone should the workers be prosecuted but there should be a complete investigation into the Department as to how this was allowed to continue for that length of time.  The main areas of fraud identified by the Commission on Social Welfare are signing for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or drawing disability benefit while continuing to work and also the failure by employers to pay social insurance contributions.  I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the Minister that in introducing measures to combat social welfare fraud he will not find this party wanting in support for any measures that are reasonable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2341" /> The most serious concern I have in regard to the Bill relates to sections 8, 9 and 10.  These provisions represent a blatant attack on married women and women generally in the social welfare system.  It is a known fact that serious concern has been expressed both within and outside Government circles at the number of women who are claiming social welfare disability benefit.  The provisions in the Bill which change the contribution conditions are designed to put outside the social welfare system anything up to 20,000 or 30,000 recipients.  I would like the Minister to give me some information on that figure.  The vast majority of these recipients are already on the poverty line.  Many of them have made their contributions while working in jobs where they scrubbed floors in offices and factories.  Their contributions will have gone towards supporting other social welfare incomes, for example, those claimed by unemployed husbands. When the equality measures were introduced in 1986, I learned at first hand what these payments meant to a substantial number of women and their families.  The provisions in this Bill attack the very existence of families and individuals.  The provisions of sections 8 and 9 are a wolf dressed in sheep's clothing.  We do not know what impact this is going to have on the very large number of people who are genuinely dependent on social welfare. It will be next July before we really know the problems this Bill may create.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed that a married man with four children who is in receipt of £180.20 per week in social welfare disability benefit, who is not in continuous benefit for 312 days and who has fewer than 260 contributions will have his income reduced by £16.50 per week. Likewise, a married man with four children and in receipt of invalidity pension of £122.20 per week who loses his entitlement to invalidity pension and is forced to draw a supplementary welfare allowance, will lose something in the region of £30.50 a week.  There is a better way of reducing public expenditure and of tackling social <Col N="2342" /> welfare fraud than by attacking individuals and families who are already on the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Maintaining the living standards of social welfare recipients had not been one of the priorities of this Government. Retrenchment and reduction of social welfare expenditure has been the policy objective.  In other countries which have advanced economies the seeds of these ideas were increasingly sown on the fertile soil of economic stagnation.  There was a rapid growth in the popularity of the idea that social welfare expenditure can be reduced, irrespective of the cost, the suffering and hardship it imposed. However, the question remains as to whether economic conditions and the current climate of opinion will lead to the kind of direct cutbacks which have been imposed in Britain and elsewhere.  The political culture in Ireland is not characterised into left and right ideologies as in the case in many other countries.  Therefore, we do not have the same traditions of social democracy and liberalism.  Any debate about key social welfare issues here will not be conducted in the political terms experienced elsewhere.  Ireland is different.  Our social welfare structure is different, our community care structures are different and we have a strong Christian tradition, a tradition that has shown concern for the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged.  The degree of dependence in Ireland on social welfare payments &mdash; over one third of the population are beneficiaries and in over two fifths of households there is at least one recipient &mdash; renders it virtually impossible to create the political support to reduce services significantly.  The provisions of this Bill, and in particular those of sections 8, 9, 10 and 11, will have to be carefully considered in the light of what I have just said.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are concerned for all but, in particular, for those depending on social welfare payments. We are committed to increasing these payments by effecting savings through the elimination of fraud and wasteful practices and by redirecting payments to the most needy in our community.  I am <Col N="2343" /> convinced that the changes in the contributions are going to cause endless hardship, especially for those unfortunate people who cannot, due to present circumstances, get permanent employment. I hope the Minister can answer the questions I have raised so that I will be in a position to make a further contribution on Committee Stage of this Bill tomorrow.</P>

      <P>So far as the Labour Party are concerned the main criticism of this Bill should be directed against that section which increases the contributions for disability benefit and invalidity benefit. This section will have far reaching effects on workers and, in particular, on young workers, who will now have to be in the workforce for at least five continuous years before they will be eligible to claim disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point must be made that five years' continuous work is a considerable achievement for workers these days and that most likely the majority of young workers will never have that qualification.  This Government increased the contributions from 156 to 208 in this year's budget.  The Labour Party had already brought down the Coalition Government on the attempt to increase the number of contributions necessary for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the increase proposed in this Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill workers will be put under further pressure to find the extra year of continuous work.  I would like the Minister to explain how that can be done.  If the Bill is passed young workers will be unable to claim disability benefit if they fall ill unless they have five years work behind them.  A young worker who gets a long term illness will only be eligible for disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The disabled person's maintenance allowance is not paid to workers and their dependants if the claimant is hospitalised.  This is a further drawback.  If a worker who claims disabled person's maintenance allowance <Col N="2344" /> has a working wife, the worker will get nothing.  These changes are obviously directed against the most vulnerable group of workers and are totally unacceptable to the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will seek to amend the legislation by requiring that the number of contributions necessary to qualify for disability benefit is brought back to 156 or the 1986 level.  Furthermore, the point should be made that it is not up to workers to prove that they are fit for work.  It is up to the general practitioner to be accountable and if medical certificates are received from workers there are reasonable grounds for believing that workers claiming disability benefit or invalidity benefit are ill.  If the Government have a problem with this or if the Government believe that there are numbers of people claiming disability or invalidity benefit who are not actually ill, the Government should refer it back to where it belongs, to the medical profession, and not try to block workers who have legitimate claims.</P>
    <P>Another point which should be made is that the Commission on Social Welfare made no recommendation regarding disability benefit except that the allowance involved was insufficient.  As well as making no attempt to implement any part of the commission's report this Government will create a more regressive code within the social welfare system.  In relation to disability benefit the point should be made that the employers should bear the burden for paying the first few weeks of disability benefit to workers who fall ill.  The Government, or the State apparatus, should try to move in to help workers only if the illness is prolonged.  I have long believed that employers who are asked to undertake this task &mdash; this effectively is what I believe the Minister is attempting to do later this year &mdash; should be given some financial incentive to perform this function, particularly to assist with the substantial administration costs that this would avoid so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>I accept that employers these days are faced with mountains of paperwork.  I <Col N="2345" /> appeal to the Minister to ensure that, if this Bill passes through this House, every effort should be made &mdash; I think he referred to that in his speech &mdash; to avoid unnecessary paperwork and the wasting of valuable time as far as employers and employees are concerned.  The new legislation will throw many thousands of workers back to subsistence, a rate which is neither adequate nor appropriate.</P>
    <P>The self employed part time workers and other categories of workers who may not have continuous stamps for five years will be badly affected.  Indeed, it is ironic that the Government who have consistently encouraged workers to set up on their own or start their own businesses now seek to ensure that should these workers fall on hard times they will not be eligible to come back to the welfare system for help.</P>
    <P>If we look at the figures for invalidity pension we will find that in 1977 the figures stood at some 10,000 people in receipt of that benefit.  That figure has grown dramatically to 26,000 people at the end of 1986.  This was a natural and in many respects a welcome development because it puts people who would otherwise be on long term disability benefit on to invalidity benefit. They do not have to wait for the postman to arrive, or not to arrive, with the social welfare cheque on various days during the week.  They do not have to communicate with and contact the local public representative to see why their cheques are not being sent out on a consistent basis.  This avoids a large amount of administration in the local employment offices, many of which, if not all, are unable to cope with the level of unemployment and the service which people require at present.  It transfers the payment on a weekly basis under the book system to the post office and is a much more convenient and efficient system of payment.  Even if the benefit is somewhat greater than disability benefit this is offset substantially by the level of savings in administration costs.</P>
    <P>I join with my other colleagues in suggesting to the Minister that, so far as this benefit is concerned, it should qualify <Col N="2346" /> recipients for other benefits such as TV, ESB, free travel and so on.  All of that could be combined into one qualification so that a person having gone through the initial medical and means test in relation to invalidity benefit would automatically qualify for all the benefits concerned.  At least the application should be dealt with in one application from rather than going through the same thing four times in a row over a period of nine months, or even longer.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to close off loopholes which made it possible for women workers to claim maternity benefit for a second pregnancy.  There are two schemes involved here: (a) women in the workforce; and (b) the old or general scheme referred to by the Minister in his speech.  The changes in the Bill attempt to squeeze up to 9,000 women out of the general scheme.  Women will have to be in continuous employment to qualify. Contributions required have gone up from six months to nine months and must be paid contributions rather than credits. This will again affect the young worker most directly.  At a time of scarcity of jobs it will be increasingly difficult for women to get continuous stamps particularly if they are attempting to combine work outside the home with work inside the home.  The latter usually end up in the black economy jobs or jobs in off peak hours or unsocial hours.  The measure, in my opinion, is regressive and is a serious attempt to undermine the small gains which women have made over the past decade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister. He and I have often disagreed on figures.  I have been right a good number <Col N="2347" /> of times so far.  It also refutes the sentiments expressed in the 1937 Constitution that women shall not have to work outside the home out of economic necessity.  To stay in benefit women will not alone have to work outside the home but must be in continuous employment and paying contributions.  Women workers who leave the workforce, having paid years of contributions already lose out in terms of dental, optical and unemployment benefit.  Despite many years of paid contributions, this latest legislative proposal is a further attempt to ensure that women do not gain under the system.</P>
      <P>Many women workers are forced out of the workforce after a first pregnancy because they fail to comply with the legislative requirements of sending a letter to employers stating their intention to return to work.  Many employers deliberately fail to inform women workers of this requirement and use it as a rationale for laying them off after the maternity leave is complete.  The withdrawal of pay-related benefit from maternity benefit is yet another severe cutback for women. The Government are quite happy to deduct pay-related contributions from women's wages but they are reluctant to pay women when they are in need.  This is an outrageous attack on a segment of workers and is regressive legislation in many respects.  One might even call it a tax on babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 12 to 14 of this Bill, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, are welcome as are sections 16 to 18.  In relation to section 15 the point could be made that a dependant is a dependant and the need for qualification should be abolished.  It costs the same to feed and clothe a dependant regardless of the circumstances and this requirement should be eliminated.  The Labour Party will be seeking to amend sections 8 and 9 to restore the status quo to the 156 qualifying contributions as was the case before we left Government, and amendments to this effect have already been submitted. We will also be opposing section 11 and I will, in the course of Committee Stage, be giving the reasons for that.  Many other <Col N="2348" /> comments could be made about this Bill and I hope we will be able to get to the nitty-gritty of it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of general comments on the Bill.  It is now becoming much more difficult to secure invalidity benefit.  I assume that the squeeze has been put on this benefit by the administration because of the substantial increase in the numbers of people now qualifying for it.  I suggest to the Minister that the reason people have been slow to opt for this benefit, as Members of this House and I am sure the Minister will fully appreciate, is their lack of knowledge of their right to acquire it and how to go about getting it.  For example, invalidity benefit is the only benefit under the social welfare code for which the applicant has to apply for an application form.  There is no other benefit in the social welfare code where this requirement is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>An application form is not needed in any other case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Many people applying for this benefit are elderly people who have to get assistance in filling in the form.  The form is then sent back to the Department, assessments have to be made and the person has to wait for a medical examination.  Incidentally, the new trend is that not alone will the persons not secure invalidity benefit but they will be disallowed disability benefit and will have to sign for unemployment benefit which they will be paid at the same rate as disability benefit until such time ar they are re-examined by a medical referee.  The social welfare system is becoming crazier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that abuses exist but the people who abuse the social welfare system are a small minority of the total number of people receiving social welfare benefit.  I suggest to the Minister that greater emphasis should be placed on dealing with employers who are party to abuses of social welfare.  If there were no dishonest employers in relation to social welfare benefit there would be no dishonest employees.  It is a well known fact that thousands of workers who are <Col N="2349" /> defrauding the system are working for employers who know that these people are signing and are in receipt of disability and unemployment benefit, and who give them time off to go to the local employment exchange to collect their money.  In the old days when we were on short time employment in the shoe factories we had to sign every day when we were out of work.  Because of the number of people signing on at present people have to sign once a week only.  That has left it very simple for employers who want to employ people who are receiving these benefits and working at the same time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which will allow freer access to the records of companies to inspectors.  I suggest that the Minister extend that right to trade union officials so that they would have the right to inspect the records of employers on behalf of the people they represent.  Very often people go to draw benefit, whether it be optical, dental or unemployment benefit, and when they seek a tax rebate during short term employment or unemployment they find that their contributions have not been returned.  Workers have no way of establishing whether their contributions are being returned.  I suggest that the right to inspect the records of a company should be extended particularly to trade unions so that representatives of workers would have that right.  In fact every worker should have the right to inspect the records of a company every year or twice a year to see if a certification has been received from the Department showing quite clearly that their contributions have been returned.  The people are entitled to a P.60 and a P.45 but they are not worth the paper they are written on.  Anyone can fill in a P. 60 form and hand it to an employee after 5 April but it virtually means nothing.  The only way to prove that the contributions have been returned is by certifications from the Department of Social Welfare.  That would avoid a mountain of problems in relation to the administration of the whole social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard of a case of a person who was marking up results in a bookmaker's <Col N="2350" /> shop.  His employer said he was giving him £10 or £20 a week.  Somebody in the bookmaker's shop who did not like this employee reported him.  That man, who has eight children, went to court and received six months imprisonment and was fined £10,000 &mdash; for marking up a bookmaker's board.  Yet there is massive abuse of the social welfare system; people defraud the system of thousands of pounds and get nothing like the same treatment.  A substantial majority are not even brought to court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not under our legislation.  The maximum fine is £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The fine was £10,000 in repayments.  My final point relates to young people.  Young people who cannot find employment but whose parents are employed are treated in a most despicable way.  They are paid sums of £5 or £15 a week and yet they are expected to respect the system.  They have to suffer the indignity of being paid these small sums of money.  Young educated people who have done courses offered by AnCO, CERT and whatever are entitled to unemployment assistance irrespective of what their parents earn.  If we do not give young people some dignity they will react against society as a whole.</P>
      <P>We will be putting down four amendments to this Bill and I hope to deal with them in some greater detail tomorrow. We will oppose the Bill for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and praise the Minister for taking the initiative in introducing it.  The Fine Gael spokesperson said there was an appalling need in many Irish homes.  Perhaps that need arose from the irresponsibility and indecision of Coalition Governments over the last number of years.  We cannot address the problem of poverty which social welfare legislation is designed to combat unless we consider the causes of poverty.  There is no doubt that much of the poverty is the result of a lack of economic activity and economic policies which would have given this country an <Col N="2351" /> opportunity to grow and which would have given us commercial opportunities to ensure that our country would be more productive with more employment so that there would be less strain on the social welfare system generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister has my sympathy in inheriting the problems caused by the previous Coalition Government, of which the Fine Gael spokesman was a prominent member, which gave rise to serious unemployment.  The unemployment level was something like 100,000 when the Coalition Government took office in 1982 but it was in the region of 240,000 when they left office.  That is the situation which this Minister had to address on coming into office.  Many Opposition Deputies challenged the Minister's figures in last year's budget debate and said that the money would run out half way through the year.  The Minister can, with pride, give an account as to how he has kept to his Estimates, the very Estimates challenged by the Deputies opposite as being inadequate.  This was good housekeeping on the part of the Minister and his civil servants and it would be remiss of me and other Deputies not to compliment the Minister in successfully facing such a challenge.  I had expected more from the spokesman opposite in his contribution on this Bill.  In these difficult times the Government cannot too often look for plaudits from the Opposition but there are occasions when generosity and recognition of sheer hard graft would not go amiss from the Opposition.  It is with pride that I pay this compliment to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am not in the least sycophantic or hypocritical in doing this.  I would not abuse the privilege of this House and my position by coming in here merely to put a rubber stamp on what Ministers do.  I trust that my performance here since I was elected has clearly indicated that I am not prepared to be a rubber stamp on anything that the Government does.  However, credit <Col N="2352" /> should be given where credit is due in this case.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 to 7 of the Bill place an obligation on employers to provide facilities to keep better records of social welfare payments or PRSI payments.  This has been alleged to be a smokescreen to cloak other aspects of the Bill.  This is an unwarranted attitude to a very good set of provisions.  In my experience as a county councillor and as a Deputy I know that the people who very often bear the brunt of social welfare investigations and prosecutions are unfortunate workers who work and draw unemployment assistance at the same time.  The Department of Social Welfare must prosecute these people but they usually are not alone in that they are aided and abetted by employers who unscrupulously employ them.  Few employers can truthfully say that they employed people with out knowing they were drawing the dole.  If an employer employs workers drawing the dole without knowing it, the employer is acting carelessly or negligently in not finding out.  The implementation of the proposed legislation will go a long way towards ensuring that there is an onus on the employer to find out the status of the proposed employee in relation to the Department of Social Welfare.  More importantly, the employer will have to satisfy the officers of the Department of Social Welfare that the status of the employee is correct that he is not drawing unemployment assistance while working.</P>
      <P>For anyone to come into this House and say that these provisions are unworthy is extremely unfair to the legislation and to the policy enunciated in this Bill.  With reference to my earlier remarks of praise to the Minister and his Department for tackling the difficult situation they inherited, there is no lack of good faith on the part of the Minister and the Department in relation to the implementation of sections 2 to 7 of this Bill when enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of spokespersons have pressed very strongly to have fraud eliminated. The enthusiasm with which this case is pressed from the Opposition <Col N="2353" /> benches is matched only by the neglect of previous Governments to do anything about it.  The success of the Minister in saving approximately £36 million through elimination of fraud this year is truly indicative of the lack of commitment and lack of will to do anything about the situation on the part of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>There have been other allegations of meanness on the part of the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare in relation to the distribution of the benefit gained through the elimination of fraud. Only the efficiency of the Minister and his diligence in the pursuit of fraud enabled the Christmas bonus to be paid out and will enable the continuation of the equal treatment provision for persons affected by the EC directive, the legislation in relation to which was introduced by the previous Government.  Only under pressure from Fianna Fáil, then in Opposition, did the former Government introduce alleviating transitional provisions in relation to equal treatment payments up to November of this year.  It is a very satisfactory result in a year of extreme shortage of cash that the Government are not only to fund the Christmas cash bonus but can continue to fund the alleviating provisions in relation to equal treatment.</P>
    <P>I heartily welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that the special £10 and £20 equal treatment payments will continue at their present rates until the beginning of April 1988.  About 21,000 people are in receipt of these payments, including many in my own constituency. This announcement must be greeted with particular gladness.  These people, having established their household budget on the basis of the situation prior to the equal treatment provision, had reasonable expectations that the equal treatment provisions and the extra payments provided on a transitional basis would go on long after November 1987.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his Department will continue in the same efficient way the crack-down on fraud and the general saving from duplication of social <Col N="2354" /> welfare payments so that these transitional arrangements can continue well after April 1988.  I trust that, if there is to be a phasing out, it will be only on the basis of reasonable long term provisions coming in.  Judging by the performance of the Minister to date I have no doubt that he and his Department have the capacity to fulfil that objective, which I earnestly press upon them.</P>
    <P>There has been a very rhetorical statement in relation to the various eligibility and means tests applied for grants and assistance to aid people on low incomes. I accept the criticism to a point and I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance that there will be an interdepartmental committee examining the situation with a view to achieving greater harmonisation of means testing and increasing the overall efficiency of the system by the elimination of duplication of bureaucratic examination of the means of people in order to assess their entitlement to various benefits.</P>
    <P>I would enter one word of caution, however, in relation to the road which the Fine Gael spokesman proposes we should go down.  I detect in what he said the philosophy of his colleagues in relation to the establishment of an ID card system like that in Denmark which has often been suggested by his colleague, Deputy Bruton, whether in this House or outside I am not quite sure.  He has certainly proposed it as a viable way to deal with a situation described by Deputy Mitchell.  I doubt that this country is ready for that type of &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; system where people are given an ID card when they are born and all information is added into the computer throughout their life, enabling one single means test to be made using this all-knowing computer. God knows what else could be established by such a computer in respect of every citizen.  It is something from which our citizens, whether in receipt of social welfare benefits or not, will recoil. It is also a system open to abuse.  It can become too immobile and inflexible.</P>

      <P>I suggest that Deputies should still consider the basic necessity of having so many means tests.  They arise principally from the fact that we have not got the resources to fund an optimum type of social welfare system.  We have not got the funds to fund the type of social welfare system we would all like to see in place.  We have not got the funds, or the sources of wealth here, to fund the type of social welfare system I suggest we would have were it not for the maraudings and deprivations of the last Coalition Government.  I challenge anyone to contradict me on that.</P>
      <P>There have been various statements to the effect that poverty is on the increase, that people on social welfare benefit suffer many indignities as a result of bureaucratic examination and delay.  I accept that a complex system such as this gives rise to delay, and much confusion. Very often it gives rise to people not knowing or claiming their entitlements sufficiently quickly to be of benefit to them.  In this respect I note that the waiting period on the part of applicants for unemployment assistance and benefit has been considerably reduced.  I discovered last week, through the social welfare officers in Mullingar, that the waiting period has been reduced dramatically without there being full computer facilities at that office.  I welcome the onset of computer facilities for Cork.  I hope, in the not too distant future, that towns in my constituency such as Mullingar, Athlone and Longford will be afforded the same facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only does the computer ensure that the Department will be run more <Col N="2356" /> efficiently with cost savings on the Department side, but it also ensures that it will become more client-orientated, which I know is a departmental priority. Indeed, it can be seen developing progressively. It is a slow development, which the onset of the computer will hasten, but, above all, it is one which will require the dedication and commitment of all of the staff of the Department. From my experience as a county councillor and the more intensive experience I have gained as a public representative, I am glad to say that the courtesy, efficiency and commitment of the staff of the Department, in so far as they have any contact with claimants, now described as clients, and with public representatives on behalf of clients, is exemplary.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the objective of ensuring greater client orientation in social welfare in the future will be shared by all Members of this House and will develop further as a result of that personal commitment on the part of the various officers of the Department.  We do not avail of our opportunity to speak here often enough to give credit for the personal effort made and the interest taken by such staff.  I know the present Minister cannot take full credit for the development of this strong personal commitment at senior, intermediate and junior level within the management of the Department in order to ensure that benefits are delivered in the speediest and most courteous way.  This development has taken place by way of the general co-operation amongst all staff members. There appears to be a rising collegial commitment on the part of staff to generate that type of attitude.  I am glad to note that it has been successfully generated. That attitude must occasion great work satisfaction on the part of the officers concerned and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that the old maternity <Col N="2357" /> allowance scheme was retained, probably wisely, to ensure there would be no anomalies or injustices occasioned by the shift from one system to the other.  It appears that the time is now ripe for the change the Minister is introducing.  When investigating maternity entitlements of constituents I discovered very often, when examining the new scheme, that they were not entitled to benefit by reason of their lack of contact with the workplace and generally, to the surprise of the claimants concerned, they discovered they were eligible under the terms of the old maternity allowance sceme principally because they had continued to sign in circumstances in which they were not receiving any unemployment benefit or assistance.  The women concerned generally were surprised that there could be a system in operation which would benefit them in circumstances in which they has been divorced from the workplace for many years.  When one is endeavouring to legislate for the protection of women at work its benefits should be geared at women at work and not those who have decided to leave the workplace.</P>

      <P>In a time of scarce resources any moneys provided should be for the benefit of women at work who continue to make their PRSI contributions. It appears the benefits of the old maternity scheme continue to be available to women who have 13 consecutive contributions.  That is a very reasonable and modest requirement, necessitating a short involvement with the workplace on the part of claimants who may continue to work in the future. It constitutes a fair and reasonable balance in the circumstances, especially having regard to the fact that such balance is required on account of the scarcity of funds generally available to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Labour Party spokesman has supported the provisions in relation to trade disputes.  This Bill constitutes <Col N="2358" /> progressive legislation with which the Minister has taken great care by way of ensuring that in the area of compensation for unemployment, no injustices or anomalies will arise.  Possibly the Minister regarded the area as being of minority interest and neglected to legislate for it, but he has shown his concern and he has no hang-ups about doing what has to be done on the most generous basis possible.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this legislation in relation to trade disputes may well solve many industrial relations problems arising from the dissatisfaction with unequal treatment because of the anomalies which the legislation is designed to eliminate. I would have thought the Labour Party would have given a greater welcome to the earlier provisions in the Bill relating to the enforcement of the obligation on employers to keep adequate records.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to be quite critical of this Bill but it is only right that I should open by welcoming the further extension of the measure which the Minister has introduced up to March.  While I welcome it I still regard it as an inadequate way of dealing with the problems created by the equality legislation which was introduced. <Col N="2359" /> There are many people still who are suffering the real effects of that legislation.</P>
    <P>While we all welcome the treatment of women as equals under the social welfare code, the effect in many cases has been to leave families worse off, to deprive adults in the family of any income of their own.  I have had both men and women in touch with me who have been meanstested completely out of unemployment assistance as a result of the application of the legislation in that area.  Nevertheless, I welcome the extension of the measure up to March.  I hope there is something in the Minister's hint that there may be something in the budget to extend it or improve it even further.</P>
    <P>To deal specifically with the Bill, it is allegedly to deal with social welfare.  At least that is what we have been told in the past few days by the Minister and by various newspaper headlines.  The newspapers have trumpeted the fact that this will eliminate fraud in the social welfare system.  As far as I am concerned the biggest fraud we have been faced with in the past few days is the Bill itself, because it only has a handful of sections dealing with relatively minor matters against social welfare fraud while it makes very significant changes in the entitlement to and qualification for certain social welfare benefits.  This is not a Bill seriously aimed at reducing welfare fraud.  It is an attempt to introduce social welfare cuts by the back door.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he was going to introduce a Bill to take certain measures against employers who were co-operating in social welfare fraud. When the Bill was published the media, with few exceptions, accepted this and never looked beyond the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to discover that there was far more to it than that and that, in fact, if proposed very significant cutbacks in the areas of disability and maternity benefits.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also clearly in breach of the commitments given in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was recently <Col N="2360" /> negotiated with the social partners.  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto said quite specifically that Fianna Fáil would maintain benefits in real terms.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was even more specific.  It said:</P>
    <P>The Government will maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits and, within the resources available, will consider special provisions for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>The ink on that agreement was hardly dry when this Bill was produced.  Yet what it provided was not the maintenance of overall value of social welfare payments but major cutbacks involving qualification for disability benefits, invalidity pensions and maternity allowances.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary, given this Government's alleged commitment to family and motherhood, that the maternity allowance schemes have been singled out for particular attention.  The Bill represents a particularly objectionable attack on the social welfare rights of women.  Ireland was the last country in the EC to introduce maternity legislation and now we are the first to start cutting it back.  The Coalition Government in 1984 reduced the level of maternity benefit payable to women in employment from 80 per cent to 70 per cent.  Now this Government are trying to take away the PRSI element for women getting maternity benefit who are out of the workforce.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in relation to the points made by Deputy Abbott that it is only fair that women out of contact with work should lose the pay-related benefit, let me ask him if he would apply his mind to the fact that most civilised and modern men would regard the activities of the woman in the home at least as work, and that it is highly insulting to the women of this country who choose to stay in the home to rear their children not to regard that as work.  If the Deputy were to think carefully about it he might retract that remark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying that it should be universal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant also that our Constitution guarantees that the woman should not be obliged to work outside the home.  Clearly there is a contradiction and dilemma for Fianna Fáil in what they are proposing here today in relation to maternity benefit.</P>
      <P>The decision to abolish entitlement to pay-related benefit in the case of all new claims for maternity benefit under the general scheme is particularly sinister. It is the first time that the pay-related element of any benefit has been abolished in its entirety.  It may be that the Government are testing the water to see what the reaction would be to a wider attack on the pay-related system.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 to 7 of the Bill deal with measures directed against employers who may be co-operating with employees in social welfare fraud.  We have no problems at all with these sections.  Indeed we feel that in some respects the penalties may not be heavy enough.  I have no doubt that a large amount of social welfare fraud does go on and that involving people working and claiming can only go on with the co-operation of the employer. Some employers have, in fact, been encouraging employees to claim as it enables them to pay a level of wages below the normal rates.  Indeed, I have come across cases where employers have refused to employ men and women unless they remained on social welfare.</P>
      <P>However, it is important that we should keep this problem in proportion and not be taken in by the concerted campaign by some sections of the media and a number of public representatives to wildly exaggerate the nature and extent of social welfare abuse.  It is an indisputable fact that social welfare fraud exists but suggestions that this is costing the country hundreds of millions of pounds are wild exaggeration and appear to be part of a campaign designed to undermine confidence in the social welfare system on the one hand and, on the other, to pave the way for the sort of cutbacks which this Bill provides for, and also to promote ill-feeling between those in work and those out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who deals on a daily basis with <Col N="2362" /> those dependent on social welfare knows that benefits are normally paid out only after the most rigorous checking.  Very often people in real need are deprived of payment by complicated bureaucratic procedures.  It is also important to remember that for every case where somebody is claiming social welfare benefit to which they are not entitled, many more through ignorance of the system are failing to claim their full entitlement. The former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, said in the Dáil last year that the Department did not have the resources to undertake formal measurement of the level of non-take-up of social welfare benefits.  We can only guess at the level of non-take-up, but it is likely that the gain to the State as a result of this is many times greater than the loss through social welfare abuse.  I would refer to two items, in particular, in this regard.</P>
    <P>When the family income supplement was introduced, we were told that it would benefit 35,000 families.  Not more than 5,000 have ever availed of that scheme.  So far as I am aware, no investigation has ever taken place to find out why there is this discrepancy between the two figures.  I proposed on a number of occasions in this House that the least we could do was notify people who are at work &mdash; because this scheme is specifically for people who are on low pay and at work &mdash; with their tax-free allowance forms each year that people earning below a certain amount can and should apply for a family income supplement. Vague reference has been made to the difficulty in co-ordinating the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  I have never had a satisfactory answer to my queries but would be very interested to know what the present Minister's thoughts are on how the family income supplement could be used to take many thousands of families out of the poverty trap in which they are lodged at present.</P>
    <P>The second point I wanted to make in relation to non-take-up is that the only survey that I have seen in that regard was carried out during a social welfare <Col N="2363" /> rights week which was organised, I think, last year.  Out of a thousand inquiries in one week which the Dublin welfare group sent out, one in six were not getting their correct entitlements in terms of disability benefit, unemployment assistance, medical cards and so forth.  It is obviously not an accurate measure of the problem but is an indication that there is a problem there and a significant one.</P>
    <P>As I have stated previously, The Workers' Party Deputies in this House are absolutely opposed to anyone making fraudulent claims on social welfare. However, I have to qualify that by stating that in many cases which I have come across the people involved in claiming benefits or allowances to which they were not, strictly speaking, entitled are driven to it through poverty, because they are in the hands of moneylenders, because they see their families lacking in food, clothing, or other necessities of life.  What we need is not a witch hunt against social welfare recipients.  We need a calm and rational programme to end the social welfare abuse that exists and at the same time ensure that all those in need get their full entitlements.</P>
    <P>It is most objectionable, in particular, that single mothers are selected as the constant target for those complaining about social welfare abuse.  Unmarried mothers are very soft targets for right wing politicians and the morally self-righteous in our society.  The myth that young women deliberately conceive in order to qualify for the unmarried mother's allowance is just that, a myth.  First, the level of unmarried mother's allowance is still well below that necessary to allow a mother and child to live their lives with any degree of comfort and dignity.  Secondly, for the majority of single mothers it is simply a temporary status and most eventually marry and forfeit their unmarried mother's allowance.  I understand that in the majority of cases that happens within 12 months of the birth of their first child.</P>
    <P>A regular series of articles on alleged social welfare fraud contrasts sharply with the silence of newspapers and, <Col N="2364" /> indeed, television on the matter of tax evasion and avoidance which has been clearly shown to this House, through parliamentary questions, to be going on in our society.  It is a fact that nobody seeks to deny that there is a vast industry out there of accountants who assist in a very big way in this area.  Such evasion and avoidance certainly amount to many hundreds of times the loss to the State from all social welfare frauds combined.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one or two further points in relation to fraud, particularly with regard to statements which have been made in this House.  The Minister tended to confuse a number of terms.  I do not know if he did this deliberately or otherwise.  He talked of overpayments of social welfare, of withholding of social welfare payments by employers and about abuse and fraud.  Could he tell me if he regards all those terms as referring to the one thing?  Does he regard them all as fraud?  Is abuse the same as fraud? Is withholding or overpayment the same as fraud?  I know of many people who have received benefits and allowances to which they were not entitled, not because they went out deliberately to defraud the system but because the system itself could not stop those payments when they were received.  Does anyone seriously think that a man with a family who receives in the post a cheque for £70 or £80 to which he is not entitled will put the cheque back in the post, if he has in his pocket an ESB bill for £70, or a gas bill for £100, or a rent bill for £200?</P>
    <P>There should be clarity in the terminology that we use.  It is beginning to be accepted that all overpayments of social welfare are abuses and fraud on the part of the claimant, when clearly that is not the case.  A figure was used here tonight of £36 million for fraud.  If my memory serves me correctly, Deputy Jim Mitchell referred to that figure which is in the Minister's speech, saying that the Minister claimed that £36 million was recovered as a result of clamping down on fraud.  That is my paraphrase.  What the Minister actually said was:</P>
    <P>This year, for instance, we are well <Col N="2365" /> on target to achieve savings in excess of £36 million within my Department through a series of measures including some to eliminate fraud and abuse and others to achieve more effective use of resources, for example by providing opportunities for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do this House and the public a service if he were to clarify exactly what he is talking about when using that phrase of £36 million savings. Would he specify for us how much of that sum is as a result of overpayment to claimants through no fault of their own, how much is as a result of fraud on the part of claimants, how much is as a result of fraud on the part of employers, how much is simply savings made through efficiencies in the system and so on.  I have no doubt that in tomorrow morning's newspapers this figure of £36 million will be portrayed as the level of fraud and abuse of the system and as the saving carried out in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to disability benefit.  He quoted figures which, on the face of it, seem starting.  He said:</P>
    <P>Of 88,000 claimants referred to medical referees this year, 19,000 were found to be capable of work and 3,000 ceased to claim benefit.  A further 19,000 persons failed to attend for examination and except in a small number of cases where there was good reason for their failure to attend, they were liable to a nine week disqualification and a second referral.</P>
    <P>Taking that on its own, one would assume that the Minister had suddenly found these 88,000 people, of whom 19,000 had been found out and so on.  From page 33 of the report on the statistical information of the social services for 1986 it is clear that what the Minister is talking about is nothing new.  It is quite common for such large numbers to be called to be examined by a medical referee.  It is quite common for a large number not to turn up and it is also quite common for a large number to be found fit for work.  The figures the Minister quoted are not much <Col N="2366" /> larger in many cases than the figures for 1985 and 1986.</P>
    <P>In 1985, the number of persons summoned for examination was some 75,000. In 1986, it was some 82,000 and in 1987, presumably up until this month, it was some 88,000.  Therefore, the Minister has called in 6,000 more than were called in last year when 7,000 more were called in than was the case in 1985.  In 1985, the number found capable of work was 14,000.  In 1986, the corresponding figure was 14,000 and in 1987 it is 19,000, an increase of 5,000.  However, the Minister went on to say that the number of persons who did not attend for examination is 19,000 but that figure is the same as that for 1985.  Indeed, in 1986 the figure was 25,000.</P>
    <P>So far as those statistics are concerned, the Minister has not unearthed any great new vein of abuse in the system.  What the Minister has revealed in his figures is that he is continuing the process which has been in existence for many years which involves calling in, presumably at random, thousands upon thousands of people each year to be examined by a medical referee to prove that they are still unfit for work.  Practically every Deputy in this House deals with people on a weekly basis who have been found fit for work but who, certainly to the layman's eye, are clearly unfit for work.</P>
    <P>One must ask to what extent the increase from 14,000 last year to 19,000 this year is simply a tightening up of the criteria for fitness for work.</P>

I have dealt with constituents who although clearly unfit for work have been found to be fit for work and who have been put through a process month after month of trying to prove that they are unfit for work.  I had one case of a young woman who was barely able to walk after having discs removed from her back but who was <Col N="2367" /> found fit to work.  I am asking the Minister to indicate whether the criteria for deciding fitness for work have been changed.</P>

      <P>As there are other Deputies waiting to get in I do not want to delay the House but my main point is that we should approach this matter in a very calm and rational way and should not take figures for this year without comparing them with figures for last year. While we must acknowledge that there is abuse and fraud, we must also acknowledge that there is a significant degree of underclaiming of benefits and of delays in payment as a result of the bureaucratic tangle which is the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The present system of social welfare is without doubt incredibly complex and complicated.  There are nearly 40 different categories of recipient and about 23 different rates of payment, some of them with less than £1 between them.  Simplification and streamlining of the system could eliminate much of the abuse and would ensure a full level of take up by all who are entitled to benefit.  It would help both recipients and administrators and free resources for other work such as the collection, as I said earlier, of unpaid taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our objections to this Bill are based on the cutbacks contained in sections 8 to 11 and part of section 16.  Under section 8 persons will now have to have at least five years paid contributions to qualify for payment of disability benefit for a period of more than 12 months.  Section <Col N="2368" /> 9 applies a similar provision to invalidity pension.  It is important to remember that only 12 months ago the requirement was only three years paid contributions; this was increased earlier this year to four years.  Now, it is being increased to five years.  This will mean, for instance, that a young person who has not had an opportunity to build up five years contributions and who falls ill will be deprived of benefit after 12 months irrespective of whether his or her health had recovered.  There seems to be no justification for this move other than that of penny pinching and further petty restrictions.</P>
    <P>All sorts of claims have been made about abuses in the disability benefit system, particularly involving women, but none of these have been substantiated. Great play is made by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael of the fact that a large proportion of those who are referred to a medical referee for a second opinion are either found to be fit for work or do not attend and go back to work voluntarily.  To some extent I have dealt with that matter in the figures I have quoted.  What is significant is that what is never referred to is that only a small proportion, around one quarter, are called to go before a medical referee for a second opinion.</P>
    <P>It can take up to four weeks to get a second medical opinion.  The fact that someone fails to turn up or is found to be fit for work in no way implies a fake claim.  Most people are ill for far less than four weeks.  Indeed, the average duration of illness is 11 to 12 days.  Therefore, it is quite natural that, given the delay in getting a second opinion, people themselves will decide that they are now fit for work and will have improved sufficiently to allow the referee to decide that they are fit for work.  Most people will accept the advice of a medical referee or of their own doctor.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides, in the cases of claims under the old maternity allowance scheme, that, for new claims commencing after 4 January next, of the paid or credited contributions which claimants are required to have in the governing <Col N="2369" /> contribution year, at least 13 must be paid contributions.  This will affect some 9,000 women who benefit under this scheme each year and will discriminate against women who are out of the workforce voluntarily or who have become unemployed.  Section 11 provides for the abolition of entitlement to paid benefit in the case of all new claims for maternity allowance under the old maternity allowance scheme.  This, again, will discriminate against women who are out of the workforce voluntarily or who have become unemployed.  These are women who will have contributed PRSI for many years, possibly 10 or more, who will have paid their PRSI in the expectation of qualifying for a certain level of benefit, including maternity benefit, if and when they should need it, and who will now find that that has been arbitrarily scrapped by the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (b) provides for the introduction of three waiting days for all women transferring from maternity allowance to disability benefit.  This means that the woman will be left with no income for three days.  One must ask, how is she expected to feed herself in that period?  In most cases women transferring from maternity allowance to disability benefit do so because of pregnancy related conditions.  I regard that as a mean and petty requirement.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech said that between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of claimants abuse their claim at some stage.  I should like the Minister to be more specific about that.  When he talks about abuse is he referring to claimants receiving payments which they may not be entitled to, something they may not be aware of?  Is the Minister referring to a deliberate decision by claimants to defraud the system?  Will the Minister indicate how he has come to the conclusion that the system is being defrauded in this way?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the disallowance of people seeking unemployment assistance.  On many occasions I drew attention to the fact that many young people do not get any benefit between the ages of 16 and 18 years. <Col N="2370" /> Young persons living at home with parents who have an income, even if they are more than 18, do not receive any benefit. There are many people who are not so young and who live with their parents and must exist on a very small allowance. A new problem has arisen because of the introduction of equality legislation last year.  A man who was formerly automatically entitled to unemployment assistance and to an adult dependant rate for his wife is now no longer entitled to unemployment assistance if his wife is earning.  Before the equality legislation was introduced there was discrimination against women but we now have reverse discrimination in that men are being deprived of unemployment assistance.  In many cases men who are not living with their wives or are separated are being discriminated against.  Many anomalies exist in our system and I urge a dramatic overhaul of it.</P>

      <P>I should like to advise Deputy Barnes that the debate must move to the Government side and that the Minister must be called not later than 10.15 p.m.  Deputy Ahern, who is now offering, is entitled to take all that time if he wishes but, mindful of the fact that Deputy Barnes has waited so patiently, I ask him to make allowances.</P>

      <P>I will give Deputy Barnes an opportunity to contribute. Before I deal with the provisions in the Bill I should like to make a number of general points in relation to social welfare. I was delighted to hear the Minister announce an extension of the alleviating measures.  Credit should be given where credit is due and I was surprised that Opposition speakers, particularly those from the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, who complain about many aspects of the social welfare system, did not laud that move by the Minister.  We are all aware that if that measure was withdrawn many people would be left in great need. The Minister has extended the £12 or £20 payment from the end of the year to next April and I congratulate him for that <Col N="2371" /> decision.</P>
      <P>The Jobsearch scheme which was criticised in the early days of its operation has proved a great success.  Following the results of a pilot scheme in four different centres the Government decided to extend the Jobsearch scheme to the entire country.  I understand that in the region of 131,000 people have been interviewed under that scheme.  We may have doubts about whether people will find jobs following their participation in the scheme but I understand that 4,000 people have been placed in jobs and that 26,500 people have been placed on Manpower or social employment schemes. That is an indication of the success of the scheme.  It is worth remembering that 57 per cent of the people on the Jobsearch scheme had been on the live register for three or more years.  It is right that we should make every effort to help such people to get a job.  I visited the Jobsearch centre in my town on a number of occasions and I was pleased to see the number of people, many of whom are middle-aged, who were involved.  It is difficult for such people to find a job in this day and age if they do not have the necessary skills and that is one of the reasons why the Government decided to extend the scheme to the entire country.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on producing the revised guide to social welfare services, which is compulsive reading for those involved with those services or who deal with the public.  The last guide was issued in 1983 and we have not had a review since.  The new guide will be a tremendous help to politicians and others who have dealings with the public.  Those involved in the social welfare system should procure a copy of the guide at any social welfare office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his work in the Department of Social Welfare since he took office.  In this age of cutbacks he has fought his corner at the Cabinet table very well.  It is obvious that the Department of Social Welfare have not suffered greatly as a result of Government cutbacks.  For <Col N="2372" /> example, in July the Minister was able to announce a 3 per cent increase in all rates.  He was able to improve the family income supplement scheme and make it slightly more relevant than it has been to date.  The Minister also extended treatment benefits.  That has been on the cards for many years and former Governments have been criticised for not bringing such a scheme forward.  I am pleased that Fianna Fáil brought it forward and that the take-up has been good, particularly in regard to dental treatment, despite initial opposition.  We should welcome the extension of social insurance to the self-employed.  Everybody should be covered in the social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>We should welcome the move to computerisation in the Department of Social Welfare.  I accept that it has not been introduced solely by the Minister but it has proved of tremendous help in the Department.  The Minister should be complimented for paying the Christmas bonus this year.  At a time of financial cutbacks it was a tremendous achievement to get the money to give a bonus to those on social welfare benefit at Christmas.  I do not think the Minister, or the Government, have been given sufficient credit for that decision.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes care of a number of anomalies that have manifested themselves in the social welfare code over the years.  I am surprised that quite a number of these have not been taken care of before now.  In particular the section which refers to trade disputes is excellent in that now it refers only to the persons directly affected in the trade dispute: in other words, people who got financial help during the dispute, may find ultimately that they are disqualified from gaining from social welfare.  I am surprised that was not taken on board by the previous Government of which the Labour Party were a member.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House will agree there is a need to ensure that fraud is kept to an absolute minimum.  We are all <Col N="2373" /> aware of the report that fraud is prevalent. There have been reports in my constituency, which is close to the Border, that some people may hop across the Border and claim both in the Twenty-six Counties and in the North.  A crackdown has taken place on this practice over a number of years and it is not as prevalent as it was.  I note from the Minister's speech that a number of units have been set up in a number of years.  The most recent one set up since we took office was the joint inspection unit under a pilot scheme whereby the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare work hand-in-hand using computers to ensure that fraud does not take place.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the entire social welfare code that worries me is the fact that the PRSI number provided is allocated by the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance.  If we are to eliminate fraud we will have to provide that there is one number throughout all Departments; whoever gives that number, it should be an absolute number for each person.  The social welfare code has a problem when these numbers emanate from the Revenue Commissioners rather than from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I understand the external control unit look into the unemployment claims and interview people in relation to them.  The special investigation unit take care of concurrent working and signing on and I understand that a number of savings have been made in relation to that in the past year or so.</P>
    <P>In regard to fraud, the aspect addressed in this Bill is in relation to employers. Anyone who knows about prosecutions knows that up to now there have been very few prosecutions of employers in regard to social welfare.  As the saying goes, it takes two to tango.  Most prosecutions to date have been of employees, as I am quite aware.  This Bill tries to address the problem by providing that once an employer takes somebody on he must notify the Department of Social Welfare of the commencement of the <Col N="2374" /> employment.  This is to be welcomed because employers have been taking people on and an arrangement has been made between them that the employee continues to get the benefit of social welfare. That should not happen.  Perhaps this is one way we will be able to get rid of that problem.</P>
    <P>Another provision for the elimination of fraud is in relation to furnishing particulars of the employee, details of his earnings and the period in which these earnings have been made.  Up to now the inspectors have been unable to get as much co-operation from employers as they would require to investigate claims quickly.  Another provision is for inspectors to enter the premises of selfemployed people and demand the records.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that a dependant of a recipient who dies may receive benefit for six weeks after the time of death. After a death dependants may face a period of trauma and problems in trying to make ends meet.  Not as much publicity is given to this as should be.</P>
    <P>Section 18 relates to mobility allowance which is not now regarded as means in the calculation for non-contributory pension.  I understand a number of people have been affected by this.  It is a pity that up to now some people have been disallowed non-contributory pensions because they have been in receipt of mobility allowance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the social welfare system generally I understand the Minister intends to set up one-stop shops in the employment exchanges.  This should have been done ages ago.  Years ago, unfortunately, employment exchanges were what they were called, employment exchanges.  Nowadays they are somewhere for people to go and get their weekly pay-out and there is no question of them getting a job by going to that building.  With the one-stop shops people can go into the building and be referred, if they wish, to someone from AnCO or Manpower under the new body FÁS to get assistance in job location, rather than having to go from one building to another <Col N="2375" /> in a town.  The one-stop shops are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  It should be given due consideration and be supported by the other side of the House. Now I will let other speakers in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I appreciate your helpful intervention in getting me even eight minutes.  I thank Deputy Ahern also for granting me eight minutes which I shall use to address what Second Stage is all about, the principle of the Bill.  I shall not have time to go through some of the other areas.</P>
      <P>There is general welcome for the provisions regarding fraud.  I will add my voice to those who have said that employers who defraud their employees of very large sums of PRSI contributions to the extreme distress of those employees must be looked at seriously.  I welcome the fact that a joint inspection unit has been drawn from the Revenue and Social Welfare inspectorates to work on a pilot basis to investigate enterprises which are known to have a high incidence of tax and social welfare fraud.  One of the shames and embarrassments of this Chamber is the fact that we have not brought in the right companies legislation to cover employers who have acted in an unjust, immoral and criminal way.  Our companies legislation should enable us to take action against such people who close a business one day and open next day at another address and behave in the same way.  This should not be allowed.  We will not have the powers needed to deal with such people until we introduce the necessary companies legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn now to the abolition of the entitlement to the old maternity allowance scheme.  Section 11 will provide for the abolition of entitlement to payrelated benefit in the case of new claims for the old maternity allowance scheme. <Col N="2376" /> I want to remind the House that on 14 May 1985 the Joint Committee on Women's Rights published their second report.  There is a certain amount of discrimination against women in the area of social welfare and a lack of acceptance and value put on our work in the home. Deputy De Rossa has already referred to this and Deputy Abbott made insulting reference to it too.  As I am an optimist all I can hope is that, as Deputy Abbott is now a member of the Committee on Women's Rights, at the end of this tenure he will have a greater appreciation and insight into the value and work of women.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this section in the Bill is a denial and a contradiction of everything the all-party committee recommended in 1985.  Paragraph 9.1 of that report reads:</P>
    <P>Often women have to cease working for a variety of reasons, such as to have a baby or to care for a sick member of the family.  This type of work which is done outside of direct employment is still a valuable contribution to the welfare of society and the Joint Committee agrees with the suggestion put forward by many groups and individuals that a system of credits should be introduced for such women who have to temporarily leave the workforce.  Such a system would ensure that a woman, while receiving no benefits during her year or two period at home would be able to re-enter the workforce without any break in her contribution sequence.  The Joint Committee feels that it would be socially and economically desirable that women and men who take time off work to look after their children should also get credits and the Department of Social Welfare should be working towards this end.</P>
    <P>At page 18 paragraph 5.4 the committee recommend:</P>
    <P>The fact that maternity benefit is paid to insured workers only raises many questions relating to child rearing and it is another example of the <Col N="2377" /> discrimination levelled against the woman in the home.  The Joint Committee recommends the extension of maternity payment to all women regardless of their &ldquo;insured&rdquo; or &ldquo;uninsured&rdquo; status.</P>
    <P>Two years later we find that these recommendations have not been taken up.  I urge the Minister to realise that this section in the Bill deals a blow to women, totally devalues their position in the home and does not take into account the discrimination against women while they are unemployed and are not earning.  To deprive a woman of credits in that short period, when her earnings are only 50 per cent to 60 per cent of men's earnings in any case, is a disgrace.  Instead of cutting back and denying women credits, in every sense of the word, to maternity benefits &mdash; because they are ensuring the next generation &mdash; what we should be doing is increasing their benefits.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have more time to go into more detail but this trend must be reversed and, under the employment equality legislation, positive discrimination in favour of women should be allowed.  This should apply not just to women in employment but also when they leave the workforce to bring children into this world.  It is very disillusioning that the words in the Constitution and the work of women in the home have not been taken seriously and that once again women are being discriminated against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with Deputy Barnes' comments.  I welcome her support for the action we are taking to deal with employers, and her very even handed treatment of the old maternity scheme.  She has this matter in persective. The new maternity scheme applies to all women at work.  The old maternity scheme could have been abandoned in 1981 when I brought in the new scheme but I did not abandon it because I was afraid some people might lose out in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barnes and others suggested there should be a new system.  Deputy <Col N="2378" /> Barnes put this in its broadest context particularly referring to the work of the joint committee when she said there should be arrangements made for special credits.  That would be an equitable across the board system.  What exists at the moment are the remnants of a system which has been there for years with many people signing for credits only having left the workforce.  In that case we have to ask ourselves if all the women who have left the workforce and have not signed for credits are entitled to those benefits. I often hear that argument.  We will bear this suggestion in mind but how far we will get with it in the near future is another question.  I certainly appreciate the way Deputy Barnes expressed her concern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said he would like to see longer prison sentences.  I said at the outset that I would be open to the views of the House as they relate to employers. The Deputy said he would be putting down amendments and I will look very sympathetically at them.  He also mentioned officials being grounded and cutbacks in the area of investigating frauds. There were no cutbacks.  More was spent on travel for the investigation of fraud last year than ever before but, at the end of the year, every section must try to keep within their budget.  A case arose in the north-western region which was given very wide publicity.  I looked into it right away but it did not have any bearing on the activities in that area.  Investigations nearer home were being carried out in the last six weeks of the year, and there were many such cases, but one thing we made clear was that, if money was needed to carry out investigations, it would be available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell also raised the question of rationalising multiple means tests.  A study of this is in progress under the Department of Health and we expect a report early in the New Year.  Meanwhile, the Department of Social Welfare are looking at their own schemes to see if they can be rationalised.  Deputy Jim Mitchell also said he was disturbed at the lack of targeting of resources to special cases.  We will certainly be targeting the <Col N="2379" /> resources as well as we can.  Several Deputies asked what we would do with the savings effected.  I explained in my speech on the Estimate last week that we were able to offset increases and to avoid cutbacks in schemes as a result of the savings.  We were able to extend alleviating payments to the end of the year, which I know Deputies welcome, with moneys saved.  Indeed, we hope to extend them to the end of April and to examine them further in the context of the budget for next year.  Our savings have had a bearing on that decision by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell raised the question of moneylenders.  I know that most Deputies are concerned at the operations of moneylenders and, in deference to him, I will ask the Combat Poverty Agency to look at that area to see if they have a project that might be helpful in that respect.  It is really an area for the Minister for Justice but we are concerned at the poverty and the implications for the people with whom we are directly concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell also referred to the need for special quarterly payments. I will certainly bear that in mind as I know that many Deputies are keen to see such payments.  However, that is a budgetary matter.  Deputy Wyse stressed the fact that he supports the actions against fraud and that he wants to see the money used for the poorest sections.  That is also my objective and we must ensure that the resources are made available to those in greatest need.  At the same time, we must ensure that the interest of the taxpayers is protected and that fraud and abuse of the system is reduced to the lowest level possible.  Deputy Wyse also spoke about the number of people affected by the withdrawal of disability benefit and maternity allowance.  Three thousand people are affected by the withdrawal of the old maternity scheme and 2,000 claimants out of 242,000 will be affected next year by the cut in the disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell mentioned the fact that a person can accumulate contributions and <Col N="2380" /> that it is not a question of continuous payments.  It means that long term disability benefit, beyond 12 months, will require 260 contributions.  This is a major benefit and creates a substantial demand on the social insurance fund.  In that context, I do not consider the amount of contributions to be an unreasonable requirement.  I should also point out to Deputy Wyse that existing claims are not affected; it only applies to claims made at the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>The Craig Gardner report on the internal workings of the Department is aimed at cutting out fraud and abuses of all sorts and providing higher security within the system.  I will certainly consider publishing a summary of the principal recommendations and making it available to Deputies.  The report is only secret in so far as the question of security is concerned and if it was made public in that regard you could forget about security systems.  The report stresses that there is a hard core of 2 per cent fraud in disability benefit and unemployment assistance and that there is a suspect area up to 7 per cent.  I should point out to Deputy Bell that one of the benefits of the extension of dental and optical care to the spouses of full rate PRSI workers is that many of the women concerned will keep those benefits.  Deputy Bell also said that the Commission on Social Welfare made no recommendation in relation to disability benefit.  They recommended a whole new scheme through the employers and we are looking at that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell said he planned to oppose some sections of the Bill.  Perhaps we can discuss these issues more widely tomorrow, but we must rationalise our schemes and trim our sails in any way we can if we are to maintain the benefits for those who need them most.  I was surprised that Deputy Bell did not welcome the alleviating payments because I know he has a great interest in that area.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa welcomed those payments but he was inclined to say that there were no major initiatives in regard to fraud.  I think they are major.  I am talking now of the employer side.  These measures arise mainly from our own ideas and from the reports of inspectors and staff dealing with this area.  These reports indicate that there are loopholes in the system and that this is the reason for employers not being caught.  Our people are sent around in circles and at the end of the day they cannot nail those responsible for the fraud.  The purpose of these measures is to close the loopholes.  I am confident that this will have a major effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have asked about prosecutions in regard to employers.  Seven employers were prosecuted in 1985, six in 1986 and to date in 1987, 13 cases have been referred for prosecution.  In any event, the Deputies generally support our efforts in that area.  It was also mentioned that the cuts in disability benefit were particularly severe.  A total saving of about £4 million out of a total of £220 million will be achieved in that area.  In the Estimates for next year we have to face up to various potential areas for rationalisation.  I would like to point out to Deputy De Rossa that the savings prevent cutbacks in times of scarce resources and that we are not paving the way for <Col N="2382" /> further cuts.  I have appointed a consultant to examine the FIS scheme and I hope to have a report in the not-too-distant future on the take-up rate for the scheme.</P>
    <P>As I do not have time any more at this point, I will deal with the remaining questions on Committee Stage.  Deputy De Rossa had a great deal of information, as is his wont, and went into great detail on disability benefit statistics.  I think the most significant figure is a reduction of 9,000 in the number per week claiming since February of this year.  You may ask why?  The criteria did not change.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very serious matter on the Adjournment this evening. It concerns the non-appointment of a permanent teacher at Clohanbeg national school in County Clare.  Last Thursday I tabled a written question to the Minister asking her the reason (a) a school &mdash; Clohanbeg national school &mdash; in County Clare had been discriminated against in <Col N="2385" /> relation to the appointment of a permanent assistant teacher (b) the reason a letter issued from her Department on 10 August, 1987 sanctioning a temporary appointment and not a permanent appointment given that rule 88 had been complied with in this school and (c) if she would make a permanent appointment forthwith to the school in question.</P>
      <P>I was extremely dissatisfied with the response I got to that question.  I got a very vague answer and the specific points put were not answered.  I am now asking the Minister to tell me why, in June 1987, a permanent teacher was not appointed to Clohanbeg national school given that rule 88 had been complied with and that 33 pupils were in that school for the requisite period.  I should like to know why it took until 10 August for a letter to issue from the Minister's Department saying that the temporary teacher might be sanctioned at that time.  The result was that the manager did not know whether he could appoint a permanent teacher. That was followed by another letter on 21 September stating that a teacher could not be appointed unless the number at the school on the date of receipt of that letter, that was 21 September, was 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows the rules of her Department and she knows that her Department have acted in total contravention to the rules set down by her Department.  The position is that a permanent appointment should have been made in June 1987.  In the Minister's reply last week she stated that the reason for the temporary appointment of an assistant teacher, was authorised in the Department's letter of 10 August, was that an investigation was being made into a possible rearrangement of the education facilities in the area, that the temporary nature of the appointment was in accordance with official practice in cases of this kind.  I put to the Minister that this is not in accordance with official practice in cases of this kind because the letter which issued from her Department on 22 October stated that it was a special concession to allow a temporary teacher <Col N="2386" /> to be appointed and that that appointment would be made only up to the date of the Christmas holidays.  In those circumstances the Minister should have appointed the temporary teacher up to June 1988 and in the event of amalgamation not taking place by that date, that position should become permanent. There is an onus on the Minister to explain to the House why there has been such irregular activity in relation to the entire debacle of the lack of appointment of a permanent teacher to Clohanbeg national school.  I am asking the Minister to issue a letter tomorrow morning to the manager allowing him to make a permanent appointment to this school.</P>
    <P>Clohanbeg national school has been in existence since 1889, has a very fine educational record and has been fortunate to have had some excellent teachers. The present teacher, who is in charge of this one teacher school is an extremely hard worker and is highly appreciated by the parents.  The extent of her extra curricular activities is quite phenomenal. For instance, she teaches traditional music to the children after normal school hours and the pupils have won prizes in that respect throughout the country.  It is most unfortunate that the teachers, parents and the pupils of this area have been treated in such a disgraceful manner.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister up to now has not been fully aware of the finer details in this matter.  Now that the Minister is aware of the situation and that there are 33 pupils on the role since 3 November, a new family having moved into the area &mdash; I am confident that the prospects for 1989 and 1990 are exceptionally good.  There are a number of two and three year old children in the area who would be on stream to be enroled in the school.  Many young couples have settled down in the area so the future of Clohanbeg national school can go from strength to strength from now on.  In the final analysis the matter rests with the Minister to make the permanent appointment and I am requesting her to do so this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for raising the issue.  From what the Deputy has told me here tonight about young couples settling in the neighbourhood the future of Clohanbeg looks fruitful.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to explain at the outset that the difficulties experienced recently by Clohanbeg national school with regard to the appointment of a teacher arose, as the Deputy is aware, from the small size of the school.  Indeed, looking back through the records for the last number of years this question was looked at several times very keenly and with great scrutiny in the Department of Education under the previous two Ministers.  There are only 30 pupils enrolled.  At the school though the Deputy informs me how that since 6 November there are 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that if the Deputy says so but they have not yet been informed in the Department.  In Clohanbeg national school and in the other school, Cree, there are at different days and at different times great reports of variance of pupil attendance.  Officially 30 pupils are enrolled in the records of the Department.  They have not yet been told about the three extra pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school comes within the purview of my Department's policy of centralising smaller schools.  In stating that this is a policy I do not lay claim to it.  It was introduced in 1966 and has been pursued by all Ministers since then and in the case of this particular school pursued with great vigour under the Deputy's own administration.  Examples of suitable opportunities to explore the possibilities of amalgamating in all areas in small schools often come up.  It is not unusual for my Department to respond to an application for sanction of an appointment of a teacher to an established post or to a new post by allowing an appointment, on a temporary basis, so as to allow time to examine the feasibility of looking at one school and another school in the neighbourhood of similar numbers to see <Col N="2388" /> what can be worked out.  In that case the services of the temporary teacher would be accepted only until the further investigation was carried out.  In some cases it could happen that pupil numbers would &mdash; even after both places had been looked at &mdash; be sufficient to absorb the temporary teacher.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for rushing, a Cheann Comhairle, but I want to get to the point of the question which was asked.  The point I wish to stress is that sanctioning a temporary appointment is no more than a holding operation to which undue significance should not be attached.  I should like to state that it should not be taken as an irrevocable notice of closure because any process of amalgamation &mdash; I say this to allay the Deputy's fears &mdash; would have to include full consultation, were it to happen, with boards of management, teachers and parents concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn is aware that the establishment of a new teaching post is conditional on the attainment of a specified average enrolment for two successive quarters.  Compliance with this condition is not tantamount to an entitlement to proceed with the permanent appointment. The relevant rule for national schools requires school managers to submit all proposed appointments to the Department for approval.  If a manager appoints a teacher without prior official approval the Minister may refuse payment of salary for any service given by such teacher.  It follows that official ministerial approval of an appointment may be dependent on the fulfilment of certain conditions, one of which would be that the appointment would be provisional or temporary.</P>
    <P>I would be very surprised if the authorities of Clohanbeg national school claimed to have been totally taken aback by or were unaware of the possibility of talks and of a review of their whole situation. As the Deputy is aware it was until recently a one teacher school.  The amalgamation policy would be well known in the area from the experience of other schools there.  It was being looked at in the light of the neighbouring school of <Col N="2389" /> Cree and was proposed to the board of management in 1978.  While the eventual decisions were not proceeded with at that time the possibility was always there of raising the question and this was done during the time of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The recent history of the school began on 5 June 1987 when the appointment of a second teacher for the following September was sought.  The school had then 33 pupils.  It was noted that Cree which had a staff of two teachers had 36 pupils. To create a fourth teaching post for so few pupils, without further investigation, would have been irresponsible.  It was also necessary to ascertain the shifts in the balance of enrolments between the two schools.  After reading the records of both schools, which I got out tonight, I am slightly confused as to the way in which the two seem to interact and interchange so much.  I do know whether the increase in enrolments in Clohanbeg national school can be maintained or whether, if it could be maintained, it could adversely affect the welfare of Cree national school, possibly to the extent of bringing about the suppression of a post there.  I should like to ask the Deputy how many miles are the schools distant from one another?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2390" /> The investigation necessitated a request to the district inspector for a full report. It was necessary for him to examine the records of both schools &mdash; I say that very clearly to the Deputy &mdash; to obtain information which would clarify the issues to which I have referred.  This was not possible during the closure of the school for the summer holidays.  In the meantime approval to proceed with the temporary appointment was conveyed to the manager. When the inspector's report was received it transpired that the enrolment had reduced to 30 pupils in September and that the projected enrolment given by the management authorities at that time for September 1988 was no more than 29.  The number required for the creation of an extra post&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am glad to inform the Deputy that the appointment will be sanctioned until June 1988.</P>

However, it is a question which is kept under review.

Under the new fares arrangement, Australian visitors to London will be able to travel on to Dublin at no extra cost.

    <P>I propose to continue to monitor developments in this matter and I can assure the House that if developments should pose any risk for this country I will have no hesitation in taking the necessary steps, under existing Irish legislation, to prohibit transportation by air of dangerous substances through Irish airspace.</P>

      <P>Work on the construction of the new runway at Dublin airport is progressing satisfactorily and is on target. It is expected that the project will be completed by early summer 1989.  It is not proposed to hold a public inquiry into any issue connected with the construction of the new runway.  All environmental issues were examined in depth before the decision was made by the Government to approve the construction of the runway.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any public concern at the number of aircraft movements at Weston Aerodrome. Apart from aerodrome circuits, most training flights from Weston operate away from built up areas and over open countryside and all such flights are carried out under the supervision of licensed flight instructors.  The fatal accident involving a training flight at Weston on 18 October last is the subject of an investigation by my Department and it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment in the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>Yes, I have seen the report and I am sympathetic to the case made.  My views are those contained in the final paragraph at page 16 of the report, namely; that the Government remain committed to the maintenance and expansion of official development aid as soon as economic circumstances permit. I confirm that the Government accept the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance and will reach the target as soon as economic circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that records are not maintained in such a manner as would enable the information requested by the Deputy regarding the number and valuation of seized vehicles to be given without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of <Col N="2031" /> official time.  However, it is estimated that in the period from 1 January 1986 to 30 November 1987, approximately 4,000 vehicles were seized by Customs and that the total value of such vehicles was in the region of £12 million.</P>
      <P>The general categories of reasons for seizures of the vehicles were the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  irregular importation or use in the State without payment of the proper Customs and Excise charges;</P>
      <P>(ii)  vehicle used for the conveyance of uncustomed goods;</P>
      <P>(iii)  where rebated hydrocarbon oil offences were involved;</P>
      <P>(iv)  breach of temporary importation regulations; and</P>
      <P>(v)  breach of land frontier regulations.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Vehicles are seized for one or other of the reasons mentioned on the grounds that they are liable to forfeiture and the question of charging Customs and Excise duties does not normally arise prior to seizure.</P>
      <P>It would be unusual for the amount of Customs and Excise duties payable in respect of a motor vehicle to exceed the value of the vehicle.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, the Revenue Commissioners would be in a position to clarify the question of the amount of any charges due.</P>

    <P>(2) The information relating to employees whose income tax was deducted under Pay As You Earn is necessarily somewhat restricted in coverage because all end of year returns were not capable of being processed at the time the information in the tables was being compiled.</P>
    <P>(3) &ldquo;Total Income&rdquo; is the total income of taxpayers from all sources as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  It is net of such items as capital allowances, interest paid in full, losses brought forward, allowable expenses and superannuation contributions.</P>

      <P>The estimated yield to the Exchequer from taxation classified into the standard tax heads for 1987 is published in the Government booklet entitled &ldquo;Budget 1987&rdquo; which is available in the Library. The standard tax heads shown in the 1987 budget booklet do not include a breakdown of income tax into its constituent parts, such as PAYE and self-employed. However, I supplied this breakdown of the 1987 income tax estimate to Deputy Barry Desmond on 20 October, 1987 in response to Parliamentary Question No. 28.  I refer the Deputy to this reply. The 1987 outturn tax figures in the standard format will be available in early January in the end year Exchequer returns.</P>
      <P>As regards the estimated amount of tax to be realised from each band, statistics showing the yield for 1987-88 by range of taxable income will not be available for some time.</P>

      <P>Levels of taxation are kept under review in the annual budgetary context. However, the scope for reductions in tax rates is totally dependent on the overall state of the public finances.  The Deputy will be aware of the major constraint that this represents in current circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the circulation of brochures in County Louth I have been informed that 5,000 photocopied leaflets were distributed through publicity post in County Louth.  The person or persons who photocopied these would not have a <Col N="2049" /> VAT liability on them.  No information is available to me on any other leaflets.</P>
    <P>I have no view on what will happen the goods in question when sold.  It is a matter of conjecture as to who will buy the goods and as to their ultimate location.  The Customs and Excise staff will, of course, be vigilant to ensure that legal travellers' allowances are not exceeded and that attempts to smuggle goods are defeated.</P>
    <P>With regard to tax harmonisation developments on this front will take place in the context of the recent EC Commission proposals to abolish fiscal frontiers. It is axiomatic that if tax rates in neighbouring states are equalised taxbased smuggling would cease.</P>

      <P>Proper regulations and berthing instructions are being implemented in Howth Harbour but implementation is sometimes made difficult due to a lack of cooperation by some fishermen.</P>

      <P>As there is only one ice chute provided by BIM, one berth is considered adequate for discharge of ice, at present.</P>

      <P>The most recent statistics on traffic accidents in the Phoenix Park cover the three year period to 31 December 1986 and were supplied by the Garda Síochána. The total number of recorded accidents in the park in that period was 236, of which 142 occurred on the main road. These figures do not include a large number of accidents which were not reported each year.  This fact is acknowledged by the Garda and is borne out by park statistics on the number of deer killed each year, as against the number of reported accidents involving deer.  The total number of reported accidents involving personal injuries in this period was 66.  There were also three fatalities. Approximately 40 deer are killed each year as a result of traffic accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study group on traffic in the Phoenix Park comprising representatives of Government Departments, local authorities and State bodies with an interest <Col N="2054" /> in traffic, produced a report in 1985 on traffic control in the park.  The provision of roundabouts at junctions, as a means of reducing accidents and preventing speeding on the main road, was considered by the study group but was rejected on the grounds of cost of the necessary ancillary lighting and the fact that such lighting would be aesthetically unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The study group recommended instead the closing of certain minor roadways to traffic, the delineation of the main road and resurfacing to provide better skid resistance, the re-erection of the piers at Parkgate Street and the closure of some side gates during peak hours.  These recommendations were incorporated in a management plan for the Phoenix Park launched by the Commissioners of Public Works last year.  Certain minor roads have already been closed to vehicular traffic and White's Gate has also been closed at peak times.  Work on the resurfacing and delineation of the main road, including the creation of hard shoulders and the narrowing of the central carriageway, is now almost complete.  The re-erection of the two central gate piers at Parkgate Street is also well advanced and will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of manpower to individual stations is a matter for the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and demands on Garda services. A new station is being built at present to replace the old station in Lucan and I am informed by the Garda authorites that it is not envisaged at this stage that the opening of the new station will, in itself, call for any change in the Garda strength at the centre.</P>

      <P>Non-public duty is performed by members of the Garda Síochána under arrangements made between the Garda authorities and organisers of events such as football matches and race meetings who seek the services of gardaí to perform duties for which they would not normally be officially assigned.  In accordance with long-standing practice, members of the force are made available for the performance of such duties and the State charges for their services.  The charges made take account of pay, allowances and overheads, and are as follows:</P>

I did not find it possible to accede to the request.

      <P>In September, October, and November 1987, broadcasts on the HF Volmet at Ballygirreen were suspended completely on 16, 14 and six occasions, respectively.  The broadcasts were made at hourly intervals instead of every 30 minutes on 15, 14 and 17 occasions respectively.</P>
      <P>From 1 to 11 December, no complete cessation of broadcasts occurred but there were four occasions when broadcasts were on an hourly basis instead of every 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>The interruption of the Volmet service is in consequence of the general restrictions on Civil Service staffing and overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's embargo on the filling of vacancies and their restrictions on overtime are aimed at cutting public <Col N="2062" /> expenditure throughout the public service. It is difficult to make any exceptions to the general rule without breaching the principle.</P>

    <P>The supply of animals for the meat industry in the future will be determined by a range of factors including the volume of live cattle exported and the international market situation for beef as well as by producers' decisions on maintaining their breeding herds and their response to measures to encourage herd expansion which are currently under discussion with the various interests concerned.</P>

In relation to pigs, future killing capacity will also be affected by current plans for extensive rationalisation, covering both domestic and export premises.</P>

      <P>Under the farm modernisation scheme preferential rates of grant were available to farmers who undertook to carry out a farm development plan over a period of up to six years (eight years in disadvantaged areas).  The person in question joined the scheme as a development farmer in 1980 and his period in that category expired in December 1986.  He was given outline approval to construct a cubicle house and concrete yard in April 1982 and definitive approval for the same works was issued in April 1983.  However, the works were not completed when he ceased to have any entitlement to the preferential rate of grant on the expiry of his development plan in December 1986.  Notification of completion of the work was received in July 1987.  A grant of £1,082, calculated at the standard rate has been certified and will be paid as soon as practicable.</P>

      <P>The 1987 sheepmeat marketing year will end on 3 January 1988. The ewe premium for 1987 will not be known until some time later because the amount of the premium depends on market price levels over the whole marketing year.  On the basis of market prices up to the end of November, the ewe premium for 1987 is likely to be a little less than £21 per head.  I have already arranged for advance payment of £11 per ewe to sheep producers in disadvantaged areas in respect of 1987.</P>

In addition members of boards are paid normal expenses in respect of travel, subsistence and other necessary expenses, incurred arising from board membership.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if employees of local authorities on full PRSI over 60 years of age, who accept voluntary redundancy-early retirement under an official scheme circulated by the Department of the Environment on 15 October 1987 will be obliged to be available for work and to be genuinely seeking work under the amended Social Welfare Act which applied to the assistance rules to insurance services in order to qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 29 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 19 of the Social Welfare Act, 1986, entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Unemployment benefit may be payable up to 66 years of age and all claimants, irrespective of age, are required to satisfy the relevant conditions for entitlement.</P>
      <P>The fact that a person opts to leave employment under a scheme of voluntary redundancy or early retirement would not in itself disqualify that person from satisfying that condition.  Nevertheless, such persons who claim unemployment benefit would be required to satisfy the Department that they are available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in respect of social assistance and social insurance payments, he will give the real percentage growth in the rates of payment since 1980; and if he will compare this to real growth in Gross National Product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the period since 1980 varying percentage increases have been applied to long term and short term social welfare payments.  It is estimated that the real increase, i.e., the increase above the level of inflation, in these payments over this period has been around 21 per cent for short term payments, 30 per cent for long term unemployment assistance and 37 per cent for other long term payments. It is estimated that the real growth in Gross National Product over the period was less than 1 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kildare was denied Class A insurance stamps for his five years of employment when that person was working in excess of 18 hours per week; and if he will review the case with a view to awarding the individual Class A insurance stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, employment by one employer involving part time service as caretaker of lands or of property thereon is insurable at PRSI Class J rate of contribution.  The 18 hour figure which applies to certain part time employments does not apply to part time service as caretaker of lands or of property thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> The person concerned was employed part time as such a caretaker.  During part of the period he was concurrently employed by a second employer.  The deciding officer decided that his employment as caretaker with one employer only was insurable at PRSI Class J rate of contribution and that his employment while concurrently employed by a second employer was insurable at PRSI Class A rate of contribution.  The person concerned appealed against this decision but the appeals officer upheld the decision following an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The decision of the appeals officer is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of some new facts or fresh evidence being brought to his attention.  If the person concerned considers that he has any such facts or evidence he should submit them to the Department and they will be put before the appeals officer for his consideration.</P>
    <P>107.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he intends to resolve the anomaly whereby some recipients of unemployment benefit can receive less money than if they were on unemployment assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit claim is made for a maximum duration of 15 months.  The rate of benefit payable after six months may be reduced where the claimant's record of paid contributions had not reached a certain standard prior to the claim.  The reduced rate of benefit payable in such cases for the last nine months of the claim is equivalent to the maximum short term rate of unemployment assistance payable to persons living in urban areas who have been unemployed for less than 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reduced rate of benefit is equivalent to the highest rate of unemployment assistance payable to any claimants with the exception of the long term rate of assistance which is payable to persons who have been unemployed for over 15 months.  This higher rate was <Col N="2092" /> introduced some years ago to cater for the special needs of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is not considered that this constitutes an anomaly.  When claimants' entitlement to unemployment benefit expires after the maximum duration of 15 months and they qualify for unemployment assistance, they are entitled to the long term rate in common with other claimants who have been unemployed for at least the same length of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Wexford has received a bill for £1,315.22 in respect of overpayment of disability benefit; that this overpayment arose because his Department paid full rate instead of half rate disability benefit to this person while she was in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance; that the claimant is entirely blameless in this matter and will have great difficulty in repaying this money from her already diminished income; and if, in the circumstances, he will arrange that this debt be waived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 29 August 1986 and was paid at the weekly rate of £41.10 the then maximum rate appropriate to a single person with no adult or child dependants.</P>
      <P>Where a person claiming disability benefit is in receipt of another social welfare payment such as unmarried mother's allowance, disability benefit is only payable at half the normal personal rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned failed to state on her application for disability benefit that she was also receiving unmarried mother's allowance.  She continued to be paid at the maximum rate until 16 November 1987 when her rate of payment was reduced to her correct entitlement of £21.15 weekly.  Arrangements were made to recover the amount overpaid by weekly deductions of £6 from her disability benefit pending notification <Col N="2093" /> from her as to how she proposed to refund the overpayment.</P>
    <P>The Department have been informed that the £6 weekly deductions will cause financial hardship to the person concerned who has offered to reimburse the Department at the rate of £2 weekly.  This offer is acceptable and the amount being deducted has been adjusted accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the amount it would cost the State in 1988 and in a full year if the basic rate of unemployment assistance were to be increased to (a) £45 per week (b) £50 per week (c) £55 per week and (d) £60 per week from 1 April 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments are made to unemployed people under two categories, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  The estimated cost to the State if the basic rates of unemployment assistance, urban and rural, were increased from 1 April 1988 to the amounts mentioned by the Deputy, and corresponding increases given to adult dependants, would be as follows:</P>

The Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986, which set up the agency on a statutory basis, specifically precludes the remuneration of any person for acting as a member of the agency.  The question of payment of expenses for the members, including foreign travel expenses, is a matter for the agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The voluntary work scheme was introduced in response to representations that unemployed people were unwilling to engage in voluntary work because, if they did so, their availability for paid employment and in consequence their entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance, might be called into question. By providing a facility whereby engaging in voluntary work could be approved in advance it was hoped to remove any disincentive there might be which would discourage unemployed people from undertaking voluntary work.  I have always been supportive of this scheme and I would encourage both unemployed persons and voluntary organisations to use the scheme as much as possible.  I cannot say why the scheme is not used to a greater extent but it may be that unemployed people, being aware of the existence of the scheme, in many cases engage in voluntary work without going through the formal procedures involved.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that an unemployed person who undertakes voluntary work would not be in a position to bear the cost of out-of-pocket expenses arising in connection with such work.  Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid by the sponsors of the voluntary work would not, however, affect a volunteer's entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>The future role of the voluntary work scheme and other schemes for the benefit of unemployed people are being examined in my Department and all possibilities which might provide further encouragement and opportunities for unemployed people will be explored in this context.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has <Col N="2096" /> been drawn to the fact that the British Government fund a voluntary projects programme which grant aids voluntary organisations to make opportunities available to the unemployed; whether there is merit in developing such a scheme in Ireland; if he will investigate the cost and potential of such programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take questions Nos. 114 and 115 together</P>
      <P>The UK scheme referred to by the Deputy is operated by the Manpower Services Commission in Great Britain and provides financial inducements to the organisers of voluntary projects set up specifically to assist the unemployed by providing them with informal training or giving them a new range of skills.  Unemployed people who participate in these schemes continue to receive their unemployment benefit entitlement.</P>
      <P>The Resolution of the European Parliament on Voluntary Work on 16 December 1983 sets out a number of guiding principles in relation to voluntary work policy and called on the European Commission to undertake a number of initiatives designed to encourage the further development of voluntary work in accordance with those principles.  The guiding principles set out in the resolution would undoubtedly find general acceptance.</P>
      <P>People who are in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance in this country can engage in voluntary work without affecting their entitlements and my Department encourages unemployed people to undertake such work as well as voluntary organisations to provide suitable opportunities for voluntary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the provision of funds to voluntary organisations, there is a <Col N="2097" /> scheme of grants to voluntary organisations administered by my Department under which a total of £750,000, is being made available this year for once-off projects in the social services area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that projects under the social employment scheme, administered by the Department of Labour can be sponsored by voluntary organisations.  That scheme is specifically for the benefit of unemployed people and the sponsoring organisations can receive additional allowances towards the cost of materials, supervision and expenses associated with the projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the objectives of the miscellaneous grant scheme for voluntary organisations; the performance of that scheme to date based on the objective; if he has any plans to make changes in this programme; if there has been any external evaluation of this scheme to see if it is giving value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare his views on whether the miscellaneous grant scheme is capital intensive rather than labour intensive; his views on whether a labour intensive programme would provide more employment; if he will give priority to voluntary organisations which promise to allow grant-aided facilities for the additional purpose of promoting voluntary work schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 116 and 118 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary bodies is designed to provide financial assistance to voluntary organisations working in the social services area.  The <Col N="2098" /> grants are awarded after consultation with the health board and are mainly for projects of a once-off nature.  They are not generally awarded for ongoing expenses or running costs.  A sum of £750,000 has been made available for this scheme in 1987 and a similar sum is being provided in the 1988 Estimates for the continuance of the scheme next year.</P>
    <P>No external evaluation of the scheme has been carried out but the level of applications received each year and the purposes for which many of the grants are sought illustrate the success of the scheme in helping to encourage and develop the work of community based organisations operating in the social services area.</P>
    <P>The fact that the scheme is designed to provide assistance for once-off projects and that assistance cannot as a general rule be provided for ongoing expenses, including staffing costs, undoubtedly affects the potential of the scheme to create additional work opportunities. The operation of the scheme and the objectives for which it is intended are, however, kept under review.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 9 October 1987.</P>
      <P>Benefit could not be awarded immediately as she had submitted an old revenue social insurance number in support of her claim.  The matter was subsequently resolved when her correct RSI number became available.  She qualifies for benefit at the maximum rate appropriate to a married woman whose spouse is employed.</P>
      <P>All benefit payable to 8 December 1987, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued to her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the records of the Department the person concerned claimed disability benefit in October 1986. However he had last been insurably employed in Great Britain.  Under the EC Regulations on Social Security, responsibility for a claim to sickness benefit rests with the member state under whose legislation the claimant was last insurably employed.</P>
      <P>His claim therefore, was proper to the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the claim papers together with the medical evidence were transferred to the British authorities on 11 November 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 10 October 1987 after which date payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee as soon as possible.  His entitlement to benefit will then be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been advised that he may apply for unemployment benefit or assistance while this appeal is being processed.  If his means are insufficient to meet his needs he should apply to his local community welfare officer for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="2126" /> Nos. 123 and 124 together.  The following tabular statement relates to the semi-State bodies which are under the aegis of my Department and sets out the information requested by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>The question of expenses is a matter for the day-to-day administration of the bodies concerned but, as a general rule, board members are entitled to travelling expenses and subsistence allowances in respect of journeys undertaken to attend board meetings or transact board business.</P>
      <P>The addresses of board members are confidential to the individuals concerned and therefore I consider it inappropriate to provide this information.</P>

      <P>The Government's voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme is applicable to local authorities as one of a range of measures aimed at maximising savings on manpower costs.  While local authorities will meet the cost of pension payments to those who accept the terms of the scheme, additional financial assistance will be made available to local authorities from the Exchequer to meet in full the cost of all lump sum severance payments coming within the scope of the scheme.  Overall, significant savings for local authorities on present manpower costs are expected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that only part of the expenditure arising directly from the voluntary redundancy/early retirement scheme will be carried by the Department of Finance and that the finances of local authorities will be further eroded by the automatic operation of the social welfare means test on assistance allowances, when insurance benefits expire, under which the assistance allowances are subject to reductions, as the local authority supplements basic pension increases; and if he will make a statement on the matter, since a shortage of funds may be expected to create involuntary redundancies.</P>

      <P>The factual position in that local authorities will be recouped from central funds all lump sum severance payments which they make under the terms of the voluntary redundancy/early retirement schemes, and the implementation of the scheme should result in considerable saving on manpower costs to local authorities even allowing for the payment, in appropriate cases, of a supplementary pension in addition to the basic local authority pension.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will list the local authorities which have adopted the Code of Practice on Security of Employment of Employees of Local Authorities 1985 which adoption was recommended to the management of local authorities on 15 October, 1987; if he will list the local authorities now in breach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which provides for voluntary redundancy, being those local authorities who have imposed compulsory redundancy, namely, layoff and loss of pay and pensionable service including holidays and Christmas holidays 1987; and the number of employees of compulsory layoff in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the employment of staff in employee (i.e. servant) grades is entirely a matter for each local authority.  The Code of Practice on Security of Employment of Local Authority Employee Grades is a voluntary, non-statutory code circulated in <Col N="2161" /> November, 1985 to all city and county managers who were asked to co-operate with its implementation.  Since the terms of the Government's voluntary redundancy/early retirement package were notified to local authorities any reductions in the permanent workforce are being achieved on a voluntary basis. In so far as temporary layoffs or short-time working are concerned I have taken the view that the package must as a priority assist in bringing such measures to an end.  In mid-October therefore I authorised local authorities to offer the terms of the package to all grades of eligible staff, including any who are on layoff or short-time working.  I have also sanctioned the immediate application of the terms to sufficient numbers of eligible staff to facilitate the termination of layoffs/short-time working.  I understand that the overall numbers affected by such arrangements has in fact decreased considerably since October.</P>

      <P>On 8 December last, I made available to the Library copies of a statement issued on that day in relation provision of essential research and related services provided until now by An Foras Forbartha.  The Deputy will appreciate that, pending Government decisions on the overall framework, it was not possible to settle detailed implementation arrangements in consultation with the various interests involved.  Accordingly, the precise information requested by the Deputy is not available in all cases at this stage.  Following is the information requested, in so far as it is available, on matters not dealt with in the statement referred to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> (1)  The board of AFF will be arranging full consultation with the unions concerned in relation to the implementation of the proposed arrangements.</P>
    <P>(2)  It is envisaged that appropriate arrangements will be made for the publication and dissemination to interests concerned, and to the public, of data and other information arising from the work of the new environmental research unit.  The manner in which, the extent to which and the conditions under which services will be provided for local authorities will be settled in consultation with the local authorities in due course.</P>
    <P>(3)  The existing technical library of An Foras Forbartha will be assigned to the new unit and no proposals have been developed for the transfer of the library, equipment or staff to a new location.</P>
    <P>(4)  Detailed arrangements for the transfer of the responsibility for regional laboratories to the local authorities concerned will be completed as soon as possible following further consultations with the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>(5)  While staff of the new unit will be available for overseas consultancy work, on a recoupment basis and subject to the constraints which normally apply in releasing staff for such work, it is proposed that general responsibility for overseas contracts in the entire local government/environment area will be undertaken by the Institute of Public Administration, on the basis of detailed arrangements to be worked out with that body.  An Foras Forbartha is involved at present in two overseas contracts which will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>(6)  The total cost to the Exchequer of operating the new environmental research unit is not expected to exceed £1,750 million in 1988 as against a grant of £3,894 million to An Foras Forbatha in 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> (7)  The standard terms for voluntary redundancy/early retirement, as determined by the Government, have been offered to all An Foras Forbartha employees and, to date, a total of 12 staff have either accepted the terms or expressed interest in them.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for the proposed Lough Easkey water supply scheme stage 2 are under consideration in my Department at present.

      <P>Due to the safety issues involved I do not intend to grant any general exemptions under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, for retail petrol pumps which are situated on the sides of streets and roads. However, there are provisions in the licensing arrangements under the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations 1979 which allow a certain degree of flexibility to the licensing authorities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if it is his policy that AnCO trainees will not be worse off financially than they would have been had they remained on social welfare; if he will adjust the allowances to AnCO trainees who would have become long-term unemployed and qualified for fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus had they remained on social welfare and not undertaken training; and if he will a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy that training allowances be set at a level not less than an individual's entitlement to social welfare payments at the time of commencement of training. Where trainees are entitled to unemployment benefit at the time of recruitment to training their entitlement to an allowance equivalent to this level is maintained for the duration of the course regardless of whether their entitlements would otherwise have expired during the period of the training course.  Such trainees would therefore have benefited by remaining at the higher level of allowance for the duration of their training.</P>
      <P>In the case of social welfare recipients, a Christmas bonus is payable only to persons in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance.  This also applies to persons in training, who are in receipt of allowances equivalent to long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Prior to 17 August, 1987, persons of 18 years and over entering training were normally paid an allowance equivalent to the appropriate unemployment benefit rate.  For those on long-term unemployment assistance this was normally an increase over their social welfare entitlement.</P>
      <P>On 17 August, 1987, training allowances were harmonised with social welfare unemployment assistance rates. Persons already in training on that date continued to receive allowances equivalent to the more favourable unemployment benefit rates.  Therefore, like recipients of unemployment benefit rates under the Department of Social Welfare, they do not qualify for a Christmas bonus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the first part of the Deputy's question it is necessary to explain the nature of the schemes listed and how they represent an improvement generally for participants as compared with their previous unemployment experience.</P>
      <P>(a)  Teamwork: This is a community managed scheme designed to help local voluntary organisations provide temporary community-based employment for the mutual benefit of unemployed young people and their communities.  The young persons recruited accept employment voluntarily on a scheme.</P>
      <P>(b)  Social Employment Scheme:  The purpose of the scheme is to provide part time employment to people who are over 25 years and who have been unemployed for a prolonged period.  Participants receive £60 for an average 2½ day working week.  An additional allowance of £25 per week is payable to persons with an adult dependant immediately prior to their recruitment to the scheme.  Participants are encouraged to engage in other employment for the days of the week in which they are not working on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  The Enterprise Scheme: Participants on this scheme receive a weekly payment of £30 and £50 per week depending on whether they have dependants. For the average participant this represents a reduction of income compared with his or her social welfare income. However, as they enter the scheme voluntarily in order to set up their own businesses, other business related income must be taken into consideration.  The drop-out rate within the year of participation is currently running at about 5 per cent and it must, therefore, be <Col N="2190" /> concluded that the majority of participants find the scheme more attractive than signing on the Live Register.</P>
    <P>(d)  The Employment Incentive Scheme: This is a scheme which is designed for employers who create extra jobs by recruiting from the unemployed. The persons recruited enter into employment voluntarily with their employers and it must be concluded that they accept employment on the basis that it is more attractive than unemployment.</P>
    <P>(e)  Work Experience Programme:  The work experience programme, which has been suspended, was designed to assist young people who had left the educational system and were having difficulty in securing employment because they lacked previous experience.  Because of the nature of the programme, only a minority of participants would have qualified prior to participation for the concessions mentioned by the Deputy.  Participation in the programme was of course voluntary.</P>
    <P>(f)  Community Enterprise Programme: The community enterprise programme is a job creation scheme. Participants, like employment incentive scheme participants, enter employment under the programme as a matter of choice.  Obviously, the participants find it more attractive to participate in the programme than to remain on the Live Register.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will accept that the circumstances of participants of the various employment schemes listed by the Deputy are not comparable to those persons receiving payments from the Department of Social Welfare and who will qualify for the concessions.  The question of adjustment does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>The Social Guarantee Advisory Board are concerned with youth programmes which are open to persons up to 25 years of age.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour (a) the names and addresses of all persons appointed to the boards of semi-State companies operating under his Department for each year between 1983 and 1987 inclusive (b) the remuneration paid to each person so appointed for each year between 1983 and 1987 inclusive and (c) the total cost of such remuneration for each year between 1983 and 1987 inclusive.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is hereunder.  It is not, however, my policy to give the private addresses of members of semi-State companies under my aegis.  I have not included appointments to FÁS as the members of the board do not take up their statutory appointments until the establishment date of FÁS on 1 January 1988.</P>

      <P>The Health Act, 1970, provides that local authority appointments to health boards are made by the relevant corporation or county council.  There are no provisions in the Act for the appointment by urban district councils of members to health boards.  As persons in the electoral areas of urban district councils are represented on health boards by virtue of local authority membership of boards and as local authority members are by statute in a majority on each health board I do not propose to amend the existing legislation in order to allow urban district councils appoint members to health boards.</P>

The Dublin Dental Hospital is also providing orthodontic treatment for a small number of cleft palate cases.  Unfortunately, neither unit is in a position to accept additional patients at this time.  I understand that the consultants associated with the Cleft Lip and Palate Unit have expressed satisfaction with the planned facilities in St. James's Hospital and recognise that they represent a considerable improvement on those available at present.

However, there is a growing awareness among the health profession of the desirability of quality assurance programmes in professional practice.  I would expect, therefore, that the health professionals involved in education have their own arrangements for keeping abrest of developments on quality assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, to 239, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have approved of the acceptance of tenders for an extension to Sligo General Hospital and arrangements are currently being made by the North Western Health Board for the signing of the contract.  It is expected that construction work will commence early in 1988 and take about 5 years to complete.</P>
      <P>The total estimated cost of furniture and equipment for the project is of the order of £9 million and provision for this will be included in the health capital programme. The scheduling of this expenditure will depend on several factors which are difficult to predict and I cannot at this stage give a precise timetable for the commissioning of the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure required for the Sligo scheme in 1988 and subsequent years will be influenced by many variables which cannot be quantified accurately in advance, including the contractor's rate of progress with the building work, and it is not possible to say what the exact <Col N="2205" /> expenditure requirements will be for any particular year.</P>
    <P>I presume that the Deputy's reference to the hospital extension task force relates to the planning group consisting of representatives of the Department and the board, which was established in 1983 to recommend a revised scheme of development for Sligo General Hospital. The scope of the development envisaged in the proposed contract is the same as that recommended by the planning group and for which the board sought approval to invite tenders in 1986.  I would suggest that the Deputy get in touch with the board in relation to the more detailed information which he is seeking on the scope of the work.</P>

      <P>An allocation to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association is not made by my Department.  However, an annual grant of £1,000 has been paid to the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association since 1983 by the Eastern Health Board.  It is open to the association to raise the question of an increase in the level of this grant in 1988 with the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>A once-off grant of £10,000 was made available by my Department to the association in 1985 in respect of a research project instituted by the association to assist expansion of community support services to families with children at risk of cot deaths and in respect of a parent support programme.  It has not been possible since then due to budgetary constraints for my Department to make a further grant of this nature available to the association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reassure the public that <Col N="2207" /> the financial allocation to the Rotunda Hospital is sufficient to provide a satisfactory level of maternity care.  The allocation to the hospital compares favourably with those of the other maternity hospitals in Dublin.  It is primarily a matter for the hospital to determine its priorities in relation to the provision of services.  This has indeed been accepted by the Master of the hospital in discussions with my Department, subsequent to the making of his statement.</P>
      <P>All mothers are advised to avail themselves of the routine six-week post-natal service provided by their general practitioners under the maternity and infant care scheme.  This scheme is available free of charge to women with eligibility for hospital services.  Approximately 80 per cent of women are covered by the scheme.  This is the arrangement which exists throughout the country.</P>

    <P>In the case of national schools, I indicated to school authorities in Circular 24/87 that I was establishing a primary quota review committee who would examine the staffing situation in certain <Col N="2216" /> national schools where the implementation of Circular 20/87 would create unacceptably large classes.  Among the guidelines for the operation of this committee is that class sizes must be appropriate to the actual size of the classroom.</P>

      <P>With regard to the responsibilities of boards of management in these matters, I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 3 December 1987 to a question raised by Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla on the subject of heating levels in national schools.  The subject of fire danger is dealt with in departmental Circular 7/81 which urges boards of management to draw attention to the dangers of fire and recommends that fire drills should be carried out regularly.</P>
