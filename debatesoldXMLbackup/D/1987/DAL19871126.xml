      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Labour Party wished to raise a matter in relation to education and a communication was received from the Ceann Comhairle's office to the effect that we were not allowed to do this.  Meanwhile the situation seems to have changed completely from the discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>Arising directly from the Order of Business and the proposal about the sitting tomorrow, will the Minister for Justice make a statement for the information of the House and for the purpose of this debate on the Order of Business to clarify the position that arose in Cavan last night and to answer the question as to whether the RUC had sent a warrant to the Republic for the arrest of Paul Anthony Kane?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Transport to confirm, through the Taoiseach, that time will be allocated for the taking of amendments on Committee Stage of the Transport Bill which is listed for debate today.  Is it intended to conclude all Stages today?  I an anxious that some time be given for debating amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether in view of the fact that there is a majority in both Houses of the Oireachtas against the Extradition Act, 1987 he will urgently find time today to discuss the position rather than having <Col N="1924" /> that Act coming into operation by default on 1 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy has referred will be coming before the House tomorrow. Members will have ample time and scope to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a reply to the question I asked.  I asked about the Extradition Act, 1987 which comes into force on 1 December unless it is set aside by the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am asking the Taoiseach whether, in view of the fact that there is a majority of both Houses of the Oireachtas against it, there will be an immediate opportunity to discuss it and set it aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should seek some alternative means of raising that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any control over that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the record of less than a year ago of the Taoiseach being so adamant against that legislation.  What is happening now?  Who has sold out to whom on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have ample time to ventilate his views on this matter tomorrow and in the coming week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no time for anything tomorrow and the Chair is well aware of that.  It is clear that there will be no time.  This is a betrayal if ever there was one and it is worse than any ever before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put two short questions to the Taoiseach.  In view <Col N="1925" /> of the fact that some weeks ago he promised a ports Bill before the end of October, will the Taoiseach tell the House whether differences of opinion between his two security Ministers on the matter have been resolved and, if so, in whose favour?  Will the Taoiseach say when we might expect that most important piece of legislation before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to advise the Deputy very strongly not to be misled by newspaper reports of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we expect the legislation in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is still a distinct possibility that the Deputy will see it this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the North Sea Ministers in the last few days agreed to stop incineration at sea I should like to ask the Taoiseach if the input document given by the Irish Government, which none of us had any notice of despite my questions last week, contains the sentiments of the Irish Government and Irish policy on incineration at sea? Will we continue this despite the decision of those Ministers to discontinue this practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the categoric assurances given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food with regard to the expansion and development of the Thurles sugar factory under a Fianna Fáil Government, I should like to ask the Taoiseach to clarify the Government's position as a result of yesterday's board meeting of the Irish Sugar Company.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives the House the opportunity to focus on some of the affairs of CIE. The organisation is important for many reasons.  Its extensive transport network by rail and road makes it the backbone of the country's inland transport system. Very many are dependent on the services of Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnrod Éireann for their personal transport needs.  Industry and commerce use the freight services extensively.  In summary, CIE services make a substantial input to the social and economic life of the community.  As taxpayers and legislators, we are interested in CIE because the Exchequer subvention to CIE, now well in excess of £100 million per annum, has to be met from the State's resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy is passing through a difficult phase and this increases the emphasis on value for money, cost effectiveness and efficiency.  This is highlighted for the CIE organisation in the challenging targets which have been set for it by Government for the period 1985-89. Iarnród Éireann are striving to achieve the railway target of reducing costs by close to 20 per cent over the five years. Bus Átha Cliath are seeking to have their 1984 deficit in real terms and Bus <Col N="1929" /> Éireann's aim is to make provincial buses profitable.  The achievement of these targets has not been made easy for CIE by the State's inability over recent years to meet in full its financial commitment to the board.  This, in part, has generated the need for the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the Bill are to discharge the obligation on CIE to repay to the Exchequer capital advances of £44,458,691; enable the board to borrow up to £45 million on a long term basis for meeting their obligations and carrying out their duties; allow the board the option of selling by tender property linked to abandoned railway lines, and increase the levels of penalties for various offences in relation to the railways. Although I circulated an Explanatory Memorandum with the Bill, I wish to explain the background and other relevant particulars to the House.</P>
    <P>The particular arrangements which eventually led to the proposed change to the State advances date back to late 1985. At that time, the then Ministers for Communications and Finance settled, for 1986 and subsequent years, the timing of payment of the normal Exchequer subvention and interest charges on the capital cost of DART to CIE.  This involved the deferral to 1987 of some payments due in 1986, the deferral to 1988 of substantial arrears due to be paid in 1987, and the payment in permanent arrears of some moneys due in 1988 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Pending receipt of the arrears, CIE had to have recourse to temporary borrowings in order to meet their liabilities from 1985 onwards.  The accumulated effect of the shortfalls in subvention and DART interest is that the Exchequer would need to provide an additional £45 million in 1988 in order to discharge the arrears.  Added to the subvention of £113.6 million which has been allocated to CIE for 1988, this would have brought the total Exchequer requirement for CIE next year to close to £160 million.  The allocation of £113.6 million includes £14 million to cover the total expected interest payment on DART in 1988.  The <Col N="1930" /> total allocation for 1987 is £107.4 million.</P>
    <P>When the Government came to dealing with the Estimates for 1988 it was obvious that there was no prospect in current economic circumstances of meeting CIE's needs in full.  At the same time, we recognised that, if the issue were not tackled, the Exchequer's indebtedness to CIE would continue to grow, with adverse consequences for the Exchequer and the CIE financial position.  Having examined the limited options available, the Government decided to write off against the shortfalls in subvention the £44,458,691 which had been provided for CIE between 1965 and 1982 in repayable advances.  The writeoff of the advances is provided for in section 2 (1) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As CIE are required to pay interest on the repayable advances, section 2 (2) of the Bill discharges CIE from liability. The interest currently amounts to about £4.4 million per annum.  This saving to CIE will serve as an offset against interest payable by the board on the borrowings generated by the deferral of the subvention moneys.  The board will, however, be required to finance the repayment of the borrowings from their own resources.  The net effect of this arrangement for CIE is that the additional costs for the board will be confined to the repayment of the sums borrowed to finance arrears of subvention instead of providing at some date in the future for the repayment of State advances.</P>
    <P>I should like to have met the Exchequer liability in full, but this was not possible in current circumstances. The solution, while not perfect, is nevertheless better than any likely to emerge as a result of pushing the problem aside for another day.  It brings to an end the payment of subvention in arrears and makes CIE's position clear so that they can plan their finances for the future.</P>
    <P>To help CIE meet the additional burden, section 3 has been included to enable the board to borrow on a long term basis for the purpose of financing the arrears of subvention.  This will involve the conversion to term loans of temporary borrowings already incurred <Col N="1931" /> in relation to the arrears.  In that way, the repayments of principal can be spread over a longer period.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the guaranteeing in the normal way of those borrowings by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill supplements the board's existing borrowing powers, under which CIE are authorised to borrow for capital purposes on a long term basis and to borrow temporarily for general operational purposes.  The statutory limit on borrowings for capital purposes is £250 million and that for temporary borrowing is £40 million.  At the end of 1986 the board's borrowings for capital purposes amounted to £157 million and the temporary borrowings stood at £30.7 million. The board's temporary borrowings are now close to the £40 million limit.</P>
    <P>Sub-section 7 of section 21 of the Transport Act, 1950, empowers the board of CIE to sell land under and adjoining an abandoned railway line, either by private treaty to the owner of the land on both sides of such line, or by public auction to any person, including such owner.  CIE have requested that the additional option of sale by tender be provided for, because experience has shown that parts of abandoned railway lines which are not of interest to adjoining landowners are sometimes not sufficiently valuable to justify the costs of sale by auction.  Section 5 of the Bill provides for sale by tender and CIE plan to use the tendering process, where it would be to the board's advantage to dispose of property in that way.  These tenders would be invited by public advertisement.</P>
    <P>Members of the House have been concerned with reports of offences and vandalism committed on or in relation to the railway.  The offences cover a wide range of problems such as wilful destruction of property, stone throwing at trains, placing obstacles in the path of trains, refusing to close gates at certain level crossings, trespass on the railway and improper use of the communication cord on trains.  All these involve dangerous <Col N="1932" /> practices and can lead to loss of life or limb and damage to property.  What starts out as a &ldquo;lark&rdquo; can cause irremedial loss and damage.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the frequency and scope of many of these types of incidents have grown in recent years.  We are now long past the stage where they can be treated as outbreaks of high spirits.  Many of them are obviously undertaken with malicious damage in mind.  At considerable cost, the board have been taking special measures to try to curb these objectionable and anti-social activities.  Some success has been achieved but it is clear that further measures are needed to impress on those concerned that their misbehaviour is unacceptable.  CIE have also to deal with people who refuse to pay or try to avoid paying fares.</P>
    <P>While the existing legislation provides for prosecutions and penalties, the courts are handicapped in applying penalties which match the gravity of the offences. This is because the impact of maximum permissible penalties has been eroded over time.  For example, it would pay a person to avoid paying his or her fare in the knowledge that the maximum fine on conviction is £2.  The penalties for some of the offences dealt with in the Bill were set as long ago as 1868.  Some of the penalties were revised between that time and 1971, but even they no longer match the potential greviousness of offences. Penalties have to be imposed which will convince offenders of the likely serious adverse personal consequences of their acts.</P>
    <P>Existing maximum penalties range from £2 to £25.  For the types of offences which are covered by sections 6 to 10 of the Bill, it is proposed to increase the maximum penalties to £300 and/or a maximum of three months imprisonment. This gives a clear message to would-be offenders that their behaviour is unacceptable and will fall to be punished in a very substantial way.  Interference with railway property and the proper operation of rail services cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Railways Act, 1868, provides for penalties in relation to the <Col N="1933" /> provision of communication cords as well as penalties for misuse.  At present such cords are required to be fitted in passenger trains which travel more than 20 miles without stopping.  The potential penalty for not having a communication cord is £10 and section 9 of the Bill provides for increasing the maximum penalty which may be imposed on a railway company to £300.  The section also extends the application of the section to all passenger trains so as to bring the legislation into line with existing CIE practice.</P>
    <P>The penalty provisions in the Bill are necessary in the interest of facilitating Iarnród Éireann to carry out their responsibilities of safe and efficient transport in an effective manner.  I now wish to address myself to a point which was at the root of the question asked by Deputy McCartan on the Order of Business. Deputies in the Dublin North East constituency have been concerned about the problems of trespass and vandalism on the railways in their area.  I am grateful to the Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, and to Deputy McCartan for drawing my attention to a related enforcement problem.  It appears that the absence of specific powers of arrest without warrant for the Garda Síochána in cases of trespass, vandalism and so on on the railway restrict, in certain respects, the freedom of the Garda to intervene where a member of the force suspects the committing of an offence.  I have examined this and related matters and have come to the conclusion that there is a need to include a provision in the Bill to extend such powers to the Garda Síochána.  I envisage such a provision being extended to other matters as well as trespass.  My examination of the matter is not, however, quite complete but I expect to be in a position to introduce an appropriate amendment to the Bill when it is being discussed by Seanad Éireann. Of course, when such an amendment has been passed, it will automatically be referred back to this House for consideration and debate.</P>
    <P>No discussion of legislative measures in relation to CIE would be complete without some account of the general state <Col N="1934" /> of affairs of the board and their subsidiaries. The most recent comprehensive report on the affairs of CIE is the board's annual report and accounts for 1986 which were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 October 1987.  The result for 1986 was a net profit of £3.648 million before exceptional items.  This took account of Exchequer subvention payments totalling almost £117 million. The railway subvention at £93.326 million continues to represent a huge cost to the Exchequer although it recorded a profit of £2.925 million during the year.  Other figures of note for 1986 were that total railway passenger journeys increased by 8 per cent to a record 21.7 million, with DART accounting for just over 13 million; passenger journeys on provincial bus services increased by 3.8 per cent and the Dublin City Services passenger journeys increased 2 per cent to 165 million. Despite CIE's best efforts rail freight tonnage dropped by 7.5 per cent to 3.126 million tonnes over the 1985 figure.  The road freight results showed a profit of £324,000, compared with a profit of £195,000 in 1985.</P>
    <P>Overall the board had a good year in 1986 and this represented a continuation of the progress of recent years.  I wish to take this opportunity to express in this House my appreciation to the chairman of CIE, the board, the management and the whole CIE workforce for this performance. It demonstrates continuing efforts in the board's various sectors for increasing revenue, and providing cost effective and efficient transport responding to passengers' needs.  The level of Exchequer support required for CIE is still very high and there is a need to reduce it further.</P>
    <P>In February 1987 the three new CIE subsidiaries, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, commenced operations.  The smoothness of the changeover to the new structures has been remarkable.  The board's report for 1987 will present, for the first time, the results under the new structures.</P>
    <P>The board's activities got off to a good start at the beginning of the year by achieving their budgetary objectives. <Col N="1935" /> More recently, however, there have been downward trends in the operating results against budget.  This is a cause for concern. CIE is making every effort to correct that situation and I hope that its efforts will be rewarded.  I believe that CIE has the potential to continue to improve its overall financial position but it will not do so without hard work and responsible attitudes throughout the organisation.</P>
    <P>An item which seems to have a recurring adverse effect on CIE is the localised labour disputes of doubtful merit which arise from time to time.  These interruptions to services are usually limited in scope but they are sources of major annoyance and inconvenience to the CIE customers who are affected.  They tend to draw public odium on the whole of CIE and they lose money.  That is very unfair to the vast majority of CIE employees.  It is a great pity that in these situations the minority becomes newsworthy, while those in CIE who continue to serve the public remain unsung.</P>
    <P>The Government are tackling the serious difficulties confronting the economy. At a time when the general economy is going through a period of difficulty, the transport sector is as vulnerable as any other, and the CIE organisation has to face up to the challenges confronting it.  Success cannot be achieved without the active support of all CIE employees giving of their best.  The employees' own futures cannot be divorced from that of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Over recent years the CIE rail carriage fleet and bus fleets have been upgraded and CIE customers have experienced the value of these developments.  Most of the mainline rail routes have now modern carriages, very recent additions being those introduced on the Dublin-Westport and Dublin-Rosslare routes.  Iarnród Éireann are modifying their carriage building programme in order to improve the quality of services on radial and outer suburban routes.  The first of these carriages will be available next year.  The renewal of the provincial bus fleet was completed in 1986 and 50 new luxury <Col N="1936" /> coaches for use on the Supabus and Expressway routes and by the tours division were acquired.  The Dublin bus fleet has also been improved over recent years.</P>
    <P>From media coverage it is quite clear that the general image of CIE as a commercial organisation has also been changing. The improved profile which the CIE group has achieved through better marketing of its services and better use of resources is very evident.  We have the special DART events, including the cultural links with the theatre and poetry, the special Killarney week-end packages for visitors travelling from Dublin by rail and the many other rail and bus special offers.  This is evidence of a new dynamism in CIE.  It is improving the product and making strenuous efforts to attract more customers and so improve the utilisation of the rail and road fleets with obvious consequences for the organisation's revenues.  These efforts and innovations in CIE reflect a customer orientated approach which deserves to succeed and will do so.</P>
    <P>CIE's role in the tourist industry is a major one.  Not only is it engaged in selling abroad Irish holidays and in providing transport services and tours for holidaymakers in Ireland, but it is also responsible for Rosslare Harbour, one of our international gateways and the major sea access point from Continental Europe.  First class access transport and facilities for visitors at the points of entry are essential for the further growth in the number of visitors coming to spend their holidays among us.</P>
    <P>CIE has been working for a number of years on upgrading the facilities at the harbour.  A major part of the development plan for the harbour is finished and next year, when the new passenger terminal is completed, we will have at Rosslare a product of the highest international standards with quality visitor services.  These are so necessary to remove for our visitors some of the frustrations, which cannot but damage our image as a friendly and concerned people, and to create the most favourable impression possible on our visitors as they arrive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> In summary, I have explained the background to the Bill and its provisions. I have outlined for the House the progress which CIE has made in recent years and touched on some of the problems facing the organisation.  I am heartened by what has been achieved but recognise that there are still many challenges facing the board and its subsidiaries.  If Deputies have questions arising from the issues raised in the Bill, I will endeavour to answer them.</P>
    <P>The financial performance of CIE over the past three years inspires confidence and I know that under the leadership of the chairman and board of CIE every effort will be made to achieve the targets set by Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not oppose this legislation which is primarily designed to make to CIE payments which had been put on the long finger over a number of years.  The latter part of the Bill concerns the updating of antiquated regulations which controlled fines and penalties.  These need updating.  It is hard to believe that we are referring to legislation which dates back to 1868.  It conjures up visions of the James' Gang.  That legislation was brought in when they committed their first major train robbery by pulling the communications cord.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Frank pulled the cord and Jesse jumped out with the mail bags and half of the people's goods and valuables. It is too early to know if the breaking up of CIE into three new sections will be a success, although that is an interesting innovation.  It will be a great pity if the provincial bus service and Bus Átha Cliath cannot break even.  I have every confidence in the general manager Mr. Conlon and in the board to improve things considerably so as to meet that aim of making both of those branches viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the railway section will never be profit making.  It will always <Col N="1938" /> make huge losses.  By its nature, in a sparsely populated country, it will make losses.  If we want to have a rail network we must be prepared to pay dearly for it.  However, there is an overwhelming consensus that we should retain a rail network.  The rail network has been savaged over the years and it is only a fraction of what it was.  There is talk about its being further reduced.  There is talk about closing the Rosslare-Waterford-Limerick passenger service.  Any further projects of that kind would be unwise. We accept that the railway system will be loss-making.</P>
    <P>Government subvention is a nice way of describing the losses incurred by the three companies.  The overall subvention amounts to approximately £117 million, £93 million of which is incurred by the railways, or Iarnród Éireann.  Not too long ago the figure was £70 million only. If that increase can be justified I would assume it is due to inflation.  I would hope it can be stabilised if not reduced.  The Minister spoke about reducing costs by close to 20 per cent over the next five years.  That would constitute a considerable improvement because it would be a saving of approximately £18 million, bringing the relevant figure down to £75 million.  However, the overall subvention or loss is £117 million.  There is a £24 million gap there which is obviously occasioned by the provincial bus services and more so by the Dublin bus services.</P>
    <P>It is the belief of my party that the abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority by the present Government before they had had an opportunity to prove themselves was an extremely retrograde step.  There was a certain degree of vindictiveness &mdash; I could not put it in nicer terms &mdash; carried over from the period during which the present Government were in Opposition.  They had vowed to abolish or disband it.  That type of tactic is not to be encouraged.  It is essential that all transport services in the Greater Dublin area be controlled by one single authority.  I might add that that authority had the power to license bus services operated by independent operators.  At a time when the Government are introducing <Col N="1939" /> legislation to allow competition on the airwaves it is a great pity that they allowed a situation to evolve in which there is not competition in public transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the very serious industrial relations problems that have arisen time and time again, most recently this week.  He stressed the annoyance and inconvenience caused to the public by these interruptions of services. I would ask the Minister to consider seriously allowing the licensing of independent services.  At present the public find the going sufficiently tough.  But when there is what could be described only as institutionalised action against the paying public, that amounts to a totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable state of affairs.  If people can provide buses of a quality comparable to those provided by CIE, if they can pay the going rate, if their workforce is trained and skilled and their equipment up to standard I see no earthly reason they should not be given the same opportunity of providing a comprehensive transport service, be that in the Dublin area alone or in Dublin and the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>I hear people involved in what is almost this State monopoly complain about unlicensed operators.  Those operators are unlicensed not because that is their wish but because they have not been licensed to do the job they are capable of doing to the very same standard as the State company with the monopoly, be it rail or bus.  They can provide a service of the same standard but are not afforded an opportunity of getting a licence. Whether it be the bus service from the ferries, from Tralee, or from Galway, Limerick or Donegal they are providing a tremendous service to the people in those regions.  In most cases they are providing that service for a lesser fare than the State company.  The question must be posed: are the long suffering public expected to continue to endure a position in which, if and when industrial action is taken, they have no alternative? Must they endure that hardship indefinitely? We had that position obtaining this <Col N="1940" /> week in Dublin and a couple of weeks ago also.  Approximately three months ago that was the position prevailing in the provinces when there was no bus service in and out of our major cities such as Waterford, Limerick or Galway.  I contend that this should not be tolerated.  I know there are people who could provide an equivalent, if not a better service, and they should be given an opportunity to do so.  This series of strikes the travelling public have had to endure has gone on for far too long.  Indeed there is no guarantee that it will not continue.  People are entitled to an option.  We heard recently much about cuts affecting the poorer and weaker sections of the community.  I cannot think of any weaker or poorer section of the community than that which travels by public transport.  At a time when the Government are breaking the mould &mdash; the &ldquo;in&rdquo; expression nowadays &mdash; in certain State services why do they not go the whole hog and save themselves a considerable amount of money?  As I pointed out initially, the losses on the bus services at present amount to £24 million.  Were it available, that amount would solve the pupil-teacher ratio problem this week and indeed many others. Probably we could have a better standard of service running alongside.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that there is no justification for retaining a system which condones a monopoly when that monopoly is continuously abused, admittedly by a small minority who are giving the majority of hard working personnel in CIE &mdash; who do a tremendous job, very faithful and loyal servants &mdash; a bad name. That small minority appear to be giving the whole company a very distasteful name and reputation.  I would ask the Minister seriously to examine that matter.  I do not think it would lead to a wholesale loss of jobs.  In fact it might even augment the number of people employed in public transport because we would have then a more invigorated system.  It should be remembered that competition is the life of trade.  I do not envisage reverting to a system such as <Col N="1941" /> obtained in the &lsquo;twenties and early&rsquo; thirties, when there were bus services crisscrossing all over the country, a crazy system which had to be curtailed and culminated in the buying out of those licensed operators, with the resultant formation of CIE in later years.  There is no need to go from one extreme to another. Let us have a little rationalisation and common sense.  Let us have competition and give the public a proper service.</P>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, did very outstanding work during his period of office.  He brought in more changes and innovation than any of his predecessors.  His concept of three companies within one in CIE is a better system and helps us to identify the extent of the loss-making within those three bodies.  It is a great pity that the Minister disbanded the Dublin Transport Authority even before they started to operate. I have every confidence in the ability of the chief executive of CIE, Mr. Conlon, and his board.  They have improved matters within the confines of their brief.  In the Minister's statement that matter is mentioned in passing.</P>
    <P>There is also reference to CIE's role in the tourist industry.  It is not dealt with in any great detail and that is a pity because the recent Price Waterhouse report on tourism clearly indicated that the inadequacy of public transport is an inhibiting factor as far as tourist trade is concerned.  That point was made quite clearly.  They felt that our public transport system is inadequate.  One can imagine a foot passenger coming to any of our airports or sea terminals and wanting to travel around Ireland by public transport.  He or she would have a considerable task in getting services which would work in unison.  There might be delays of hours if not days in travelling from certain parts of the country to other parts.  We lack a comprehensive system and it must be a problem where the tourist industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to additional aspects of this legislation, one of which is to get rid of railway property.  This is interesting and may be dangerous.  Previously <Col N="1942" /> the policy was to sell the land to the adjoining land owner and that was probably very successful.  Now a system is to be introduced where by the property will be sold by tender.  In rural areas this could give rise to considerable controversy considering the value that is put on land.  If a strip of land which accommodated a railway line was sold to an antagonistic neighbour and the land on either side was owned by a farmer we can imagine the problems that would arise. It is not clear if the owner of the adjacent land will be given priority when it comes to the purchase of the land.  I could imagine the sense of this change in the legislation if the person adjoining the railway property is not willing to pay a fair amount for it but if a valuer puts a price on it which seems to be reasonable and the adjoining land owner is prepared to buy it then he should be allowed to do so.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point.  We will have to oppose that section of the Bill if there is a possibility that somebody who did not have any interest in the adjoining land could buy that strip of land and thereby make a nuisance of himself or cause difficulty for the resident land owner.  That matter is not explained satisfactorily in the Minister's statement.  Maybe there is a satisfactory explanation and, if so, I would like to hear it in the Minister's reply. Otherwise we will be opposing the provision on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the level of penalties for various offences in relation to railways makes good sense.  We cannot tolerate people throwing rocks through the windows of trains or putting the bough of a tree on the line and being fined only £2 or £3.  The fine must be realistic.  It seems the penalty for pulling the communication cord is being increased from £25 to £300.  I do not know if that penalty is ever enforced. Communication cords are generally pulled by one of a crowd of hooligans on their way to or from a football match.  I exclude hurlers in case people would get the wrong idea that I was having a go at the GAA.  Those involved are generally soccer hooligans who are not to be found <Col N="1943" /> on this island although I am sure it also happens here at times.</P>

      <P>If my local hockey team heard me saying that I would be in trouble.  I am in enough trouble with them already because I cannot get a pitch for them.  The pulling of a communications cord is an offence which is difficult to combat when people are travelling in droves and are making a nuisance of themselves.  The Minister did not refer to that point in his statement.  Fortunately it has not been a major problem in this country to date.  Much damage is being done on the Continent and particularly in Britain by hooligans travelling <i>en masse</i> on public transport, particularly on trains.  Knowing our facility for copying the habits of the British it will not be too long before the same is happening in this country.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that matter.  He spoke about rocks being thrown through windows, logs being put on the railway tracks and all the old fashioned ways of causing trouble but perhaps he will say how he intends to deal with organised gangs of hooligans or trouble makers, particularly those travelling to and from events, whether they are matches, pop concerts or whatever.</P>
      <P>The following lines in the Explanatory Memorandum do not make a whole lot of sense to me:</P>
      <P>Section 9 extends the requirement to provide an efficient means of communication between passengers and train staff to all passenger trains and increases the penalty in relation to the failure of a railway company to provide such means of communication to a fine not exceeding £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe that is good English but to me it is gobbledegook; it means nothing at all. Does it mean that if one of the railway staff announces over the public address system that the train now standing on platform 22 is going to Westport and it <Col N="1944" /> turns out that it is going to Cork, the staff member has given wrong information and is liable to a fine not exceeding £300?  The other regulation is not to use the toilet when the train is standing in the station but if a case was brought in regard to that the district justice would throw it out on compassionate grounds.  I would appreciate an explanation of this section because as worded it sounds quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Jesse James being responsible for the 1868 legislation.  Some of the legislation is antiquated and some of the penalties and fines are very much out of date.  We can support all the sections but I want section 9 to be explained as we go along.  I do not think we will find this difficult and I hope the Bill gets a quick passage through the House.  I would like an elaboration in regard to the rights of land owners adjacent to lines which are disused and an explanation of section 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's speech would be an understatement.  He has failed to address the essentials of the whole question of transport and he has dealt with it in a very superficial way. How can anybody responsible ultimately for a major transport company come into this House and use phrases like &ldquo;we are seeking to halve the deficit in real terms&rdquo; and &ldquo;we are hoping to make a profit&rdquo;? What kind of language is this in the economic climate of the Ireland in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to one of the major problems that has been crippling CIE over the last number of years, and particularly in the last few months, the Minister again says &ldquo;an item which seems to have a recurring adverse effect on CIE are localised labour disputes of doubtful merit which arise from time to time&rdquo;.  This is about the only reference to a fundamental problem within CIE today.  The rest of what the Minister said basically dealt with the increase in fines, to which I have no objection.  It is right that they should be updated.  I do not think the essential element is the increase in fines.  The Minister has missed a golden opportunity to <Col N="1945" /> address the whole transport question, which I hope to do now.</P>
    <P>This Bill epitomises the huge wastage of taxpayers' money.  CIE can justly claim to be at the pinnacle of draining the Exchequer of scarce financial resources. In a time of unprecedented questioning of public finances, with every Department and sector being asked to trim to the bone their demands on the Exchequer, the Minister has the audicity to come into this House to ask us to approve the writing off by the State advances of just under £45 million and the interest thereon to CIE. Not alone are we being asked to allow CIE to walk away from a debt of some £45 million, the Minister wants us now to allow CIE to borrow another £45 million which the State will guarantee and which no doubt in time will disappear into the bottomless pit that CIE has continued to dig for many years; the State in time will have to write off this debt also.  No right minded person could approve of such a course of action.</P>
    <P>We have seen the incredible hardship that the people are being asked to bear because of the very severe, ill-planned, ill-thought out drastic cutbacks in the health service, followed by incredible blunders in the education system.  In the midst of all this the Government see fit to write off £45 million owned by CIE.</P>
    <P>This state of affairs can no longer be allowed to continue.  The Government must face up to the realities.  They must take a critical look at many of the State run companies including, above all, CIE. This vitally important aspect of the agenda has not been addressed by Government.  In fact, they are paralysed with fear when it comes to having a major rethink on the whole area of State involvement in companies and, most important, the return to the Exchequer and the people of this country as a result of that involvement.</P>
    <P>Why is it that when the Government are prepared to take such hard options, many of which I applaud them for, they absolutely refuse to turn their attention to the value of the State's involvement in <Col N="1946" /> semi-State companies?  That is the greatest flaw in this Government's programme. If this question is not addressed all of the hard work being carried out will go for nothing.  A fundamental change of direction and attitude is urgently needed. The monoliths that have consumed vast sums over the last 20 years cannot remain sacrosanct.  They must be part of the financial restructuring that is urgently needed.  To allow CIE and similar public companies to continue in their old ways is tantamount to criminal negligence.  I, and the Progressive Democrats, have no intention of allowing this state of affairs to continue.  The sooner the Government face up to that reality the better.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of months we have witnessed the apalling and irresponsible carry on in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  They have totally removed themselves from reality.  They seem to think they can carry on in any fashion that suits them with absolutely no regard for the public who are their ultimate employers and customers.  It is quite apparent that industrial relations in this company have reached a crisis point and they are floundering around in a sea of self interest.  Their constant calling of strikes at the drop of a hat show clearly that their whole <i>raison d'être</i> is to score points internally to the total detriment of the service they are paid to provide.  But they are secure in the knowledge that their monopoly position in the transport sector is being guaranteed and protected by the Government and they are not subjected to competitive market forces.  Does the Minister believe for one minute that if there was real competition on the bus routes these people would get away with this sort of carry on, that if the people were allowed an alternative the workers and management of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann would behave in such a manner? The answer is an emphatic no.  Why then will the Government not recognise that fact and take steps to force Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann to operate in a responsible manner by allowing other companies compete on the bus routes thereby subjecting them to market forces which <Col N="1947" /> no doubt the public would greatly welcome?</P>
    <P>It it quite clear from the Book of Estimates for 1988 that the public finances are in a serious state.  No stone is being left unturned in the effort to trim our sails.  I fully acknowledge that the public finances have to be tackled for the next few years.  It is patently obvious that the country was living beyond its means, that our borrowing requirements were far too high, and if this continued the country would be bankrupt.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of the Government's reduction in public spending is indeed correct.  We have already witnessed over the past couple of months the very real and serious effects such action is having. The whole area of health, which was grossly mishandled by the Government in a totally unplanned way, has resulted in many hospitals being closed, many nurses losing their jobs and a very serious reduction in the level of our health services. In my constituency of Waterford we have witnessed the very sad spectacle of the oldest hospital in the country having to close.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequences and the conflicting nature of all this become even more obvious when we look at the budget for the Minister's own Department.  I am sure it is quite in order to deal with the Estimate for the Department of Tourism and Transport.  The Minister can witness at first hand the full measures of the cutbacks with the particular devastation of the budget to Bord Fáilte which now amounts to just over a paltry £16 million. Also contained in that Estimate for the Minister's Department are the grants to Coras Iompair Éireann, which &mdash; surprise &mdash; show an increase of some £6 million for 1988, making a total grant of £113,605,000.  How in the name of sanity can the Minister justify this position?  If he is a rational man he must surely realise that the Bill before us today is an extraordinary mistake which he cannot, surely, in all honesty stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study of the whole question of how road transport should operate is long overdue and a major rethink and change of direction are urgently needed.  As I have said, it is fundamentally wrong that in a country such as ours one company should have a virtual monopoly in the <Col N="1949" /> bus transport sector.  The situation is not to the benefit of the citizens who pay the piper for the actions of this company. CIE are a bureaucratic nightmare where lines of demarcation are being replaced by little Berlin walls of self-righteous power which are located both in management and in the workforce.  The purpose for which this company was set up, to provide the best possible public transport service on behalf of our people, has long been forgotten.  We have witnessed in the past few weeks the outrageously intransigent positions adopted in Clontarf and Donnybrook bus disputes where no consideration was given to providing an efficient bus service.  This country can no longer afford the luxury of such thoughtless action.  As a taxpayer I am not prepared to see my hard-earned income wasted on such indefensible actions.</P>
    <P>We have a large commercial fleet of bus operators who are deprived of the right to operate in competition with Bus Éirean and Dublin Bus.  I put it to the Minister that in the autumn of the 20th century it is a totally indefensible position and should not be tolerated any longer. This Government should not bring a Bill before this House today which only throws more money into a company who have patently failed, who are out-of-date in regard to the needs of a modern transport system, who are totally intransigent in their outlook, who abhor change of any type and, above all, are not providing a good service for their customers.  I am calling on the Minister to withdraw this Bill and, instead, to bring forward proposals for real competition and true market forces to operate across the spectrum of public transport by allowing private companies to compete with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  I can assure the Minister he will be applauded the length and breadth of the country if he has the courage and foresight to do this.  The benefits to the Exchequer would be incalculable, the taxpayers would surely benefit and I am convinced that a far better system would result, which the fare-paying <Col N="1950" /> public would be indeed happy to enjoy.</P>
    <P>The inevitable consequences of this, of course, are the Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus would not continue to operate under the present arrangements.  These companies would have to be privatised because they would be incapable of functioning and operating effectively under their present set-up if they had to cope with competition on the bus routes throughout the country.  Why, I ask, are the Minister and the Government so afraid of this course of action?  Are Fianna Fáil so shackled to the past that anything that smacks of being innovative, progressive and modern paralyses them with fear of the unknown?  Yet this Minister has already benefited from the fruits of this type of action.  He, I am happy to say, has continued the work of deregulation in air transport.  When Deputy Desmond O'Malley first mooted this suggestion some years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That very suggestion was taken up by Deputy Mitchell in Government. Fianna Fáil, in particular, threw up their hands in horror at the very thought that competition should be offered to Aer Lingus.  They even suggested that it would be the death knell for Aer Lingus, that the whole air transport market would come into disarray and they all combined to ensure that Ryanair would not get off the ground in this country. It was even said of Deputy Desmond O'Malley at that time that he was being anti-national.  However, we have seen the results of what happened.  Deputy O'Malley persisted and Ryanair did, also.</P>

It was already made by Deputy Deasy in his remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention and I shall endeavour to remain within the Chair's ruling.  Aer Lingus, which is our national airline, must be given fifth freedom rights to as many countries as possible and must continue to expand and grow <Col N="1952" /> in their own interests and those of Irish tourism.  It is quite obvious that there is a bad effect on tourism in terms of our bus transport system.  It has been recognised that we need a far more efficient and competitive service, which would enhance and work with our endeavours in this regard.</P>

The tourism horizon throughout the world will be greatly broadened by Ireland's success in major ways in bettering its market share, which will be built into the cost of access transport in this country.  The problems in the whole area of transport are manifold. Once again, B &amp; I are at the centre stage. For many years this company have grappled with internal conflicts compounded by major changes in the marketplace.  I commend greatly all those who have been involved over the past number of weeks, in both unions and management, in facing up to the very difficult problems which have now come to a climax.  The reality of the situation is that not alone are changes needed within the company but the types of changes needed are extremely fundamental and the whole way in which that company operate, both in practice and in theory, must totally change.  It is <Col N="1953" /> unfortunate the seriousness of the situation of the company was not grasped a long time ago by all involved and that discussions were not allowed to take place in an air of reality.  It led to the very serious consequences that must be faced up to now.</P>

This is a totally flawed and ridiculous situation.  To coin the old phrase, there are absolutely no winners but there are two main losers &mdash; the fare paying public and the Exchequer.  The reality of this situation will have to be faced up to by Government sooner or later and I propose that it be sooner.</P>

    <P>The Minister and his Department have a golden opportunity seriously to tackle the increasing failure of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann to provide the best possible public transport system.  With the best will in the world this will never happen until there is competition both within Dublin city and throughout the country.  If this Government were really serious, courageous and imaginative it is this proposal which I have outlined that we should be discussing here today.  I can assure the Minister that the Progressive Democrats and I are going to keep these <Col N="1954" /> fundamental issues on the agenda because they are very much relevant in the Ireland of today.</P>
    <P>The days of throwing millions of pounds of scarce taxpayers' money into companies who believe the Government have a bottomless pit of money to give them are over.

      <P>We in the Labour Party will of course be supporting this Bill and will not be putting forward any amendments to it because this is a measure which has been brought forward to deal with the financing of CIE.  I would only agree with one sentence of what my colleague on my left, Deputy Cullen, has said, which is, that on some other occasion we should have a discussion on the problems in the transport system. Perhaps in that discussion we could deal with all sectors of the transport system such as air, sea and road transport and also deal with the many difficulties in producing a good transport system.</P>
      <P>Listening to the previous speaker it would appear that all the problems in the transport system would be solved if we were to privatise CIE.  This suggestion has been put forward during the years by certain parties and individuals as the answer to providing cheaper road transport. There are those of us who have either read or can recall the history of the transport system In the forties the State had to step in to a chaotic transport system, both rail and road, which was being run by private companies.  In order to deal with that chaotic system the Government set up CIE to provide a modern transport system for the benefit of all the people of this country, not just for those who were living in the built up areas but also for those who lived in the remoter areas of the country who deserved a public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to look at certain sections of the transport system and say that we should privatise buses in a certain area. Many reports have been carried out on CIE and the McKinsey report, which is one of the later ones, was published in 1981.  That report looked very closely at the industry and came up with some ideas which have been referred to earlier today.  It had four main views on the rail system.  It suggested that because it was <Col N="1956" /> the biggest loss maker, for very good reasons which we can analyse if we wish, firstly, we could increase the volume and investment in the railways so as to make them more attractive; secondly, we could keep the present rail network and level of service but eliminate the rail freight service and the road freight service and centralise the management of the dangerous substances freight services; thirdly, we could close all the lines with the exception of the lines from Dublin to Belfast and from Dublin to Cork and Limerick; and, fourthly, we could close down the operation altogether by 1990.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that in 1983 the Government having considered the McKinsey report decided on giving an annual subvention to CIE which was based on the relationship between CIE's revenue and expenditure.  They included a requirement that the board would reduce their level of expenditure in real terms by 2.5 per cent per annum.  The primary objective of that arrangement was to contain the overall deficit of CIE. That was a reasonable approach to take at that time.</P>
    <P>The second initiative which was taken by Government at that time was to produce a Green Paper.  That was one of the most enlightening apporaches ever taken to the transport system and it dealt with all of the operations of CIE.  It also dealt with other areas of CIE, which I do not wish to dwell upon now, such as the state of our roads which has an important bearing on transport policy.  The Green Paper on transport policy dealt with all aspects of the operations of CIE and the direction it should take in the future.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read back over that Green Paper and especially the section on the provincial bus services.  It stated that, overall, CIE provincial bus services operated profitably until 1974 but since then they have made losses. The greater part of these losses was incurred in the provincial city services.  In 1980, the city services recorded losses of £3.2 million.  The loss peaked at £4.2 million in 1982 but was reduced to £2.71 million in 1984.  On the other hand, the losses in the provincial bus services which <Col N="1957" /> embrace rural bus services and Expressway buses grew from £1 million in 1980 to £2.5 million in 1981.  Since then, these losses have been reduced to a loss of £1.1 million in 1984.  Therefore, we can see that improvements have been made in the bus area.</P>
    <P>The proposals set out in the Green Paper were adopted and today we see the result of that very important initiative by the previous Government in setting up three arms of CIE, the rail service, the Dublin bus service and the provincial service. They operate as independent structures so that their operations can be viewed separately and the problems in them can be identified and dealt with by boards set up by the individual services.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read in the latest CIE report what has happened since that Green Paper was brought forward.  If one uses only the yardstick of profit &mdash; which I would not wish to use in relation to a public service &mdash; to decide the future of a concern such as CIE, let us get the facts right.  In 1982, the deficit in the operations of CIE was £11.6 million.  That increased in 1983 to £16.1 million.  In 1984, the deficit in the whole operation was £1 million. In 1985 there was a profit of £1.5 million and in 1986 the profit was £1.6 million.</P>

      <P>In this debate we have heard severe criticism of CIE and their operations and how we would have a wonderful operation if privatisation were to take over the bus services and the rail services, apparently, were to close down. I have quoted figures from the latest CIE report dealing with 1986 and those figures have not been challenged in this debate today so far.  I accept the report which has been produced by the Chairman and the Board of Directors of CIE.  I welcome the improvement in CIE since the introduction of the three new companies overseen and guided by the original CIE company.  I join in the compliments paid to Mr. Conlon and his board who, I am glad to say, are made up not simply of <Col N="1958" /> people from the business side but also by a number of worker-directors who not only represent the workers in CIE but bring a great deal of knowledge and experience of working in that organisation to the boardroom.  Because of the operations of the central board and the three other boards and the direction given by the previous Government in bringing forward the transport policy paper, we have seen a turn around in CIE in the past few years.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made by speakers for Fine Gael and the PDs of the strike position which is always pointed to in a discussion on CIE.  On the day I took office as Minister for Labour in 1981 a CIE strike was in progress.  If one looks at the record of strikes in companies, CIE must rank high in that area but this is part of their history.  In the recent climate in that company and the change around not only in their economic fortunes but in industrial relations, a great improvement can be seen and this is referred to on page 7 of the CIE report.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The improvement in the Industrial Relations climate, to which I referred last year, was maintained.  There were only seven minor stoppages, all unofficial, all throughout the year and none lasted longer than a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a strike at Clontarf Garage which lasted much longer than that and one at Donnybrook recently lasted a very short time.  From my knowledge of labour relations it takes two to make a strike. Regarding the most recent one, I question how a strike can be settled in one day by having to go to a public hearing of the Labour Court or by bringing in an official of the Labour Court when the strike is in progress.  Only one route was concerned.  All the other services were prepared to accept one-man operation on the buses, or at least to consider it.  Why was the whole south east area of Dublin left without buses when a settlement could have been reached by isolating that one bus route, the 45A, and having the discussions which are being considered as a result of the intervention of the Labour Court?  These finicky problems cannot <Col N="1959" /> simply be blamed on the workforce. Strike settlement requires enlightenment on both sides and all strikes are settled eventually.  That recent strike should never have occurred.  The one area of difficulty should have been isolated as the strike was finally resolved on that basis.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the efforts being made within CIE by the new companies under the new arrangements are bringing in results.  The service to the public is good and is improving.  Imagination is being used in fare structures for the travelling public.  Whether they travel to work constantly or simply use the service for the occasional visit to relations, taking weekends away or whatever their choice, attractive packages are being presented to them through the fare structure of CIE.  Coupled with that is an improvement in the buses and the rail carriages for the comfort of passengers.  I am satisfied that this can and will continue because the recent enlightenment in CIE will be encouraged by Members of this House on all sides.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to advocate privatising the buses and bringing down fares.  Of course this would happen in the profitable built-up areas but CIE have always been accepted as having a social role and this has necessitated high subventions.  CIE have been bedevilled by the method of financing by successive Governments. They are not alone in this.  Many of the semi-State companies who have been receiving a great deal of public attention because of their difficulties have been bedevilled by the way they are financed. I will not refer to the travail of B &amp; I or Irish Steel but if we hang a huge debt of borrowing around our State companies and tell them they must pay off heavy interest payments to the commercial banks, irrespective of the climate in the money market, we cannot then blame those companies or the workers for the difficulties in which they find themselves. That is not the yardstick by which to judge these companies.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party would support <Col N="1960" /> a reasonable input of State equity to protect the company from high interest charges on the capital they have to raise. I have never heard anybody from the banking industry clamouring for the privatisation of public State companies.  The banks are the big beneficiaries of the State companies because of the loans public companies must obtain in order to update their services and their stock. When the DART started operations and ships had to be bought by B &amp; I the money was raised through the banks and the debts accruing were applied just as one would apply the cost of wages or salaries to the running of those companies, irrespective of the prevailing financial climate.  That is why we believe there should be a far greater State equity within public companies which are, after all, owned by the taxpayers.  At least it would equate them to the private companies who have the ability to raise money through the Stock Exchange.  If they make money they pay a dividend; if not, it is too bad.</P>
    <P>Recent events on the Stock Exchange have shown that events in America can wipe millions of pounds from the equity capital of private companies.  That will not happen to CIE.  They will have to carry their debts and pay the interest on them, irrespective of what happens abroad.  These debts are hung around their neck.  CIE's borrowing from the banks now stands at £169 million and only £44.5 million from the Exchequer. This raises the question as to whether CIE are really a public company or whether they are owned by the banks. This is the root cause of many of the problems in CIE.  At some stage an investigation should be carried out by the consultants we use to examine undertakings in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the semi-State companies has been somewhat wrongheaded. Instead of producing proper equity for them we simply send them to the banks to raise more money.  This is my criticism of this Bill.  CIE will have to go to the banks once more to raise money to finance their operations.  CIE have <Col N="1961" /> been involved in heavy capital expenditure during the past three years and the payment of interest on those debts continues.  Now we are sending CIE to the banks to reschedule the debts.  The company are to be allowed to raise £44 million but it will be stretched over a longer period.  This may cause more financial problems for CIE.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some other aspects of the Bill.  The sale of land is a reasonable proposal.  A great deal of land adjacent to our railway lines is still in the possession of CIE and they should be given the ability to sell this land, not simply to pay for current debts but perhaps to improve the system further.  Some very valuable land is owned by CIE in my home town, Wicklow.  One of the problems is that this permission will be given at a time when land values are at their lowest and the market is depressed.  The large sums which could have been raised by the sale of this land some years ago will not be achieved now.  It is questionable whether this is a good time to encourage CIE to sell off their land.  We all hope this depression will end in a few years time and since CIE have held the land for so many years it might be appropriate to wait for a more favourable time to sell. If this land is put on the market quickly it will have the side effect of depressing land values further, perhaps affecting the whole market.</P>
    <P>Railway companies in the US are permitted to set up a land company to lease and sell their land.  They can use their land in the most profitable way possible or dispose of it in a way that does not create financial problems for them. Would it be in the interests of CIE to permit them establish their own land company so that they can lease or use their land in a manner that will bring a good return to the company?  I accept that the company have some ability in that area but if we gave them the latitude to establish a land company they might be able to complete more profitable deals in relation to their land rather than selling it off by tender to farmers with land adjoining the railway lines.  Such a move would raise more money for the company. <Col N="1962" /> I hope the Bill will be confined to sites adjoining railway lines because I would be very concerned if the site acquired for the proposed Dublin transportation centre was sold off by the company. I hope the Bill will guarantee that that valuable site is held by the company.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions to increase certain penalties.  It is strange that Ministers must come to the House to change maximum penalties.  I do not know why there should be a ceiling on penalties.  In the seventies and early eighties when the rate of inflation was very high those penalties were eroded.  In my view penalties should at least keep pace with inflation. If the cost of living increases there is no reason penalties for misdemeanours should not increase.  We are all aware that vandalism to carriages is caused by hooligans.  CIE are not the only concern to suffer.  We are all aware that public estates and facilities in many areas are vandalised but while penalties may be a deterrent they will not change the position. This is a social problem which many people say is caused by high unemployment. We are told that many young unemployed people take out their frustrations in certain ways but I do not agree entirely with that.  I accept that there are more opportunities for young people to damage public property but there should be greater parental control.  Schools should try to create a better civic spirit among their pupils and get across to them that everything owned by the State is for their benefit.  We should not try to change the position by increasing penalties; we should try to do so by education and example.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to railway crossings is different.  Difficulties in regard to them arise because of pure carelessness. There have been a number of fatalities in recent years in my constituency at railway crossings caused by the failure to close gates, or people driving cars half way across the tracks and stopping to close the gate behind them.  I do not think increased penalties is the answer.  CIE should be encouraged to provide automatic systems at all level crossings. Initially that may prove a costly move but <Col N="1963" /> in the long run they are the only answer to that problem.  I cannot understand why there is a hand operated system in operation on one of our national primary roads.  Surely in 1987 we should have an automatic system operating there.  I imagine that the problem is a lack of finance rather than a willingness by the company to introduce more modern techniques.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be supporting this measure.  The financing of CIE has been wrongly pursued over many years. There should be a greater State involvement rather than driving the company to the commercial banks to raise money. That policy has caused many problems for CIE and other public companies.  The policies adopted following the publication of the Green Paper in 1985 are proving beneficial.  I reject the statements by Deputy Cullen of the Progressive Democrats about CIE and I do not agree with his ideas for public transportation.  I suggest that he do a little more research on the history of public transport here and read the various reports produced on that topic.  If he did so his attitude to public transport would change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to debate the public transport system in Dublin.  At the outset I should like to ask the question, who controls CIE?  It seems to me, and to many citizens, particularly those living in Dublin, that CIE is controlled by the unions.  CIE have made superhuman efforts to rationalise and develop their services but yet we had a strike last week caused by a man who has been out sick for the past nine months, and is still out sick.  When that occurs it is time to look at the sanity of the union involved and its executive who authorised an official strike.  Thousands of workers in the city suffered severe hardship.  The working people of Dublin were affected by that unnecessary strike.  We have all been approached at some stage or other by constituents when a bus was taken off a particular route.  For example, I was informed by constituents that the No. 23 bus is about to be taken off a route in <Col N="1964" /> Drimnagh.  I contacted CIE and they told me they were willing to put on a single decker bus on that route but the union would not allow that.  The people of Drimnagh, therefore, are to be deprived of a bus service because the union has said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I do not think it will be long before the citizens of Dublin picket the headquarters of unions because in some instances they are becoming the tyrants in the play, to use that word in its widest sense, that causes hardship to ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Every time there is a strike it strengthens the case for privatisation.  The call for privatisation becomes stronger when we have this kind of strike.  People do not call for privatisation for profit but to escape from this prison they feel they are in because a company has a monopoly of the transport system.  People want a choice of transport.  Most people I know would opt for the privatisation of our airways.  They do not like to think of one company with a monopoly because, if there is a strike, every channel is affected. For many years people were in favour of public ownership but they are changing their views because of this type of strike.</P>
      <P>CIE are a good company providing very good welfare facilities for their employees.  I know many bus drivers and conductors who have nothing but praise for the conditions under which they work. They are as embarrassed as anybody else when a senseless strike takes place. Deputy Kavanagh asked why the Labour Court had to intervene before the recent strike was settled in one day.  How do we know that the terms which settled that strike were not already offered by CIE but were not acceptable to the leader of that union?  As far as the public are aware and from the exposure he gets on the media, he seems to take delight in having the power, with one wave of his hand, to take all the buses off our roads and bring the staff out on strike.  This type of thing has bedevilled CIE's efforts to break even.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with vandalism and the measures proposed to increase fines. The Minister said this Bill will increase the fines from £2 to a maximum of £300. <Col N="1965" /> Because we so seldom get the chance to make changes in legislation, I believe we should impose the maximum fine and let the district court decide whether to impose it.  At present, the maximum fine the district court can impose is £800.  Over the next ten or 12 years £300 may be worth £100 or less and the damage that can be done by vandals can cost far more than £300 to repair.</P>
    <P>I have always felt very strongly that if those who have committed acts of vandalism were caught and let go free, except with a very small fine, and were under 18, their parents should be made to pay out of their wages, salaries or, if they are on welfare, a deduction could be made from their welfare payments.  They should take some responsibility for the acts of their children.  Therefore, I am sorry that the maximum penalty was not increased to £800 and a maximum of one year in prison rather than three months, bearing in mind that some of these acts of vandalism can cause the death of passengers on trains and buses.  As a Deputy said earlier, rocks are being thrown through train windows.</P>
    <P>I was bringing my children on their first train ride to Howth and a rock came through the window, landing about three or four inches from where we were sitting. If it had hit any of my children it could have killed them.  I would love to have caught those young hooligans and I would have administered justice on the spot.  I can tell you they would not be able to throw another rock today.  This is another area about which the people feel very badly.  These vandals are brought to court and a puny fine is imposed.  This is not a deterrent.  When we have the chance to increase fines to the maximum the district court should impose, we should take that opportunity and leave it to the district justice to decide how severe the fine should be.  This might make these people think twice before they commit an act of vandalism.</P>
    <P>CIE are doing a tremendous job providing tours and holidays for visitors.  The couriers and drivers are very carefully selected and do a first class job.  They are not just great ambassadors for CIE, but <Col N="1966" /> they are great ambassadors for Ireland. Visitors often come back because they got value for money.  I have nothing but the highest praise for the way CIE select these people for these very competitive jobs.  Naturally the bus drivers and couriers have a much more informal and relaxed life than the driver who has to go from A to B every day of the week.  I am not unaware of the harshness of the bus drivers' and conductors' jobs.  They work very unsocial hours, often getting to the garage at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m.  They work very difficult shifts and earn their money. The few mavericks &mdash; and there are a few mavericks in every organisation, even in Leinster House &mdash; in CIE cost taxpayers a lot of money.</P>
    <P>Today we are giving CIE extensive powers to borrow because of their inability to repay money borrowed from the Exchequer.  How much did that recent strike which lasted two or three days cost the taxpayer?  The company still had to meet their overheads and the men were paid.  It must have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds in lost revenue.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it is possible to bring some influence to bear on CIE to bring in a special fare in certain parts of the city like Darndale and Tallaght. Buses should leave regularly for the centre of the city with a fare of 25p. People would use such transport in vast numbers because it would be an economic proposition.  Many people are housed on the outskirts of the city and it is very expensive to travel from there to the city.  I know that CIE would be very reluctant to embark on a six months experiment of a 25p fare from Tallaght into town in case they would lose more money than is already the case.  However, it is worth a try and we should make an effort to see what can be done in pilot areas on the north and south sides.  Public transport is not being utilised as it should be and far fewer people would use their cars if they could get in and out of town at a reasonable cost.  Even off peak rates would be worth trying.  I have spoken about this to people in CIE and I have also mentioned it at meetings of Dublin City Council in relation to planning the <Col N="1967" /> future of Dublin and the building of housing estates.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to vandalism and people trying to avoid paying fares, stated that at considerable cost the board had been taking special measures to try to curb these objectionable and anti-social activities.  He also said that some success had been achieved but that further measures are needed to impress on those concerned that their misbehaviour is unacceptable.  What further measures do CIE propose to take?  The proposals they adopt should be endorsed by this House because, for too long, people have had to pay far in excess of what they should pay for public transport.  It is an absolute scandal compared with public transport in other countries.  I know that the population in these countries is far bigger and that there is far greater use of public transport.  Nevertheless, the cost of public transport here has gone beyond what used to be called in economic terms the optimum.</P>
    <P>I wish CIE and all the different bodies attached to them &mdash; Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and the road haulage section &mdash; the best of luck in their efforts to make a success of this venture.  However, I appeal to the unions, although I know this will probably be interpreted as union bashing, to reverse their seeming <i>laissezfaire</i> attitides to the hardships inflicted on commuters.  I am highly critical of the NBU in relation to their conduct, not just in this recent strike but in others.  The unions should realise that the people they penalise are paying for the service and ultimately the unions are penalising their own members because only so much of this kind of conduct will be tolerated.  We cannot afford the luxury of strikes based on a whim of a few people who do not represent the majority of their members. CIE have done more than any other company in the world in facilitating the objections to the one man bus system which operates everywhere else.  The patience of the public has worn thin and if the unions proceed along their present lines &mdash; I say this with the best will in the world &mdash; they will force privatisation.  People <Col N="1968" /> have a legitimate right to expect a transport system to bring them to work and if it is not available they have a right to go the a private company who are willing to operate services for them.  It is not a question of just operating profitable routes; it is a question of having a service available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not surprising that when this House gets the opportunity to discuss important and precise legislation dealing with transport the debate is taken up primarily by those who seek not simply to talk objectively about CIE and our transport services and systems but to spend their time campaigning and arguing on behalf of the private haulage transport lobby.</P>
      <P>The alliance of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats and their political support of the private transport lobby have joined yet again, not to address themselves to the central issue and point of the Bill but to try to downgrade the work of CIE and support their friends in private industry.  The fact that Deputy Cullen seems to have lost all reason in his contribution and gone right over the edge does not take away from the point that he and Deputy Deasy are contending for basically the same position.  Both want to see the dismantling of our public transport service and the handing over of this social service to the vultures of privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Deputy in his contribution developed a new buzz word.  The plea from Deputy Deasy was for rationalisation and common sense.  That is what he calls privatisation and he suggests that that would give the public a better service. Deputy Cullen and the Progressive Democrats talk about deregulation.  They borrow terminologies utterly inappropriate to a discussion on transport by rail and road, terminologies borrowed from some other debate in the hope of drawing the warped thread of their thought through the whole debate on private versus public, on profit versus social service.  It is regrettable that in speaking on this legislation one has to spend so <Col N="1969" /> much time trying to put right the record with regard to CIE and in trying to redress the balance of the narrow mindedness that we have had here this morning.</P>
    <P>CIE must be defended from unreasonable attack.  The reason CIE is there is the failure of private transport companies to maintain their services in the early years of the history of the State.  CIE provides not just a transport service but a social service.  We must make it clear to the proponents of privatisation that the private transport industry are not interested in the privatisation of CIE and its services.  If they were handed the job tomorrow they would run scared.  What they want is the opportunity to cream off the profitable routes, to take whatever prospect CIE and all its schemes offer to them for making money.  They do not want to carry the responsibility that CIE currently carries which will never make a profit but which must be undertaken so that CIE can maintain a proper transport system in a small island, a vast area of which is under-populated and could never support a private transport system.</P>
    <P>In this debate the whole argument of profit and loss has been dwelt upon. When we are talking about a social service such as that provided by CIE it is not appropriate to talk about profit and loss.  We must accept as a fundamental basis of the development of public transport that there will always be central Government subvention of that service. We should accept that and stop suggesting that there is a private industry prepared to step into CIE's shoes, because there is not.  There is a range of vultures sitting on the sidewalks, parking buses around this city on Friday evening, pandering to the needs of the people at peak times on selected routes.  What happens when CIE realise that they should be taken on at their own game?  The private enterprise <i>laissez-faire</i> lobby scream &ldquo;unfair competition&rdquo; when CIE introduce their weekend £14 return fare from anywhere in Ireland.  I would much prefer to address the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Whips have decided in their <Col N="1970" /> wisdom that we can dispose of all Stages of the Bill within one day.  Having agreed that, it is remarkable that we then have contributions from the people who have so artificially prolonged the debate in this House, on behalf of a lobby not concerned with the provisions of the Bill and on behalf of principles and ideas that have nothing to do with it.</P>
    <P>I am utterly astounded by the attitude of the Progressive Democrats to this Bill. I am advised that they will not support it, that the notion of the very limited tidying of finances within CIE is something that they cannot contemplate even in the interim period before their private plans take over the transport system.  I am fascinated to learn that they are not even prepared to support the notion that CIE will have a right to put up for auction or public tender lands that they want to sell which are adjacent to their railway lines.  It does not seem to have struck them that some of their speculative builder friends could benefit from the opportunity to purchase land adjacent to the railways.  I am amazed that in response to their supporters for example in Dublin North East, they are not prepared to assist CIE to preserve the service that runs through that constituency, a service availed of by many PD supporters. In view of the PD attitude to the DART service I doubt if they will continue to have electoral support in that area.  That service is bedevilled by trespassers and vandalism on the railway line.  I am amazed that the PDs are not even prepared to consider an extension of power to the Garda Síochána to arrest people found on the railway line.  Their whole attitude is completely befuddled by this mania they seem to pursue based on the false premise that we could supplant CIE by privatisation.  The PDs are not prepared to consider what is a useful working Bill introduced here.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not a great handout to CIE. In the first provisions of this Bill we are engaged in writing off charges that accrued to CIE over the years primarily because of smart book-keeping by the Coalition Government who proposed, year in and year out, to defer the liability <Col N="1971" /> on charges accruing to CIE because they could not balance the books any other way.  The present Government must be given the credit for at least being prepared to say publicly what the position is and to take definitive action to address it.</P>
    <P>CIE's current financial position is in tatters, courtesy of the previous Government's attitude.  Unless this Bill passes quickly through the House and is enforced they are in very serious trouble. I would underscore the fact that this is a writing off of accumulated charges.  It is not the handling out of £44 million or more to CIE.  The whole question of public transport has been bedevilled by double think.  Unfortunately it is a double think that has extended into the minds of many people currently in the Government party.</P>
    <P>We have already spoken about cutbacks on route services that CIE in Dublin have had to undertake because of inadequate funding.  There was the disastrous decision on the part of this Government to abolish the Dublin Transport Authority because Dublin requires a single authority to co-ordinate its transport services.  We must get away from the position of having nine separate agencies in this city having a say and responsibility in the co-ordination and running of transport in and around the city and county. The appointment of the Dublin Transport Authority constituted a progressive step and its abolition was not an economic or wise decision.  As I understand it, the only financial saving involved &mdash; and this matter was pursued by Deputy De Rossa in the House a few days ago &mdash; was that of the salary of the chief executive.  There is a double think here in the failure of this or previous Governments to realise that there must be investment in public transport, that it must be developed on a rational basis.</P>
    <P>Since the Dublin transportation study of 1971, CIE have been strongly committed to the concept of developing a rapid transportation service throughout the city and county.  This developed from the Schaechterles report of 1969 which <Col N="1972" /> was re-examined and its recommendations given full approval as long ago as April 1975 with the publication of the Voorhees and Associates report on the development of a rapid transport city service.  That would require a certain amount of financial commitment on the part of any Government to see it through. The reality at present is that CIE have been told by the present Government that they will not receive the necessary funds to develop the capital structure of such a system.  One might well ask what is the reason for that.  The answer is the lobbying on the part of private motor car owners, the private transport system lobby, the people who want to keep CIE down, who do not want to see it develop in a proper way bringing political pressure to bear on Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, when in Government. The result is that the political will and courage to forge ahead simply has not and does not exist at central Government level since these plans were first mooted.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city, when it comes to discussion of roads, transportation generally and a public transport service, the roads and motor car win time and time again. Since the first proposal of the rapid transport service was unfolded and proposed by CIE in Dublin more money has been spent on the demolition of houses, dislodging communities, building and widening roads than would ever have been spent on the development of a rapid transport service throughout the city and county.  All of this is occasioned by the lack of political will at Government level to give public transport the breathing space it needs.  Until that double think has been addressed, confronted and dealt with, until a clear political decision is taken, the question will be raised always: should we widen this road, should we demolish those houses, should we move this community out because it is in the course of environmental development, improvement or whatever?  Never is the essential question posed: is it not time to stop and reappraise the whole development of transport in the Dublin area?</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party will support this Bill.  We welcome the provisions of <Col N="1973" /> sections 2 to 5, inclusive, in an effort to address the ridiculous financial position in which CIE find themselves.  We welcome the fact that CIE will be allowed to borrow and that the Government will guarantee those borrowings in order to aid their capital development.  CIE do not need central Government funding to cover their day-to-day running costs.  As has already been adequately illustrated they have made a remarkable turnabout within a short few years from a deficit in 1982 of over £11 million on their running costs into a profit of £3.6 million in 1986. What CIE do need is to be given the financial opportunity to develop their capital projects.  If we allow CIE borrow in the manner proposed under the provisions of this Bill will we give them a free hand to compete in the way that the profits made in private industry would seem to dictate?  Will the hands of CIE be untied?  Will they be given an opportunity to get out in the marketplace and compete in all the lucrative areas which have been creamed off over successive decades, handed over to the private hauliers and private transport lobby?</P>
    <P>In relation to the other provisions of the Bill The Workers' Party propose a number of amendments.  Because we have been given a day only in which to address all of these matters I want to refer briefly to some and explain them. For example, we support the provisions contained in section 5 that CIE be given the added option of sale by public tender. In any of these transactions I contend that sales should be advertised publicly with the community being aware of what that State body are doing in that regard. I must emphasise that while there may be lands lying idle not immediately required for CIE's plans, which should perhaps be put up for sale, nonetheless there are important pockets of land, particularly in the Dublin area about which we would be very concerned if the message went out from this debate that these would now be available to be snapped up.  I am speaking particularly of those lands which have been preserved for the development of a rapid transport service.  In the building <Col N="1974" /> of satellite towns in the county area, towns such as Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Swords, Dublin County Council have maintained a reservoir of lands to facilitate the extension of the rapid rail transport service to those towns.  The Harcourt Street line and its adjacent lands remain wholly in the hands of CIE.  It is important that CIE's plans for the Harcourt Street line progress without further delay and that none of these pockets of lands is ever put up for sale publicly.  They must be retained because CIE's plans for a proper transport system in Dublin must be implemented some time.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have a number of amendments to sections 6 to 9 inclusive. We welcome the increased penalty provided in respect of various offences stipulated in those sections.  I might say in response to the point made by Deputy Briscoe that they are not sufficiently severe, he must re-examine the precise nature of those offences.  The Deputy cited stone-throwing.  That could represent a multitude of offences ranging from malicious damage to assault, to wounding.  All of those offences would incur the type of penalty Deputy Briscoe seeks to deal with them.  I was somewhat alarmed at a turn of phrase on the part of Deputy Briscoe when he suggested that had he laid his hand on the offender who had disturbed his peace on his first trip to Howth, he would have dealt with him on the spot.  That is the type of language we should leave to people who pass themselves off as so-called, concerned parents and masquerade on behalf of a subversive organisation.  It is not the type of language we should use in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The penalties are appropriate to the type of offences being envisaged &mdash; the pulling of the communication cord, the fact of being on a railway line as opposed to committing any further offences such as stone throwing, interfering with the property or causing injury to someone travelling on the railway line and the non-payment of a fare.  A district court should have power to impose these penalties for such offences.  We welcome the increases in penalties.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that up to this year we <Col N="1975" /> have been dealing with legislation which goes back as far as 1868.  Return train fares can cost up to £20 or £30 and the penalty for not paying a fare was only £2. If a person was found wandering on the railway line the penalty was only £2.  I am aware that CIE have lobbied for a number of years for these penalties to be increased to a realistic level.  I wonder what previous Governments were doing or whether they had any concern for the proper running of CIE, as they profess here today.</P>
    <P>The traditional view was that the railway line, because it was usually running in a straight line, was the most convenient and quickest way of getting from one point to another.  We must make it clear, particularly to people in urban areas, that railway lines are not open for public resort.  They are not there to trespass on or as a convenient way of getting from one place to another.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area where the Howth-Bray line is now electrified it is clear that many members of the public do not appreciate the risk they are taking by travelling on the line.  It is equally clear from meetings in my constituency with members of Dublin Rail and Dublin Bus that most of the stone throwing and trespassing on the line, of a nuisance to rail traffic, is caused by children between the age of eight and 14 years after school hours.  Many of them do not appreciate the risk to which they are putting workers and their neighbours who travel on the trains and buses.  They do not understand that a stone thrown at a train travelling at 60 miles an hour has the same force of impact as a bullet shot from a firearm. The impact of glass when it shatters into a bus or train can have devastating effects upon people in those vehicles.  People can be blinded or very severely incapacitated and may find it impossible psychologically to return to work after such an experience.  An attempt has been made to address all these matters.  As I have said, it is remarkable that the Progressive Democrats do not feel that it is important enough even to give it consideration or support.  Our party and this House will give it support and we will ensure that <Col N="1976" /> the legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>We have proposed an amendment on this matter.  I am glad to hear the Minister say he will consider a very important point, that is, the absence from legislation of powers of arrest to members of the Garda Síochána who wish to police the offences of trespass and other related offences.  I look forward to seeing the amendment the Minister will put down in the Seanad.  Perhaps I will have an opportunity to address it on Committee Stage because I have also put down an amendment dealing with that matter. The Garda Síochána have no power of arrest of a person found trespassing on a railway line unless they are called to deal with that problem at the specific request of CIE.  The fact that it is an offence under legislation does not make it an arrestable offence.  The Garda Síochána have the power to arrest for felonies that they observe or suspect to have been committed.  Under the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1861, they may arrest for a misdemeanour if it amounts to a breach of the peace or if it is committed at night. Outside that they have no powers of arrest for offences that are not felony or misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>The offences which up to today carried a penalty of no more than £2 are non-arrestable. I am glad the Minister, by reason of my representations and, I understand, representations from the Garda Síochána and of CIE, is prepared to address this problem.  Garda representatives have attended meetings in my constituency and have said they would like to help CIE to deal with people who trespass on the railway line but they cannot take action or tell them to get off the line because those people can tell them what to do with themselves and the Garda do not have the power to arrest them.  That matter must be addressed. The amendment which I propose merely deals with trespass.  If the Minister thinks that other offences need the attention of the Garda Síochána by way of arrest we will give it good attention when the Bill comes back from the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We are also proposing to include in the Bill a provision whereby an inspector of CIE can impose on-the-spot fines.  We <Col N="1977" /> want to address the situation where a person refuses to pay a fare through inability or sheer malice, and can tender a name and address and argue the issue later.  Many inspectors travel on trains and ask to see tickets and we are asking that they have power to impose an on-the-spot fine on a person who is not prepared to tender a ticket or to pay a fare. It would then be open to the passenger either to pay the fine or to plead the case in court on a subsequent occasion.  This type of power is available to traffic wardens to deal with illegal parking which might be defrauding the State of a mere 10p or 50p depending on the area of the city and the time of the day.  Surely analogous provisions should be available to CIE inspectors who come across somebody who may be trying to defraud the company of a transportation fare of anything up to £30.</P>
    <P>We are proposing an amendment in the relation to the proof of an offence of trespass and I hope the Minister will take it on board.  Under current legislation CIE, in prosecuting an offence of trespass, must prove to the satisfaction of the court, as is their legal obligation under the Transportation Acts, that there are sufficient signs erected along the railway line at the nearest point of entry to the railway line or at the nearest level crossing to show that it is an offence to trespass and to indicate the penalty that can be imposed on prosecution.  No-one would object to the public being made aware that it is an offence to trespass on the railway line and the more people that are aware of that the better.  When it comes to prosecuting the case in court CIE, who are currently the only prosecuting authority for this type of offence, can be involved in calling up five or six witnesses. Maps often have to be produced with the result that huge expense is involved, a great amount of time can be consumed and the possibility of legal technicality arises.  The court must be satisfied before it can convict for the offence that the sign is there, that it is at the most convenient point and that it was there on the day the offence is alleged to have been committed. <Col N="1978" /> If a vandal, for example, removes the sign or if, by wear and tear it falls, so too will the prosecution.  It is ridiculous that a prosecution for this type of offence needs to be sustained by such proofs.  We are simply seeking to delete the requirement for these proofs as essential to a proper conviction under the Act for this type of offence.</P>
    <P>It should be drawn to the attention of the House that in 1982 there were no more than six prosecutions taken in the whole year for trespassing on railway lines, even though in urban and rural areas they are used on a regular basis by people who think they have the right to do so.  The penalties imposed amounted to £2 and, in one instance, £5.02 costs, and in another case £3.92 costs.  That is not the way to give the Gárda Síochána and CIE the authority to try to safeguard the railway lines.  We are not seeking to impose a state of terror on people who live close to or have had the habit of walking on railway lines.  What we are trying to do is address in a serious way the problem of interference with the railway lines, particularly in urban areas, to bring home to people that CIE must be allowed use and move their traffic safely not just from the worker point of view but from the passenger point of view.  People have to realise the danger they put themselves and people who have recourse to the service in by in any way interfering with or being present on the railway line.</P>
    <P>Those are the views we hold on this legislation.  I hope the Minister will take on board the amendments I have been suggesting.  This is an opportunity to deal with these matters that are presented by the Bill and it would be a great pity to let them go.</P>
    <P>In relation to the arrest provision we will see what comes from the Minister by the return from the Seanad.  I welcome the fact that he is prepared to address it. It is a very real problem and I hope it will be dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>The final matter I want to address is the question of staff management relationships and strikes within CIE. People who come into this House and attack the service of CIE on the basis that <Col N="1979" /> it has bad staff management relationships are not addressing the facts at all.  Deputy Kavanagh, referring to the 1986 Annual Report of CIE, its board and Chairman, drew attention to the fact that in 1985 there were nine stoppages throughout the whole year, that in 1986, the number decreased to 7, and that none of these stoppages lasted longer than a day. Anyone who suggests that that is a poor record of staff management relationships of a company the size of CIE, with all its employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting it is a good record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and with all its services and intricacies, is not addressing himself fairly to what is being done to develop CIE.  It is obviously regretted when there is a dispute and when services stop.  My own constituency was unfortunately bedevilled by a dispute in recent times that lasted far longer than it ever should have.  But the point has been made that there are two sides to every story, and it is quite clear that the dispute in Clontarf was not simply one relating to one man buses, because that issue has been negotiated and determined by agreement between the unions and CIE. What precipitated that dispute was a disagreement over the implementation of the terms of that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the bus services in my constituency, I have on many occasions approached the manager of Clontarf bus depot and have had the opportunity to attend meetings at Clontarf of both management and workers and union representatives, including the assistant principal officer of the National Busmen's Union, who took the time to come and discuss the problems of vandalism of buses and attacks on passengers and bus drivers.  I do not welcome the remarks of Deputy Briscoe or anyone else here who says that that union is not working in the interest of a comprehensive, effective State-run transportation service.  I have found all workers and unions within CIE <Col N="1980" /> to have had the best interests of the community at heart at all stages.  It is with the greatest reluctance and regret that any of them go to the picket line.  It is a final resort and it is the domestic sanction that that country has bestowed and made available throughout its history to workers as a weapon to settle their disputes when management are unreasonable. I do not think that the remarks made in this House have been the slightest bit helpful nor are they in any way based on what goes on within CIE.</P>
    <P>We have before us some useful legislation that deserves the support of all parties.  We should address ourselves to the implications and ramifications of that legislation, enhance it as best we can, which is our job as legislators, and leave the running of CIE to the management who are doing an excellent job and to the workers who are doing an even better one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the initiative of the Minister in bringing it before the House.  I also welcome the support of other speakers for the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Bill and the policy underlying it, my interest, as Deputy for my constituency, is to encourage Irish Rail to start up commuter services between Mullingar and Dublin and to continue the recently commenced commuter service between Athlone and Dublin.  I beg the pardon of the House for pressing a particular area interest but, if every Deputy in the House were to take an active interest in the development of train and bus services in and out of their constituency, they would be doing a very good service, not only to their constituents but to all the people and the Exchequer.  This is especially true since the public transport sector can be so heavily subsidised by the Exchequer and can very often become dependent on it rather than seeking its own efficiencies within its own system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening to see that the total number of railway journeys goes up by 8 per cent in 1986.  It is true that the railways remain, even in the case of <Col N="1981" /> DART, a social service.  While the railways will remain a social service in the years to come, this does not necessarily mean that they should go on regardless on their own merry way without being subjected to any tests.  Just because the test of profit cannot be applied to such a service, it does not mean that there should not be clear objectives to be met. Unless the service meets objectives of efficiency, notwithstanding the social aspects, the train services for various parts of the country will be under threat.</P>
    <P>In the context of an outlying provincial area such as Mullingar or Athlone, we are conscious that the objectives of the train service would be to bring business to the area and people to live in the area by providing a commuter service to the busier eastern region so that people can choose to live in Westmeath and commute to Dublin to work.  We have in the last year or more experienced the vast interest arising from the eastern plan in relation to the expected population increase in the Dublin and eastern region. In the context of such an uncontrollable expansion in population in this region; apparently at the expense of the rest of the country, it is important that the rest of the country at least have an opportunity to link into this dynamism in the east by having the very best commuter service.</P>
    <P>In the context, let us say, of the Dublin docks site there will be many people in my constituency who will be interested in taking up employment there, either on the construction and initiation side or on the permanent side when the project is up and going.  It is very feasible to contemplate living in Mullingar and travelling to Dublin by commuter train.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tourism aspect of the train, Dublin for long has looked to Wicklow as a place to which people might take a day trip.  When I lived in Dublin, I looked forward to going to Wicklow. With Dublin's expanding population and clogged roads, Westmeath can and does increasingly provide people in Dublin with the opportunity of a day trip, not perhaps for the same reasons as one might go to Wicklow but, nevertheless, <Col N="1982" /> to enjoy the fabulous water sport and angling facilities in the county, in addition to the various archaeological sites and sites of special interest.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to supply a commercial for Westmeath but, nevertheless, must do so in the context of the very live and real interest that exists in the county in relation to the development of these services. With regard to the purpose of that Bill, that lively interest is indicative of and responsive to the new management awareness in the CIE bodies, Irish Rail and Bus Éireann.  I have no doubt that the passing of this Bill will encourage the type of dynamism we have experienced in the last couple of years and which has evoked an ever increasingly popular response in areas such as my constituency.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the continued dedication to marketing and selling of the facilities of the railway in the coming months and years.  As a representative of my area, I have very satisfactory and pleasant recollections in meeting within the last couple of months with management of Irish Rail and various individuals associated with the marketing side, for the purpose of ensuring a developing of the commuter routes.  I can place on the record of this House that I found management of these bodies to be very positive and very sympathetic.  From the various meetings which I and fellow public representatives from Westmeath had with that management, I am happy to say that we are now past the time when public representatives and management of the railway companies and bus companies will have ceremonial meetings in relation to retention of a railway service or its development to a town like Mullingar and perform a flag waving exercise. The meetings we have had in relation to the commuter services in Mullingar were businesslike, concerned with finding out the depth of the market, above all, about pushing a marketing exercise and not putting pressure on anybody, whether it be on the management of CIE or on the Government somehow magically to wave a wand and ensure that the service would go on, regardless of the criteria that <Col N="1983" /> would be required to keep a service going.  I look forward to working, in relation to the whole campaign, to keep the services in the area working with the public of my constituency and working with the excellent management of these bodies.</P>
    <P>I pay great tribute to local newspapers in the area which have taken up the cause of advertising, using their space to advertise to the public that there is a possibility of ensuring a cheap and efficient transport system into and out of the area.  In view of the fact that in the telecommunications area we have in the eastern region and right out into a large area of Mullingar, the facility of radiophone contact right through the country, I have taken the initiative to suggest to Irish Rail that in the context of commuter trains, we would welcome a commitment from them to investigate whether radiophones facilitating Eircell and Air Page connection by phone could be installed on the trains.  This would be a remarkable advantage for train travel over and above road travel.  Given that we have the rail facility there and that at present it is being run on the basis of a costly social service, the more people we have on the train the more assured we are to have the services of the train, with all its attendant advantages and all the spin-off effects.</P>
    <P>When speaking about train services, which are a hobby horse of mine and of other people in my area, one must be mindful that if a commuter service is to be given from an outlying provincial area into the capital, the users of that service must of necessity be concerned about the type of feeder service from that train depot, be it Connolly or Heuston station, right through the city.</P>
    <P>However reluctant we from the country might be about becoming involved in a debate about the efficiency of the bus or train services in the capital, we must do so.  While I am not going to become involved here in the House in that matter, I would commend the Minister and the Deputies who took the trouble to make a contribution on the matter in the House for the manner in which they addressed <Col N="1984" /> the difficulties of the bus service in Dublin.  The efficiency of the whole national system depends on the efficiency reflected from the bus and train services in Dublin.  I would not profess any special knowledge in relation to the difficulties of these services.  I have noticed that the debate in the House has swung to and fro.  I would make this special plea, that those involved from every side would make up their minds, for once and for all, to work on a better image for bus services in Dublin for their own sake and the sake of the whole country.</P>
    <P>I recollect that when I was in university many years ago studying various issues of national economics, the general conventional wisdom was that the Dublin bus service would, internally within the general transport system of what was then CIE, generally make a tremendous profit which itself would subsidise the more social aspect of all the transport provisions for the rest of the country.  In the 20 years since I have left that system and lost contact with that proposition, regretfully the profitability and the efficiency of the Dublin bus system have deteriorated.  It is a great loss to the country generally that that should be so.  The matter should be addressed.  It is a Dublin issue but, nevertheless, it is an issue in respect of which I should like to see a resolution and a return to the system of 20 years ago when there was a very efficient and profitable bus system notwithstanding that there were plenty of bus strikes in those years.</P>
    <P>There may well be a more fundamental malaise affecting the Dublin bus system than merely the regrettable stoppages which occur from time to time.  I would like that malaise to be addressed sooner rather than later.  Given the economic climate at present no sector can isolate itself from the discipline which has asserted itself and which will continue to assert itself if we are to survive on a national basis.</P>
    <P>If we look back to the history of the Dublin transport system during the past 20 years we can see that it has moved away from discipline and efficiency, that it has lost its way in many respects.  I hope <Col N="1985" /> the atmosphere of the last two years will eventually pervade that system and that CIE will tighten up their operations so that they can secure the resources which would carry the less profitable and more costly services which they must provide throughout the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which would make it possible for CIE to sell, on a more flexible basis, property of the railway company and the bus company. CIE found it difficult to negotiate and sell property.  Decisions were very slow in coming and if this Bill hastens the decision making process in relation to the property it will have been very worthwhile. On that basis I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. At the outset I would like to take issue with some of the remarks made by Deputy McCartan in his contribution to this debate.  He accused my colleague, Deputy Deasy, of supporting the complete disbandment of CIE just because he mentioned words or phrases such as &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;the use of commonsense&rdquo;. Nothing is further from the truth.  Fine Gael would support anything which would make CIE more efficient and more effective and which would result in their giving more value for money.  Interpreting the remarks of Deputy Deasy in the manner in which Deputy McCartan has done leaves much to be desired.  The Deputy made a number of other remarks which I will take issue with later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assumed that this Bill would deal with all the elements of transport.  I had hoped that it would contain major new initiatives and would give a new direction to the transport system.  However, on reading the Bill I was disappointed to find that the Bill deals specifically with CIE and removes from them the requirement of having to re-pay certain liabilities to the State.  It also gives them powers to borrow more money, powers to dispose of land and powers to increase penalties. I hope the Minister at some future date will bring before the House a much wider Bill covering all areas of transport and <Col N="1986" /> containing some novel provisions.</P>
    <P>I support the main thrust of the Bill. Most of the sections are very welcome but we must seriously investigate whether the monopoly CIE hold is damaging the type of service which the general public are being provided with.  The bus service which is being provided by CIE in Dublin is bad.  The strikes which take place repeatedly in the Dublin area must in some way be due to the fact that there is no competition.  If the private sector competed with CIE on bus routes in the Dublin area I have no doubt that many of the strikes which occur within CIE would not occur because those who consider going on strike would put much more serious thought into whether they should go on strike.  A subvention in excess of £100 million is given to CIE annually.  That is an awful lot of money and it is the taxpayers who provide that money.  These are the people who use the services and they are the people who should be getting a reliable and efficient service but, unfortunately, at present that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Because of the continuing serious situation in the Dublin area the Minister must seriously consider at an early date granting licences to private operators so that they can compete with CIE on these routes.  I would not be as forceful if a good and reliable service was being provided. CIE should be making substantial profits in the Dublin area.  As Deputy Abbott has said, over one-third of the population lives in the Dublin area and CIE should be able to make enough profits in this area to subsidise the less economic routes particularly those in the west where the population is not as big.  Unfortunately, that is not the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to a range of vultures waiting with their buses around the sidewalks of this city at weekends to cream off the profitable routes. The fact is that there are no people out there creaming off the profitable routes because they do not have licences to do so.  In many instances they are not licensed to go on routes where it appears it is difficult to make a profit.  In my own <Col N="1987" /> constituency in County Clare there is one private operator who has been operating a very efficient daily service from Kilkee and Ennistymon to Dublin and at weekends from Dublin to different parts of Clare.  This operator has been providing an extremely efficient service for hundreds of Clare people during the past year and a half.  It is unfortunate that the Minister will not consider giving a licence to this operator to provide for the people of Clare services which no other operator is at present providing.  It is unfortunate that the Department are adopting such a narrow attitude on the issuing of licences. Our attitude should be one of going out to compete.  Where there is competition a more efficient service is provided but that is not happening at present.  Until the Department of Transport open their minds to competitiveness and giving more licences overall transport management will not improve.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations in CIE one must question the attitude of management.  It has been said in the House that management must be commended and the position of the workers must be put in question when, as a Deputy across the House said, a man who was out sick for nine months could cause a strike.  Somewhere along the line communication is lacking and management is not good.  If worker-management relations were good then the incidence of strikes in CIE would be lower than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the sale of land by CIE.  Like my colleague Deputy Deasy, I am concerned about that section and I hope that the Minister will consider seriously the overall position regarding the sale of land.  As he knows, railway lines run either through one owner's land or between two owners' lands.  It would be unfortunate if a third party were allowed to come in and buy the narrow stretch of land between those properties.  Somebody might do it just for devilment and could create bad feeling and hassle in the area.  It is not necessary for me to highlight the problems and history of land ownership and I would not like any legislation passed in this House <Col N="1988" /> to aggravate the situation or cause further difficulties.  The value of the land to somebody other than a person whose property adjoins it is pretty negligible.  In most case the land in question is not capable of much farming or agricultural use because there will be a great deal of gravel foundation and stones in the area.  Where a railway line has closed down in a tourist area it might be advisable that CIE approach the local tourist interests with a view to purchasing the entire rail route.</P>

      <P>There could be a tourist advantage in retaining certain portions of the railway line.  If a local tourist interest group were interested in purchasing the entire stretch of rail between two towns like Kilrush and Kilkee &mdash; although it is too late to talk about that now &mdash; consideration should be given to that purchase.  In the final analysis if the company purchasing it were to wind up they in turn should be obliged to sell the lands back to adjoining farmers.  Welcome has been expressed in the House this afternoon for the provision that the land can be put up for public tender but priority should be given to adjoining farmers for the sake of peace, if nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision relating to fines is more than welcome.  It is ludicrous that this House should be considering legislation going back to some time such as 1876. We are 100 years behind the times in updating such legislation.  It is more than amusing; it is serious that this House is not on top of matters like that.  The fine is to be increased to £300 from £2 for the various offences outlined in the Bill.  I join with other speakers in suggesting that the Minister increase the fine or at least give discretion to the district justice to consider a maximum fine in the region of £800 or £1,000 and scale it down from <Col N="1989" /> there, or arrange it in line with inflation. The Bill provides for three months' imprisonment.  Perhaps the Minister should consider a maximum of 12 months giving the District Court the option to decide on the penalty.</P>
    <P>Overall the Bill is welcome and I hope that as a result of it we will see greater efficiency within CIE.  CIE need capital to expand and to proceed with work that they have not done prior to this and to make improvements where they are needed.  I hope we will see a greater range of service by CIE throughout the country. I commend them for what they are doing in providing tour buses.  They are giving a competent, efficient and capable service in that regard and those operating that service are acting as good ambassadors not just for CIE but for the country. Iarnród Éireann are to be complimented on their Dublin-Killarney weekends.  I understand that negotiations are proceeding for a Dublin-Ennis weekend and if that materialises and Dubliners come to Clare I assure them of hospitality in keeping with County Clare.</P>

      <P>The Transport Bill, 1987 is a Department of Finance measure. It is clear that it has been imposed on the Minister by the Department of Finance and arises directly from arrangements, as the Minister said, which were made between myself as Minister for Communications and the then Minister for Finance to defer certain payments to CIE in 1987 and 1988 into the following years.  I agreed to that I suppose under duress and if the truth were known I suppose the Minister is agreeing to this Bill under duress.  I preferred to defer payments to CIE to cancelling a financial formula which I and the then Department of Communications fought so hard to put in place.  I am not one to attack the Department of Finance unnecessarily, but many of the problems we have lie within that Department because of the silly approach they take to so many issues.  Much of the hot water the Government are in today on a number of <Col N="1990" /> matters including teacher-pupil ratio, the NSSB&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making a passing reference to the difficulties the Government find themselves in on a number of other matters like the NSSB and the pupil-teacher ratio because of the Department of Finance.  Those things have been imposed on Ministers by the Department of Finance.  A saying in our time in Government was &ldquo;sell the <i>Asgard</i> list&rdquo;.  The Government in an effort to demonstrate how Rambo-like they were agreed to all sorts of things under pressure of time because they had ill prepared themselves for Government.  In the case of the financing of CIE the role of the Department of Finance has been disgraceful. I need to illustrate the background to the financial problems of CIE. From 1969 to 1982 the deficit in CIE increased from £2.5 million to £109.2 million; seven times the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister in late 1982 I decided that this could not continue.  The deficit would have escalated beyond redemption and we would have been faced with the collapse of CIE out of which the Exchequer could not have extricated it.  So I, as Minister, and the <Col N="1991" /> officials of the Department of Communications &mdash; now the Department of Transport &mdash; worked very hard and came up with the idea of a new financial formula whereby we set realistic targets for the reduction of that deficit.  I should like to pay a tribute to the officials of the Department who worked so hard and so fast at the problems and came up with so many good ideas which are having very good results today.</P>
    <P>Since 1982 &mdash; and it ought to be reiterated &mdash; CIE's deficit has reduced each year in succession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Liam Kavanagh illustrated graphically earlier today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The deficit has gone down each year in succession.  The targets have been met or improved upon.  Certain realistic targets were set to reduce their call on the Exchequer by 2.5 per cent per annum and they have done so. I want to use that fact to criticise the tole of the Department of Finance because the Department resisted that formula all the way.  I had a major battle for 18 months in Cabinet and even after it was clearly beginning to work they resisted it.  They are still clawing back on that formula, a formula that has been a dramatic success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is partly drawing back on the commitment given to CIE that part of the deficit which should have been paid in 1987 will now be paid in 1988.  That is a promise that was not kept and that is what this Bill is about.  It is a half-way house.  It has not been totally put aside but they are finding a way of allowing CIE to borrow more in lieu of the grants to which they were entitled.  That is very shortsighted.  If the Department of Finance had their way we would have continued the same old approach to the financing of CIE as went on for years before.  Had we not adopted that approach we would have possible deficits of £50 million, £60 million or £70 million more than we have today per annum.  I sympathise with the Minister that this unthinking, short sighted, hard line from <Col N="1992" /> the Department of Finance has, to some extent, triumphed and has been given expression in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The commitments given to CIE should be kept.  One of the most important needs between the Minister and his State companies is that when the Minister gives his word the State companies know they can take that word and that it will be honoured and they can operate within it.  For too long the opposite was the case.  We are going back into that situation now. What will happen?  The State companies know that the Minister cannot give a word that can be guaranteed to hold up, so they go about cooking the books and hoodwinking the Minister as they did for years before 1982.  That is why I say the Department of Finance are shortsighted.</P>
    <P>Most of the problems in CIE are not in terms of CIE at all.  Most of the problems arise from the regime imposed by Governments over the decades.  I should like to refer to the financial performance of CIE since 1982 and to rebut much of the unfair criticism which I have heard in this House today.  It is unfair because there has been a terrific performance in all three branches of CIE.  It is unfair of Deputies to slag all of CIE when the industrial relations problems are in one sector of the company, namely, Dublin Bus.  There are no industrial relations problems in the railway nor has there been any for many years.  There are no industrial relations problems in Bus Éireann nor has there been any for many years but there is an industrial relations problem in Dublin Bus.  I thought Deputy McCartan's justification for this was pathetic.  It is extraordinary that a man who represents large working class estates of Dublin and who purports to be a member of The Workers' Party should encourage in any way the industrial relations problem which most adversely affects the working class people of this city.</P>
    <P>There is an industrial relations problem but it would be wrong to say that there are not two sides to that problem.  There have been many recent strikes, notably the one last weekend, of which no notice was given.  That sort of behaviour is not acceptable and is totally against the <Col N="1993" /> interests of the workers.  As that behaviour continues more and more people will make other provision for their transport needs in the city.  There is evidence of that already.  They will buy cars and bicycles and they will make arrangements to take lifts.  Having made those provisions, even on days when there are no strikes, many people will utilise those arrangements. They will not revert to the buses. Fewer people are travelling on the buses and therefore fares must go up.  Because there are fewer passengers to cover the total revenue needs of the company the fares must go up and this leads to a downward spiral.</P>
    <P>Much has been done in CIE during the past few years and also before 1982. Before I became Minister many decisions were taken regarding the investment in the bus fleet so that today we have a much more modern bus fleet than we had ten years ago.  Much has been done in relation to bus priority schemes on the roads of Dublin.  Much has been done about the one person operation on buses and the DART and there has been a great deal of progress.</P>
    <P>There is one major component which must be put in place.  If Dublin Bus is to become profitable in the years ahead &mdash; which I believe it can &mdash; we must have customer confidence.  Customer confidence is totally upset by all of these strikes.  There is no confidence among customers of Dublin Bus that they can be relied upon to provide a reliable service. That is a terrible thing and it is a terrible thing to tar all CIE with that brush. Indeed, it is a terrible thing to tar all the workers in Dublin Bus with that brush because, firstly, only a small number of persons are concerned, and secondly, it is usually one particular union.  That union is not a member of Congress and they have a habit of carrying out lightning strikes which are in breach of proper industrial relations procedures.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy McCartan spoke about democracy and the democratic protection of workers.  I do not believe there is one Member of this House who does not support fully legislative protection of workers' rights.  That is not what is at <Col N="1994" /> issue here: what is at issue is the consistent abuse of that protection and the consistent ignoring of proper procedures. If it is to be democratic, these strikes should be subject in advance to secret ballots of all the people involved.  That is democracy.  Democracy is not one or two people running off with pickets and causing strikes.</P>
    <P>Why do that union and their members behave like that?  They must see it is damaging to their public image, to their relations with the community at large and to their own self-interest, not alone in the long term but in the mid-term also. However, they do it and there must be some explanation for it.  I believe they do it because of the legacy of distrust which has existed between management and workers in the Dublin city bus services for a long time.  Management have to take a very substantial part of the blame for that.</P>
    <P>Major structural changes have been carried out and there has been a reorganisation of management since CIE were broken up into three companies.  I had hoped one of the major achievements of that reorganisation, which is only in place since the beginning of the year, would be greatly improved industrial relations, which would, in turn, lead to greatly improved customer confidence.  I suggest to the Minister, and through him to the Chairman of the CIE group, that the time has come for some sort of conference to be convened involving the Minister, the management and the workforce of CIE to see if some sort of concordat could be arrived at which would eliminate these constant stoppages in CIE services.  It would be a good idea if some independent outside party chaired such a conference in order that a concordat of peace could be achieved so that the bus service of this city can be relied upon by the people.  That has to be based on the belief that there have been wrongs on both sides; we cannot blame the workers only.  There is a long history of distant and bad management and of distrust on both sides.</P>
    <P>In the context of the services in Dublin, a number of changes were being <Col N="1995" /> implemented when the Government came into office.  One of these changes involved the setting up of the Dublin Transport Authority.  When the Minister was Opposition spokesman he strongly attacked me about the DTA which we brought in and said that they ought to be a much bigger affair.  The Minister has now decided to abolish the DTA.  That requires legislation but there is no reference to the Dublin Transport Authority in this Bill.  I do not know if the Minister will get legislation which repeals the Dublin Transport Authority through this House.  I appeal to him to reconsider that decision because it is a disastrous one for the commuters of this city.  It affects both CIE and the travelling public directly. The cost of running the DTA was very small; it was around £500,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, there is a crying need for co-ordinated decisions on transport infrastructureal investment.  At present rail and bus investment decisions are taken by the Department of Tourism and Transport and road investment decisions are taken by the county council, the corporation and the Department of the Environment.  There is no co-ordination. The Dublin Transport Authority were set up to give that co-ordination. Up to now, the local authorities, when drawing up development plans, had no input from the transport sector about transport objectives.  That role was given to the Dublin Transport Authority so that transport objectives would be included in all future development plans.  Deputies from any constituency in Dublin city or county know there have been very major oversights in relation to transport because of the absence of any transport input.  The DTA were set up to perform that role and I regret very much the Government's decision to chop the DTA so soon after their commencement.</P>
    <P>The DTA were set up to co-ordinate roadworks in the city which cause so much havoc to traffic.  Not only did this include the construction, repair and digging of roads but also the timing, co-ordination and prompt repair of such <Col N="1996" /> roads so that many of the gaping temporary repairs which disfigure many roads in this city would be eliminated. One week the Gas Company are involved, the next week the ESB and three weeks later Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to review his decision in relation to the Dublin Transport Authority and to allow them to carry on the work which this House legislated them to do.  There are two other areas I would like to refer to.</P>
      <P>One deals with the problem of bus services to the inner suburbs.  Because of the spreading out of the city, long-established routes are being taken out of the inner suburbs and being sent to the outer suburbs, with the result that by the time buses get to the inner suburbs in the morning they are full and people cannot get buses to work.  There has been a sharp deterioration in the quality and level of bus services to the inner suburbs.  There are two cases of this in my own constituency. The 21 bus service has been extended to Clondalkin and now bypasses both Ring Street and Bluebell termini.  As a result, people in those areas find it very difficult to get bus services into town in the morning and in the evening the buses are over-full with people who are going to Clondalkin.  Similarly, the No. 79 bus used to stop in lower Ballyfermot but it now stops in upper Ballyfermot, the No. 78 bus having been extended to Clondalkin from upper Ballyfermot. As a result it is almost impossible to get a bus at certain times in the morning from lower Ballyfermot.  I got the blame for this as I was the Minister at the time though I tried to explain to the people that I had nothing to do with the changes.  I ask the Minister to request CIE to re-examine the bus services to the inner suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to deal with the CIE Inchicore Works.  Inchicore is very near and dear to my heart, not only do I represent it in the Dáil but I was born and <Col N="1997" /> reared there as were my parents.  The Inchicore Works have played a very big role in the development of CIE during the past 150 years.  Now there are to be 300 redundancies at the works.  I think these redundancies are unnecessary. During my term as Minister, as I am sure the present Minister will agree, I urged the chairman of CIE to go out and do what Aer Lingus had done.</P>

      <P>It is my policy that AnCO trainees will not be worse off than they would have been had they remained on social welfare assistance.  As I announced yesterday, for AnCO and CERT trainees who are long term unemployed at the start of their training and who would have qualified for fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus payment, I have asked AnCO and CERT to make the necessary increases in their allowance to maintain their level as equivalent to their social welfare entitlement. As regards butter vouchers, these are given under an EC scheme to recipients of social welfare assistance only.  I am not able to change the conditions of the scheme.  However, I would remind Deputies that trainees receive a meal allowance which should more than compensate for loss of the vouchers.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of numbers, we have to identify those people who would qualify for a Christmas bonus under social welfare because some people on training courses would not necessarily have been in receipt of unemployment benefit.  It is estimated that the approximate gross cost of the Christmas bonus for trainees would be £150,000; the net cost to the Exchequer would be £68,000.  The cost of a fuel allowance in this respect would be £125,000 gross and £55,000 net.  We have been examining the costings over the past few weeks and find that we can achieve the savings from the AnCO Vote.</P>

      <P>We are talking about people who are not necessarily on training schemes by choice.  As a result they will be losing their entitlement under the free fuel scheme, free footwear scheme and clothing allowance scheme and also possible assistance with their ESB bills.  I am asking the Minister specifically to make provision to ensure these people will get their double week payment at Christmas and their free fuel allowance. Because they are on a scheme, and have the same income as they would have on social welfare, will they also be considered for the clothing allowance and for assistance with their ESB bills?</P>

The other questions are primarily a matter for the Department of Social Welfare and I suggest that the Deputy takes them up with that Department.  With regard to the fuel allowance, those people who would have been entitled to the £5 fuel allowance because they were recipients of long term unemployment assistance but who are now on AnCO or CERT courses, will receive that benefit.  The Christmas bonus of 65 per cent of the normal weekly entitlement will be paid by the Department of Social Welfare to those who would have been entitled to that payment while in receipt of social welfare payments but who are now attending AnCO and CERT courses.</P>

Could I ask the Minister if he would consider extending the bonuses to those on the social employment and teamwork schemes, who are in exactly the same position and who are losing out as a result of participating in these schemes.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I announced in August that we would try to extend the bonus when we linked the training allowances rate to the unemployment assistance rate, which was a change from the normal benefit.  The reason I delayed the official announcement was that I was waiting to see what would happen in the <Col N="2001" /> Department of Social Welfare and, relating to Deputy Birmingham's question, to see where I would get the resources to pay for them.  Finally the schemes are not the same.  The social employment and Teamwork scheme are not linked to the unemployment assistance rate.  They are paid on a separate rate, so I am afraid I cannot do anything for those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">

      <P>Can the Minister outline the mechanics for payment?  Is it a question of each trainee having to make a claim to be entitled to payment?  How will it be processed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare in conjunction with AnCO and CERT can produce a list of people who would be entitled to unemployment assistance.  AnCO and CERT will then pay those entitled.  It will not be difficult to administer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Minister for succeeding in making provision for the bonuses in these cases.  I would ask the Minister to have due regard to the fact there is a very close margin between the level of allowances paid under the various training schemes and the total entitlement that people on social welfare assistance can obtain, not just in cash terms but in the terms Deputy Stagg referred to.  In order to maintain the success of the various schemes could the Minister ensure, perhaps in the forthcoming budget, that there is a net financial gain for somebody to participate in a scheme? Otherwise he will be awarding bonuses to declining numbers of participants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make a statement regarding the progress, if any, he has made in reducing unemployment in Tallaght, Dublin 24.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The expansion of employment is primarily a function of general economic policy which creates the environment conducive to the creation of self-sustaining jobs.  The Government's policy in this respect has been set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>The role of the Manpower Agencies, which come within my area of responsibility, is mainly concerned with helping those without jobs to find employment and to try to ensure that people coming into the labour market are adequately trained and have the relevant skills for the jobs which do arise.</P>
      <P>During 1986, AnCO trained over 1,700 people at its training centre in Tallaght and are on target to train a similar number for 1987.  In addition 120 people are participating in community youth training projects, and community workshops. A further number from the Tallaght area are attending training courses operated by CERT.</P>
      <P>To date, this year, a total of 322 people from the Tallaght area have been placed on the employment schemes operated by the National Manpower Service while 500 have been accommodated on the Job-search course.</P>
      <P>Under the community enterprise programme, grant aid has recently been approved for the development of two incubator workspaces in the area.  In addition, the &ldquo;Get Tallaght Working Group&rdquo; is employing an enterprise worker to develop project ideas and to provide business advice and support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Community Training and Employment Consortium (COMTEC) was established in Tallaght by the Youth Employment Agency in January 1985.  Its objective is to bring together and coordinate the work of manpower and education agencies in the area, and to promote community involvement in local provision of manpower services.  In February of this year, the COMTEC produced a two-year plan for Tallaght.  A number of the report's specific recommendations have already been acted upon and are being funded by the Youth <Col N="2003" /> Employment Agency.  These include the establishment of a centre for the unemployed and the appointment of a community development and enterprise development officer under the YEA's community enterprise programme to help to generate more temporary employment and community-managed enterprise projects.</P>
    <P>As a result of recommendations in the Tallaght COMTEC plan, an integrated development programme for the Tallaght area is being developed by the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO, in co-operation with local community interests and Dublin County Council.  The programme which is being developed at present for implementation from early 1988 is a strategy for identifying individuals, companies and groups in the area showing potential to increase local jobs and income as well as enhancing the climate for enterprise in the area.  The programme will involve concerted and coordinated use of the training and enterprise development resources within FÁS, the new Manpower Authority, to achieve the maximum impact.  Initial discussions have been held with interests in the Tallaght area about the organisation of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the Minister's very lengthy reply.  Would it be fair to sum it up by saying that he has made no progress at all in reducing unemployment in the Tallaght area?  Could he make a statement now regarding the very positive Kiltalown project which was discussed during an Adjournment debate where there are real employment prospects to be created from local sources?  Will he assure the House that a positive response will be forthcoming shortly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I could say that if I were to withdraw all the resources I mentioned in that very lengthy reply Deputy Taylor would have far more problems than he has at the moment.  I appreciate the difficulties in Tallaght and the efforts the Deputy has put into the Kiltalown project. <Col N="2004" /> The maximum grant of the YEA is not sufficient for the requirements of the area.  Deputy Taylor has highlighted on a number of occasions the fact that over 80 per cent of people are out of work in that locality and that resources are not available.  At his request I have asked the Youth Employment Agency to look at it again and, following a Private Notice Question from Deputy Taylor some weeks ago, I have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to look at some of the projects mentioned.  I am aware that there are a number of people who are in a position to take up space if this project goes ahead.  I hope to be able to give a full reply, if not before Christmas, then early next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that any of the 1,700 trainees would have been in employment but I would need to check it.  There were 185 first-year off-the-job apprentices included in the figure of 1,700.  The courses on offer ranged from employable skills, skills foundation, travellers' workshop, community workshop, community youth training programme and community response.  These courses would not have been taken by people in employment.</P>

The vast majority of people taking the courses I have mentioned would not be in employment. Some of the apprentices would be sponsored.  The percentage placement of <Col N="2005" /> non-sponsored people came to 77 for employable skills and 91 for first-year off-the-job apprentices.  The vast majority would not be in employment.</P>

      <P>Each post-primary school throughout the country has been sent a copy of the booklet <i>Working Abroad</i> together with information cards on south-east England &mdash; the most asked about destination.</P>
      <P>The booklet follows from my policy to discourage thoughtless, ill-prepared emigration. Experience shows that many who decide on impulse, to emigrate, find themselves later in very difficult situations. It is hoped that by encouraging young people to seek information and assistance from placement officers, the problems of unprepared emigration will be lessened.</P>
      <P>Teachers have been advised to refer intending emigrants to the local National Manpower office, where information on other EEC countries, as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and USA is available.</P>

      <P>Have the draft heads of the Bill been circulated to other Departments and, if so, do they retain the provision in the earlier Bill introduced in the Seanad almost 12 months ago which enabled the extension of the powers of worker participation to all semi-State bodies by virtue of an agreement between the Minister for Labour and the sponsoring Minister?  Has the Minister retained the same number of bodies included in the original Bill in the document he has circulated to other Departments?</P>

      <P>I have considered that.

I do not think the case mentioned by the Deputy will come under those headings.  I must point out that I have not received any recent representations on that matter.  I do not think the legislation I mentioned would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>Because of the national importance of the post of director general of FÁS, I decided that I should advertise it in the public press and in that way attract the widest possible field of candidates. Accordingly, I had the post advertised during the last week of August 1987 and the first week of September 1987.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the public advertisement, I set up a selection board to assist me in reviewing the applications. The selection board comprised a senior businessman, who acted as chairman, the Secretary to the Government and the Secretary of my own Department.</P>
      <P>The selection board examined all applications and interviewed those candidates whom they considered best qualified for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2013" /> On completion of the interviews, the selection board reported to me.  I am, at present, considering their report and I hope to announce the name of the new director general shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put it to the Minister that the delay that has occurred since the advertisement appeared and the inaugural meeting of FÁS is unacceptable and has damaged the morale of the three organisations who have been waiting for the changes to be implemented.  Secondly, did the Minister instruct the interview board to give him a number of names or one name of the person to fill the post?</P>

We hope this document will be circulated to as many people as possible.  I think it will be of great interest to all members of trade unions and employers.  As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, I am anxious to get a clear view as to whether this legislation is helpful, unhelpful or irrelevant to employment prospects.  If we can get a good debate on the legislation we can state, once and for all, that we should amend this legislation to try to create employment.  We must also decide if we need to strengthen the legislation to help the people it directly affects, the employees.</P>

      <P>I have only recently named the board designate of FÁS which is currently meeting informally to undertake preparatory planning to take on its responsibilities.  The members will take up their appointments on 1 January 1988 the establishment day for FÁS.</P>
      <P>A major task facing the FÁS Board will be to carry through the integration of the services provided by the three existing organisations.  It is much too early to take decisions about the eventual staffing requirements of FÁS in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there has been a reduction in the allocation to FÁS this year of £4.22 million, and the fact that FÁS was not in existence last year, although provision was made for FÁS in the Estimate &mdash; the sum of £52.142 million for training purposes was reduced to £48.702 million and there was a reduction for administration from £6.651 million to £5.870 million &mdash; I would like to know the likely <Col N="2017" /> effects on the number of places which will be available, the cutbacks in stock and the people who run the courses.</P>

      <P>We have already spread the money we have across a range of courses and, with a few exceptions, we will be able to maintain the man years in 1988 which we had in 1987.  I highlighted the areas where there are difficulties.  In relation to staffing, I hope the amalgamation of the three semi-State bodies will generate a sufficient amount of work for the staff and that there will be adequate resources to keep all staff members more than busy.  I would like to stick to that policy decision and I hope I will not have to change it.</P>

My reply is that there are no redundancies proposed.  As regards the other matter the Deputy raised, it will be possible to maintain the man years, except for schemes which were abolished, such as the work experience programme, which will not exist next year, as well as a number of other schemes.  As I have already outlined in this House on two occasions and during Question Time, the man years in 1988 will be similar to those in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the arguments advanced in favour of a merger was that there would be a more cost effective delivery of services and that the degree of triplication could be removed?  Does he accept that if one agency can do what it previously took three agencies to do that fewer people should be employed in doing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be so but the plan involved the amalgamation of three organisations but not to get rid of the staff.  It was to be a cost effective, integrated body and it is my wish to regionalise it.  If I could save 200 or 300 jobs by rationalisation I could allocate them to any area.  Some 19 per cent of the population are unemployed and require the services of FÁS.  A high proportion &mdash; a figure of 5,000 was mentioned but it could be much higher &mdash; leave school before reaching 18 years of age and the social guarantee advisory work could be extended to them.  I want a more cost effective organisation to give better service to the public.  I certainly do not want to make people redundant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. Certainly there will be redeployment and the management and the board are extremely active in highlighting those areas where there is duplication.  It is primarily a matter for the management and I have had almost daily meetings with them in that regard.

      <P>The offer of voluntary redundancy has probably now gone to all State organisations but I want to make it clear that I am not trying to force anyone in FAS to avail of it.  If people wish to apply they have the right to do so. However, it is quite traumatic for those with Civil Service status to be moved out of their Department into a new organisation. The same applies to the YEA and AnCO and they are all to be highly commended &mdash; unlike some other organisations &mdash; for working in such a co-operative way with the board and me.  I do not wish to talk about unemployment at present.  If people wish to go that is another matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Exchequer allocation to CERT was made against the background of the overall difficulties with the public finances.  It was also the understanding that there would be a significant increase in the contribution from the hotel, catering and tourism industry to the work of CERT.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with CERT Ltd. who have formulated specific proposals for collecting the necessary level of contribution. The proposals cover not only the hotel industry but also extend to catering institutions, hospitals and carriers. These proposals will be discussed with representatives of the various sectors involved, and my Department will be present at these discussions.</P>
      <P>Given an adequate level of funding from the industry, there will be no negative consequences to the operation of CERT.  CERT training will continue to be a major element in the Government's strategy on tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister initiated these discussions and I wish him success.  Does he agree, however, that success will be measured by whether he will be able to raise the projected figure of £500,000?  Having regard to the replies he gave to me in the form of written answers last week, does he agree that the hotel industry have benefited very substantially from the support of the taxpayer, an average of two employees per institution at a rate of <Col N="2021" /> subsidy of £20 per week per trained person?  A reduction of VAT was introduced two years ago and, in view of this, will the Minister agree that the hotel industry has received over the odds support from this and previous Administrations? Will he clearly indicate now that the House expects that sector of the industry to come up with a figure of £500,000 which was mentioned earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's comments about the value of CERT's contribution to the industry.  It is well known and has been publicly acknowledged on many occasions by Members on all sides of the House.  I initiated the consultations with a view to securing a substantial increase in the financial support for the industry.  I set a target of £500,000 and since then I have been directly involved with the board of CERT to explain the position.  I said if they could not raise the industry's contribution the consequences for CERT would be quite dramatic.  State funding will have to be replaced as a matter of urgency because I do not have the necessary funds.  The board accepted that in principle and, in a joint meeting between the management of CERT and senior officials in my Department, said they would try to get an agreement before Christmas if possible from hotels, licensed premises, restaurants, industrial caterers and carriers to a levy.  If that was not successful, legislation would have to be introduced for each area.  However, I feel quite justified in asking the industry to pay £500,000 to avoid delays and this is the path I intend to follow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

I then had a meeting with the management and my senior officials.  Over the next few weeks they will be meeting every sector of the industry to get their agreement, not in principle but in fact.</P>

      <P>The cutback to CERT in the current year amounts to £300,000. Will this result in fewer training places being available to applicants in the coming year?

      <P>I am pleased that the Minister requires the industry to contribute. It is the least they can do.  Is the Minister aware that there is a grave shortage of skilled personnel in catering and baking, that facilities are not available for training and so on?  In view of that and in view of the grave unemployment figures has the Minister any plans to expand training in these fields?  It appears that these are the only fields where we have not enough personnel to fill the vacancies available.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  Apart from what I have said here, the maintenance of CERT operations at existing levels will continue to underline the Government's emphasis on the strategic importance of tourism.  In the National Plan agreed with the social partners there is agreement to increase by 300, craft training places.  CERT, wherever possible have tried to increase their numbers to ensure that there is adequate numbers to fill vacancies.</P>

      <P>Initially, I hope to meet both sides.  I have met them on numerous occasions in recent months and at least once on this issue.  Bearing in mind what occurred on previous occasions, I should <Col N="2031" /> like to have a small delegation of perhaps two or three nominated along with a senior official of my Department who is involved in this area.  I would hope they would comprise a working group to undertake an initial examination, perhaps encompassing all areas, and then ascertain where we should go from there. Later on it might be necessary to break that down into an examination of particular areas.  We must first establish clear guidelines on the total sphere of the review.</P>

For instance, it will cover provision for rule books, the conduct of secret ballots before industrial action is taken, provision for placing restrictions on the granting of injunctions, the withdrawal of immunity from workers, all of those things.  At this stage I consider them all appropriate for discussion. I might have personal fixed views on an awful lot of them but, for the <Col N="2032" /> purpose of making progress, I will put all of the documents in for discussion initially.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make a statement on the extent to which progress has been made in merging AnCO, YEA and NMS into FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Services Act, 1987 which provides for the establishment of An Foras Áiseanna Saothair (FÁS) and the dissolution of AnCO, NMS and YEA was enacted on 18 July, <Col N="2033" /> 1987.  Since then I have been pressing ahead with its implementation, specifically in relation to the setting up of FÁS, in consultation with relevant interests.</P>
      <P>On 25 September, 1987, I made an order under section 2 of the Act fixing 1 January, 1988 as the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.  On that day FÁS shall become a legal entity and will assume responsibility for all the functions currently exercised by the three other bodies which shall then cease to exist.</P>
      <P>I have also appointed the chairman and 14 ordinary members of FÁS in accordance with the relevant provisions contained in Part I of the Schedule to the Act.  Since 30 September, however, members of FÁS have been meeting regularly on an informal basis under the chairman. They have met senior managers of the three agencies involved with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements for bringing FÁS into operation on 1 January.</P>
      <P>Applications for the post of Director General of FÁS were invited by means of a public advertisement during the last week in August 1987 and the first week in September 1987.  I hope to announce the appointment of the Director General shortly.</P>
      <P>Staff in AnCO, NMS and YEA have been kept informed of developments by means of general circulars and consultations with their staff representatives. Officers of my Department who are being assigned to FÁS under section 7 of the Act have already been notified to that effect.</P>
      <P>On the basis of progress to date, I am satisfied that all the preparatory work which can contribute to the successful launch of FÁS on 1 January, 1988 will have been completed by then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fairly conclusive debates have been continuing all the time.  The main issues which the board <Col N="2034" /> designate of FÁS have been considering affect the staffing and organisational structures of the new body, general staffing arrangements, premises, pension schemes, rationalisation of programmes and concerns of staff associations, We have been working by way of sub-committees. All of those arrangements have been agreed and the necessary details have been almost completed between the Departments of Finance and Labour. The concerns of the staff interests are that there should be no compulsory redundancies, no worsening of conditions in the new organisations, there should be preservation of career and promotion opportunities, assurances about adequate consultation and redeployment and preservation of pension entitlements. I have concluded the negotiations. Mainly I have been trying to allay fears of individuals and I have completed that exercise.</P>

      <P>That is a totally unfair perception not so much from my own point of view but the staff directly concerned have worked almost every night since 1 September and since 1 October they have worked every weekend also. The various bulletins on the industrial relations difficulties are now at hand. People have been appointed.  As regards the organisational structure, posts have been advertised and interviews will be held shortly.  Legal and accountancy matters are in hand and progress on updating the modelling of the new offices is also in hand.  There are over 100 people in training and that training should be completed before Christmas.  Those people will have to deal face to face with the public.  I have been very closely involved in the meetings and while I would like to pay tribute to the chairman and to his <Col N="2035" /> senior staff in all the agencies, the officials in the Department of Labour have worked extremely hard.  This work could not have been done if it was not for the co-operation of the Opposition spokespeople who allowed me to get the Bill through before the summer.  They can take as much credit for the matter as I can.</P>

May I ask the Minister to what extent the members of the board have been given an opportunity of having an input into the qualifications and the character of a suitable applicant for chief executive and for the other senior posts which have been advertised and which the Minister mentioned?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

I hope I will make the right decision and I will announce it in the next few days.  As regards the structure of the Board, I have left that matter totally to them.

    <P>30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he is satisfied that workers' interests are adequately safeguarded in the case of mergers and takeovers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that, generally speaking, the rights of workers in mergers or take-overs are protected but, of course, it is difficult to be totally satisfied in relation to matters of this kind. Instances can arise, for example, even where legal safeguards exist and are technically observed, but workers are not treated as fairly as they might be in situations of changes of ownership of their employers' business.</P>
      <P>So far as the legal position is concerned, the Deputy will probably be aware of the provisions of the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980, which give effect to an EEC directive relating to workers' rights in merger or take-over situations.  These regulations provide that where a change of employer occurs the rights and obligations arising from an employment contract are transferred from the original owner to the new owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> In relation to redundancy payments to workers affected by mergers or take-overs, there are special provisions in the Redundancy Payments Acts relating to take-overs or transfers of business.  These provide that an employee must be paid his statutory redundancy entitlement by the first employer unless the second employer undertakes responsibility for the employee's service with the first employer.  In the event that the employee is made redundant by the new employer at some later date, his full entitlement would then be the responsibility of the new employer.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in cases where the take-over is due to the insolvency of the first employer, the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, apply.  This ensures that in an insolvency situation certain employment-related contractual entitlements which the insolvent employer is unable to pay are protected by the Act. The protected entitlements include arrears of wages, holiday pay, sick pay, minimum notice awards and unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes within certain limits.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a combination of legal instruments which afford good protection to workers affected by mergers or take-overs.  I acknowledge, however, the difficulty of providing for every possible contingency situation.</P>
    <P>My Department will be prepared to assist in any way possible in resolving any problems that may arise from employees in particular cases that are brought to notice.  It will be understood, though, that it would not be feasible for the Department to give authoritative legal advice on issues arising.  These can only be decided by the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for that comprehensive reply.  Will the Minister agree that there is considerable disquiet that in a series of fairly recent takeovers, some in insolvency situations and some otherwise, the interests of workers seem to have come a very poor second to the interests of creditors, contributors and <Col N="2038" /> others?  Specifically in the case of insolvency, will the Minister accept that liquidators have tended to regard their responsibilities under the Insolvency Act as being a lesser priority than some of their other duties and that the effect has been that people have been delayed in getting their entitlements?  Will he take steps through his Department officials to impress upon liquidators the responsibility that rests on them to address this question if people are to get their statutory rights?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said.  There has been some concern in this regard.  Without naming any of the companies, some of them have been raised in Private Notice Questions in this House in the last month or so.  It is a highly complex area and I will certainly raise the matter with the officials in my Department.  I know from recent examples that they were not slow to point out to the liquidators the concerns and the protections that should be in place for employees.</P>

      <P>In relation to a Private Notice Question that I tabled and which you dissallowed, and which I accept I cannot now challenge, the reason the different approach was taken on Question No. 15 was that I tabled questions today in regard to the arrest, release and re-arrest of a person in Cavan; you ruled that out of order on the basis that it was <i>sub judice</i>.  I tabled a question arising from certain allegations that were made in the course of an employment appeals tribunal and you allowed the question to appear on the Order Paper but did not allow supplementaries to be put.  Could I suggest to you, a Cheann Comhairle, that the proper course of action in relation to my Private Notice Question would have been to allow me put the question but not to allow me put any questions that would have touched on the offence which was charged.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned I had been talking about the industrial relations problems which have persisted in Dublin Bus as distinct from CIE as a whole.  I reiterate my suggestion that an independent party should convene a conference between the management and the trade unions in Dublin Bus with a view to establishing a concordat guaranteeing for some years to come a strike free period.  Until there is certainly and confidence in the service, Dublin Bus will not get the passenger numbers it needs to make it profitable.  All concerned owe it to the workforce to accept that suggestion and hammer out some agreement that will eliminate these frequent stoppages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking about Inchicore Works before the Adjournment.  Inchicore is near and dear to my heart because not <Col N="2077" /> only do I represent it but I was born and reared there, as were my parents before me.  Inchicore Works has, for well over a century, been the respository of many human skills.  There is a great risk that these skills will be lost.  Already CIE have proposed that there should be several hundred redundancies at Inchicore Works arising, among other things, from the fact that no new coaches will be built beyond the present programme.</P>
    <P>I felt for a long time before I became a Minister, and I pressed the issue when I became a Minister, that CIE should be using its property and its many human skills to its advantage and that of the State.  This has happened in Aer Lingus which has many subsidiaries such as Air-motive which is now making a lot of money using skills which were already within the organisation; rather than making people redundant it set up new ventures, sometimes jointly with others, and in the process helped to subsidise the aviation side of the company.  That is what CIE should have been doing over the decades.</P>
    <P>When there was a big boom in office building in the past decade or so CIE should have been in there with Irish Life and others developing the enormous sites at Heuston Station, Connolly Station, Pearse Station and elsewhere, reducing their call on the taxpayer.  Perhaps it is inopportunate to talk of those things now because of the slump but there is all the more call on CIE to find profitable ways of using the great skills of its workforce rather than making people redundant. Making people redundant is all too easy an option.  Every manager in every State company and everywhere else now measures his success on the extent to which he reduces his workforce.  We should stop that.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Inchicore Works being the herald of a new philosophy within the CIE group.  Why could not Inchicore Works become an enginneering works, perhaps making components for some of the car manufacturers elsewhere in Europe, rather than operating just as a railway engineering works?  This is something <Col N="2078" /> that I, as Minister, put to the Chairman and Board of CIE and I know they were looking at it actively.  Unfortunately nothing has come of it yet.  I would like the Minister to tell the House whether this approach is still being pursued and whether or not there are any prospective developments in relation to Inchicore Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the record of the House as being in favour of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is very much in favour of this.  I would like him to tell me if there has been any progress.  We have not just a financial crisis here but an unemployment crisis.  I take great exception to the national plan because it will cause more unemployment in the public sector.  We need jobs, and fast.  Here is CIE with these enormous assets in Inchicore and elsewhere.  In Inchicore there are skilled people and we are losing them.  I urge the Minister to get the IDA involved in finding a joint venture suitable to that plant where there is such a lot of space and such great human skills available.</P>
      <P>I also hope, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that CIE are still actively pursuing the development of their assets and getting other people to develop assets while paying rent to CIE which would be a means of income.  It must be one of the great omissions in the past decades that when things were growing and when there was a boom CIE were not in on the ground floor.  If they had been, the financial position of CIE today would be so much better.  It is inexplicable that there was not thought given to those ideas in the boom years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to talk a little about the railways.  More than two-thirds of the deficit is accounted for by the railways.  The provincial bus service, Bus Éireann, is heading towards profit.  Dublin Bus, for all its faults, has greatly reduced its losses.  In fact, between 1982 and 1984 what is now Dublin Bus halved its deficit in real terms. The objective in 1984 was that by 1989 that halved deficit would be halved again <Col N="2079" /> so that by that time we would have a quarter of the deficit that existed in 1982. Are we still on target for that?  I believe we are.  Secondly, it should be said that the Dublin Bus deficit should be reduced and a target set for Dublin Bus to reach profitable status in the next few years.  I believe it can be done without pushing up bus fares.  Higher bus fares are not the answer.  The bus fares are already high.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do about the railways?  This was considered very much in the context of the national plan of 1984 and of the Government's consideration before that of the McKinsey report.  The decision was made by the last Government that the railways should be retained.  The McKinsey report pointed out that there was very little room for contracting the railways any more, that there were only two options, to keep them or to close them.  To keep them for many years to come will prove nearly as cheap as to close them.  Given that the railways employ about 7,000 people, one could say that the decision to keep them is made.  No sensible Irish Government could do other than retain them.  Apart from employment and financial considerations, there is also the fact that we will never know when we shall need the railways strategically in years to come. However, can we continue with a very high level of subsidy?  My answer is that if we can retain the railway deficit at its present level in real terms we should do so.  It is not only possible, it is more than possible that the railways can contain the deficit at the present rate or slightly reduce it.  The objective I set out was that it should be reduced over a period.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister perhaps dwell a little on how he sees the future of the railways?  If the railways are to be retained, there is the question of the rolling stock.  In Inchicore Works in the next year the carriage building programme will be completed for the present.  Does the Minister see any need or possibility in the foreseeable future for a further rolling stock replacement?  Will there by any need for engine replacement in the <Col N="2080" /> next few years?  Can the Minister assure us that whatever engines need to be replaced will be replaced, so as to ensure the continuity of the railways?  Does he see any role for expansion of the railway service in the greater Dublin area and by that I mean, for instance, a greater number of commuter services on lines like the Maynooth line, or does he see a greater number of commuter services from places likes Athlone, Arklow and Dundalk?  If so, what will the rolling stock requirements be and will they be met?</P>
    <P>A topic that always arises at a time of financial stringency is the safety of the railways.  As Minister, I and all my predecessors and the present Minister put safety first.  Of course, that is right.  It must be said that the record of Irish railways in safety matters is very good. Would the Minister assure us that within the provisions for the railways, the first call is the maintenance of adequate safety standards, both in terms of physical safety provisions &mdash; new rails etc., new infrastructure where necessary, upgrading of infrastructure where necessary for safety reasons, safe rolling stock &mdash; and in terms of safe procedures.  Many of the accidents which have happened, not only in Ireland but elsewhere, happened because of human error, sometimes because of physical defects of equipment or contributed to by such defects, but often because of human error.  Would the Minister assure me that the first call out of the provisions will be safety and that included in that is constant attention to safety procedures, safety awareness, safety training and repeat training.  Anybody who knows anything about the railways will know that in reports on accidents, and notably in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, these aspects were addressed.  I call on the Minister to assure the House that safety first continues to be the policy.</P>
    <P>One recent development has caused me some concern, which is the rerouting of the Ballina train which carries acrylonitrile from the Dublin docks to Ballina. This subject has been discussed in the House on a number of occassions &mdash; the entire safety procedures, the safety <Col N="2081" /> back-up, the very routing of this lethal cargo.  The matter was raised with me by a concerned constituent.  I wrote to the chairman of CIE on the matter and he wrote back confirming that the train had been rerouted.  I put down a parliamentary question on the subject but it was ruled out of order as not being the responsibility of the Minister, which surprised me.  I take the opportunity of this debate to ask the Minister to give the fullest possible details for the reasons for this rerouting.  Have all the communities and local authorities along the new route been alerted to this change?  Have their emergency plans been checked as capable of speedily reacting to and coping with any accident that might occur to this train while carrying this lethal cargo?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cause any public alarm because I am quite sure, knowing the normal way in which these things are attended to, that all due attention has been paid to safety matters, but I should like the Minister to spell it out in the House and alert communities in the neighbourhood of the line on which this cargo now travels of its dangers and to advise them on what to do and what not to do if any emergency should arise.  It would be wrong to conclude a debate on the railways and especially on the matter of safety without reiterating that our railways have had a very fine safety record but that there is never any room for complacency. This must always be constantly in our minds.</P>
    <P>The accident which occurred at the King's Cross tube station in London highlights again aspects of safety which possibly are neglected in other area systems. We do not have a rail service on anything like the scale of the London underground, but it emphasises the need to check things which are off centre, such as escalators, stairways, entrances and exists, as potential fire and accident hazards.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming message which goes out from this House to CIE today is one of congratulation and not criticism.  I was a little upset by the degree of criticism in the earlier contributions.  CIE have been a whipping horse for far too long and I <Col N="2082" /> too participated in some of that whipping but a great deal of progress has been made by CIE since 1982 and a great deal of the credit for this has to be given to the chairman, board, the management and workforce of CIE.  It is very important for morale purposes that everybody within CIE should realise that their achievements have been recognised.  It is very demoralising for all those involved in CIE after making all sorts of changes and improvements to find themselves still getting whipped and kicked either in this House in an ill informed way, or on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo;, or wherever.</P>
    <P>Very seldom does the word of praise get the coverage that the word of criticism gets.  I ask the Minister and my colleagues on both sides of the House to recognise the achievements of CIE over the past few years which have continued into this year and to say to everyone involved in CIE that they have played a huge part in bringing these achievements about and we thank them for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former employee of a semi-State company for 25 years I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I endorse the final remarks made by the previous speaker in that there has been much criticism of State and semi-State companies, much of it ill-founded. There is a lack of knowledge amongst the public of the restrictions which are placed on these companies.  These restrictions can relate to the financial structure of the companies or to the statutory requirements regarding what they may or may not do and the public should be made more aware of these restrictions.  The many thousands of employees in this sector have borne the brunt of this criticism and in many cases it has affected morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to raise the morale of all employees at this time.  Recently great initiatives have been taken in the State and semi-State sector and I welcome them.  I also welcome the Bill because it continues the enlightened approach in removing some of the shackles and it updates the existing legislation.  This Bill deals with the fines which may be <Col N="2083" /> imposed.  It is ludicrous that in the battle against vandals one of the fines which may be imposed dates back to 1896. Every former Minister must accept a little bit of the blame for this.  There has been some change in the thinking but perhaps this has been brought about by the changing commercial circumstances.  As far as State and semi-State companies are concerned, we are coming out of the dark ages.</P>
    <P>The Minister welcomed what he described as the smooth changeover in CIE.  I welcome this move and it amounted to a very traumatic change for CIE.  The changes are geared towards providing a more viable and efficient service for the public who, of course, are the founders and owners of these companies. We need to get the message across to the media and the public that employees in these companies do not want to be associated with lame ducks.  I am aware from experience that these employees work at least as hard and are as conscientious as employees in the private sector but they have been shackled in many cases.  It is ludicrous that the fine for not paying your fare on a train or a bus is only £2.  The State is saying to these companies that they must provide a modern efficient service but at the same time the legislation which is in place is nearly 100 years out of date.  We need to change fast and I welcome the changes which the Minister is proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see change for the sake of change.  We can only change for the better and at the end of the day we will give the public a better and cheaper service in almost all cases.  The main criticism of State and semi-State companies is that they hold monopolies in the services they provide.  In nearly all cases, State and semi-State companies are able to provide a good service.  I have no ideological hang-ups but, all things being equal, I would opt for services to be provided by State and semi-State companies because it is money which returns to the State.  Monopolies exist and they provide a safeguard for workers, but there must be a balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> The employees in CIE must be conscious of the fact that they hold a monopoly and they should be extremely reluctant to strike for what the public may regard as trivial matters.  I have emphasised previously to my colleagues that there should be almost a total ban on a failure to provide a service for the public.  When they do go on strike they reinforce the arguments and strengthen the hand of those who call for privatisation. Therefore, I appeal to all those involved to think very carefully before they withdraw a service.  This matter was referred to earlier on and I appeal, as a former semi-State employee, to those involved to think very carefully about withdrawing a service because their actions will be used in the argument put forward for privatisation.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes proposed in this Bill are long overdue.  It was very unrealistic to allow deficits to mount up and to make no moves to change the position. It is no good saying to the public each year that the deficit is snowballing and is a millstone around the necks of the directors and the officials of the company. In this Bill under the section which deals with write-offs the Minister has made some realistic proposals and I welcome them unreservedly.  The financial structures of these companies did not allow them to compete on an equal footing with the private sector.</P>
    <P>The question relating to vandalism and the dangers to passengers is one which worries me most in regard to public transport. On the Cork-Dublin service I have seen incidents in which people could have been killed quite easily.  I have seen trains stoned only a couple of miles from this House and that seems to happen at only one location on the track between Dublin and Cork.  We should have moved on this area much earlier.  It is ludicrous that the maximum fine for this was pitched at the level of a fine for somebody stealing an apple or fruit from a shop.  In these attacks life and limb are at stake.  On many nights I have seen train windows shattered or cracked and stones bouncing off the trains.  This is criminal assault.  I <Col N="2085" /> ask the Minister to reconsider the suggested fines for these offences and to increase them.  We should try to eradicate this problem by realistic fines or imprisonment for these offences.</P>
    <P>The fines for vandalism are being reviewed also.  I am worried about putting a ceiling on the fines.  Any fines should cover at least all costs to the State.  It should cover the cost of the damage by vandalism and legal costs which the State may incur.  It is not good enough if somebody can cause a couple of thousand pounds' worth of damage to State property and be fined £50.  The Minister might review the suggested increases in the penalties. I do not know the legal implications in this regard but a statutory limit exists for different court levels.  There should be no upper limit to the penalties for attacking a train or bus with stones or whatever.  That happens regularly and there is every possibility of somebody being killed in such incidents as is obvious from the injuries we have seen.</P>
    <P>The provision for the selling off of land is a minor change.  The Bill gives the board the option of selling land by tender rather than by the present method.  A massive amount of money could be brought into the State coffers by getting rid of surplus land and properties, in the case not just of CIE but also of many State and semi-State bodies.  CIE have tried to facilitate people by selling off land at the best possible price to enable them to enlarge their gardens and so on. However, I am referring mainly to property located in cities and larger towns. We should examine the holdings of every State company with a view to bringing money into the State coffers.  In many instances land used for repair services, shunting or storage of coal or of equipment no longer required is an eyesore or is just locked away from the public.  I ask the Minister to carry out a survey of all properties owned by CIE with a view to encouraging them to sell what is not required for their service.  Some people may feel that these properties may be needed again in the distant future, but we will deal with that when we get to it. At this time we are short of cash.  We <Col N="2086" /> cannot afford to buy land for AnCO for instance &mdash; in Cork the last such purchase was for AnCO &mdash; but we can push the State bodies out to the green field area, to land which may be held by another State or semi-State body.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>In general the thinking behind the Bill will boost the morale of CIE, the board, the managers and everybody down the line.  They will see we have a Minister who is interested in making them a viable commercial unit.  Until now they have been treated as a lame duck and they may have reacted accordingly.  Since the division of the company into three a new air of optimism has prevailed.  As in the case of BTE and An Post, people are prepared to boast that they are with this company and are prepared to provide a service and are capable of doing so.  As I said earlier, the suggestion of striking could detract from that credibility.  I appeal to the company to consider this in any future negotiations and discussions.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise again that I am not happy with the safety aspects particularly on the railways.  CIE can do only a certain amount and the Garda have a massive job in this respect.  It is of little use to come into this House and sympathise with the bereaved if somebody is killed on our railways because we did not take action in time.  The Minister can bring in more punitive fines etc. for offences.  The thrust of the debate so far has been encouraging for CIE.  Deputy Mitchell moved across the water to King's Cross. We have no similar system here, but DART can introduce new dangers and hazards and we need to update our legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let me mention an issue brought up by Deputy Mitchell not directly related to this Bill.  I am referring to the national plan.  I should like to say to Deputy Mitchell, or anybody else, that if he failed to get such a plan through this House and if he failed to get agreement on it he should not knock the present one because of that.  If anybody is worried about the contents of the national plan or the potential benefits or if they think Fianna Fáil are playing the political angle I would ask <Col N="2087" /> them to read <i>Liberty,</i> the official organ of the ITGWU, where the benefits and the potential benefits for the State generally are spelled out.  I can safely say that that organisation would not be leaning towards Fianna Fáil in the main.  If Deputy Mitchell, or anybody else, wants to use some other Bill to knock the national plan they would need to think again.  The Minister is heading down the right road.  I thank him for the interest he is taking.  I would ask him to consider the two aspects of penalties in two different areas.  As a former semi-State employee he has my total support in what he is doing.</P>

      <P>I do not want to digress from the subject matter under discussion but following the closing comments of the last speaker I should like to say that there are some aspects of the national plan now coming to light which are causing some serious difficulties in this country and in this House and will be seen to cause more as time goes on and a great deal of heart flutters as well.</P>

      <P>With reference to the Bill before us I welcome it and the proposal to give effect to the various borrowings which CIE must incur and also the changes in penalties for various offences.  I would like to make a few comments in relation to CIE.  There have been comments, both positive and negative, in this House today.  We should examine the case from both sides.  It is true that CIE gave a great service and are an institution to this day in this country.  The subdivision of the company into the various companies which now operate bus services in the country, rail services and city services, is proving to be a worthwhile development.  As time goes on it will prove even more effective as a means of streamlining a transport company and making sure it meets the requirements of the modern age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time we hear the various comments put forward by CIE on the one <Col N="2088" /> hand and private transport on the other hand concerning who is right and who is wrong.  The argument goes on interminably. That argument stems from whether private transport is endangering the services provided by CIE and as such is endangering jobs within CIE.  That is a fair comment from CIE.  I should also like to point out that CIE have enjoyed a monopoly situation for a very long time. We have discussed monopolies in this House over the last couple of weeks in relation to other areas.  A monopoly situation in any business is not the ideal way in which to provide the consumer, or the customer, with the best possible service, because the customer has nothing with which to compare it.  The person who has the monopoly obviously will not be motivated other than by very extreme pressure.</P>
    <P>CIE have had a monopoly and it is true that the private transport system which has grown up over the last few years has been illegal.  In the eyes of CIE it will be regarded as an illegal development.  It developed in response to consumer demands.  Services were provided in areas which CIE consistently refused to service for various reasons.  Public representatives, of all shades and colours in this House, have from time to time, come forward repeatedly with representations to CIE begging them to provide services in certain areas and they have been met with blank refusals.  Yet year after year we vote moneys to a State company, which is right provided that that State company fully recognise that it has responsibilities to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the people outside, who are the consumers, the taxpayers, who pay for that service.  I hope that the enlightenment which has taken place with the subdivision of the companies and the formation of three separate companies within CIE will continue but at an accelerated speed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the reason I have for saying the things I have just said. I could give countless instances in relation to rail services.  I can recall over the last ten or 15 years &mdash; and I am sure every <Col N="2089" /> other Member of this House can do likewise &mdash; making numerous representations for an extension of rail services to areas that required services. These were growing urban areas where there was an obvious need to provide services.  People in those communities were crying out, asking and demanding that services be provided on a daily basis and we were given all kinds of excuses as to why it was impossible.  Some of the excuses were: there were only single tracks, the services in the various stations were inadequate to meet the requirements in today's age and inadequate to meet the usual safety standards.  That was fair enough.  After much time and much effort eventually the concession was granted.</P>
    <P>In relation to bus services there are several urban areas now where over the last ten or 15 years repeated requests were made for the provision of services by the national transport authority which comes before this House year after year for the approval of the Members of this House for various subventions.  Again, I can recall on countless occasions, being met, as have many other public representatives, with various excuses as to why certain things could not be done.  For instance, the gradient on particular roads was such as to make it unsafe to operate a double deck bus service.  When the request was made for a single deck bus service it was decided that it would not be possible, given the alleged market requirements at the present time, and that a survey would have to be carried out.  It took a long time.</P>
    <P>The survey obviously gained information which was useful though some of the information sought in the survey was in a rather peculiar way related to the subject under discussion.  The survey was carried out after a long time.  It was then decided that a minibus service might be considered.  If a minibus service was sufficient and proved efficient in another area in the city that was fair enough. People who have waited so long are prepared to wait a while longer.  We were prepared to accept that.  Suddenly, and as if by magic, it was decided that regardless <Col N="2090" /> of the gradient of the roads in question, regardless of other conditions, it was now possible to provide a single deck bus service.  This was amazing.</P>
    <P>I admit I do not believe in magic &mdash; and there are times that people in politics even believe in miracles &mdash; but I find it very difficult to understand how, after a period of five or ten years, a gradient on which it was unsafe to operate buses suddenly became safe.  The reason it became safe was that private enterprise got involved.  Private enterprise made an application to operate a similar service and suddenly all the barriers disappeared.</P>
    <P>If we have a national transport company whose purpose and whose function is to provide a transport service I accept that.  I accept also the argument being put forward in certain quarters that there is a social requirement.  I have said that in this House.  If there is a social requirement to be met so be it, but let us not come up with ridiculous and nonsensical excuses by putting off legitimate requirements, which are recognised and regarded as legitimate requirements, for spurious reasons, when it is well known within a particular company &mdash; in this case the National Transport Company &mdash; that it is possible and permissible and in every way in order to meet the demands of the request made.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware I am referring to an area in my own constituency, Confey, in Leixlip.  There are about 4,500 houses in that area and the nearest public transport service is two miles away. Admittedly, the terrain is rather difficult in terms of gradient.  I am very disappointed that it took so long to provide a service and for CIE to come to a decision that they intended to provide a service.  Despite the fact that CIE indicated they were willing to provide a service they obviously did not apply for a licence before a private company had done so.  I know that the Minister has already granted a licence to a private operator and that he has before him a request from CIE to provide a similar service.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be possible to let the two operations <Col N="2091" /> run side by side.  I see no reason why that should not happen.  At present, the private operator is providing a service to the nearest point at which CIE pick up passengers.  In many cases the passengers &mdash; unless the service becomes successful &mdash; have to wait half an hour for a connection. As the Minister is aware no provision is made for a round trip or commuter ticket.  It should be possible for the Minister, when considering the request before him, to provide the best of both worlds to the people of that area who have waited a long time and suffered much frustration.  The services that should be provided there should include a full scheduled service right into the city centre and a shuttle service for the local railway station.  This would give the people of that area what they justly deserve.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to safety standards and requirements, an aspect that has been mentioned by a number of other speakers already.  Modern telecommunications have gone forward in leaps and bounds during the past 15 to 20 years, and especially during the past five or six years.  Deputy Abbott made reference to the use of a telephone system in trains.  I see no reason why a full scale radio service or telephone system cannot operate between trains and from one train to a central location.  I know that some improvements have been made in that area since the Cherryville disaster. If a train stops on a line somewhere it is farcical that someone should have to go back along the line with a lantern to warn the next train.  That should not have to happen in this day and age.  Regardless of whether measures have since been taken that should not have been allowed to happen at a time when modern technology is providing so much by way of amenities for use by such companies and operators.  The highest possible safety standards in relation to road and rail services should be available to the national transport authority.  I ask the Minister to ensure that in future every possible assistance is given to CIE to provide them with the most up to date safety equipment <Col N="2092" /> particularly in relation to telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that instead of producing a commodity now we produce an item which is manufactured to meet consumer requirements.  I want to give a message to CIE and to any other company, whether they are in the public or private sector, who are involved in transport. That message is that it would be in their interests to look at what the consumer is now seeking and to remember that where markets and consumer demand have changed, there are ways and means, other than by research, of ensuring that the public will accept a service so long as it is good.  The systems Telecom Éireann and An Post are operating now prove that they are entitled to take their place in any arena with any company.  They are moving forward with the times and they are capable of competing with any competition, be it from the public or the private sector.  If our national transport company do the same thing they will not have to worry about whether they have a monopoly.  They will not need to hold a monopoly in order to provide the best possible service.  They have many advantages and they should avail of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my main reasons for speaking on this Bill is that many of those who have contributed are from urban centres.  I smile when I hear people speak of the difficulties they experience because they live two miles from a bus service.  There are many thousands of people in the west of Ireland who live 50, 60, 70 or 80 miles from a bus service.  In many cases, they live even further from a train service.</P>
      <P>The Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill explains that its purpose, <i>inter alia</i>, is: &ldquo;to remove the liability of Córas Iompair Éireann from repaying State advances of £44,458,691 and the interest thereon and to empower the Board of CIE to borrow, on a long term basis, up to £45 million, for the purpose of meeting its obligations and carrying out its duties&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that CIE have carried <Col N="2093" /> out their obligations and duties to a whole segment of people living along the west coast of this country.  When I was a boy there was a rail service running to the mouth of Valentia Harbour.  In about 1959 CIE decided to discontinue that service, leaving in their wake a desolate area.  This led to unemployment, emigration, migration and to a lower standard of living.  To this day CIE have not carried out their duties and obligations to those people nor to the other people living along the west coast of Ireland.  For example, the village of Sneem which this year won the Tidy Towns award and is acknowledged as the most beautiful village in the country has no public transport system.  Could one say that old age pensioners and others entitled to free travel passes living in an area such as that are being dealt with fairly by CIE?  By and large CIE have carried out their obligations and duties to people living in cities and large urban centres.  However, they have neglected their obligations and duties to people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The privatisation of certain sections of CIE would merely extend the rot further. You cannot privatise the lucrative routes and keep the remainder for the public transport system.  It is time for the board of CIE to consider whether they have kept pace with modern standards of transport.  On the Continent one purchases a ticket in a machine and there are regular inspections, with severe fines for those who are caught without a ticket.  In the light of the budgetary constraints that CIE are experiencing, is it not time to consider this as a viable option?  I believe the employees of CIE are as fine a bunch of people as one could wish to meet.</P>
    <P>Although in the past the board of CIE have failed in their obligations to people living in rural areas, there are indications of late that they are beginning to take a new approach.  Very recently CIE became involved in running a &ldquo;Show Time Express&rdquo; to Killarney.  For the sum of £30, hundreds upon hundreds of people travelled on CIE and spent the weekend in Killarney.  CIE profited from the venture, but in my view CIE have had to be dragged howling into the 20th <Col N="2094" /> century.  It is time for CIE to take a more aggressive and innovative approach.  It is difficult to understand how a private bus company can operate a fare of £30 to travel to London each week and carry a full load while CIE cannot do the same. Is it not strange that in many semi-public areas a private man can do what the public company cannot do?  That inevitably means that there is something wrong at the top &mdash; and it is not just in CIE but in other semi-State companies as well.  I believe that until such time as the people at the top of these organisations start looking at things in a businesslike way rather than in a pension-like way, we will continue to have the same stagnation that has been experienced in rural Ireland for so many years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I warn any community which is faced with the prospect of losing its railway line to protest at every possible level because CIE will tell them that they will provide an alternative bus service which will be just as good but they will fail to deliver.  I say to those people, &ldquo;Do not buy the ticket because you will not be carried on the bus&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>First, I should like to deal with some points made by Deputy Deasy.  He stated categorically that he wanted to see the railway system maintained; indeed, this point was also referred to in the course of the debate by Deputy Mitchell.  He recognises the high cost to the Exchequer and I take note of what Deputy Deasy has said in this regard.  He mentioned also the Dublin Transport Authority, as did other speakers.  I will be introducing a Bill on that subject shortly and we will be able to have a full debate on the matter.  Nobody understands better than I the whole story with regard to the Dublin Transport Authority &mdash; and Deputy Michell referred to it in the course of the debate.  I want to reject one point made by Deputy Deasy when he said the decision on the Dublin Transport Authority was based on vindictiveness.  I reject that utterly because there is no foundation whatsoever for that assertion. The decision ws taken purely on the availability or non-availability of financial resources.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate a number of Deputies supported liberalisation in the bus transport area.  The House knows very well that the legislation which deals with this goes back to 1942 and that alone indicates the need for revision of the legislation.  My Department are working on the legislation and its deficiences and we hope to be able to come to some conclusions in the very near future.</P>

It is important that he should be in the House since he has a key role to play in the successful outcome of this matter.</P>
      <P>The decision to axe Thurles Sugar Factory will deal a shattering blow to thousands of people in Thurles, Tipperary, and throughout Munster.  It will devastate the local economy which has already suffered dramatically during the past six months with the closure of St. Mary's District Hospital in Thurles, the part-closure of the Hospital of the Assumption and the axing of the only ray of hope we had, the establishment of a regional technical college which would lead to educational and industrial development. Yesterday's unanimous decision by the board of the Sugar Company has cast widespread doom and gloom.  The workforce and the community in general are totally dejected and demoralised.</P>

    <P>The concept of the Irish Sugar Company and the Thurles factory was the brainchild of a Tipperary man, M. J. Costello and it is ironic and sad that another Tipperary man should preside over the closure of this factory.  As a State enterprise the Sugar Company was established to provide an additional source of revenue for Irish farmers, to improve the national balance of payments and to provide a vital base of rural employment.  Unfortunately the present <Col N="2097" /> Minister for Agriculture and Food is allowing these noble principles to be trampled upon and set aside.</P>
    <P>There is widespread fear and concern in Thurles at the prospect of 350 permanent and part time jobs being put in jeopardy and the consequent loss of a wage bill approaching £9 million per annum to the local business people.  The decision to close the Thurles factory is impossible to understand as the plant over the years has been a profit-making enterprise.  The beet harvesting campaign at present being conducted is one of the most successful for many years.  The factory has proved its efficiency and cost effectiveness through the years.  It is a viable unit and would continue to be so if allowed to stay in existence.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons for the shock and dismay is that no one expected this type of decision in view of the categorical assurances given last February prior to the election by Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, the present Minister for Agriculture and Food, on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  It was stated that Thurles Sugar Factory would expand and develop under a Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister and his ministerial colleague from North Tipperary, Deputy Michael Smith, attracted considerable additional support on foot of those gilt-edged promises. They now have a moral duty and responsibility to live up to those commitments. The Minister's continued weakness in negotiations in Brussels has led to his failure to secure an increased sugar beet quota which would copperfasten the future of the Thurles factory. I do not say lightly that he has betrayed those who voted for him on foot of his empty promises by allowing the board of the Sugar Company to recommend closure.</P>
    <P>I read with amusement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> the Minister's statement at an agricultural conference last Sunday that he gave no assurance the Thurles factory would be kept open.  Having made that statement among a gathering of Fianna Fáil people, the Minister probably did not expect it to get back to the constituency, but there are many irate <Col N="2098" /> people in the factory who know the facts and are very disappointed that the Minister should disown his previous comments and commitments.</P>
    <P>It is important that those commitments should be underlined.  In a document circulated to all workers in the factory and their families the Minister committed Fianna Fáil in Government to establishing an enterprise centre to develop new by-products.  Nothing has been heard about it since.  Contrary to his promise to retain a 2,500 tonne defuser in the Thurles factory, this plant was transferred long ago to Mallow.  He also failed to deliver on a promise to retain sugar packaging facilities at Thurles.  The machinery was designated for Mallow a considerable time ago and all future packaging is to be shared between Carlow and Mallow. Those decisions were taken long before yesterday's decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made a commitment that natural gas would come on stream in Thurles.  This is included in the famous document I have here.  The promised natural gas was supposed to reduce manufacturing costs at the Thurles plant and make it more viable.  We have heard nothing of that either.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a guarantee that job opportunities would be increased at the Thurles Sugar Factory but the very opposite has happened.  Between May and July this year 27 permanent employees have lost jobs through disemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think I should have to put the document on the record of the House because the Minister, the people of Thurles and the people of North Tipperary are well aware of the document I am referring to.  That document, dated 9 February 1987 is in the name of Michael O'Kennedy T.D., Gortlandroe, Nenagh, County Tipperary.  I should like to quote from it because such unsustainable promises undermine the credibility of all politicians and our political system.  That document states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" /> The Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> places special emphasis on the agri-food industry.  It commits itself to &ldquo;the development of new by-products in agriculture and the strengthening of each semi-State enterprise to achieve maximum employment and added value in this sector&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Thurles Sugar factory is just such an enterprise where we will develop new by-products ...</P>
    <P>Where Government talk of closing Thurles, Fianna Fáil plan for development. The Coalition Government and the present board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann talk of closing down the Thurles sugar factory.  YOU CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT, AND WE WILL CHANGE THE BOARD.</P>
    <P>That is in black and white in the Minister's document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should admit it; resign.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The document went on:</P>
      <P>In the meantime, we will insist that the present board review their so-called &ldquo;two factory plan&rdquo;.  The decision to transfer the 2,500 tonne diffuser from Tuam to Mallow will be reviewed.  The transfer of sugar packaging from Thurles to Carlow will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Small is beautiful, as France the world leader in sugar beet production, has proved in that no less than 12 of their factories are smaller than Thurles.</P>
      <P>Thurles can be competitive like Carlow, with cheap natural gas like Carlow, with sufficient plant and equipment like Carlow ...</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The document continued:</P>
      <P>The EC have now offered sugar (with a huge rebate to processors) as a feed stock for the chemical industry. Why have the present board of the sugar company rejected this prospect? People count as much in Thurles as in Merrion Square.  We will not accept executive luxury at the cost of worker misery.  There is a huge sweetener market in Ireland, as there is in Europe.  There is a major feed stock market for the chemical industry. There is a better way.  Fianna Fáil brought the sugar factory to Thurles and Fianna Fáil will keep it there.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have heard enough from that document to accept that there was validity in my earlier comments.  I was not casting any unfair aspersions on him.  The document speaks for itself and I am glad the Minister has given me an opportunity to read it into the record.</P>
      <P>In the election campaign a DJ who was housed in a caravan in Liberty Square continuously played a tape of Michael O'Kennedy and Michael Smith wooing the voters in that constituency with promises of a better way ensuring a brighter future and the promises included the expansion and development of Thurles. In this case they hijacked the voters, based on a message of economic resurgence, renewal and expansion. Since the election there has been an air of expectation in Thurles with the people anticipating that the factory will be maintained and developed.  However, they have been let down with a bang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of statements circulating in Thurles since this decision was made I should like to make a number of comments. No matter how Fianna Fáil try to camouflage the decision, or refer to the statement that was made, the fact is that the board of the sugar company have taken a decision to close Thurles sugar factory.  That was the decision no matter how one plays around with words.  That <Col N="2104" /> decision was unanimous and any reference to the composition of the board is irrelevant now.  We have people in my area, on behalf of the Minister and Fianna Fáil, calling on Michael Lowry to save the sugar factory but the reality is that the two Ministers from North Tipperary can take an initiative on this and have the closure of Thurles deferred. They should fulfil their commitment for the expansion and development of the factory.</P>
    <P>I should like to refute the comments made that the five year plan was in existence prior to the election.  That plan came into being on 1 May 1987 and that occurred during the term of office of the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy.  Some people on behalf of Fianna Fáil, have stated that the factory is not going to close but everybody in the industry knows that the problem in Thurles this year is that included in the five year plan is a proposal that all capital investments and expenditure will be devoted to the factories in Carlow and Mallow.  Millions of pounds will be spent on improvement works, equipment and so on in those factories but a paltry £40,000 has been earmarked for the Thurles factory.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, who may say that the factory is not going to close, to say how that statement is compatible with the fact that it is being closed by stealth, is being strangled to death slowly, but surely due to a lack of investment.  The capital investment programme in the five year plan leaves out Thurles for the full five years.  In effect, the factory is closing anyway.  I call on the Minister to exercise his ministerial authority and control and request him to go to Government and ensure that the board of the Sugar Company are instructed immediately to rescind this decision.</P>

      <P>I am glad I was able to get back a short time ago from my talks in Brussels to respond to this question, and particularly to correct some of the distortions which were presented to the House by Deputy Lowry.  Deputy Lowry <Col N="2105" /> has taken it on himself to represent the unanimous view of the board yesterday as a decision to axe the Thurles sugar factory.  He presents it that way.  He also demanded that I not allow these noble principles to be repudiated and put aside. He is effectively requesting and demanding of me that I directly interfere with the activities and decisions of the board of the Sugar Company.</P>

      <P>In view of the publicity surrounding the sugar factory operations at Thurles, the Board wishes to state that it is concerned about the future viability of sugar processing in Thurles in the long-term. In the light of the consequential threat to employment caused by the potential non-viability of the plant, the Board has decided to secure an alternative industry for Thurles.  When this industry is identified the Board will then decide on the future of the Thurles factory.</P>
      <P>End of decision.  Deputy Lowry interprets that as a decision of the board to axe Thurles.  He wants to give the impression, for his own ends, that I was sacking the board despite the fact that the members were appointed by the previous Minister, Deputy Deasy.  Deputy Lowry wants to convey the impression to gloom and apprehension in Thurles but he will not succeed because I am glad to say the board, in their unanimous decision yesterday, took particular account of the employment priorities and the operations of the Sugar Company in Thurles.</P>
      <P>I want to state for the record that the plans Deputy Lowry says came into existence in my time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The number of people who applied to participate in the enterprise scheme to date in 1987 was 2,300 approximately. Of these, a total of 2,170 persons were accepted onto the scheme.  It is expected that the total number of recruitments to the scheme in 1987 will be about 2,500.</P>
      <P>In relation to 1988, when the Deputy refers to places available I assume he means admissions.  The number of admissions feasible in the context of a 1988 allocation of £7 million is 3,700 approximately. As take-up of the scheme is dependent on demand from the unemployed public, it is not possible to state exactly how many people will apply for the scheme in 1988.  However, it is expected that admissions in 1988 will exceed the 1987 figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the funding of the <Col N="2040" /> scheme in 1988 the allocation of £7 million for that year is about the same level as the forecast expenditure for 1987.</P>

      <P>Under present conditions of the social employment scheme, up to 52 weeks employment is provided for each project <Col N="2041" /> participant.  Allowing persons who have completed their term of employment on the scheme to continue participating would be unfair to a large number of eligible unemployed people who are anxious to participate and are awaiting vacancies.  It is not possible, therefore, to extend the employment of participants in the ICTU centres beyond the 52 weeks period.</P>

      <P>The rate of allowance for persons without an adult dependant on the social employment scheme was reduced from £70 to £60 for new participants from April 1987. This enabled the number of man years to be provided under the scheme to be increased by 1,000.</P>
      <P>In 1988, the budget for the SES will be £43.41 million and this will provide for 9,647 man years, which is an increase of 1,402 on the 1987 expected man years.</P>
      <P>I do not expect that the reduction in allowance will cause major problems regarding recruitment as the pool of unemployed people on unemployment assistance is sufficiently large.</P>

      <P>I have also had discussions with Vice President Martin, Commissioner for Social Affairs, Education and employment on matters of special Irish concern especially with a view to securing increased resources in the context of the review of the Community structural funds.

      <P>On Tuesday next, 1 December, I shall be attending another Council of Social Affairs Ministers which will discuss measures to combat long term unemployment, an action programme for the vocational training of young people, an action programme to help the disabled, and measures to protect the safety and health of workers in the workplace.

      <P>The social employment and Teamwork schemes administered by the NMS and the AnCO community youth training programme make a worthwhile contribution to the development of their local community.</P>
      <P>Projects undertaken which involve amenity and environmental improvement and cultural activity also improve the tourist potential of the areas concerned with resulting economic benefits for the community.  The following are examples of work undertaken by the three programmes.</P>
      <P>Under the social employment scheme the Kinsale Chamber of tourism project provided work for 19 SES participants and was instrumental in the towns win of the 1986 Tidy Towns competition.  Kinsale was also awarded third place in the European Entente Florale in 1986 and was nominated to host the presentations of prizes in September 1987.  This was an exceptional honour for Kinsale as usually the prizegiving goes to the winning town.</P>
      <P>The Sneem Development Co-op also attribute their success in the 1987 Tidy Towns competition to the social employment scheme.  Their scheme was approved for 16 workers and the work involved the care of the village greens, church and sports grounds and landscaping and tree planting around the town.</P>

    <P>The Ledwidge Cottage Committee, a sub-committee of Slane Community Council, are sponsoring an SES project. <Col N="2044" /> The SES participants act as guide-caretakers of the cottage which was the birthplace of the poet Thomas Francis Ledwidge.  Information regarding the poet and his works is provided to visitors.  The committee hope to establish the cottage as a museum which will add to the tourist attraction in the Boyne Valley, an area noted for its scenery and its prehistoric sites of international significance.  The project commenced in June 1986 and has been extended for a further year.  In August 1987 the centenary of Francis Ledwidge was celebrated.  Without the SES scheme the committee would be unable to provide a guide for the cottage.</P>
    <P>An example of a project completed under the AnCO CYTP programme is the restoration of the Italian Gardens and the ancient ruins at the Salesian Missionary College, Ballinakill, County Laois. CYPT are also building an oratorium at the Rock of Cashel sponsored by Ceoltas Ceoltoiri Éireann.  It will be used for showing old Irish plays etc.  Its aim is to further Irish culture and to attract tourists from the States and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Teamwork scheme is funding a project at the Hawk's Well Theatre, Sligo, which involves training in all aspects of theatre work.  The aim is to form a professional drama company.  The group have recently staged the world premiere of Dermot Healy's new play &ldquo;The Long Swim&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My Department in August requested all the regional directors of the National Manpower Service to place increased emphasis on tourism orientated projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of making regulations under section 4 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, is still under consideration.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received legal advice on certain aspects of the matter, but a considerable number of legal and administrative difficulties remain to be resolved.  The first problem is that, in order to apply the Act in an individual case, it would be necessary to declare the employer concerned insolvent. Obviously, this would have major implications so far as the employer's rights are concerned.  The declaration of an individual to be insolvent, even for the limited purposes of the Act, would also represent a radical departure from current practice governing insolvency procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are basic problems in relation to the definition of the types of cases which might be covered by regulations, as well <Col N="2046" /> as problems of verification of the existence of a state of insolvency in individual cases not covered by the normal legal provisions governing insolvency situations. Even where it can be established that a state of insolvency exists, there are considerable problems about devising arrangements for verifying individual entitlements of employees.  For example, employers may have ceased business or gone away and employment records may be inadequate or non-existent.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that any scheme involving the making of payments from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund would have to be soundly based, legally and administratively with adequate safeguards against abuse.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the fact that AnCO is paying £25,000 per month in rent for office premises it is no longer using, and having signed a long term lease may have to pay £300,000 per year for premises for the next 29 years; the action, if any, he proposes to take on this matter; if he will review the procedures used by AnCO and other State bodies supervised by his Department for renting office premises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the premises in Mespil Road recently vacated by AnCO staff.</P>
      <P>AnCO's policy has always been to seek the best terms available at the time of obtaining premises, taking into consideration the suitability and cost-effectiveness of the location, including its proximity to AnCO headquarters.  The only lease available in 1982 for the Mespil Road premises was for 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO have now accepted an offer, <Col N="2047" /> subject to contract, on the property and expect to complete the negotiations before the end of the year.  This will mean significant savings in overheads next year.</P>
    <P>Reducing expenditure on rent and rates is in line with my policy to cut expenditure on overheads rather than direct services to the labour force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy is to boost economic growth and employment by bringing the national finances under control. The Government recognise that additional selective measures are required to stimulate employment and these are identified and detailed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>My responsibility as Minister for Labour is to contribute to a climate conducive to economic and employment growth, including the area of industrial relations.  I am also concerned to ensure the implementation of a number of selective measures to alleviate the unemployment problem and to assist people who are unemployed to improve their employment prospects and job-skills. During 1988, employment and training programmes will provide a projected total of 34,600 man years in terms of training and temporary employment places.</P>
      <P>The main purpose behind the establishment of the new manpower authority &mdash; FÁS &mdash; is to deliver the programmes currently administered by AnCO, the Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency on a more co-ordinated, integrated and cost efficient basis as from 1 January 1988.  This will ensure the best possible service for the unemployed and will offer them ready access to the full range of employment and training opportunities open to them.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from the Irish Management Institute and I have met with the chairman and director general to discuss the position regarding the IMI's allocation for 1988.</P>
      <P>I should say that, while the 1988 allocation shows a decrease of £300,000 in Exchequer funding compared to 1987, the 1987 allocation was an exceptionally high one.  The 1987 allocation had been greatly increased over 1986 to offset European Social Fund losses and to give the IMI an opportunity to adjust to the changed situation.</P>
      <P>The question of managing with the 1988 Exchequer allocation is, of course, one for the IMI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises the <Col N="2049" /> importance of high quality management for our future development.  The contribution of management training to economic development, including funding arrangements, is under review and I have established an advisory committee for that purpose which will report to me in June 1988.  The report of the committee will provide a basis for the foundations of future policy in relation to management development.</P>

    <P>(i)  The information relating to employees from whose income tax was deducted under PAYE is necessarily somewhat restricted in coverage because all end of year returns were not capable of being processed at the time the information in the tables was being compiled.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Taxable income is that part of income on which tax is actually calculated.  It is thus the total income of taxpayers less personal reliefs and other deductions.</P>

    <P>The person concerned was examined on 24 September 1987 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in nine months.  A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.  The person concerned appealed against this decision and arrangements are being made to have <Col N="2054" /> him examined by a different medical referee on 16 December 1987.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of that examination.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 61, 62 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any one time, there are approximately 2,500 children in the care of health boards, of whom about 1,600 would be in foster care and about 900 in residential care.  Residential care is provided in over 40 homes mainly run by religious orders and charitable bodies which are funded directly by the health boards.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the collation of the detailed information sought in these questions in the form requested will take a little time.  I will communicate <Col N="2070" /> directly with the Deputy as soon as the information is available.</P>

      <P>There are eight refuges which deal specifically with the victims of family violence. The attached tabular statement gives the details requested by the Deputy in respect of these eight refuges.  I might also mention that victims of family violence are from time to time accommodated in various shelters and facilities for the homeless e.g. Bru Caoimhin and the Regina Coeli Hostel, both of which are in Dublin.  However, it is not possible to supply information in the form requested by the Deputy in respect of the latter facilities.</P>

      <P>My Department are agreeable in principle to grant-aiding the improvement and extension of facilities at the No. 2 national school, Monasterevan, County Kildare.  Efforts in that direction have so far been unsuccessful, in that a scheme of building prepared for the school proved to be too <Col N="2075" /> costly.  Efforts will be continued in consultation with the school authorities to assist them in finding a solution to their accommodation problems, and any necessary grant assistance will be made available as soon as a suitable solution is found.  While I agree that the school's present accommodation is unsuitable, I fear it is unlikely that the question of providing grant moneys will arise in the current financial year.</P>
