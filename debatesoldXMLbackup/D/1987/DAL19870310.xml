      <P>Fellow Deputies, I regard it as a very great honour indeed that I should be elected unanimously Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann this day.  I wish most sincerely to convey to all Deputies and the various parties which comprise this great assembly my profound gratitude for the confidence they have reposed in me. Moreover, I regard it as a very great privilege.  I have long since valued highly the history and the traditions of this House.  All Members can be assured of my full support to enable them to speak here and put forward their views in accordance with Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, a very great honour indeed for me especially as I have been a Member of this House for 25 years. I have occupied the position of Ceann Comhairle in the past and all Members know full well what to expect of me in respect of utter impartiality and fairness in the administration of the rules of this House.  All Members may rest assured that their rights and obligations in this House will be treasured and safeguarded by me.  I cannot fulfil my obligations without the full support and co-operation of all of you, Members of the House.  I now <Col N="17" /> seek that co-operation and I feel sure it will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In seeking to uphold the best traditions of the House I am mindful of my many illustrious predecessors.  It would be remiss of me if I did not mention in particular my immediate predecessor, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, and the invaluable contribution he made in upholding the dignity and the decorum of this House. He performed his duties as Ceann Comhairle in exemplary fashion and is worthy of the support and respect of all of us. Again, my gratitude to fellow Deputies. I shall strive very earnestly to prove worthy of the honour, the confidence and the trust you have reposed in me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I, as your immediate predecessor, be allowed congratulate you on your appointment to the exalted position of Ceann Comhairle of the 25th Dáil and to wish you a pleasant and fruitful term of office?  I am satisfied that your long experience as a parliamentarian, the respect which you have always shown for the Chair and the great dignity with which you always discharged your obligations and behaved in this House and indeed outside it qualify you in a special way for the position you now have the honour of occupying for a second time.  I wish to thank you for your kind words regarding me.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a brief appeal for co-operation with the Chair and for respect for the Chair.  I feel, and have felt for some time, that the democratic system is in some danger and in so far as this country is concerned the continued success or otherwise of the system will depend to a considerable extent on how we in this House project ourselves to the country.  That will depend in turn on how the Chair is treated and the respect that is shown for the Chair.  There should be full co-operation from all sides and sections of the House for the Chair. There should be no such thing as the &ldquo;him and us&rdquo; approach <i>vis-á-vis</i> any party in the House.  I appeal with all the sincerity I can command for that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> In conclusion I want to express my own appreciation to all the Members of the 24th Dáil who co-operated with me so well and indeed to those Members of the 24th Dáil who did not always find it possible to co-operate with me at all times.  My term in office has been challenging, interesting and the most enjoyable experience in my political life which spans in one way or another more than half a century.  Thank you very much.</P>

      <P>I move that Dáil Éireann nominates Deputy Charles J. Haughey for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach.  Molaím Cathal Seosaimh Ó hEocaidh.  In proposing Deputy Charles J. Haughey as Taoiseach I wish to emphasise that he is leader of by far the largest party in the 25th Dáil.  Fianna Fáil are the only party in a position to form a Government.  Deputy Haughey has an outstanding record of achievements in 30 years of political life.  No one else in this House can match his political experience, his leadership qualities and his practical social concern.  He was a great reforming Minister in the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Finance and Health and Social Welfare.  Few legislators have done so much for the old and the deprived.  It is the primary duty of the Dáil to give the country a Government. Ireland needs an enlightened and imaginative Government to deal with the major problems we face.  There is no one better qualified to provide that than Fianna Fáil under the leadership of Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</P>

      <P>I wish to propose Deputy O'Malley to be nominated by Dáil Éireann as Taoiseach.  First though, I wish to congratulate you on your election this afternoon to the position of Ceann Comhairle.  Unanimity is rare in this <Col N="21" /> House and is not always a good thing but a wise decision was made this afternoon. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats you will certainly have our support to ensure that the affairs of this House are conducted in an orderly and efficient manner.  We represent the people that we are honoured to come here to represent.</P>
      <P>The predominant thing that is needed in this country today is leadership.  Sadly, it has been lacking for many years.  There is a growing consensus regarding the nature of the nation's problems but unfortunately successive Irish Governments have failed to address these problems. We politicians have wrangled as the country, in James Joyce's bleak phrase, has performed a stationary march.  The problems of unemployment, Government spending and taxation have all outpaced the ability of this House to solve them.  Rarely are contributions made that address the real issues.  It is no wonder that many people feel that this House contributes more to the country's political problems than it does to solving them.</P>
      <P>There are many in this House who in recent days have attached labels to many Members of the House.  I do not wish to be a prisoner to such labels.  I do not wish to be a prisoner to anybody's naked ideology.  We want to see in this House a Government who are characterised by fairness and commonsense, one who will not pander to any sectional interest.  The Progressive Democrats sought a mandate in the recent general election to have a fair and equitable taxation system, to have a Government who would reward enterprise and initiative, who would be caring and compassionate to the needy in our society, who would eliminate the abuses by the greedy, who would reform the political institutions in this country and who would restore the image of politics by changing things like ministerial pensions.  That is why the Progressive Democrats will shortly introduce in this Dáil a Bill in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sought a mandate for new leadership. Alone of all the parties, we told the people we would not support either Deputy FitzGerald or Deputy Haughey <Col N="22" /> for the post of Taoiseach.  For many years the exercise of electing a Taoiseach has been a mere ritual, the result having been predictable from the day of the general election count.  That is not so today. There are those who feel that because the election yielded an inconclusive result we should support the nominee of the largest party.  No one in this House welcomes instability.  If this evening, this House fails to select a Taoiseach, the Progressive Democrats will be keen to see the three main parties get together to facilitate the election of a Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This business in which we are engaging is a serious business. We are not electing just any one to any particular office.  We are here this afternoon to elect a Taoiseach to preside over a Government of this country in the weeks, months and years ahead.  We are here to pick the best person.  We are here to judge each person on his merits.  The Members of this House who canvassed in the recent general election will agree that the country is crying out for new political leadership.  We sought a mandate to try to provide that condition and it would be inconsistent for us now to confine ourselves to making a choice between the nominees of the two main parties, each of whom has been in office in the position of Taoiseach on two occasions and both of whom have failed.</P>
      <P>We need a leader, Sir, acceptable to a wide cross-section of the people, a leader capable of getting a consensus, capable of uniting our people.  We need a leader who will inspire confidence and trust, who will display vision, pride and hope. We need a leader who has the qualities to be the first elected Officer of this House.  We also need a Taoiseach who has stated his intention to take tough decisions to bring about the necessary economic recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alone of all the nominees, Desmond O'Malley has shown determination to lead by example.  Just over two years ago, he refused in this House to put politics before conscience.  He cut himself off <Col N="23" /> from the path of easy advancement which rewards compliance and subservience. He refused to keep his head down and his mouth shut when the country was crying out for a new political initiative. There are many who followed that initiative, particularly young people and the vast numbers who have become tired and fed up with the existing political choices. They have given the Progressive Democrats a mandate to come into this Dáil and make changes.  We do not intend to let them down.</P>
    <P>Desmond O'Malley is firmly committed to the building of a new Republic. He displayed that commitment just over two years ago in this House when alone he stood by the Republic in one of the best speeches ever to have been made in this House, a speech that many felt was conduct unbecoming a politician.  His total condemnation of violence and his commitment to the rule of law and order was displayed as Minister for Justice when he stood up to the forces that were trying to subvert this State.  His unequivocal support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement was again evidenced in this House.  Since then he has supported it and he has done everything possible to help the process of reconciliation on this island.  He respects the rights and aspirations of both traditions in Ireland.  His lone fight for deregulation has been shown in his successful stance on the Air Transport Bill.  He has rejected fear and offered hope to so many people.  He is the kind of person who does not put political expediency before his own convictions. He is a person of enormous courage, the kind of person that Ireland needs today.  Now is the time for bravery and courage.  It is not a time to run away. No one can doubt that of all the candidates offering themselves for the position of Taoiseach today he commands widespread support around the country because of what he stands for and because of what he is prepared to do in the interests of this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first assure you, Sir, of the co-operation of the Labour Party in the discharge of your duties as Ceann Comhairle.  I wish to propose Deputy Dick Spring, Leader of the Labour Party, as Taoiseach.  The Labour Party have decided on this occasion not to support any other nominations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dick Spring, when he launched the Labour Party manifesto in the general election, said on 30 January:</P>
      <P>At various times in the past Labour has remained independent of Government. At other times it has supported or participated in Government, but at all times Labour has fought for an end to unemployment and for an end to injustices.</P>
      <P>In or out of Government, that has always been our role.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dick Spring said &mdash; and his words were prophetic &mdash; on that occasion:</P>
      <P>After the General Election we will play our part in ensuring that Dáil Éireann concentrates on the problems of unemployment and social injustices. We will also discharge, if necessary, our duty to the Irish people by playing a key role in the election of a Government. Never once since the foundation of this State has Labour failed to provide an Opposition when it was needed, or to ensure a Government when it was necessary.</P>
      <P>He concluded by saying: &ldquo;We shall not fail on this occasion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope that Dáil Éireann will not fail on this occasion.  There now devolves on this Dáil the very grave responsibility, first to elect a Taoiseach and, secondly, to decide on his nomination of the other members of the Government.  It is necessary that we should make a fresh start in Dáil Éireann, that we should produce the political leadership which the country demands of us in the national interests and, following the election of a Government, that we should proceed with a budget for 1987, long and truly overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all else, there devolves on us &mdash; and the Labour Party will play their <Col N="25" /> historic and current role in that responsibility &mdash; a responsibility to ensure the confidence of our people in this democratic parliamentary institution.  The Labour Party, therefore, were particularly proud, despite very many difficulties, to return to Dáil Éireann 12 Deputies.  There was opposition from very many vested interests &mdash; I do not propose to name them, but we all know them &mdash; who attempted to write us off. We came back and are proud to be back as a strong, experienced and vibrant Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We did resign from Government.  We were not afraid to go into Government, we were not afraid to take difficult decisions in Government and, when we disagreed on fundamental budgetary questions, we were not afraid to leave Government.  The Labour Party are proud of their role in that Government. For four successive budgets, we succeeded in defending the basic interests of working people in a harsh economic climate.  We protected jobs, in joint partnership with the Fine Gael Party in Government, in both the public and the private sectors.  Above all else, we defended the living standards of ordinary people and social welfare recipients in the face of demands from other parties for massive spending cuts throughout that period.  We are proud of that record.  The one man who led the Labour Party in achieving that record was Deputy Dick Spring.  His contribution was monumental and it will be seen when the history of that period comes to be written that it, and also the contribution of the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, were exceptional throughout that period.</P>
    <P>When one looks back on the virtual elimination of housing lists and waiting lists, when one sees the introduction of the enterprise allowance scheme, the social employment schemes and other measures to help those who are unemployed, it is obvious the work of Government was exceptional during that period. Despite great difficulty we succeeded in modernising our health services and in <Col N="26" /> bringing in very many social reforms.  Finally, in Government we succeeded in setting up &mdash; and they are there now for the incoming Government to take the work forward &mdash; the Commission on Social Welfare, the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Pensions Board.  All of that framework is there to be built on in the national interest.</P>
    <P>In our work in Government the Labour Party and Deputy Dick Spring were proud to join the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our colleagues in Government in developing and bringing to fruition the Anglo-Irish Agreement. That is a record on which we stood in the election, on which we were returned to Dáil Éireann and on which we will go forward in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>When the Government are established our approach will be entirely responsible and constructive in the framing of the 1987 budget, in the discussion on that budget, a budget which will endeavour to create more jobs, which will reform our taxation system, which will attempt to bring forward measures to develop our mixed economy of public and private enterprise, which will simultaneously reform our social services and stabilise our national debt.  Such a budget will have the support of the Labour Party in this Dáil.  We will reject any approach which would diminish the role of Government in the administration of our social services.  As a political party we will reject any approach to the privatisation of our successful State companies.  We will reject any approach which would impose hardship on those most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>These were the bench-marks from which we, the Labour Party, worked in Government.  In Opposition, we will contribute in like manner.  The House may be assured that we will discharge that responsibility to the utmost in the months and, hopefully, in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am pleased and proud to nominate Deputy Dick Spring, the Leader of the Labour Party, as Taoiseach.  I look forward to the support of other Deputies for our nomination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take pride &mdash; all the more so since this is the first time I have had the privilege of addressing this House &mdash; in seconding the nomination of Deputy Dick Spring for the position of Taoiseach. As a Labour Party we have no illusions that our nomination will be successful or that Deputy Dick Spring will be elected today.  Many outside this House regarded the mere fact that we had our own nominee as an act of cynicism.  We feel it vital that the Members of this House should be presented with real alternatives.  An option between one, two or three leaders of the centre right is not presenting this House with an alternative.  That choice would not offer a clear policy option which would influence significantly the economic policies that will determine how this country is to be managed in the months and years ahead.  It would not give rise to any new impetus to fairness or to greater equality in our society.  Furthermore, it would not create an awareness &mdash; to quote James Connolly &mdash; of the gap between what ought to be and what is and, more important, a determination to bridge that gap.  The choice between parties, policies and personalities of the centre right is merely a choice between shades of opinion.  It is a contest which serves no useful purpose for the future of this country.</P>
      <P>That is why we are placing a real alternative before this House today.  We are inviting the House to choose not just a different personality but a radically different philosophy and approach, an approach which has not been tried as yet in this country except in so far as it has succeeded in protecting key elements of our society from attack in recent years. We believe our approach is well equipped to initiate the changes and radical reforms necessary if we are to emerge in the future as a prosperous, united and, most important, an equal society. Because we believe that Labour's approach can work, we are putting it forward today in the person of the Leader of our Party, Deputy Dick Spring.  I am proud to second his nomination.</P>

Maidir leis na moltaí atá os ár gcomhair ba mhaith liom a rá go ndúramar go poiblí deich lá ó shin céard díreach a dhéanfaimís inniu.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party announced ten days ago our decision that we would not be supporting nominees for Taoiseach of any of the conservative parties, that is, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats.  I do not think the Progressive Democrats' nomination or indeed that of the Labour Party is serious. But the procedure of declaring one's intentions in good time is the best in the interest of the country.  It ends speculation and makes it clear to everyone what needs to be done to elect a Government. In such a case &mdash; when everybody's intentions are clear &mdash; those who have 90 per cent agreement between them, as has been declared, clearly can enter into dialogue to ascertain how best they can get their programme implemented.  That is what should have been happening over the past couple of weeks.  Speculation games played by the media over the past week have been of no benefit, to the left, the right or indeed to the democratic process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mandate we were given in this election was to defend the interests of workers, whether employed or unemployed, to make job creation the first priority of Government; second, to shift the burden of tax from the PAYE workers to other sectors; and, third, to ensure that there would be no cutbacks in health, education or social welfare services. If it was not clear before the election where Fianna Fáil stood on these matters, it is now very clear that they are not committed to those principles either with regard to taxation reform or cutbacks or, indeed, to what needs to be done in order to render job creation the first priority.  To do that, harsh measures must be taken, not the harsh measures spoken of by the conservative parties, but those that need to be taken against their <Col N="29" /> friends, the harsh measures that need to be taken against speculators, tax dodgers, against those who are annually shifting £1.5 billion of the wealth created by our workers out of the country.  These are the people at whom those harsh measures must be levelled.  We have seen no evidence of that.</P>
    <P>Our party's decision was based solely on the policies of the other parties.  We are not interested in the sort of personality contest which has been such an unfortunate feature of Irish political life recently and which appears to have been the main impetus in the formation of a particular new political party.  We find the prospect of a Fianna Fáil Government led by somebody like Deputy Mac-Sharry or Deputy Reynolds neither more nor less appealing than one under Deputy Haughey, and we do not believe that a Government led by Deputy Barry would be significantly more or less responsive to the needs of Irish workers and their families than one led by Deputy FitzGerald. It is a question of the policies of the parties and it is on that basis that we made our decision.  I think it is very clear where we stand.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the importance of my vote on the election of Taoiseach today.  I am also well aware of the implications and the significance of it especially for the people who are watching this event today outside the House. I have never believed in histrionics in politics.  There is nothing to be gained from such and I leave that to other people who have more practice in the art than I have.  I believe in coming to the point.  I did not delay my announcement of how I would vote today until this assembly met this afternoon.  I announced a week ago how I would be voting.  I was down this road before and my vote is an unqualified and unconditional one.  It is on the issue only and I would like the people concerned to take note of that. My vote is for the Labour Party, the largest of the left-wing groups in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talk about left-wing unity is cheap.  I have heard a lot of it in my 25 years in <Col N="30" /> politics, but I see little practice of that unity in this House or outside.  My vote today is an effort to encourage the development of real alternative parties here.  After all, the three main parties have gained 148 of the 166 seats in this assembly.  My vote is also a practical demonstration of socialist co-operation and goodwill in action.</P>
    <P>The people have voted and have clearly placed the responsibility for forming the Government on the three main parties. It is time for these parties to get away from Civil War and personality politics and get down to the business of forming an administration.  It is time for them to get away from the point scoring and petty shadowboxing that has characterised Irish politics for far too long.  In reality, there is no difference between the three parties.  There are only cosmetic differences dating back in some cases to 65 years ago, to the Civil War which is long since forgotten, and to personality problems in Fianna Fáil in more recent times. All the parties in this House, with the exception of the Labour Party and my own party, are chips off the one Sinn Féin block, and the sooner we get away from personality politics the better for all of us.</P>
    <P>Our economy is in a mess.  We have a quarter of a million people unemployed and our young people are running out of the country in their tens of thousands. We have failed to bring the full development of our people and our resources behind us as a nation.  At the same time, more than £1,000 million is being exported from our country every year in the form of profits for multinational companies and there is also the matter of repayment of our £21 billion national debt.  The enormous export of capital is draining away the very lifeblood of our people and must be tackled immediately along with all our other problems.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are importing more than £900 million worth of food, much of it vegetables.  It is time for a Government to emerge which will use taxation to force investment and productivity on an unwilling and reluctant agricultural sector in the interests of our <Col N="31" /> people.  For far too long we have created wealth and jobs inside the farm gates.  It is time to create them outside.</P>
    <P>Even though there are 18 left-wing Deputies in this House, which is a very small number, the people at large are watching us, particularly the ordinary working people.  They want us to behave in an intelligent and effective way in how we use our forces in this House, because some of us might not get a second chance &mdash; and I know a little bit about that.  We must also learn the lessons of Labour's past mistakes.  While I welcome the Labour Party's newfound socialist stance, I must say that for far too long Labour have merely been used as lobby fodder by Fine Gael.  For too long that party have acted as Fine Gael's conscience.  It is time for Labour to act as their own conscience. Labour must work with other left-wing forces in this House in the interests of the people they represent.  They must also endeavour to forge some kind of effective opposition to the powerful, wealthy, conservative forces which have ruled our society since its inception.  The Workers' Party today have made their stance known in this House.  It is not for me to tell The Workers' Party how they should behave, but I will say that I have no interest in cat and mouse games between Labour and The Workers' Party.  The people out there will not tolerate that. They put us here to act in an effective way on their behalf and not to engage in cat and mouse politics.  We have seen too much of that in the conservative forces.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to talk about left-wing unity, using all sorts of clichés. I have no interest in doing that.  The concept of unity of the left is something important that we should work for.  I am voting today for Deputy Spring, not as an individual but as the leader of the largest left-wing party in this House.  His views are consistent with my own views about an alliance and unity of the left and, therefore, I have great pleasure in supporting his nomination.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús, a Cheann <Col N="32" /> Comhairle, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat as an oifig ard atá bainte amach agat.  Tá a fhios agam go n-éireoidh that barr leat mar a éirigh leis an Cheann Comhairle deireannach a bhí againn.  Ba mhaith liom an deis a ghlacadh chun buíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle deireannach, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, as an neamhspleáchas a bhí aige i gcónaí sa Dáil deireannach.</P>
      <P>As an independent Member of the Dáil my position on the vote on nomination for Taoiseach is guided by the record of the candidates and the policies of their parties, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats.  My analysis is that all of these conservative party leaders share direct responsibility for the dreadful economic and social downfall of this country over the past decade.  While the same nominees for the position of Taoiseach are themselves insulated from and unaffected by their own harsh economic and social policies, I see at first hand every day in my own constituency the human tragedy that results, in the poverty and the unemployment, in the horror of heroin addiction and the mindlessness of crime.  There is no doubt in my mind that it is the right-wing policies of Deputies FitzGerald, O'Malley and Haughey that have made one million of our people dependent on social welfare, over 300,000 unemployed and now, sadly, we have the recurring haemorrhage of emigration.  Worse than that, it appears that their only budgetary solution is to make the poor pay for their appalling economic and social mistakes and mismanagement.</P>
      <P>Now they seek to pursue these same and even harsher policies.  I could not vote for the architects of such policies. Indeed, since the results of the general election became known the factor that has been the major influence on the course of action I will take today has been the dangerous swing to extreme right-wing politics evident in the outcome of the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was this conservative threat that prompted me almost immediately to call on the left-wing individuals and groups to form an alliance in the Dáil.  Had this <Col N="33" /> happened, while there would have been unity of the left for the first time, there would have been division and disarray among the right-wing parties, with each trying to out-manoeuvre the other.  In these circumstances, should the left have been united in the Dáil, a Fianna Fáil Government could have been, at the very least, held in check by the left and prevented from introducing the harshest of budgetary measures and, indeed, could well have been forced to improve the living standards of the more vulnerable sections of the community.  I cannot think of a more honourable role for the left in a Dáil dominated by the conservative right.</P>
    <P>Instead, regrettably, the left failed even to meet to discuss a common strategy, despite the huge responsibility they carry to defend the poor and the disadvantaged against the policy of That-cherite cutbacks.  The strategy of Labour, The Workers' Party and the Democratic Socialist Party appears to be to force the right-wing parties together into an even more extreme conservative block, where the victims yet again will be the poorest sections of society.  It is not in the interests of the unemployed or those on social welfare, either in the short term or the long term, that the right becomes stronger.  I have never believed in the cynical philosophy that things get better for the left when they got worse for the poor.  Just as I could not vote for the three right-wing nominees because of their record on policies, I could not vote for Deputy Spring because of his collaboration in the previous four years with the Fine Gael dominated Government, when even the food subsidies were taken from the poor, and unemployment reached crisis proportions.  Even then, Deputy Spring only pulled out of Government when the game was up, not on any issue of principle but out of simple and cynical expediency.</P>
    <P>I waited until today in the Dáil to state the decision I have reached, initially to allow the left to meet and discuss a common strategy.  I did nothing to preempt, or prevent the realisation of that <Col N="34" /> course of action.  Equally, I waited to allow time for the main parties to act responsibly and selflessly and honour their commitment to the electorate.  They all said the country needs stability, but they failed miserably to provide that stability. Instead, they are motivated by petty party self-interest and personality differences. They have sought to divert attention from their irresponsibility by isolating me, as if the burden of responsibility rested with me alone.  It is in this context that I have been forced to make my decision, a decision based on a practical assessment of the realities presented by a Dáil so overwhelmingly dominated by the right.  Another election would most likely drive the country further into the grip of the hard monetarist right.  No matter what the posturing, nobody here or outside wants another election.</P>
    <P>While never collaborating by participation in right-wing Governments the left must use their position to influence the Government in order to prevent the worst excesses of right-wing policies, and in doing so, work constructively in the interests of the working class.  This is the only way forward to build a credible socialist alternative which in the long term will gain the confidence of the people.  For these reasons I have taken a most difficult although necessary and correct decision, to abstain in the vote on the nomination of Deputy Haughey.</P>

      <P>I join with the other Members in extending my congratulations and good wishes to Deputy Treacy on his election to the post of Ceann Comhairle.  It is my great pleasure that Deputy Treacy should occupy the Chair at the moment, not only because he comes from a small number of us who are unattached to any major party but also because of his long experience, because he showed courtesy when in the Chair before, because of his international experience in Europe and his 25 years service in this House.  All of this ensures a good start to what seems a rather dicey situation at a time when we require a Government that will take imaginative and determined steps and if necessary spectacular decisions in order to rectify the situation in which we find ourselves as a result of the mal-administration now departing and as a result of the mal-administration going back not for ten years as indicated by Deputy Gregory, but going back 13 years and a bit.</P>
      <P>We began going down hill in 1973 with the fairly genuine excuse at the time, that the oil crisis forced us to borrow in order to run the house.  That proceeded to a point where in the following four years, even though the crisis gradually lessened, we were £6 billion odd in the red before the 1977 election.  In that unfortunate contest there was panic in the front bench of the then Fianna Fáil Party who could not read the signs that they could have stayed in bed and won the election in 1977.  With ten days to go before polling day they put the brains of the then elitist within that party, the then leader, Deputy O'Malley, Deputy O'Donoghue and I will not mention any others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They also decided that there should be no tax on cars.  That, added to the £6 billion, really set us on the down hill course with the wind at our back and we have never since recovered under any administration.  Another £6 billion debt was added to our housekeeping costs during the term of that administration, right up to 1981.  From 1981 on we have doubled it again and we now have a debt of about £24 billion. Though the interest rates keep changing, somebody said lately it is costing us £70 a second in interest on our debts created by successive administrations since 1973. We have nothing to show for it.  This would have been different had the money been borrowed for capital development and not for housekeeping and to ease things when difficult decisions had to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a scandalous record that stands as a monument to the maladministration by and the lack of determination on the part of successive Governments since 1973. Leaving aside the world depression which has been used as an excuse for our going further into the red, it has resulted in the frightening ever-growing unemployment figures that we have today.  These things have happened because of the lack of determination and the lack of real leadership in Governments during that time. Nobody can be excused in that regard. The only thing one can ask of this House is that from now on we can take a lesson from what has happened, from the unemployment figure of 250,000 and from the exodus of the tens of thousands who are beginning to drift out to all corners of the globe.  As far back as ten years ago it was predictable that the exodus could one day become equal only to that which was seen during the great famine.  We are approaching that stage today.  We should <Col N="37" /> not borrow further for housekeeping but should borrow, if necessary, for development and job creation and to do the things which are required for the future.</P>
    <P>If our young population are to stay here, jobs alone will not keep them though we do not have the jobs yet for them.  Unless there are provided such services as housing, roads, water and sewerage &mdash; even if we might have the jobs in the future &mdash; our young people will not stay and why should they?  They will go to places where all these things are available as of right.  These, then, are the areas that any Government who would rear their heads to try to lead us out of the mess we are now in should concentrate on.  They must take their decisions regardless of how narrow their majority may be or of whether they are actually a minority.  They must take those decisions seriously, without favour to any section and as and when the dictates of the benefits of this country so require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fought this election with a very small party, and I have a party as some of you may well know.  In that election, as I have done in the last four elections, on the economic side I pointed out in our literature and manifestoes, of which we have printed several during the years, that in 1977 unemployment was 70,000 which I regarded then as a scandal, that it is now 250,000 and still rising with the outlet valve open for emigration again.  As has been said, probably the true figure for comparative purposes would be 300,000 at present.  From 1977 to 1981, and twice in 1982 I called for determined efforts from incoming Governments <Col N="38" /> whoever they may have been to invest in the future.  Now in a worsening situation I am making that call again to the incoming Government.  We must believe in the future of this country.  Above all, we must believe in the huge percentage of young people among our population &mdash; the under 25s or the under 30s, whichever you wish.</P>
      <P>The construction industry is the one outlet that can be put into operation overnight. I can hear the cynics ask where is the money to come from?  The money for that purpose could be raised and would be good value because it could put anywhere up to 60,000 of our unemployed construction workers back to work.  Some people seem to think that we have too many houses, that the position is similar to that of 1957 or 1959.  That is not the case.  For some considerable time 300 housing contracts from my own county have been resting in the Department awaiting sanction.  We have a five-year waiting list for people who are just as badly off as those already approved.  That is just my own county and counties elsewhere differ very little in that respect.</P>
      <P>There is scope and there is the need. Idle hands are being paid money at present.  Taking into account administration costs, those construction workers are costing more than what would be their gross wages after tax.  As I have said on several occasions, not only during elections but in this House, it is daft to pay people for doing nothing at a cost as great as you would pay them net if they were doing some useful work. That useful work lies not just in housing but in the breakdown of our roads system which was predicted by me ten years ago also.  It has broken down because of the fact that no money has been spent on maintenance for a considerable number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A silly decision was taken to take the surface men off, the men who were fair game for a skit, those with their barrows, hooks, brushes and shovels, whom people thought it was all right to laugh at.  But these were the men who kept the water tables clean, the briars and the hedges cut and the holes filled in.  When <Col N="39" /> there was a splash of rain he knew where the flooding would take place and would relieve it even if that meant going out in the middle of the night.  In my county we had 1,500 of those men.  Today we have 280 while our roads are becoming impassable. There is a similar story in every county.  Surely nobody can say we can stand back and allow our roads to deteriorate and become impassable.  Surely something vital must be done if we are to keep our heads above water.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications, despite all the money that has been put into that area, are still far from satisfactory although improved.  We hope they will be perfected in the not too distant future.  There are tens of thousands in this country in whose homes there are no sewerage facilities.  There are thousands who have no water facilities.  We are short schools to the extent that a blot on our landscape in every county in the motley collection of prefabs, some of which have been standing so long that they are now falling down.  Building plans and contracts have been held up while our kids and our teachers are suffering in bad conditions to provide what all of us agree must be provided, education for our young people for the future.</P>
    <P>These things must be done.  We have the hands to do them but we are spending more paying people to do nothing than it would cost to pay them to do this work. If we have to borrow, borrow for those things but cut out fast the borrowing of housekeeping money that has been to our detriment during the past 13 years.  Our fisheries have only been crawling along despite massive increases.  Fish processing is still in its infancy.  In fact, we are providing 0.7 of a job onshore in processing fish against every individual fisherman who is full time at sea whereas in the EC the comparative figure for every full time fisherman employed is seven employed onshore processing fish.</P>
    <P>We have 5,000 fishing full time in this country and we are only employing 0.7 of those onshore.  We could multiply that figure by ten, or halve it and call it five, and provide between 20,000 and 25,000 <Col N="40" /> jobs in that industry.  If you think we do not have the supplies let us do what the Bulgarians have been doing during the years: let us put the factory ships on the water and follow the shoals as they do and not stand, as I have done, watching 15 to 30 of them operating off the Donegal coast year in and year out.  That continues to happen.  We can do these things but we must take our courage in our hands.  Timber is one commodity which will pay off very well but not if it is sold when it is half grown, as this Government have done and are doing, exporting it at the lowest possible value, giving as an excuse that it is sold in this condition to raise money to plant more trees.  I do not know anything more daft that the present Administration did than that.</P>

      <P>I campaigned specifically against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Act dealing with extradition which we passed, but which is not yet in operation, and section 31 which is one of the daft things for which we are all responsible, and not just the last Administration who might be credited with other daft things.  Section 31 is too daft to talk about here.  I also campaigned on the basis that I am not to be taken for granted by any party on any issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that with the inconclusive result of the last general election we have the worst possible situation which could <Col N="41" /> have been envisaged so far as the future well being of this nation is concerned.  It is believed that the last thing anybody wants is another election.  It is my opinion that we are rather introverted so far as this is concerned because 90 per cent of all those to whom we have been speaking about these matters have been working on our behalf and they see things as they affect themselves.  They say nobody wants another election but I do not believe the public at large give two hoots whether there is an election next week, next month or next year.  All they are concerned about is that we get a Government to govern, a Government who are not afraid to take the right decisions.</P>
    <P>On the national issues, I have mentioned extradition, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and section 31.  I have no belief in those who forced the Anglo-Irish Agreement through this House. How could I?  My only hope that these trends will be reversed is if the Fianna Fáil Party form a Government.  We are left with Deputy Gregory abstaining and if the counting is right &mdash; I have been counting the Deputies on the Government side and they are one short; Fianna Fáil are there in strength&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we had known for sure on the night of the elections that there would be a deadlock &mdash; although that was clear to me when only half the returns were in &mdash; it would have made my task of how I was going to vote this evening a lot easier.</P>

Anything would be preferable to a PD-influenced Government, whether it be the far left, the middle right or the middle ground, which is now Fianna Fáil.  This new entity is frightening because they have grasped this opportunity, departed from their roots and set up a new party.  He could not be captain of the team so he formed a team of his own.</P>

      <P>Do you believe in God?  I thought it was only in the PD leadership you believed.  Let me conclude on a note which I have no doubt will be as dear to the Chair as it is to me.  My support will go to the only party which can form a Government and who &mdash; I want to put <Col N="43" /> it on record &mdash; I am satisfied will not recognise the article in the Anglo-Irish Agreement which gives the British the right to be in our country; and No. 2, that the Extradition Act, which is ready to be put into operation when certain things happen, will go out the window as far as the UK and the Six Counties administrations are concerned.  In the meantime, and urgently, the newly interpreted extradition laws we recognise between here and the Six Counties and the UK should be repealed so that in the interim a young county man of mine, by name McIntyre, who is in custody awaiting an appeal to the Supreme Court against extradition be not extradited under the present interpretation as handed down from the Supreme Court or now being practised under existing law.  Those matters are of fundamental importance to me and to all who hold republican traditions in any sort of favour at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, and in order to avoid the possibility of the far right getting their hands on any party to <Col N="44" /> manipulate a Government in the future, I will support the new administration. I will support it on the condition that measures beneficial to the construction industry, the fishing industry, the forestry industry and in job creation will be implemented speedily and that the differential in taxes which is destroying our Border counties will be reduced on petrol, liquor and beer before it swamps the entire country.  I am putting it to the House that the only possible place to get that return is from the Fianna Fáil Party. On that basis, on conditions laid down by me, no deals done by anybody, I will vote for Deputy Charles Haughey and hope he becomes the Taoiseach to avoid all the things I have said about the right, far right and otherwise.  I hope he does the things that need to be done in order to save our country, our economy, our people and our future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is here an equality of votes.  Pursuant to Article 15.11.2º of the Constitution I have a casting vote and I am required by the Constitution to exercise that vote.  I exercise it, therefore, for the question and I declare the question carried that Deputy Charles J. Haughey be nominated as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to offer my congratulations and good wishes to Deputy Haughey on his election as Taoiseach. That election was secured, it is true by a very narrow margin, the narrowest of margins.  Deputy Haughey will be aware that there exists in this House a clear and decisive majority in favour of decisive action in the economic sphere.  I refer to the action necessary to create conditions favouring increased employment and a lasting cut in the tax burden achieved by means which do not add further to the share of public revenue preempted by interest payments which, indeed, it would be desirable to reduce as soon as possible.  The action necessary to achieve these objectives will in present circumstances necessarily involve decisions that will not find favour with sections of the community.  The new Government will require the necessary support in this House to carry them through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the incoming Government introduce budgetary measures which correspond to the objectives which I have just mentioned &mdash; and I have deliberately avoided being more specific recognising that the Government must take their own decision on the details of the policies required for this purpose &mdash; my party will not oppose such measures or legislative action required to implement the necessary budgetary provisions.  It is important that the Dáil and public opinion generally <Col N="51" /> understand that this is the situation.  It is important that the narrowness of the margin by which Deputy Haughey was elected should give rise to no doubts as to the possibility of the new Government in this Dáil as at present constituted taking the steps that have become necessary in the national interest because it was the unforeseen and indeed the unforeseeable events that have so aggravated our public finances since the preparation by the outgoing Government of the national plan in 1984.</P>
    <P>Finally, this party will offer full support to Deputy Haughey in the further implementation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the full fruits of which can be secured only over time and through the continuance of the common sense of purpose which has animated both the Irish and British Governments in negotiating and signing this agreement and in its implementation to date.  Were the continued and further implementation of the agreement to be put at risk in any way my party, and I believe Dáil Eireann as a whole, would react very sharply.  I believe and I hope that we shall have no occasion to face such a problem and that Deputy Haughey will actively pursue the further implementation of the agreement with the aim of securing peace and stability in Northern Ireland and indeed in Ireland as a whole.  I conclude by renewing my good wishes to Deputy Haughey in the very difficult task he is now undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa mo fhíor bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Dáil as ucht mé a ainmniú mar Thaoiseach.  I want to express my very deep gratitude and appreciation to Dáil Éireann for having conferred upon me the honour of electing me as Taoiseach.  May I also, a Cheann Comhairle, offer you my congratulations on your election and join with all the other Deputies in the House who have promised you their full support and co-operation in the discharge of your onerous duties.  I want also to express my appreciation to Deputy FitzGerald for his offer of support in decisions that he <Col N="52" /> feels will be necessary and that will merit his support.  I am grateful for that attitude on the part of Deputy FitzGerald and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the efforts made by the outgoing Taoiseach to deal with the problems which confronted him and his Government.  I believe that those problems were perhaps unprecedented in their severity during the course of the past four years.  We did not always agree on the methods or the approaches of the Government in dealing with those problems but the Taoiseach and his colleagues approached them as they saw best and in the best interests of the country.  I hope that I and my colleagues will do the same with the problems which confront us.</P>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it is necessary now that I should go and inform the President of my nomination so that he may appoint me.  Accordingly, I suggest that the Dáil now adjourn until 7.30 p.m. this evening.</P>

    <P>Department of Labour to Bertie Ahern;</P>
    <P>

    <P>Department of Defence to Michael J. Noonan;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>Department of Education to Mary O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>I also propose to nominate Deputy Vincent Brady for appointment by the Government as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>I propose to nominate John Murray, SC for appointment by the President to be the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I have allocated the members of the Government to Departments on the basis of existing divisions of responsibility. There are, however, substantial changes which I propose to make in departmental responsibilities and organisation.</P>
    <P>The Government will concentrate our main effort on areas of the economy with particular development potential, within a framework of consistent fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies that will create an economic climate conducive to confidence and enterprise.</P>
    <P>To that end, I am proposing some reorganisation of the Departments of the Government so as to focus political attention on, and give greater political impetus to, vital sectors where wealth and employment can be most readily created. The changes are designed to make the Government's management of the economy more effective and responsive to today's needs and opportunities.  I hope they will recommend themselves to the House in that light.</P>
    <P>I see marine resources and tourism as requiring specific and more concentrated governmental attention.  The great wealth and employment potential of these sectors is, I am sure, recognised by all.  I, therefore, propose to establish two new Departments, a Department of the Marine and a Department of Tourism <Col N="56" /> and Transport and to expand the Department of Agriculture to become the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>For administrative convenience, the Department of the Marine will formally replace the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and will contain the functions of a number of existing Departments which relate to the sea and maritime affairs.  The Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry will become the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>The new Department of Tourism and Transport will combine the tourism functions of the existing Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry with the transport functions of the Department of Communications.  Transport must be managed and developed in future as an essential element of a dynamic tourism policy and, in particular, access costs to this island must become more competitive if we are to recover the ground we have lost in recent years in the growth of international tourism.  The Minister for Communications will become the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <P>The non-transport functions of the Department of Communications will, under the new arrangements, be allocated to the Minister for Energy.  A Minister of State will be appointed with responsibility for the Department.</P>
    <P>To form the new Department of Tourism and Transport, the statutory shell left by the Department of the Public Service will be used.  The outgoing administration merged the ministerial responsibility for the Department of the Public Service with the Department of Finance.  The merging of the two Departments is, in my view, desirable in the interests of better co-ordination of pay and staffing matters with budgetary requirements and of better utilisation of highly-qualified staffing resources.</P>
    <P>In order to give greater thrust to certain development areas, I intend to create Offices attached to a number of Departments. Each of these Offices will be under the direct control of a Minister of State.  A headline for these kind of Offices already exists in the Office of <Col N="57" /> Public Works and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which are attached to the Department of Finance, but which exercise separately their own distinct functions and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>These offices will have responsibility for certain key sectors of development and relevant ministerial powers will be delegated to the Minister in charge of each Office.</P>
    <P>We will also examine, within the framework of recent developments in the organisation of Civil Service work, how the administrative efficiency of these Offices can be further enhanced in relation to their main Departments so that they can function with the speed, effectiveness and independence of a mini-Department of State.</P>
    <P>The new Offices will be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Office of Science and Technology (attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce).</P>
    <P>The Office of the Food Industry (attached to the Department of Agriculture).</P>
    <P>The Office of Horticulture (attached to the Department of Agriculture).</P>
    <P>The Office of Forestry (attached to the Department of Energy).</P>
    <P>The Office of Trade and Marketing (attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce).</P>
    <P>I will recommend that the Government appoint the following Deputies as Ministers of State and assign the Offices to them as follows:</P>
    <P>Forestry, Michael Smith; Food Industry, Joe Walsh; Trade and Marketing, Séamus Brennan; Science and Technology, Seán McCarthy; Horticulture, Séamus Kirk.</P>
    <P>I will inform the Dáil of these appointments when they are made and also of the appointments of other Ministers of State when they are made by the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on these Offices and on the contribution they <Col N="58" /> can make to foster economic and employment growth.  Science and technology, allied to the investment we decided to make at the end of the 1970s in telecommunications, has opened up a whole new area of opportunity for this country. By establishing an Office for Science and Technology, we intend to upgrade the importance of this whole area for national recovery, and create a high-technology, high-income economy.</P>
    <P>By establishing an Office of the Food Industry, attached to the Department of Agriculture, we are giving high priority to the objective of creating a food-processing industry of larger international importance, greater diversity and higher value added.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is a labour-intensive sector with, at present, an unnecessary level of imports.  The function of the new Office will be to bring about a better organised commercial horticulture industry that will increase its share of the home market and develop, in time, substantial exports.</P>
    <P>The better development and management of our forests and timber offer us great opportunities in import substitution and, in a Community short of timber, ultimately growing exports.  It is proposed to transfer the forestry functions of the Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, to the Department of Energy, to which the new Office will be attached, with the mandate to develop potential through a new, more commercial approach.</P>
    <P>Our standard of living will ultimately depend on our capacity to market our goods and services abroad.  I am not satisfied that we have devoted enough attention and resources, in our development policies, to stimulating trade and marketing. I see the new Office of Trade and Marketing as one likely, therefore, to contribute very greatly to the growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>This concept of Offices is one which we will consider extending to other areas as we gain experience of the operation of the Offices now being established.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention my <Col N="59" /> view about the need for greater co-ordination of Government activities and programmes with special reference to EC affairs where constant and effective co-ordination is vital.  The outgoing administration took certain preliminary steps towards better co-ordination of departmental activities by the giving to a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach the general task of ensuring better co-ordination and more speedy advancement of Government business.  I propose to continue that arrangement, but I also envisage such a Minister of State being specially concerned with the co-ordination of our EC business through the work of the ministerial committee dealing with EC affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like on behalf of my party, to congratulate the people who have been appointed to the various posts and to wish them well in their work.  We on this side of the House have no doubt whatever about the burdens they are taking on and the problems they will face.  We respect the Taoiseach's decision on the allocation of functions and hope that the individuals, some of whom have experience already in particular Departments, will be successful in the task they have to undertake.</P>
      <P>The other arrangements which have been mentioned by the Taoiseach are ones which represent a development of certain steps which I took in Government in terms of allocating specific functions and delegating them formally in the particular areas to Ministers of State. Indeed, in several instances there is no change in what we have already done in terms of the food area and also in terms of forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other proposed specific areas of trade and marketing, science and technology and horitculture are more experimental and we will have to judge in due course whether the earmarking of these areas for special attention under the auspices of Ministers of State is successful or not.  We should not attempt to prejudge the issue.  In some instances some problems will arise out of crossing of lines between <Col N="60" /> the functions of different Departments but any restructuring carries that risk and I do not think we should do anything to discourage experimentation; we ourselves have experimented along these lines and I am glad to see that in general that trend is being continued.</P>
    <P>We did, in our election document, make the point that we thought that it was not necessary to fill all the posts of Ministers of State that the law now allows.  In the early days of the State they were quite few in number.  The number gradually rose to seven, to ten and to 15.  In terms of the areas which can be identified &mdash; the Taoiseach has identified some already &mdash; where it is possible to delegate the functions fairly fully, the number of such areas is not as great as 15.  I notice the Taoiseach has announced five such appointments and he said there will be others.  I suggest that he reflect before using up all the 15 posts unless genuine delegation can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In regard to the co-ordination of departmental activities, I am glad the experiment we undertook with great success is being maintained.  We found that the need to co-ordinate Government work needs attention.  The only thing that would concern me about the Taoiseach's proposal is the combination of that work of co-ordination, of speedy advancement of Government business, with co-ordination of EC business through the work of the ministerial committee dealing with EC affairs.  I recognise that the overall burden of work involved in the area of Foreign Affairs &mdash; of EC affairs, Northern Ireland affairs and general foreign affairs &mdash; is very great.  Nonetheless I have some doubt about an arrangement which would separate EC business from other aspects of foreign affairs, given the increasingly close relationship between political co-operation and Community affairs which makes that kind of division difficult.  I contemplated attempting such a division within Foreign Affairs &mdash; two Ministers dealing with different aspects &mdash; but there were technical and constitutional difficulties in what I proposed so I did not proceed with it.  What is proposed here is to take this area out <Col N="61" /> of Foreign Affairs into the Taoiseach's Department.  I have some hesitation about that but the Taoiseach must make his own decisions and we will have to see how it will work out.</P>
    <P>I want to be constructive in relation to the problems that will confront the Government.  It is appropriate on an occasion like this to be so.  The problems we faced as a Government were aggravated by two major factors.  One was the shortfall in revenue which occurred in the past few years, particularly since 1984, through lack of growth and through unexpectedly low inflation rates.  Inflation fell faster than expected while commitments were entered into on the assumption of higher inflation rates.  There was also an exceptionally big drop in non-tax revenue by comparison with what we had expected.  Those problems of shortfall of revenue account for the whole of our difficulties in attaining our target to reduce the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>At the same time we faced very high rates associated with a combination of high domestic borrowing and problems posed by the fall in the dollar and sterling rates placing a strain on our relations with the EMS.  But for those two sets of problems occurring we would have got down to a level of borrowing of 8½ per cent of GNP in 1987 and that would have put us in a situation where the level of interest charges, all things being equal, would have tended to diminish as a proportion of taxation rather than to rise as it had done hitherto.  They are the problems that put us off course.</P>
    <P>The incoming Government will also face those problems but they may benefit from some improvement in some respects.  They may benefit from lower interest rates: there are early indications of that.  This will be especially true if Britain joins the EMS after the British general election.  It is also possible that the Government may be luckier than we were in terms of economic growth but in our circumstances I am very sceptical of the capacity of a Government in a country like ours to generate economic growth that would not otherwise have occurred, except in the long term through operating <Col N="62" /> wise policies which have a generally beneficent effect on the atmosphere for enterprise in the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>We cannot create growth from nothing.  While I do not wish to be controversial, the Government when in opposition during the election campaign seemed to suggest that growth could be created at 3½ per cent per annum with the wave of a wand.  The Government might be fortunate in experiencing a higher growth rate than we did but it will not happen automatically and the amount the Government can do in our open economy to contribute to it, especially with the constraints in spending, is extremely limited. Even in favourable circumstances, even if the Government are fortunate in terms of growth and lower interest rates, they will still face very grave problems in terms of the control of spending.  Even in favourable circumstances they will have to ensure, if they are to get borrowing down to the necessary level and prevent the vicious circle of the increasing burden of interest payments <i>vis-à-vis</i> taxation, that public spending is held at its present level.  Some areas of spending, such as education must rise for demographic reasons and if we are to maintain the overall level of spending, some other areas must fall.  Even in favourable economic conditions the Government cannot avoid that dilemma.  It is in tackling that problem that they will require and will receive the support of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance the Government should attach to the European Community.  We are at a point now where we have continuing problems deriving from the pressures on the CAP. These problems require very skilful handling in order to minimise the impact on agriculture here.  We have been remarkably successful in minimising the impact of these policies but problems still exist and the pressures will continue.  The new Government will face the problems we faced in trying to ensure that they do not have an unduly adverse effect on our hard pressed farm sector.  At the same time, there are exceptional opportunities which are perhaps not fully appreciated in terms of the Commission's proposals in relation <Col N="63" /> to cohesion, for expansion of the total resources of the Community and through the diversion of these resources into the structural funds and in proposals for doubling structural funds in a manner directed towards benefiting particularly countries like ours on the periphery of the Community.  These proposals the Government will not have difficulty in supporting.  They will have some difficulty, however, in securing their implementation because undoubtedly there will be a strong backlash against them from some member states more concerned with limiting the amount of spending by the Community than with developing the Community and its operations in a constructive way.  Major effort will be required to ensure that the extremely favourable Commission proposals will come into effect.  The Government should give maximum attention to that.  Whether that is best done by associating it with the work of the Taoiseach's Department or through the Department of Foreign Affairs is a matter for the Government.  Let no one doubt that the possibilities here are very great indeed.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps not widely appreciated that in this whole area much depends on the goodwill of other Governments as well as on skill and diplomacy on our part.  One factor which has created great goodwill towards us in Europe and in the US is the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The degree of interest in and commitment to that agreement in Europe and the degree of interest in the US where the investment of political effort into that area by leaders of Congress as well as by the President is so great that it means the agreement has an importance which transcends these islands.  It will be important for this Government to clearly establish their commitment to the agreement not merely for the purposes of achieving results within this island, particularly in Northern Ireland, but to maintain the goodwill which exists towards us in Europe and the US.  That is ancillary to the agreement which is of vital importance to peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  Its potential is enormous, given <Col N="64" /> adequate attention and support.  Efforts invested here can yield real results within a couple of years.  I hope and believe the Government will understand and appreciate that and will in their approach secure the benefits which can come from the work which has been put in there.</P>
    <P>For my own part and indeed so far as this party are concerned, I can say that we will do our best to help in all these areas.  If given the material to work with we will certainly endeavour to be supportive of the Government's efforts be they in Europe, the United States or Great Britain.  I have to say that during the last couple of months, recognising the possibility of a change of Government, with the election which was bound to come early this year, I endeavoured where possible where the matter arose to convey to other Governments that if there were a change of Government it would not mean any lessening of the commitment to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I will certainly continue to propound that view so long as the evidence justifies it as I believe and hope it will.</P>
    <P>With those general remarks I simply want to wish the new Government well. I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his remarks in response to what I said following his election and to thank him for his recognition of the exceptional problems our Government faced and the fact that we endeavoured to tackle them responsibly although necessarily at times in a manner different from that which his party would have adopted.  I am grateful for the courtesy of his remarks and I hope that the contructive spirit in which this Dáil has begun will be maintained.  It is vital that it be so.  None of us is or need to be in doubt about the gravity of the problems facing us or about the fact that they can only be overcome by an effort of political will involving a commitment and a degree of united effort on the part of all of us in politics which is outside the normal framework of what has in the past been secured or what has seemed possible to secure given the adversarial character of our parliamentary system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> I know it is going to be difficult for all of us.  We are going to find it difficult at times to offer the degree of support which will be necessary for the Government to carry out their functions effectively and to overcome the great problems that face us and to take on the vested interests which are strangling this country.  It will not be easy for an Opposition to support some of the measures the Government will have to take.  Yet we will do so.  It will not be easy for the Government to take these steps but they must do so.  It will not be easy for this House to operate in such a way as to secure, on the one hand, the benefits of the degree of unity required to tackle the problems of the scale which now face us and, on the other hand, to maintain the distance there should be between Government and Opposition and to continue to carry out the constructive role of Opposition in questioning the Government's actions, scrutinising them and of keeping the Government up to the mark in the way in which every Opposition have to do.</P>
    <P>The manner in which this Dáil will have to carry on their affairs will be different from any previous one.  That is going to require, on our part certainly, a degree of goodwill and constructiveness in Opposition greater than any of us in Opposition have previously found it possible to accord and, on the part of the Government, necessarily a corresponding response in terms of a willingness to be open with the Opposition and the House and to seek and rely on our support when things need to be done for the sake of our country.  I will not say more than that now but I do want to emphasise how crucial this Dáil will be for the sake of our people and the sense of responsibility I feel and my party feel to play our part constructively.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like at this stage to congratulate you publicly as others have done, and as I have done privately, on your election and to assure you of our good intentions in regard to acting in an orderly manner in this House.  I say &ldquo;good intentions&rdquo; because from time to time all of us fall short of our best intentions.  I am sure <Col N="66" /> there will be moments occasionally, every few months, when you will have to correct somebody who is out of order but we will do our best to assist you and when you call us to order to respond in the way in which we should if this House is to carry on its affairs in a dignified way.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to take the opportunity of offering on my own behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats our congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the Chair and to wish you well for the currency of the 25th Dáil, however long that will be.</P>
      <P>Next, I would like to offer my congratulations to Deputy Haughey on his election as Taoiseach and to wish him well both for his sake personally and for the sake of the country because of the Office he now holds which is the most onerous in this country.  He is holding this Office at a time which has few parallels in terms of difficulties that the country faces at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is on the appointment of members of the Government and I have <Col N="67" /> before me a list which, to put it mildly, does not contain any surprise, or anything terribly imaginative, new or radical.  It looks to me as a recipe for a lot of the same again.  In many respects that is a pity.  I am not just talking about personnel, I am also talking about some of the ways proposed to tackle some of the problems and some of the changes which are proposed, some additional agencies of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The great disappointment in many respects is that it is only additional agencies. A country which is absolutely weighed down with agencies, bureaucracies and offices of one kind or another is to have additional ones rather than fewer.  It is, for example, disappointing to find that the Department of the Public Service is now to disappear in a nominal way.  It will no longer have a separate Minister and will once more be a minor adjunct, as it was in the past, of the Department of Finance.  The only time in my experience that any worthwhile progress was made in regard to reform of the public service was when Deputy Boland was Minister for that Department and for no other for a period of some years.  It is not possible for a Minister for Finance, particularly at a time like this, to devote the sort of time that is needed to the reorganisation of the public service.</P>
    <P>Our public service is enormous.  It is extremely costly.  It is full of people of excellent calibre but it is not particularly effective given the structures under which it has to continue to operate and which have long since gone out of date.  In relation to the very limited amount of reorganisation that is taking place I welcome particularly one aspect of that reorganisation, that is the merging of the tourism and transport functions, functions which have been together for many years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that:</P>
    <P>Transport must be managed and developed in future as an essential element of a dynamic tourism policy <Col N="68" /> and, in particular, access costs to this island must become more competitive if we are to recover the ground we have lost in recent years in the growth of international tourism.</P>
    <P>I fought a lone battle on that point in 1984.  I challenged a number of divisions on what was essentially that point but the divisions never took place because the count was one in favour and everybody else against.  It is remarkable that within a two year period what I was then derided for has now become the official policy of the Government and of such importance that it is set out in the initial short speech of the Taoiseach on the appointment of the Government.  It is surprising what can be achieved by someone who insists on fighting his corner in this respect.</P>
    <P>In relation to the five Ministers of State &mdash; I suppose a consolation list &mdash; announced tonight, I would have thought no more than two further appointments would be necessary, but I am sure many more appointments will be made.  In some respects it is a pity that areas such as the food industry, trade and marketing and science and technology which are of enormous importance and which the Taoiseach is right to recognise in a specific way, will be operated by Ministers of State rather than by members of the Cabinet.  I hope that will not have the effect of downgrading them in the sense that agencies of different kinds which are run by Ministers of State tend to get overlooked if members of the Cabinet are not involved.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity to speak in the earlier debate today and it is appropriate that I refer to some of the things said.  We had an avalanche of the new terminology which has been in use in this country in the past few months &mdash; references to the three right wing parties and, particularly, references to what Deputy Blaney and others described as the far right.  This amuses me because if some of the things we as a party are talking about and in respect of which we got an exceptional response in the recent general election, are to be described as right wing in the pejorative manner in <Col N="69" /> which people use that phrase in Ireland at present, then nearly everything the late Seán Lemass did in his time as Taoiseach, and in part of his time as Minister for Industry and Commerce, could be described as being of the far right.  If to encourage enterprise is to be regarded as of the far right, then those using that terminology are rather wide of the mark. If to do what some of the leading socialists in Europe are endeavouring to do in their own countries is to be described as of the far right, it shows how foolish political terminology in this country has become.</P>
    <P>At the core of our problems is the excessive appetite which has been generated in this country for public expenditure. Last year 68 per cent of our gross national product was consumed by the State in one form or another, a percentage which is way beyond anything in western Europe, a percentage which is way beyond the figure in Britain, France, Spain and various other countries.  Nonetheless, people like Fabius, who up to recently was the socialist Prime Minister of France and Gonzales, at present Prime Minister of Spain, find it necessary to take steps that they regard as of commonsense in their efforts to curb the level of public expenditure in their respective countries.  If they regard that as a matter of commonsense, why is it a matter of ideology for us to want to curb our level of public expenditure when it far exceeds that of any country in western Europe? Why is it regarded as right wing and ideological to want to curb public expenditure in this way in order that we might achieve a situation where this country will no longer have the highest level of direct and indirect taxation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I look at the Government proposed here tonight I wonder if they are prepared to make the radical changes needed for us to face with reality and with some likelihood of success the situation we are in.  In this week's <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> certain figures are given for this country compared with others.  It is no harm to quote these very briefly in order to put our position in some perspective and ask ourselves whether a continuation of what we have had over the years will solve those difficulties.  Our <i>per capita</i> debt is US$8,000 per head of the population.  The corresponding figure in Britain, which is not a successful economy by any standards, is US$330 and the corresponding figure in the United States is US$127.  Yet, we seek to act as if we were a country in their type of league and as if we were entitled to the level of service which they have.  Our national debt is 133 per cent of our GNP while the coresponding figures in Britain and the United States are 43 per cent and 39 per <Col N="71" /> cent respectively.  That is an enormous burden for us and no economic debate here can be meaningful unless it takes into account the effect of those matters. Of our 3.5 million people, as that journal points out one-third of them, one of the highest proportion in any developed country in the world, are on welfare.  Our problems will not be solved until we get many of those people off welfare and into employment.  Our problems will not be solved until we approach matters in that way.</P>
    <P>I heard with some trepidation today the speech of Deputy Blaney in relation to Northern Ireland.  I was not particularly concerned about or impressed by his various other references but I was rather amused to find that the reason he gave for justifying his vote on the motion for Taoiseach was his fear of the Progressive Democrats.  I thought that was stretching it a bit but at least it gave him some reason to do what he wanted to do. I listened with some concern to what he had to say about Northern Ireland.  I should like to say to the Government in relation to that and some economic matters that that conditional support given to the Taoiseach today is the type of support on which he, as I am sure he knows as well as I do, would be very unwise to rely.  I can give the Taoiseach, the Government and the House an assurance that they need not rely on Deputy Blaney's support on matters such as that because they can look elsewhere.  In regard to Northern Ireland they will have plenty of support in the House for a reasonable course of action.  I would define a &ldquo;reasonable course of action&rdquo; in many respects as being the direct opposite of what Deputy Blaney suggests or recommends.</P>
    <P>The same is true so far as economic matters are concerned.  The Progressive Democrats will not seek to defeat or bring down the Government on specific policy issues where we judge the Government are trying to do the right thing.  We will encourage and support them either by voting with them or by not voting against them as appropriate in such cases. <Col N="72" /> Although I have reservations about some members of the Government and I have reservations about the way portfolios and Departments have been distributed, I am prepared to give the Government &mdash; a Government who have been elected by the narrowest possible majority in the House, the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; as and from tonight the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>No matter how narrowly they are here, by the closest possible margin, they are at least a Government.  Some of us were concerned for some weeks past that we might not have a Government and in giving them the benefit of the doubt the Progressive Democrats are prepared to start that from tonight.  We will not oppose the appointment of the members of the Government, although we have reservations about some of the personnel and the way some of the Departments have been distributed.  We are in a most difficult period.  Minor variations on the policies pursued here in recent years will not come to grips with or solve the difficulties of the nation.  There should be a much greater anxiety for change within the House than is reflected here or in the personnel of the Government.  It is only a willingness to accept that change, to see the necessity for it and to put it into practice that will solve these difficulties. I encourage the Government to think in those terms.</P>
    <P>Do not think, as I feel some of them will, that achieving the seat in which they sit tonight is the be-all and end-all of their political objectives.  There is an enormous task to be undertaken where great risks will have to be taken but without those risks and the courage that is entailed in taking them we will not have solutions. We are only going to put off the evil day.  A change of Government will only amount in those circumstances to a change of faces.  A change of faces is not enough.  A fundamental change of attitudes is what is called for and I ask the Government to respond to that.</P>

      <P>I should like to offer my congratulations to the Taoiseach and his <Col N="73" /> Government on an individual and collective basis.  It is the Taoiseach's third run over the course and I trust he will get on better than on previous occasions.  I wish the Ministers luck in their portfolios because, having served in Government for four years, I know the responsibilities they are undertaking and the difficulties that face them in their Departments. There were some strange appointments and nothing very innovative.  The people of Limerick West must feel extremely privileged in that they have to have two Ministers.</P>

      <P>Whatever the reason the real McCoy will appear in due course. The belated conversion of the Taoiseach to the affairs of the Gaeltacht is something which I have no doubt will be explained on Radio na Gaeltachta 24 hours each day.  I wish Deputy Woods well in the Department of Social Welfare and I am glad to note that it has been left as a separate Department.  I wish him well on the north side of Dublin city if he proceeds with the proposals which are on his desk in that Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy O'Hanlon on his appointment to the other major Department, the Department of Health.  It is of value to the Departments of Health and Social Welfare that they should remain as separate Departments because the workload in them is enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we set out on what could have been a very interesting day for constitutional lawyers.  However, having witnessed the prancing of Deputy Gregory across the stage for most of the past fortnight and noting that he did not have the basic dignity of voting in the House &mdash; whatever the thought-out and well-reasoned cop-out he devolved for himself today &mdash; the constitutional lawyers were not called on to give further advice to the outgoing Taoiseach, the incoming Taoiseach and all and sundry as to what would happen had the Taoiseach failed to be elected but for the casting vote of the <Col N="74" /> Ceann Comhairle.  Thus, the Taoiseach faces a very difficult task but he has faced difficult tasks in the past and has shown himself to be a man of resilience and determination.  He held on to the throne when many others would have left it for other people.  I wish him well.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter that was touched on by other speakers, that no individual Deputy should hold this, or any Government, to ransom.  Having heard the remarks of Deputy Blaney in regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I must remark that I do not believe he is the custodian of the Anglo-Irish Agreement or of what he might call republican or nationalist matters.  I do not believe the Government should bow to his wishes on that agreement.  Certainly, Deputy Blaney, who has been a Member of the House for many years, should not attempt to dictate to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Taoiseach that the Anglo-Irish Agreement, with which I had a very deep involvement, is something of value to the island, North and South.  It recognises for the first time the identities and differences that exist on the island, things we have to recognise. It may be that there is room for development, for building on the foundations that exist.</P>
    <P>In relation to the portfolios and the slight innovations, I do not believe that by themselves these will be the panacea for our economic ills.  Some of them verge on being cosmetic and the examples given by the Taoiseach are unfortunate.  I do not believe anybody in the commercial world would regard the present position regarding the Office of Public Works or the Revenue Commissioners as being the optimum we could achieve in new areas. Likewise I believe the Taoiseach is already creating a problem for himself because the Book of Estimates before the House makes no provision for new offices and there is obviously a cost factor.  Whether the transferring of forestry to the Department of Energy, which in the past has had absolutely no connection with it, is a good or a bad thing remains to be seen.  We will have the opportunity of debating at a later date <Col N="75" /> the portfolios, the responsibilities, the amalgamations and the transfer of responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the incoming Government will face enormous problems, although Deputy O'Malley, if he continues in the tone he adopted in the past 20 minutes, may keep the Opposition so divided that the Government may have a very easy ride.  That division probably will not last for very long.  If I can divert from my extreme right to my temporary minor left, Deputy O'Malley delivers his opinions in this House as if he has never had the onerous task of being involved in Government.  We should put the bona fides of the Progressive Democrats to the test at a very early date when we put before the House a Private Members' Bill requiring that contributions to political parties should be registered.  I believe the amount of money spent during the past six weeks by the Progressive Democrats was nothing short of scandalous.  The bona fides will be tested because I saw two blatant examples of their lack of bona fides in the past few months.  Any time the outgoing Government were brought into this House by the Opposition on any question relating to public expenditure, whether it concerned the teachers or any part of the public service, the Progressive Democrats failed the first test.  Likewise in relation to the closure of the Tuam Sugar factory &mdash; this was outside the House when Deputy O'Malley was speaking on radio after the 1.30 news.</P>

      <P>If he raises them, they will not go unanswered.  They said during the election campaign that they wanted to roll back State expenditure and they wanted to close down the Great Southern <Col N="76" /> Hotels &mdash; until, of course, they visited South Kerry during the course of the campaign.  Then they had no plans for closing the Great Southern Hotels.  Political expediency tends to be the order of the day.  I would have far more respect for Deputy O'Malley's comments had he not been one of the strongest advocates the IDA ever had when he held ministerial office but within six months of leaving ministerial office he believed we should not have an IDA.  Other examples will arise as time goes by.</P>
      <P>This is the day for the incoming Government.  There is one lady but I thought there might be more.  I wish them all well, individually and collectively. They have a very difficult task and the Labour Party intend putting them through the hoops.  They made fair efforts to do that during the past four years.  I assure the Government they will not be allowed to relax, week in, week out.  As someone who appreciates small majorities, I can see that the Government now have something in common with me.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I welcome you to the Chair and hope that you will have the co-operation of the Dáil.  We in The Workers' Party intend to co-operate with you.  I wish the new Government well in the task before them and indicate that as far as The Workers' Party are concerned there will be no honeymoon for this Government. Various surprising statements have been made by a number of speakers from Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats that they will support this Government in the harsh or tough measures which they believe need to be made to put the country on its feet.  This is surprising because although we know that they had fully agreed before today on the kind of measures they wanted to have implemented, they refused earlier to support the Fianna Fáil nominee for Taoiseach.  That highlights the fundamental flaw of Deputy Gregory's abstension which allowed a Fianna Fáil Government to come into power and allowed the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael off the hook in relation to voting to put a Fianna Fáil <Col N="77" /> Taoiseach into office.  The net effect has been to create an alliance of the Right far stronger than it would have been if the Left had united in Opposition to all the nominees from the Right.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley takes umbrage at the use of the terminology &ldquo;Left&rdquo; and &ldquo;Right&rdquo;.  I do not know why, because his party articulates very clearly the kind of philosophy which the Tories in Britain have been articulating so strongly in the past seven or eight years.  They talk about getting the State off the people's backs. Since Deputy O'Malley does not like the term &ldquo;Right&rdquo;, perhaps I should avoid using it.  He tries to differentiate between the Left and &ldquo;sensible policies&rdquo;.  That is a typical Tory usage of terminology which one can hear on the BBC or Channel 4 any night of the week.  It is interesting that while the PDs do not like to be placed on the Right, the whole thrust of their policies and terminology places them clearly in that category.  Obviously people can put any label they like on themselves but they must be judged on what they say and do.  While the Progressive Democrates do not like to be labelled right wing, any sensible observer would clearly understand them to be on the right and would understand their policies to be right wing.  That is not to say that they are not radical policies.  The Thatcherites glory in being radical Tories.  It would be more honest for the PDs to understand themselves in that light.  One has to agree with Deputy Spring, however, that their policies tend to be toned down a bit depending on the part of the country in which they are campaigning and the issues that may arise in a particular area, but I suppose that is par for the course when parties of this nature are attempting to win seats to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of things I should like to welcome in the Taoiseach's statement. The proposal to make the food and forestry industries a prime target in the attempt to develop and create jobs is important.  However, we have yet to see specific proposals in this area and I will withhold judgment until we hear what they are.  At least it is recognised that <Col N="78" /> these are two key areas for the development of jobs.</P>
    <P>An immediate opportunity arises in relation to the forestry industry, I refer particularly to Clondalkin Paper Mills where a receiver has been placed.  The workforce are determined to ensure that this country retains the only paper processing factory in the State.  The nature of the Government's reaction to this challenge will be their first test.  They should move in immediately to ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills becomes a State company and that the trained and dedicated workforce are retained to enable them to give the kind of service they wish to give by producing millions of pounds worth of paper which we import at present.  I hope that the new Minister will not let the grass grow under his feet and that he will be on the job tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. to ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills are kept open, the workforce retained and that they will be part and parcel of a viable forestry products industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to criticise the Fianna Fáil administration in relation to their attitude to the Single European Act.  In this House not too long ago the Fianna Fáil Party were highly critical of that Act and Deputy Haughey made a specific statement that he was not satisfied that the Single European Act protected Irish neutrality. I read recently that Deputy Haughey said in Brussels he had no difficulty with the European political co-operation process as enshrined in the Single European Act.  I have argued in the House that the Single European Act should be renegotiated.  Fianna Fáil did not support my arguments but they proposed adding a codicil or addendum to the Act to try to ensure that our neutrality was more tightly guaranteed.  If they are not prepared to renegotiate the Single European Act, at the very least the incoming Taoiseach should implement what he proposed in the debate on the Single European Act some months ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Ceann Comhairle to his new position.  I wish the Government well and we will be pushing all the time to have proper policies implemented in <Col N="79" /> relation to jobs, tax reform and the protection of those on social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate you, the Taoiseach and appointed Ministers.  I find it rather surprising that I should need to speak in this debate.  I wish to make a point in a non-party political way.  I am disappointed to have to say at such an early stage in the lifetime of the Government that the Taoiseach made a fundamental mistake in his allocation of portfolios.</P>
      <P>As one who occupied the post of Minister for the Public Service for three years, I believe that if that Department are to be assigned to another Department they should be assigned to any Department except the Department of Finance. From the day the Department of the Public Service were created some 13 or 14 years ago, their avowed enemy &mdash; and the organisation which set out to thwart their every effort &mdash; have been the Department of Finance.  They have been disgraceful and outrageous in their attacks on every attempt to reform and modernise the Civil Service and the public service.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Public Service have responsibilities other than merely pay and staffing matters.  They are responsible for computerisation, training and organisation and, in my experience, every single proposal was opposed &mdash; unfortunately very often successfully &mdash; by the Department of Finance.  They were the biggest opponent of computerisation, new technology and training in the Civil Service.  To assign pay and staffing matters to the Department of Finance will, ultimately, cost the taxpayer money because the function of pay bargaining should be kept separate from the Department of Finance; if you amalgamate pay bargaining with the paymaster, it will cost you more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Taoiseach to carefully reconsider the assignment of all the functions. The Taoiseach's speech is a little difficult to understand, he seems to be appointing Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Finance and also Minister for the <Col N="80" /> Public Service.  However, he referred to the administrative statutory shell left by the Department of the Public Service. That appears to indicate that the two Departments will be merged which has been the aim and goal of the Department of Finance since the day the Department of the Public Service were created. However, the Department of the Public Service were created for a specific purpose because the Government of the day, following a major review, recognised that certain functions were not being properly carried out by the Department of Finance and that they should be assigned to another, separate, Department.  As a result, the Department of Finance resented that and have thwarted the many efforts at reform which were attempted, not just during the time when I was Minister for the Public Service, but also during other periods.  The Taoiseach should recall, from his experience in Government, the many times the Department of Finance have used tactics and tackles which would not be allowed by a referee in their efforts to defeat modernisation, computerisation, the spread of technology, access to information and training of civil servants.  All those things have been retarded over the years and it grieves me that this has been the fault of the Department which should be the engine house for change, the fountainhead of new ideas.  The Department of Finance should be leading the economy and advising the Government but instead, they have the most debilitating influence on Irish life.  I am amazed that so soon after leaving Government I am obliged to say this in the Dáil.  I had intended to say it at an appropriate time but the Taoiseach created the opportunity now and he is creating many difficulties for himself in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I urge him most strongly in his own interest and in that of his colleagues &mdash; but much more importantly in the interest of the public &mdash; to reconsider at least some of the proposal.  If the Taoiseach wants to have a statutory shell left to create a new Department then he should take most of the functions of the Department of the Public Service under <Col N="81" /> his own aegis, but do not put it on the other side of Merrion Street, for the sake of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let met start by congratulating you, Sir, in public as I have done in private, on your accession once again to the Chair.  It is appropriate that I should follow my former Government colleague, Deputy John Boland, on this item.  Like him, I had not intended to speak in this debate tonight and I do not intend to be long.  As his successor in the Department of the Public Service I repeat and endorse the intent, the thrust, the passion and the advice that Deputy John Boland has given to Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  I have no quarrel with his intent to make rearrangements but if he has to make rearrangements I advise him not to bundle them all up into the one end of Merrion Street.  Deputy Boland was a unique Minister for the Public Service in the sense that he had sole responsibility for the task and his record will long live after him.  I suggest the Taoiseach should not end up by transferring all of the functions to the far end of Merrion Street.  A great deal of wisdom is contained in the energy and the passion of the advice he has received this evening and he would do well to listen to it and reflect upon it because it is given without rancour or prejudice by people who have &mdash; for a short time in my case &mdash; some reason to be able to say we have been inside the cave and have seen part of the resource residing within it.  I have also seen on the other side of the field some of the tackling that would not pass Triple Crown refereeing standards in relation to changes that were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say two other things because this is a night for rejoicing, not just for those who have won but for all of us who live in this democracy and who can celebrate the victory.  Of all of the generations who have lived on this island we are among the very few who have been able to celebrate the peaceful change of power among ourselves, within ourselves and between ourselves.  To the victors tonight I extend congratulations because this victory is contained within our own <Col N="82" /> people and belongs to all of us.  If they have to lose in the future let them celebrate tonight because their victory is a celebration of the process of democracy which was for too long denied to all of the people to this island to be celebrated by themselves.  Therefore, I say in a democratic fraternity of which I am proud to be a part that if tonight is their night, in their celebrations they celebrate for all of us.  Very few countries among those whose flags fly outside the UN building in the lower east side of New York can orderly transfer power among one another and between themselves in the manner that has occurred today, even with this uncertainty.  We would do well to reflect on that, consolidate it and celebrate it.  It took our grandparents long enough to deliver to us what we have witnessed this afternoon and we should not take it for granted.</P>
    <P>I have one last point to make to the Taoiseach and his Government.  Unemployment and employment have been and will continue to be the major item on their agenda.  In so far as the Labour Party and my personal contribution to this House are concerned, any measure that the Government take, any risk they take, any new idea they test and any advancement they make for which they seek the support of this side of the House will be regarded with an open heart and an open mind and without prejudice, because that is the final test upon which all of us will be judged, and perhaps have been judged.  That is the final foundation upon which the free democracy which we currently enjoy must ultimately rest.</P>
    <P>I say in conclusion to the Taoiseach, to the Tánaiste, to all of those Ministers who have been Ministers previously and to those who are Ministers for the first time, that they have my personal congratulations for their personal success. They have my personal support for the difficult task which now confronts them and they have the offer of co-operation from this side of the House in so far as they come forward with inventive, progressive and risk-taking ideas that challenge the conventions that previously <Col N="83" /> have denied us success.  They have difficult times ahead of them and in so far as we can be of assistance it is our function at this time, on this evening, to offer them solidarity and support, because, I regret to say and as my leader has said already, that there will be enough hoops through which they will have to jump in the coming months and perhaps years.  On this evening let them celebrate what is a democratic decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with other colleagues in the House in congratulating you, Sir, on your election, and the incoming Taoiseach on his new Ministers and Ministers of State on their appointments. I wish them personally and collectively every success in their endeavours.  I hope that nobody will quibble if I pay particular attention to my constituency colleague, Deputy Ahern, and say that I wish him well.  If the endeavours which he has brought to all of his political life to date are anything to go by I have no doubt that he will make an outstanding success of his new portfolio.  I wish him well as I know do all of his constituents from all shades of political opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also appropriate that we say a word of gratitude and appreciation to the outgoing Government for the earnestness of their intent and the integrity with which they approached their task.  It is important that that be said and important to echo what Deputy Quinn said, that it is right that we remind ourselves that we live in a democracy where the transfer of power happens in this kind of circumstance peacefully, properly and in a civilised fashion.  I must admit that for a few moments earlier I thought it was the Progressive Democrats who were going into Government.  We were the subject of so much attack from one or two sources but there will be another day and another time for explaining to recent political opponents that <i>realpolitik</i> is all about and how out-dated are the faded attitudes to left and right and how irrelevant they are in terms of this small economy. We all have a collective <Col N="84" /> responsibility to work together to provide whatever assistance is possible to the elected Government of the day and we should debate the other issues on another occasion.  This is not the time for getting into ideological diatribes, of rediscovering the touchstone of left and right politics or talking about the alliance of the left, a totally new fangled concept which I had not heard mentioned at all in Irish politics until a few months ago but which happens conveniently to have arisen in recent times.</P>
    <P>The manner of the election of the Taoiseach today augurs well.  By all accounts it is perfectly clear that there was no attempt, despite the temptation there must have been, to engage in any discussions which might have led to the allegation that there was a deal of any kind with anyone.  That is heartening and should be commended.  We all have learned from experience in the past that that is not ultimately the way in which we should proceed.  Neither is it right or proper that any individual Deputy or small group of Deputies or party of Deputies should exercise a degree of power or leverage above and beyond that which is democratically appropriate for them in pursuing policies.  That is why I endorse heartily the comments of my party leader and of the leader of the Labour Party again in taking to task the extreme demands of Deputy Blaney this afternoon, so out of character with the overwhelming view not just of the parties in this House but of the people.  If that veto is ever to be exercised it will not matter very much because I have no doubt that it will be vastly out-numbered by those who will be willing to support the Government in rightful pursuit of policy relating to Northern Ireland and its related issues.  I felt that the way that note was injected by a very seasoned and experienced politician was unwise.</P>
    <P>However, let me say to the Government that if this Dáil is to succeed it seems that a new type of Government is needed, as is a new type of administration in this House.  This is a minority administration and it cannot work unless the undoubted goodwill that exists in this <Col N="85" /> House and outside it towards working for a resolution of major national problems can somehow be translated into creating in this House a forum more meaningful in that respect than it has been to date, which seems to involve and incorporate the wisdom and experience of all sides in this House while retaining the executive function in the hands of the Government. If a Government wish to proceed on the basis of coming in here daily and seeking to get nodded agreement on an Order of Business decided elsewhere and proceed without reference over months to details of legislation without willingness to take amendments, to consider the views of the Opposition or to consult in advance, that administration cannot succeed because it forces all of us into the old roles which perhaps many of us do not wish to adopt.</P>
    <P>An attempt in so far as it is possible to operate this House in a different way is vital.  An attempt to recognise in that context the good will which exists all around is important.  That broad base of good will should be translated into a mechanism which allows us all to make some form of reasonable input while recognising the right of the Government at all times to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; or to say: &ldquo;This is our view and ultimately you have to take it or leave it&rdquo;.  Unless that attempt is made it will not work.  That is something that has not happened to date.  That form of dialogue or consensus seems to be an essential ingredient if this Dáil is to succeed, particularly in view of the enormous tasks it has to confront in the economic area.</P>
    <P>The Government party received the lowest vote of any they got in the last 25 years.  The number of TDs they have falls short of their expectations in the election. The Government have to govern as if they got a lot more votes.  They must have the courage of their convictions and they have to govern without fear or favour in the knowledge that there are very many people in this House and outside it who believe that the national interest, a much used cliché, has to come first.  If the Government have the courage of their convictions they may surprise themselves by their own success.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> This is a night for celebration by individual Ministers and I wish them well.  I am very pleased to have been re-elected as a member of a new party with 14 Deputies, which surprised a number of people on all sides of the House.  We look forward collectively to playing an extremely constructive and determined role in this House.  I would not like anyone to misinterpret or misconstrue that willingness on our part as weakness. We are not personally or collectively afraid of any electoral test that may come next month, in 12 months time or in three years time.  That is not what I am talking about.  I am talking about doing business in a different way to see if it can work.  If the Taoiseach sets that process in motion this Government may very well have a successful term of office which I know all of us hope they will have in the national interest.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the words of congratulation to you, Sir, on your unanimous election to the exalted post of Ceann Comhairle, a post you occupied with distinction before.  I wish you every success in that post.  I also wish to congratulate the Taoiseach on his election as Taoiseach for the third time.  I sincerely hope that this time it will be a turning point in the affairs of the country, certainly in regard to the economic issues, problems and challenges facing the country.  It is a time for celebration and congratulation for all the Ministers.  It is a Government of great experience.  I think 11 of the 15 members proposed have already been in Cabinet and, of the remaining four, two have held junior ministerial posts.  It is a Cabinet of great experience.  I should like to congratulate in particular my constituency colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, a man of great experience, on his elevation to the post of Tánaiste.  I also wish to congratulate my predecessor in the Department of Communications, Deputy John Wilson, on his reappointment to that Department.  I can assure him of the same courtesies and co-operation in Opposition as he extended to me.</P>

      <Col N="87" /> I want to speak about the reorganisation of the Department of Communications and the policy issues raised in the Taoiseach's speech and by other speakers.  The rearrangement of Government Departments and the assignment of positions announced by the Taoiseach make a good deal of sense in general even though I would have done one or two other things.  The assignment of the Department of the Public Service to the Department of Finance is probably a mistake. I might not say that with the same venom and flourish as my colleague, Deputy John Boland, but I suppose the House will understand the passion he feels because of the major work he did in the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I am not as critical of the Department of Finance as Deputy Boland.  As I see it, they were just doing their job as they thought best.  Of course there will always be interdepartmental disagreements and so on.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that he should reflect on whether the Department of the Public Service should come under the Department of Finance which in any event is a very major burden for any Minister especially in present economic circumstances.  It may well be that the Department of the Taoiseach is the Department under which the Department of the Public Service should come. A Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach should be responsible for the Department of the Public Service. There are precedents in other countries for that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the division of the Department of Communications it seems that the Department will be divided among three Ministers which is great testimony to the great work load I carried during the past four and a quarter years. That work load will now be carried by three men.  I take that as a great compliment from the incoming Taoiseach. The joining of the Departments of Tourism and Transport makes eminent sense. I am only sorry the Taoiseach did not go further and transfer the roads function from the Department of the Environment to the proposed Department of <Col N="88" /> Tourism and Transport so that for the first time we could have a properly co-ordinated transport Department.  That has been proposed many times in many reports but it has always been resisted, I suppose understandably, from within the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to announce that the non-transport functions of the Department of Communications will be the responsibility of the Minister for Energy.  I do not object to that proposal. The Taoiseach also proposes to set up an office of science and technology in the Department of Industry and Commerce. An office or a department of science and technology would not be complete without having assigned to it the telecommunications function because that is vital to the information revolution that is going on in the world.  The Taoiseach has rightly identified that as an area of opportunity.  It does not seem to make a lot of sense to have the telecommunications area divorced from the rest of the technology area.  If the Taoiseach was saying the remainder of the Department of Communications was being assigned to the Department of Industry and Commerce that would make a great deal more sense because the rest of the technology function already comes under that Department.  The National Board for Science and Technology comes under that Department and that is the Department responsible for the promotion of industry in general.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider these points in the rearranging of the Departments.  In general, his approach has been not too radical, but sensible.</P>
    <P>You will forgive me, A Cheann Comhairle, for guffawing at the claim of Deputy O'Malley of the effects of his influence on air transport policy and on bringing about low access fares, a matter to which I am delighted to see the Taoiseach giving such priority.  Deputy O'Malley repeatedly told this House, among all sorts of excessive claims, about the depredations the Air Transport Act would bring about, for example, that it would increase air fares generally.  That <Col N="89" /> Deputy was the only Member of this House who was wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred and sixty-five Deputies agreed that it was only prudent management to make provision for the Government of the day to have reserve powers to regulate the air transport industry.  I repeated constantly to Deputy O'Malley that what was important was the policy which was pursued under that power.  I pointed out that since the appointment of the outgoing Government in 1982 there had been an opening up of the airways.  That started in March, 1983 with the licensing of Avair.  That policy has been progressively pursued with enormous success.  The only Member who was repeatedly in gross error, who had not the grace to admit that he was in error when it was pointed out to him, was Deputy O'Malley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that my policy on low access fares, not only in air transport but in sea transport, is to be a priority of the incoming Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to another question.  The Taoiseach is proposing to set up a Department of the Marine.  That is the most questionable part of the reorganisation he proposes here today.  Is this just a Department of Fisheries renamed with a bit of a flourish?  Or, for instance, does he propose that the shipping function of the Department of Transport be assigned to the Department of the Marine?  If he does, that is a mistake.  There is a long overdue need for co-ordinated transport policy.  It just does not make sense to divorce shipping from the rest of the transport function.  It certainly does not make sense to divorce shipping, which is a key part of tourism access, from aviation and the tourist function.  I would ask the <Col N="90" /> Taoiseach, in reply, to clarify if the shipping function will remain with the Department of Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House very much longer but wish to say a few words to my friends who call themselves the left wing.  We have had to endure a great deal of rhetoric over the past few weeks as if the left wing, so called, were the only people concerned about poverty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or concerned about unemployment.  I have no doubt that there is not one Member of this House who is not passionately concerned about unemployment and poverty.  It is idle for certain Deputies to pretend that we can go on spending the present amount of money without causing more unemployment and more poverty and then call the rest of us, in derogatory fashion, right wingers.  There are very few right wingers in this House, in the normal meaning of that term.  In the two major parties there are more people who would be generally perceived as left of centre than some of the so-called left wingers, in reality.  There are more people in the two major parties who represent intuitively the values of working class people than are generally represented in what is called here the left wing.  Let us stop this rhetoric.  Do my friends on the left wing agree or not that excessive debt is causing unemployment, that unemployment is causing poverty? Do they agree or not that debt must be reduced?  Do they agree or not that debt can only be reduced by curtailment of public expenditure which, in the main, is in four areas which have been declared out of bounds so far as public expenditure cuts for the left wing are concerned &mdash; health, social welfare, education and pay?  We are not being true to the people we represent, we are not being just, compassionate or honest if we pretend that these areas cannot be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe very passionately that we must curtail and cut public expenditure if we are to eliminate injustice in our society, which would in turn eliminate <Col N="91" /> poverty and reduce unemployment.  I totally agree that those cuts should be applied in a way that protects most the weakest in our community and offers them the most hope.  If we postpone the evil day the situation will get worse.  This is something which the so-called left wingers have not addressed.  They consistently mislead those they purport to represent.  I ask for much more honesty from them than has been apparent to date.</P>
    <P>In other countries where there are socialist governments, more has been done to redress imbalances in the national finances than has been possible here.  For instance, the present Australian socialist Government only last year halved their budget deficit in what would be called a savage budget.  Mr. Gonzales has already been referred to as addressing the problems of public expenditure in Spain.  He is not being called right wing. As a previous Deputy has said, he is merely addressing the laws of arithmetic which say that you cannot go on spending more than you bring in.  If you do, you will be in the hands of the moneylender, as are so many unfortunate people in the suburbs of this city at present.  They have got into the same position as the Government. I ask those who call themselves left wing to be honest and acknowledge the fact that public expenditure must be reduced.  Yes, this must be done in the best way possible for the least well off in our society.  Yes, there must be a vigorous attack on the other areas of our economy where there are abuse and evasion of taxes and responsibility.  However, that will not be enough to avoid the need for cuts in public expenditure.  It is only if we cut public expenditure that we shall be able to continue providing services for the needy, services which we all want to be continued and improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom tréaslú leat féin, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an phoist atá bainte amach agat.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leat agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh <Col N="92" /> tú féaráilte i gcónaí le gach duine a theastaíonn uaidh nó uaithi labhairt.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tréaslaím leis an Taoiseach agus leis na hAirí atá ainmnithe aige chun na dualgais éagsúla a chomhlíonadh.</P>
      <P>Tosnóidh mé leis an chéad cheist san ráiteas a chuir an Taoiseach amach maidin, mar shampla, le dualgais Roinn na Gaeltachta a choinneáil leis féin.  An gciallaíonn sé sin go bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag baint le cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, nó an bhfuil cúram Roinn na Gaeltachta imithe síos ionnas nach bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach agus a bhí sé go dtí seo?</P>
      <P>Equally I should like to take up some questions other than mine as to the intention that is precisely involved in keeping the responsibilities for Roinn na Gaeltachta to the Taoiseach's own Department. Unlike the last speaker I want to welcome the establishment of a Department of the Marine.  It makes eminent, logical sense to have all matters to do with the sea brought together under one umbrella.  At present people dealing with marine matters find themselves perhaps dealing with a dozen State bodies and several different Government Departments. Anybody with the slightest familiarity with the sea will know that the establishment of such a Department makes sense.  There are Deputies who have no familiarity with these issues and who do not support the reforms suggested but I welcome those reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I want to side with those who say that the movement of the reforming functions of the Department of the Public Service under the deadly tutelage of the Department of Finance, as it has been so colourfully described so far, seems to be an extraordinary move in its own way. Curiously, I have not a jaundiced view of the Department of Finance.  It has a very honest presentation of itself; it always has had.  To use a word which Deputy O'Malley has been using all evening, it has been an ideological Department.  It has built up a conservative ethos of its own over the years since it was founded. Indeed in its early days it managed a continuity with the British Treasury for <Col N="93" /> which it was commended in its day by different senior Treasury officials who have left us their memoirs.  It is hardly the place to which to entrust the reforms that are necessary in the public service.</P>
    <P>I rise merely to wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers well in tackling the enormous problem of unemployment which afflicts this economy at present, in tackling the crisis of investment affecting our economy and the many related forms of poverty connected with unemployment and the crisis of investment.  I include in that the problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>I felt I had to speak because of what has been said up to now in a pejorative sense by people who have recently started using the language of politics about the so-called Left.  The phrase, &ldquo;the motley collection that constitutes the so-called Left&rdquo; has been used.  There was an appeal to the so-called Left &mdash; I suppose I would be one of them &mdash; to be honest and so forth. Some of us have got used to living with Deputy O'Malley's conversion in public but, when he decides to proceed with his political education in public, it can become a little tedious.  Many of us are familiar with the meanings of the terms Left and Right.  In most civilised democracies people us these terms without the great trauma it appears to cause Deputy O'Malley; it seems to fire him into some extraordinary disability.  In a curious way both of us being from the same part of the country, he should know a lot about ideology.  Nearby his city, Limerick, when the ESB was being founded it was opposed by the loose alliance of electrical suppliers at the time.  It was opposed by the farmers as something that would never catch on.  There was a host of ideological statements that the State has no role in Irish life.</P>
    <P>As this Dáil begins its work tackling unemployment, tackling poverty, tackling the problem of emigration, dealing with the crisis of investment, at the background of all of the arguments is the issue of the role of the State.  Those of us who are on the Left, who know what the term means, who are not worried about gabbling on about Left and Right as if we were standing like chickens in the middle <Col N="94" /> of the road, like Deputy O'Malley's party, know what we mean by it.  Regarding a role for the State, for a start we believe that our unemployment problem is of such crisis proportions that only the most gullible people would be arguing for a cutback in the right of the State to innovate, invest and provide the jobs needed.  Equally we know that to go around with a pencil totting up the number of State agencies and, in a rather ignorant fashion saying, &ldquo;this must go, that must go&rdquo;, without asking the question which of them is contributing to which form of production within the economy is simple-minded nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Progressive Democrats mentioned a host of agencies.  My point is that there is a need for reform of the public service, but I suggest it is interesting.  It is populist to start saying that we have too many agencies and to start attacking the State.  There are votes in it.  It is that mixture of populism that has precisely nothing to contribute to our economic problems at present.  Our people deserve better economics.  If the Government propose economic strategies they will have the support of those of us on the Left where such strategies lead to employment, investment and reform of public institutions.  That is the kind of economics we need rather than this fashionable notion, every bit of it borrowed, via England back through the new Californian economics, back to Professor Hayek and bits and pieces of Friedman, all mixed up together, like people standing in the middle of a street saying that all of these different agencies have been wasting our time.  The fact of the matter is that this country would have none of the great State agencies if there had not been people who said, &ldquo;there are tasks that have to be accomplished that are beyond the abilities of individual companies and single individuals who are investing.&rdquo;  That was the thinking that gave us a turf industry, energy authorities and a national airline.  Equally if it had not been for State investment we would not now be able to start talking about jobs from information technology and the reform of telecommunications.  We <Col N="95" /> would not be able to start talking about a wood or food industry had there not been State investment in research and development.  Yes, I will assist the Progressive Democrats if necessary, but let them go back and look at the agencies that are inefficient.  Let them tell us where we have made mistakes in investment, in science, research and technology.  But it is a little too much to sit and listen perhaps having spent years thinking as to how Irish politics have divided and the price we have paid for mindless and useless divisions to the notion that we are all in agreement on our approach to solving our economic problems.  We are not.  We differ in relation to the State.  There are people in this House who must have the courage to say they are hostile to the idea of an expanded and effective State role. Those of us who are described as being on the Left are in favour of an effective State role&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Equally there are those of us who look at our society and who take as indicators of income and wealth, the manner in which transfers are made to education and health.  We say, in this small country, we do not all share the same experiences. Is that true of the purchasing power of the top quintile of people and incomes in this country and the lowest quintile?  Is it true of the people who have inherited wealth and those who have not?  Is it true of any of their children?  For example, is it not bothering anybody that we might be transferring taxpayers' money to private education and to private health?  Is it not true that if we were not subsidising private education and private health we might have a better, more general educational and health system?  There is a difference there and, as the invitation was thrown out from this side of the House, let us be honest about these differences. There is a difference between Left and Right in these matters, equally, in relation to the task of tackling our economic problems and reproducing the kind <Col N="96" /> of society we have.  Many of us see that compassion is not enough.  I am moved by the genuine sincerity of people who say there is not a single person in the House who is not moved to tears by the sight of a poor person lying on the side of the street.  But we are not talking only about compassion.  We are talking about the structures of our society, the manner in which one generation succeeds another, in which, for example, my children might have 15 or 16 times the chance of participating in third level education than the children of an unskilled craftsman. That society is not produced by accident.</P>
      <P>I note in the speeches this notion that life is accidental, that it is a terrible disaster to suggest that there might be two approaches to tackling our social and economic problems, one interventionist and the other casual.  I find there is growing up in this country at present a clear view that the push toward the removal of inequality must be stubbed, that if we could freeze the State at present, freeze public expenditure, we would, in some miraculous way, create jobs and solve our economic problems.  The interesting question I will be posing during the course of this Dáil is this: which State are we speaking about rolling back?  The people who speak about freezing the State at present are those who have benefited from it already.  We need positive State intervention and positive State discrimination to remove the inequalities that exist.</P>
      <P>Once again, there are two sides.  One is either on the side of moving towards an egalitarian society or one is in opposition to that egalitarian thrust, and as to the people who have taken to giving us lectures in their heady new days using all this language, vulgar people, left, right and all the rest of it, it is time they discovered honesty and courage themselves, and if they be against the State and against further equality, if they be for reducing the different State agencies and if they do not believe that we should use the State to invest and so on, let them say so and we can have an honourable difference among ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> It is very interesting this evening that the group of 18 Deputies should be singled out by two parties here as people who had to be some kind of political lunatics.  The left is a word that describes a certain political philosophy and we have lost much in this country by not listening to that political philosophy.  In the fifties we sent people at the rate of 50,000 to 60,000 a year on the boats, because we were not able to intervene directly to provide employment.  We could do so again, and it is this kind of redneck political philosophy, that has been borrowed via every kind of backward economic textbook from Professor Hayek on, that is now trying to suggest that a country that is full of young people should roll the clock back to the 19th century and that we should not have an effective role for the State.</P>
    <P>When we come to this Dáil session we have an opportunity of taking every bit of that argument apart, in every one of the proposals in relation to the different areas of the economy.  But I hope that when they get beyond simple abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is certainly nothing of the kind.  Deputy O'Malley was not well up in his speech before he began practising to be an antiquarian saying he had never heard the words left or right and so forth and we were all supposed to be very impressed by that.  I listened, a decade and a half ago, to that stuff from Professor Kelly who was much better at it than Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <P>There are three things I would say in conclusion.  I wish there had been more emphasis in the Taoiseach's speech on investment.  People are being accused of rhetoric.  But in the second paragraph of the Taoiseach's speech he said that the Government would concentrate its main efforts on areas of the economy with particular development potential.  I agree with that. <Col N="98" /> But he says this will be within a framework of consistent, fiscal, monetary exchange rate policies &mdash; that is fine &mdash; that will create an economic climate conducive to confidence and enterprise.  This climatology is another nonsense, the idea being that if one creates some kind of atmosphere or some set of conditions, automatically one will get investment. There is no evidence that it has happened in the different economies in Europe without a conscious interventionist investment policy, and I would hope that when we move past the budget to discussing economic policies the Taoiseach will have the courage to look for assistance from those who believe in State intervention to establish interventionist investment policies that can give us the job creation or prospects that we need if we are to impact on unemployment.</P>
      <P>I said that in relation to the administration of the different Departments that are involved, I am worried about the Department of the Gaeltacht because all of the problems that I mentioned are worse there than they are in the rest of the country.  In relation to the Gaeltacht we have to ask what strategies there will be in relation to providing jobs, for example, in an area with a worse infrastructure than the rest of the country and a number of considerable disadvantages. I worry about the demotion of Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Department of the Marine and I join with those who have been critical about the movement of the Department of the Public Service within the conservative ethos of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that the Tánaiste has been given responsibility for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I remember recalling as a Member of this House before, and as a Member of the other House, that there is a demand for knowledge as to what is being done in our name through foreign policy, and I am not satisfied that mechanisms exist to establish a proper accountability in relation to Irish foreign policy.  We are unique in European democracies in not having a foreign policy committee in <Col N="99" /> which different issues could be discussed and in which we could decide whether we should take a particular voting position or not.  I hope that, when the new office holder, Deputy Lenihan, comes to review his policies for the years ahead, he will find it possible to allow both Houses and the Irish public to have far more access to information about foreign policy which is being enacted in their name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already had an opportunity of congratulating you, Sir, privately on your appointment to the office that you hold and I am very glad to be able to do so in the House.  I want also to congratulate the Taoiseach and the members of his Government on their appointment.  I can fairly say that tonight the Taoiseach the members of his Government deserve the respect of the House.  From tomorrow morning on they will have to begin to merit and earn the respect of the House.  But certainly, for tonight, I warmly congratulate each one of them.  They are embarking on what will be a very difficult task.  I do not intend to give them a lot of advice tonight, although there are some over there who gave me good advice when I was in a similar position to them.  I hope that those who have had previous experience in Cabinet will not look askance at me if I say quite sincerely that I want especially to congratulate and encourage those members of the Government who have not previously had Cabinet office.  I think that their colleagues will join with me in saying that, even though it is extremely hard work and is a very onerous position, most of us who have held office &mdash; I speak for myself and I know I speak for others &mdash; look back on the experience as having been a privilege.  I know from personal experience that many, if not all, members of this Government will approach their duties in that spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of my party, the Leader of the Opposition, has set out the terms in which we will support economic and budgetary policies to be brought forward by this Government.  I reiterate that, and <Col N="100" /> I expect, in supporting policies to be put forward by this Government over the next few months, particularly in the context of this year's budget, to be able to say and to advocate on this side of the House a great many of the things that I have said and advocated on the other side of the House.  I can give one undertaking to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance in particular, and to other members of the Government.  They will not be able to say to me that these are words I must eat.  Nor will I succumb to the temptation, as so many of us here have done in recent years, to use rhetoric instead of thought.  I do not intend to throw labels such as &ldquo;bookkeeper&rdquo;, &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo; across the House, although I am quite sure that in the logic of the situation in which we now find ourselves those labels might be just as apt, just as appropriate, to many of the statements and proposals that will be made on the other side of the House. But I do not believe that labels of that kind add anything at all to the sum of human wisdom.  They certainly do not add anything to the sum of human welfare on this island and the stupid, misguided use of those labels has been more an obstacle than an advantage in Irish politics and public affairs for too many years. I do not intend to feed that process any further.</P>
    <P>I do look forward &mdash; nor will I stint myself of the pleasure of doing so &mdash; to illustrating to members of the Government just where they will have to eat their words and why.  There are others indeed, on this side of the House, to whom I will have the pleasure of pointing out the same thing.  But I will do it in a constructive spirit and I will do it in order to bring about the result that we have been striving to achieve in just over four years in office which is, quite simply, the greater welfare of the people of this country.  We must do it in a framework that looks not just at today or tomorrow but further than that.  That is why we on this side of the House believe that the Government that bring forward the kind of policies we have said we will support deserve support, because they must be <Col N="101" /> the kind of policies that have the longer-term interests of all of the people at heart.</P>
    <P>I give the same undertaking to the Minister for Justice that I have given to the Minister for Finance because there also the use of labels has obscured more of the issues than it has enlightened.  The &ldquo;fly&rdquo; remark, the easy resort to short-term criticisms of both expenditure and policy measures has disrupted Irish politics and has contributed a great deal to the kind of cynicism that is often talked about by politicians and it has contributed to the cynicism we find now affecting the practice of politics in this country.</P>
    <P>Where the Government decide not to provide the items on Deputy Blaney's shopping list, they will certainly have my support.  They will have my support in resisting Deputy Blaney's extraordinary approach to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. They will have my support in resisting Deputy Blaney's extraordinary claim today that something should be done to interfere with a matter that is now before the courts and that that something should take the form of repealing the 1965 Extradition Act, an Act which Deputy Blaney seems to forget was passed while he was a member of the Government of this country.  It was one of the regrets of my most recent career that on Committee Stage of the debate on that Bill we did not manage to get to section 3 of the Bill so that we could smoke out what Deputy Blaney really wanted.  I suspected he would get to the point where he would be forced to say that if we had information here that there were people in Northern Ireland who could be reasonably suspected to the point of being charged with carrying out a bombing incident here, that we would not ask for their extradition so that they could face charges before our courts, because that is the end of the road upon which Deputy Blaney set out today.  To the extent that the Government need any outside help in dealing with Deputy Blaney on those matters, I will be very happy to provide it.</P>
    <P>A number of the reorganisation proposals which the Taoiseach put before us this evening will obviously come up for <Col N="102" /> further discussion in the months ahead. There is no great point in reorganising something into a new office or setting up a new structure unless the function of that reorganisation is to focus resources and effort specifically on a particular problem.  If the energy and the resources can be focused without adding a new bit to the bureaucracy, that is the way it should be done.  I am sorry Deputy Higgins is gone.  I did not want to contribute any further to his great passion and what seems to be a kind of persecution complex of the left now caught between Fine Gael on the one hand and Fianna Fáil on the other as a kind of central buffer in between.  However, there does not seem to be any point in setting up a new office if an enlightened approach to focusing resources and efforts can bring about the desired result.  I will wait to see, but I am not convinced that the setting up of a new office just to give a new name and function without a specific focusing of resources and effort will contribute anything to the solution of the problems they are set up to solve.</P>
    <P>From the debate we have had so far this evening, it seems there will be a slightly different mixture of flavours to the 25th Dáil to what we had in the 24th Dáil.  The sauce that has been added is not one that many of us would particularly relish but there will be some difference. I would advise those who claim to be adding something new to look more closely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Power knows perfectly well that I will always resist the temptation to shed tears for him.  He was near enough shedding tears for me on the night of the count.  Those who want to put forward the image of providing something new should be very careful about the symbols they use.  For example, a couple of weeks ago I looked at a newspaper advertisement making the extraordinary claim that one man alone, of all the Members of this House, had brought about changes in air transport.  It was a good trendy advertisement.  There was a picture of a jumbo jet and one was meant to get the impression that the thing was taking off, but if one looked carefully one saw that the jet was in landing configuration, and that instead of taking off it was coming down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have done I will commence by congratulating the Chair on his unanimous election to the Chair.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on his election and each of his Ministers on their appointment in what is a very difficult time for this country.  In offering congratulations I want to avoid covering ground that has already been covered by other speakers this evening and I will resist the temptation of adding to the joys of the Government by showing how the various Opposition parties fall on each other and fight like dogs, so suggesting that the Government's task might be somewhat easier than they envisaged it some hours earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The task of Members on this side of the House in all parties is to provide a coherent and constructive Opposition which will deal with major national issues in a responsible way, that will facilitate the Government in tackling the major economic and social problems which need to be tackled.  We will be in a position to point out where the Government are failing and to steer them on course where they go off course.  The problems facing us require, according to the Taoiseach in his announcements this evening, reorganisation of Government Departments. Comment has been made on that reorganisation, some critical and some supportive.  I suppose at the end of the day the usefulness of the reorganisation will be judged not by names given to individual Government Departments but by the results achieved in the areas which need to be tackled.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted that changes in Government Departments are necessary to make the Government's management of the economy more effective and responsive to today's needs, I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Government that the reorganisation that is required of Government Departments also applies to modernising and reorganising the procedures of this House.  This is something which has not been adverted to yet this evening.  If it is accepted that there is a need to modernise Government Departments, to reorganise them, to make them more finely tuned to meet the problems we are confronting and to avail of the opportunities which exist in new areas of technology to provide employment, I implore the Government to co-operate with all Members of this House and individual parties represented in this House in thorough modernisation of the procedures operated by this Parliament.  The time has come to sweep the cobwebs out of the corridors of power.</P>
    <P>For too long in this House we have talked about the need for change.  As a backbench Deputy throughout my period in this House I acknowledge that the previous Government implemented changes of some significance in the provision of various Oireachtas committees <Col N="105" /> and Dáil committees which enabled some aspects of the business of this House to be dealt with more efficiently and which facilitated this House to respond to particular issues and needs when they arose. However, the steps taken in those areas were only the first steps along the road to providing what is a 19th century parliamentary structure with the type of reforms which are necessary to drag it screaming into the 20th century and to enable us to face into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Now that the Government have been appointed there is an absolute need during the course of the next few weeks, for us to look at the way in which this House functions and to render it a more efficient and effective parliamentary assembly that it has not been in recent years.  It should be done not having in mind the idea of throwing up some sort of stones in the way of the Government. I am not suggesting parliamentary committees should be created that are deliberately going to create difficulties for Ministers or are going to deliberately slow down the effectiveness or usefulness of Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that committees should be established that will facilitate the Government to confront the major economic issues we need to confront, that will facilitate this House in ensuring that the issues are promptly confronted, that public expenditure where it is incurred is properly incurred and met and that the taxpayers' money is not wasted by Government Departments whose financial procedures are lax and out-of-date and whose officials are not fully accountable for the spending of public moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government to provide a major impetus for Dáil reform and to do it in co-operation with all the parties. People outside this House look askance at the number of sitting days in this House.  Since I became a Member of this House I cannot understand why this House does not sit regularly on Fridays. <Col N="106" /> I do not understand why we cannot commence sitting at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday morning instead of 2.30 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon.  As a very minimum this House should sit four days a week.  Many people would say it should sit five days a week.  That is a reform which should be introduced.</P>
    <P>We have talked for long about the need to modernise the system of Private Members' Bills.  There is a need to provide a proper and adequate structure to deal with that area so that economic and social issues that require confronting, which Governments do not have time to confront, can be dealt with at a parliamentary level.  There is a need to make this House more responsive to the major issues of the day when they arise.  I recall Deputy Haughey during the previous Dáil as Leader of the Opposition trying with difficulty to raise serious issues, issues that deserved to be raised in this House, which required a response from Government.  All too often when those issues were raised instead of the specifics of the issues being discussed and their substance being confronted the debates descended into procedural wrangles with the Chair as to what procedure should be adopted to raise the issues and whether it was appropriate that they be raised in one way or another.</P>
    <P>For the efficient operation of this House and the efficient functioning of Government there is a necessity to revamp the procedures which are used in these areas.  In calling on the Government to establish new Dáil committees I urge that some of the committees which existed in the past Dáil be re-established such as the Committee on Public Expenditure who performed a major and important role in the work they undertook. There are other committees that need to be looked at again and revised.  I suggest to the Government and to this House that if this House is to operate properly, if Ministers are to be truly accountable to this House and if we are to have an efficient and modern parliamentary structure we should have a series of Dáil committees that directly reflect the responsibilities of individual Ministers or <Col N="107" /> groups of Ministers.  Ministers should be accountable to those committees and those committees should be in a position to call Ministers to account for the work they do.</P>
    <P>Those committees should also be in a position to suggest policy innovations which could be adopted on a non-party political and non-contentious basis to tackle the major economic problems which confront us all.  I suggest it is urgent that we reappoint those committees.  The committees we previously had are worth reappointing.  The various parties in this House should get down to the business of reaching agreement on the new types of Dáil committees that will enable the House to function more efficiently.  In that context, I join with the comment made by Deputy Higgins.  I would not agree with a lot of what Deputy Higgins said but there is one particular issue I do agree with.  I made this point during the course of the last Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of this House I have been amazed that we do not have a specific committee to deal generally with the area of foreign affairs. This must be the only Parliament in Europe which does not have such a committee. The Department of Foreign Affairs effectively have a monopoly on the development of foreign policy in this country.  Debates on foreign affairs in this House are debates of an incidental nature.  Issues of foreign affairs are discussed incidentally in a debate relating to some specific meeting of Heads of State of the EC when the Taoiseach comes back to report on what took place, or debates take place incidentally if some major disaster occurs in some far-flung region of the world or if, as happened during the course of the lifetime of the previous Government, groups of Deputies get together to try to propose an all-party motion on some specific issue relating to some aspect of foreign affairs.  The reality is that this House plays no real role of any substance in the development of foreign policy.  The reality is that in effect the Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="108" /> conducts foreign policy with the assistance of a very able Department and with a back-up of officials who have the admiration of us all but he conducts a policy which is not accountable to this House and in respect of which this House can make no contribution in its development.</P>
    <P>I particularly urge that in the context of a new committee system we establish a committee with responsibility for foreign affairs both in the development of foreign policy to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be accountable and in which foreign policy would be developed, discussed and debated so that it is not something left to be dealt with purely within the hallowed walls of Iveagh House.</P>
    <P>I also urge that a further reform be introduced.  Much is said about the contributions of politicians in this House to debates, about their contributions to the development of legislation and their contributions as legislators in the parliamentary process.  Much of what is said outside this House is derisory about the lack of contributions made by people elected to Dáil Éireann.  Most people outside this House do not know how it functions and do not know what contributions are made by individual Deputies.  The manner in which this House conducts its procedures does not lend itself to informing the general public or the electorate outside this House as to the capacities of the people they elect to this House.</P>
    <P>It took some years for this House to agree to allow RTE to rebroadcast parliamentary debates on radio.  We regard it as a major innovation that RTE can now broadcast in their news programmes on radio and television what Members are contributing to debates in this House.  Most European Parliaments, ironically except Westminster, are televised. The debates of most democracies throughout the world are televised.  The television cameras have access to parliamentary debates and can show them live when the national broadcasting stations wish to do so or in their news and current affairs programmes.  It is unique in Europe that the proceedings of this <Col N="109" /> House and the British Parliament in Westminster are not televised.  The time has come for us to get away from this colonial mentality to our parliamentary procedures.  Not only are we currently slaves to the Westminster model of parliament, which is largely unchanged since 1922, but we are slaves to an attitude which seems to believe that in some way democracy is enhanced by excluding television cameras from broadcasting and covering the proceedings of this House.</P>
    <P>In the interests of democracy and to allow the people who elect us to this House to learn how the democratic system works, the time has come when Members of this House should regard the televising of the proceedings of this House not merely as something to be tolerated but as something desirable.  In this way the people can see the parliamentary process in action and they can see how democracy works.  I urge that this major reform be considered and implemented.  People feared that the rebroadcasting of proceedings of this House on radio would diminish the proceedings of this House and create problems for the democratic process.  Those fears have proved to be nonsense.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House some years ago, I have been very conscious that there is a particular problem in areas of legislation being brought before this House.  There seems to be a lack of sufficient parliamentary draftsmen with expertise in specific areas, particularly relating to social reform, to bring before this House the type of comprehensive legislation necessary to introduce major social reforms which are long overdue.  I accept that the major work of this Government will be dealing with the economic problems confronting us &mdash; unemployment, taxation and ensuring that there is not further growth in the budget deficit, that we contain public expenditure and reduce borrowing.  The fact that we have to tackle all these problems does not mean we should totally abandon providing some of the major social legislative initiatives which are so badly needed.  For example, it does not mean that legislation which was before <Col N="110" /> this House or before Dáil committees, but which was not completed during the lifetime of the previous Government should be abandoned.  I am thinking of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill and the Status of Children Bill, which is on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why this Government cannot tackle the major economic problems confronting us while also dealing with the areas of social reform which badly need to be confronted.  In some of these areas there has been great difficulty in getting legislation drafted in a manner which would facilitate its passage through this House and in a manner which would make the legislation workable.  For example, there was the mental health legislation which Deputy Woods brought through the House and which, through no fault of his, was seen not to be capable of working.  There were acknowledged difficulties with the original drafting of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill. I urge the Government while containing public spending and not encouraging growth in the public service to provide additional parliamentary draftsmen with the necessary expertise to tackle these areas and to deal with them in an efficient and precise way to facilitate the work of this House.</P>
    <P>I wish you well in your position as Ceann Comhairle.  I wish the Government well in the work they must take on. I hope this Government will not shirk the major problems which need to be tackled.  I also hope that the major interest groups which need to be taken on will be confronted and that, through a constructive parliamentary process, both Government and Opposition will take major steps towards tackling the many problems facing us.</P>

      <P>I want to make a very brief contribution.  First, may I congratulate you on your elevation to this very high office and wish you success in your term as Ceann Comhairle?  I extend to the Taoiseach and the Government my best wishes in tackling the very difficult tasks which face them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am cheesed off with the attacks being <Col N="111" /> made by some politicians on other politicians for cheap political gain.  I am sick and tired listening to the nonsense about politicians' pensions.  Admittedly something needs to be done about this, but there is a view abroad that politicians are milking the system and that we are all millionaires.  The fact is that most Members of this House are paid less than higher executive officers in the Civil Service.  We never hear from the Marxists or the new right wing in this House about public servants, chairmen of State boards, secretaries of Departments, assistant secretaries, principal officers and many other officials.  I earn my few bob in this House and I am sick and tired of cheapskate politicians smirking at other politicians in an endeavour to appeal to the public, a bit like the page three pin-ups in some of the cheaper imported newspapers.</P>
    <P>We do a good job.  The Irish people get their politicians on the cheap and they get good politicians.  To whom are they comparing us?  They will not find a Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons who works as hard as 95 per cent of the Members of this House.  I am cheesed off with these constant and regular attacks on politicians by other politicians for cheap political gain. Politicians are entitled to be paid, just like everybody else.  We are not as well paid as most people in the public service, even junior public servants.  I want to put that on record and I make no apology for saying it.  I am making these comments because this matter was raised today by a number of Deputies, particularly a Deputy in her speech nominating somebody for election to the office of Taoiseach. The only reason politicians are supposedly held in contempt is that we continually treat each other with contempt and try to gain advantage by constantly knocking each other for short term gain.</P>
    <P>I question the suggestion that the public have no confidence in politicians. Look at all the people who worked voluntarily to get us elected.  Every Member of this House had many people working <Col N="112" /> voluntarily to get him or her elected. Look at the number of people who sought election to this House, people who held excellent jobs and belonged to many of the professions.  It is time we stopped succumbing to this so-called public view which is being created by some politicians to gain short term political advantage over their colleagues.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that a certain dogma or ideology would present the solution to our problems, whether right wing or left wing.  Ideology and dogma have created an economic apartheid here which has 300,000 working in the public service.  Those people have secure employment, promotion prospects and pensions.  However, there are 250,000 people who do not have any promotion prospects, no job or security and little hope for the future.  That has been created by ideology.  It is nonsense to think that a community enterprise scheme in Terenure that could create 15 jobs for young people for two years in Mount Jerome Cemetery has to be sanctioned by an anonymous committee of ideologues in the Department of Labour.  Too much power resides outside the House.  All the responsibility lies with the House but the authority is outside.  It is time we took back that authority and used it to the advantage of our people.</P>
    <P>I am nervous about the Taoiseach's Office becoming a microcosm of the entire State machinery.  I am not referring to the new Taoiseach but former holders of the office.  This all comes back to the question: should the Taoiseach be chairman or chief, or part chairman and part chief?  What should be the role of the Taoiseach?  I am happy that Deputy Haughey has assigned to himself the Department of the Gaeltacht because something should be done about that Department.  I am not an Irish speaker but I have a great interest in the Irish language.  I am learning the language and I would like to have more time to devote to it.  My eldest child is attending an all Irish school.  It is time that a Minister for the Gaeltacht promoted the use of the Irish language outside Gaeltacht areas. It should be developed in Dublin where <Col N="113" /> there is great support among parents, many of whom cannot speak the language. It is worth looking at Gael-Scoil Inse Chór.  The management of that school kept it going against all odds in St. MacDara's in Templeogue and in St. Damien's school until they acquired a site.  A lot remains to be done for the development of the Irish language in the urban areas of Dublin where there is a love for it.</P>
    <P>In my view the Taoiseach can make a great contribution in developing an interest in the language.  I wrote to the committee established to examine the use of Irish in the House and pointed out that I was interested in developing my skills in the use of the Irish language.  Many imaginative things can be done about the use of the Irish language here.  Is there any reason why Members who want to learn the language should not get an opportunity to lock themselves up in the Gaeltacht for a month, even at the expense of the State?  If we can develop a skill in the use of the language we can encourage our constituents, and others to use Irish.  The Taoiseach should concentrate on giving Members an opportunity to develop a skill in the Irish language.  Officials in the public service are given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the number of Ministers of State. Nobody has said that we should have fewer secretaries or assistant secretaries of Government Departments.  The only call has been for fewer elected Deputies. I do not agree with that.  We are living in a democracy and I do not see why it should not be possible to delegate to Members executive functions and to hold them accountable to the House.  The development of the Dáil committee system will have to be looked at.  In Canada which has an adversarial parliamentary system similar to ours Ministers and departmental secretaries are reshuffled from time to time.  Citizens in that country do not bat an eyelid when those changes take place.  I want to see more involvement of public representatives in the running of the country and I suggest that the Taoiseach look <Col N="114" /> at the Canadian system with a view to reshuffling departmental secretaries occasionally.  That system works well in Canada.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy Ray Burke has been appointed Minister for Energy.  As a Dublin Deputy I should like to ask him to look at the question of the safe use of the gas grid in Dublin.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to report to the House soon on that matter.  I am sure he is aware of the public concern about gas.  Last December I expressed my concern about the gas grid in Dublin, long before the tragedy at Raglan House or the incident at Dolphin House.  I am genuinely concerned, like other Dublin representatives, about the safe use of the gas grid in Dublin.  I hope this can be got under control before a major catastrophe occurs.  The Taoiseach will be aware that I raised this matter in a calm way before any explosions occurred.  I appeal to the new Minister to get involved in this and report to the House at an early opportunity because we may face a major problem. I wish the Government well and I wish the Ceann Comhairle well.  I hope we can have a constructive working relationship in the House and that the 25th Dáil will be successful.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment and wish him well in that office.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Haughey on his election as Taoiseach and to wish the members of the Cabinet every success in the onerous tasks that lie ahead of them.  I am sincere about that because at this time in our <Col N="115" /> history we have to put other considerations aside and act in the national interest.  Many subjects have been touched on tonight and I do not intend to go over the ground again but I was disappointed that the Taoiseach in appointing his Cabinet, and junior Ministers, made no reference to Border areas.  As a Deputy from a Border constituency I accuse all parties, including my own, in relation to trading across the Border.  There is little point in the kettle calling the pot names.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been guilty of misreading the problem, as have Fine Gael, but the sad fact is that there is an economic crisis in Border areas.  Petrol filling stations on our side of the Border have closed down and hotels and licensed premises are finding it hard to exist.  Family businesses are just holding on.  The problem will not go away and we will have to do something about it.  If we do not tackle the problem it will get worse.</P>
      <P>Some months ago Members from all parties decided, in the best interests of Border areas, to establish an all-party committee to monitor what is going on in those areas.  The problems there demand the attention of all concerned.  We are caught up in a dangerous situation.  I am aware that the Government, like the previous administration, have a responsibility to get our economy into a proper state and that that means facing serious challenges.  However, in meeting those challenges we are putting businesses on this side of the Border in peril.  Unfair competition across the Border is driving many people on this side out of business. It is becoming a wasteland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever help I can give as an Opposition Deputy will be given in the greater interest of all concerned.  This requires the attention of all parties.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he should look seriously at the possibility of structuring an all-party committee with secretarial back-up to monitor what is wrong and to make sure that measures taken to deal with domestic problems in the Republic will not exacerbate the position in Border areas.  The Taoiseach might give one of <Col N="116" /> his Ministers or junior Ministers the responsibility for dealing with this and I hope I would be allowed to make an honourable input, in the interests of resolving problems rather than scoring party political points.</P>
    <P>The question of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be part of the debate that lies ahead in the next three or four years or whatever time this Government remain in office.  I had responsibility as spokesman for the Fine Gael Party between 1977 and 1981 and I was disappointed that I was not given the responsibility to see that things I believed in could be achieved, but that is yesterday's news. Because of my experience I had the occasion to lecture British politicians, before the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and tell them that they should take up a neutral position in Northern Ireland and stop looking at the two traditions, one as an enemy and the other as a friend.  Most of us in this House come from one of those traditions but we are not enemies.  Tens of thousands of our people went off and fought wars for Britain; enemies do not do things like that.  Hundreds of thousands of our people went to England, Scotland and Wales where they married and brought up families and lived as law-abiding citizens; enemies do not do things like that.  We as a people objected to the politicies of the British Government in Northern Ireland and to that extent we were anti-British, but only to that extent. I pointed out that the people whom they looked on as friends were only friends because they agreed with the policies of the British Government in Northern Ireland, but if it ever came to pass that the British Government were to change their position in Northern Ireland and take up a pro-united Ireland stance, then their old enemies might become their new friends and their old friends might soon become their new enemies.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement has given an insight into what is happening in Northern Ireland.  The agreement has been criticised by people who do not understand what it claims to achieve.  The agreement was brought about to put something in place which was not there <Col N="117" /> beforehand.  Something had to be done. Two sovereign Governments came together and produced what we know as the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is a constitutional agreement entered into by two sovereign parliaments.  I support the terms and the spirit of the agreement, but I feel entitled to say that it is lacking in a human dimension.  We are dealing with a human problem in Northern Ireland and one cannot solve a human problem by looking at books and being academic.  One cannot solve a human problem by dealing with constitutional matters without getting people together behind the effort.  We will not succeed with this agreement if we do not win the confidence and goodwill of those Irish people who call themselves pro-British or Unionists.  I hope we will become more human in our approach and offer the hand of friendship to those people who find it difficult to give their hand in thanks.</P>
    <P>I have a personal relationship with the new Taoiseach because of the number of years we have both served in the House. It would be easy for people in the North of Ireland to generate a hate image for our Taoiseach.  That would be a tragedy. My advice, for what it is worth, is to make sure this does not come about.  The leader of the nationalist people in the South is not deserving of being put into a position where he is made a hate figure.  That would be very dangerous.  I know the Taoiseach is probably aware of this and I hope he will take appropriate steps through public relations to make sure that he will overcome this terrible divide which separates our people and bring a quick end to the carnage which is taking place so that we can create a society where all people will share a pride in calling themselves Irish, no matter what church they go to or whether they go to none.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Blaney, spoke earlier about Patrick McIntyre who is appealing against an extradition warrant. I know this boy very well.  I visited him a couple of times in Long Kesh while he was there and I know his family exceptionally well.  Having given the matter <Col N="118" /> very serious consideration.  I must say that the sentence initially was too severe for the crime he committed and I hope that may be taken into consideration in dealing with his case.  In protesting against the extradition of Patrick McIntyre it should also be said that Deputy Blaney was a Cabinet Minister in the Government which introduced the legislation which is now being used to extradite Patrick McIntyre.</P>
    <P>I say to the Taoiseach and the new Government that any help I can give, any service I can provide in helping to overcome the many difficulties that confront them is to be had for the asking and I will work in the national interest in any capacity they may require.  I wish them every success in the work which this House has given them the responsibility to discharge.</P>

I know that, as in the past, you will distinguish yourself in your current office.  I extend my congratulations to the Taoiseach and the members of the Government and in particular to the Minister for Finance.  Every cutback starts in Finance and every new expenditure has to be sanctioned by Finance.  Very quickly the Minister for Finance becomes the most unpopular internal member of the Government and I wish him steel nerves in the weeks and months ahead. He certainly does not have an easy job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly make some constructive comments which I hope the Taoiseach and the members of the Government will take up.  Over the past four-and-a-half years as a backbencher I have tried in my own small way to make sure that the procedures of this House work.  I was chairman of an Oireachtas committee and I produced a Private Members' Bill seeking to ban below-cost selling.  In both areas I must say that in principle Dáil reform works but in practice it does not. If a Private Members' Bill gets past <Col N="119" /> Second Stage it must go to a select committee of this House.  Unfortunately our whole system is a pyramid structure.  I am sure that Fianna Fáil backbenchers and even Ministers of State will find out very quickly that the Cabinet have all the executive authority.  It is not possible on the basis of confidentiality to extend that. We need to develop along the lines of every other parliament in Europe.  We should have a lottery system for Private Members' Bills, especially where Bills would not incur new expenditure.  They should be facilitated and the Government should take an open attitude towards them.  The procedure relating to a select committee of the House after Second Stage should be dropped and Government Departments should be available to assist.  It is wrong to assume that a monopoly of wisdom in relation to legislation lies within State Departments.  The Oireachtas committees worked in so far as there was a commitment by the members of those committees in the 24th Dáil, but unfortunately at the end of the day they were only talking shops.  Unfortunately they were only talking shops because there was no effective follow-up in terms of the implementation of any of those constructive reports.  I hope that some procedure will be devised to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to the restructuring of Government, an opportunity has been missed tonight because the Department of Defence are the most lightweight and there is a strong case for combining them with the Department of Justice.  I know that responsibility for the Department of Justice is particularly onerous but with evolvement in the whole area of security, one Minister could do both jobs and, more importantly, would allow within the constitutional limitations of the number of Cabinet Members, the appointment of a Minister for Tourism.  I was appalled two years ago to see that in the Department of Industry and Commerce a section of eight people headed by an assistant principal officer was dealing with tourism, it had the same ranking as legal metrology which means that the <Col N="120" /> encouragement for people to use kilos and litres was as great as our whole tourism effort.  This is the greatest growth sector in terms of the international economy and we have the potential to increase our share.  It is worth £1 billion at present and will be employment intensive in the future.  Nevertheless, we only commit £28 million of State resources to this area.</P>
    <P>I support the Taoiseach in his ambitious plans for that area but I should like to see a full ministry involved &mdash; not just for the sake of having a ministry &mdash; but because the biggest problem in tourism is that the effort is disparate in so far as the Office of Public Works are responsible for monuments, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry look after wildlife services and local authorities deal with signposting.  The B &amp; I also took for their share, they all move in different directions and, unless tourism is central to the Cabinet table, with a proper Departmental secretary along the lines of the &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; on television, it will be left behind.</P>
    <P>Science and technology are rightly recognised as the most significant area in relation to employment because of the numbers of workers who will be displaced. The NBST submitted a proposal to the Government in 1984 recommending the setting up of infrastructure for biotechnology and AMT involving the private sector and third level education which would form the background for creating 600 jobs in the area of technology. Those plans need to be implemented and I hope they will be included in the Estimates because it is the most significant step that any Government could take, creating a framework for employment creation through new technology.</P>
    <P>I hope that the establishment of an office in the area of forestry will not negative the proposal to include it in a semi-State body because the transfer of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to a semi-State body has been successful and I am sure that there would be equal success if there was such a move in the <Col N="121" /> forestry area.  I also hope that the Taoiseach will not forget to nominate someone from County Wexford as we are a neglected area in many ways.</P>
    <P>I wish this minority Government well, they have enormous problems but they can take comfort from tonight's debate in so far as the Opposition spent more time attacking each other than attacking Fianna Fáil.  Fine Gael will be putting forward constructive proposals, I hope they will be accepted in that spirit and that we will bring about political stability through co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly heartened and encouraged by the general reception my new Government have received and by the constructive tone of the debate. On behalf of myself and my colleagues I wish to express our appreciation of the generous offers that have been made of support for our efforts in dealing with the many problems we will confront.</P>
      <P>The debate ranged over many issues and many of the Deputies who spoke put forward genuine inquiries about the form of the Government, the changes proposed, their extent and implications.  I hope in due course to deal with them all but not this evening.  I wish to refer to the proposal which has attracted some attention, to allocate the Department of the Gaeltacht to the Taoiseach.  I can assure my old friend, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, that this proposal is meant to upgrade that Department and to award it greater priority and importance than it has had up to now.  Successive Governments have been guilty of the practice of tagging the Department of the Gaeltacht on to another Department and making it an appendage and it was to get away from that practice that I have taken this &mdash; perhaps unusual &mdash; step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In forming this Government, I am conscious of the fact that we face tasks and challenges which are greater than any incoming Government have had to face for decades.  Public confidence and morale need to be restored if we are to put the failures we have suffered for some time behind us and revitalise our national life.  That revitalisation, I am convinced, <Col N="122" /> must begin with economic recovery.  We must take the measures necessary to put the economy back on the path of greater growth in employment.  These measures will require many difficult decisions and will certainly have to be implemented with skill, energy and resolution on the part of the Government and indeed with understanding and support from the House in general.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have heard me say on other occasions that there is more to running a country than managing the economy. I want to emphasise that at this stage in our affairs it is the effective management of the economy which must take priority.  We on this side of the House published in detail during the election campaign a programme for national recovery setting out specific policies and programmes for the various economic and social sectors.  We now have an opportunity to rebut the criticism of that programme, that it contained nothing but aspirations.  We accept the challenge to prove that the programme can be implemented and can be more than simple pious hopes and aspirations.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the essential principle with which we will implement that programme and manage the economic and social life of the nation in its present precarious state.  Generally, we accept the broad thrust of the recent National and Economic Social Council Report entitled <i>A Strategy for Development.</i> That strategy consists of four elements, the correction of the fiscal imbalance, tax reform, greater social equity and the development of the economy to give increased growth in employment.  These elements are consistent with our view of what is required and we are heartened by the fact that consensus on that strategy exists among the principal economic and social partners represented on the council. It is my intention to meet shortly with the council to discuss their findings and recommendations in greater detail.</P>
    <P>We intend to manage the public finances so as to reduce progressively excessive levels of Government borrowing particularly for current expenditure.  The <Col N="123" /> current budget deficit will be progressively reduced and we will commence that process in 1987.  Just how far we will be able to go in 1987 will not be clear until we have had an opportunity to measure and assess options and choices which are there.  Already we know, for instance, that because of the delay that unfortunately happened in bringing in a budget because of the political situation there has been a slippage in the Estimates of expenditure and revenue for 1987 but, as we have already announced and I now reiterate, we will at least contain Government expenditure in 1987 at or below the 1986 expenditure levels measured as a percentage of GNP.  As stated in our programme and as recommended in the NESC report, the growth of the national debt as a percentage of GNP will be slowed and reversed by firm fiscal policy. That policy will be accompanied by consistent monetary and exchange rate policies. The result of these policies firmly pursued will be to improve confidence and to create a monetary and economic climate &mdash; with due apologies to Deputy Michael D. Higgins here &mdash; which will be conducive to greater economic activity but will also stimulate actively that greater economic activity and increase investment in employment.  We will review immediately in consultation with the financial institutions the other interests concerned and the composition and causes of the exceptional flight of funds from the country in recent times to see what measures can be taken to encourage such funds to remain in or to return to our economy.</P>
    <P>Increasing employment and reducing unemployment are our major economic and social objectives and I know that those objectives are shared on all sides of the House.  Our growth and development programmes for industry, agriculture, food processing, real resources, horticulture, forestry, tourism, the construction industry, international financing services and semi-State companies are comprehensive and constitute a dynamic action programme to generate employment and growth in output.  The <Col N="124" /> reorganisation of Government Departments which I have announced has been made with those development programmes in mind.  I take fully aboard some of the criticisms that have been made about the changes that have been proposed and as a first step in the constructive and co-operative attitude about which we have been talking here this evening I propose to talk particularly with outgoing Ministers who have made some criticisms and, indeed, with other Deputies, about these proposals that we are making before their final details are settled.  I hope that I can assure the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, that it is not intended to set up a number of costly new bureaucracies but to try within the existing resources to reorganise the administrative structures more efficiently in the form of the offices that we propose, administrative structures which will be able to focus more directly on the particular development areas and programmes which we have in mind.</P>
    <P>In the EC we will support the measures which the Commission envisage to bring about greater economic cohesion in the Community.  I have already had the benefit of wide-ranging discussions with the Irish Commissioner, to whom I would like at this stage to say a very sincere word of public thanks for his help and co-operation, and with the President of the Commission.  I have received very firm assurances from the President and the Irish Commissioner of full understanding and support for Ireland's special problems. I was glad to avail of the opportunity to assure them of our commitment to the Community's objectives for greater cohesion and I explained particularly to the President our special concern that in any revision of the CAP the needs of the family farms throughout Europe should be differentiated from those of other agricultural enterprises in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Our taxation policies will seek greater equity and relief initially by recovering arrears which are due by the introduction of a system of self-assessment for the self-employed and by the achievement of a <Col N="125" /> situation in which two-thirds of our taxpayers will pay tax only at the standard rate.  Our ultimate objective, of course, will be to lessen the burden of taxation particularly on the lower paid and, as everybody in the House recognises fully, that can be achieved only by having more people in paid employment paying taxes. Social welfare benefits will be maintained in real terms.  Payment of the increased benefits in 1987 will be made from July 1987.</P>
    <P>We will work to create a consensus on the direction and development of education and we will guide that development more closely towards employment opportunities that are available.  Our health services must be safeguarded and developed with efficient use of resources and emphasis on community care rather than on hospital-based care, the promotion of personal health and the widest role possible for the VHI.</P>
    <P>We will support fully and press for all and any worthwhile reforms and improvements in the position of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; particularly the Nationalist community there &mdash; which can be brought about through the Anglo-Irish Agreement without prejudice to the reservations which we sincerely hold on the constitutional aspects of that agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government come into office in circumstances which threaten the economic stability and the social solidarity of our society.  Our principles and programmes are clear and our intention is to implement them with courage and resolution. We will look for goodwill and support for our efforts both at parliamentary level here in this House and from the nation as a whole.  The task we face in containing and improving the stability of the fiscal, economic and social life of our nation is complex and difficult. All of us in our different capacities in this House must work together to the greatest extent we can to meet the challenge that confronts us today on every side.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I am greatly encouraged by the general atmosphere in which this discussion has been conducted, the contributions that have been made and <Col N="126" /> the very patent and sincere wish by so many on all sides to help Government in this difficult task.  It will be my particularly earnest personal wish to the greatest extent possible to avail fully of the great reservoir of experience and knowledge that exists in the membership of this House and to accept and look out for and seek constructive advice and comments, and particularly to listen to what is said in our debates here and to get the maximum possible guidance from the membership of the House.  That may be a very important contribution indeed in helping us to overcome our difficulties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that we hope very shortly to get down to looking at constructing and devising procedures for the more efficient carry on of our business here in the House.  A number of Deputies have spoken about the committees and I know that there will be a general wish on all sides that we set about recreating the committee structure.  We have learned a great deal from the committees that were established in the last Dáil.  Perhaps I interpret the wishes of the House correctly in suggesting that maybe there should be a lesser number of committees and an effort to make them more effective, but we can discuss that matter in a total non-partisan way.  However, I think we all agree that there should be more effective use of the committee structure. We made a fair amount of progress in the last Dáil and we should build on that progress in the future.</P>
    <P>Again I express my appreciation to the outgoing Taoiseach for all the very generous and helpful co-operation he has afforded me prior to the take-over by this Government.  He and his Ministers have been quite exceptionally co-operative and helpful in making sure that in so far as they were concerned I would not be at the slightest disadvantage in coming into office today.  I appreciate that greatly and I think it augurs well for the future.  I would like members of the general public who criticise us politicians and the political process to know that sometimes we can work together in a general spirit of co-operation for the common good.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and <Col N="127" /> the Members of the House for the welcome which was given to the Government. It is now our responsibility to accept the duties which the electorate placed upon us and which Dáil Éireann has confirmed today.  I hope we will be able to use all our abilities and our capacities to successfully undertake the difficult task and the challenge that lies ahead.</P>
