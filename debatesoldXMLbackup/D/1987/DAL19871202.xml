      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business if it is his intention during the forthcoming European Council meeting at the end of this week to press for concerted action by the member states of the European Communities to deal with the effects on us of the slide in the value of the dollar?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach do a little more than keep it in mind?  He will remember that some weeks ago I asked him the same question, or broadly the same question.  He assured me at that stage that he would be pressing for any action that could be taken at Community level.  This week presents probably the best opportunity he will have.</P>

      <P>A month ago I asked the Taoiseach when we would see the ACOT-AFT merger Bill and I was advised at the time that it would be circulated before the end of November. Now that the deadline has been passed could I raise two questions with the Taoiseach? First, when now does he expect the Bill to be circulated and, secondly, does he expect that the Bill will be debated and passed through all Stages before the Christmas recess?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that proposal I wish to raise a certain reservation with regard to amendment No. 4.  I would ask that amendment No. 4 also be taken with amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 5.  I read your communication this morning addressed to Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to amendment No. 4 where you advised that that amendment would be outside the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not seek to challenge that.  As I understood it, the guiding indicator for the purpose of any Bill is its Long Title.

      <P>What do you propose in regard to amendment No. 2 which relates to section 1 of the Bill?  If we do as you suggest, we will have debated section 2 before we will have dealt with an amendment to section 1.  With respect, could you also take amendment No. 8 in conjunction with the other amendments you have just mentioned as it also relates to the main principal of the Bill which relates to section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the basis that amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 5 are there suggestions as to what should happen before a warrant is backed.  You propose to take those together and as amendment No. 8 is a fourth suggestion, it seems sensible that all of them should be on the table together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 deals with a different issue altogether.  Amendment No. 8 should be taken with amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10 and 20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues dealt with in amendment No. 8.  First, there is the question of the person who <Col N="385" /> is going to be involved in this procedure. Our suggestion is that it should be the DPP.  I accept that that issue has a bearing on the amendments mentioned by the Minister.  Also dealt with in the amendment is the state of mind that is expected of the person who makes the decision.  In our amendment we propose to reverse the procedure that is now contemplated in section 2.  Section 2 requires the Attorney General to issue a directive unless he is satisfied that everything is in order.  Effectively our amendment proposes to reverse that and say that a directive would only be issued if he is satisfied that there is something amiss.  It would seem logical to debate that when the preliminary procedures contemplated by section 2 are before the House.  I suggest that it should be possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is no agreement that amendment No.  8 should be taken in the manner he has outlined.  My formal proposal to the House is that amendment No. 8 be taken with amendments Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10 and 20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

The Taoiseach and the Minister <Col N="386" /> for Justice since they came to office knew they were entirely dissatisfied with this matter and it is quite unreasonable of them to bring this before the House in this rushed fashion.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Part I</P>
      <P Just="Center">Evidence in Extradition Proceedings in relation to Offences</P>
      <P>1. &mdash;(1)  In any proceeding under Part III of the Principal Act in respect of any warrant for the arrest of a person who is for the time being a citizen of Ireland and is accused of an offence, a final order shall not be made under section 47 of that Act unless documentary evidence within the meaning of this section shall have been produced to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In this section, `documentary evidence' means an affidavit or statutory declaration setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that the offence to which the request for extradition or warrant, as the case may be, relates has been committed and that <Col N="388" /> the person before the District Court committed it.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by regulation made under this Act in relation to `documentary evidence' provide for any or all of the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  the persons or classes of persons who may swear an affidavit or make a statutory declaration,</P>
    <P>(b)  the persons before whom an affidavit may be sworn or a statutory declaration made,</P>
    <P>(c)  the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration and the manner and place in which it is to be sworn or made,</P>
    <P>(d)  the means of knowledge required of a deponent,</P>
    <P>(e)  the documents, if any, that shall be exhibited in an affidavit or statutory declaration,</P>
    <P>(f)  such other matters as appear to be necessary or expedient for the proper working of this section,</P>
    <P>(g)  the revocation or amendment of any order made under this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  A document purporting to be an affidavit or statutory declaration for the purposes of this section shall be received in evidence by the District Court when tendered without further proof and it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that the document was made for the purposes of this section and in accordance with the provisions of any order for the time being in force under subsection (3)  of this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  In considering whether or not an affidavit or statutory declaration sets forth reasonable grounds for believing that the offence, to which the request for extradition or warrant relates (as the case may be), has been committed and that the person before the District Court has committed it, the Court shall have regard only to the matters set out in the affidavit or statutory declaration and any matters duly exhibited therein.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> (6)  Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary a person who swears an affidavit or makes a statutory declaration for the purpose of this section shall not be liable to be summoned before the Court or cross-examined thereon in the course of any proceedings under Part III of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as may be after it is made and shall not have effect unless a resolution approving the said regulation is passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>(8)  In this Act `the Principal Act' means the Extradition Act, 1965.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek to substitute some reasonable and simple procedure which would take place in an open courtroom for the convoluted and complex procedure that is being put forward by the Government in section 2 and which will take place in secret in the office of somebody who is not a judge but who will be required to make a decision in regard to the extradition or otherwise of a person who will not be present, who will not know what is alleged against him and who will have no opportunity to make any representation or observation on the matters that are alleged against him.  In my view it is perfectly reasonable that such an amendment should be put forward and that such an amendment should be accepted.  The Bill deals only with our extradition relations with Britain and Northern Ireland.  Amendment No. 1 has been drafted as closely as possible to the provisions of Article 8 of the Irish-US Extradition Treaty, signed in Washington in 1983.  In 1986 the United Kingdom and the United States entered into a further extradition treaty which was ratified in that year after a lot of delay by the US Senate.  That treaty contains very similar provisions to what is in the Irish-US Treaty.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, therefore, that both Ireland and Britain, acting independently, have agreed on an extradition procedure of this type with a common <Col N="390" /> third party.  I fail to see how, therefore, Ireland or Britain can reasonably object to operating a similar procedure as between themselves.  If it is good enough for them in their dealings with the Americans it is, I suggest, good enough for them in their dealings with one another. It has not been alleged in the course of the many legal and other views that have been expressed here, to the best of my recollection, that this proposal of ours in any way contravenes either the extradition Convention of 1957 or the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism of 1977 nor is it in any way incompatible with the Extradition Act, 1965, or the 1987 Act.  It is perfectly workable from that point of view and it is also clearly constitutional.</P>
    <P>Many claims, assertions or allegations of unconstitutionality have been made in the course of this debate inside and outside the House but nobody has claimed or alleged that the procedure that is set forward here is unconstitutional.  I fail to see how it can be unconstitutional if it is accepted, and was accepted by the House, as part of the Irish-US Extradition Treaty.  It seeks to use the court in the spirit of the Constitution but, at the same time, it does not try to confer on any non-judicial personage any judicial activity or judicial function.  I have heard at least one commentator say it is the most sensible of the various suggestions that have been made to try to overcome the difficulties that relate to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>So far as this amendment, and the others associated with it, and amendments generally are concerned &mdash; we now have 26 of them &mdash; it is noteworthy, and this is something that should be said early in the debate, that there are no amendments from the Government.  One is entitled to ask why, in view of the relatively diffident speech made by the Minister for Justice last night, in which he was holding himself open to all kinds of possibilities for changes or amendments. Will amendments be made at the instigation of the Government and, if that is the case as one might suspect from the <Col N="391" /> end of last night's debate, will they be Fine Gael amendments?  If so, I wonder which amendments they are.  It might shorten this debate very considerably if we were to know what the position is in this regard.</P>
    <P>It seems remarkable that, for a Bill the Government seem to be so tentative about, they should put forward no amendments or give any clear indication of what amendments they will accept, other than what we got last night at the end of the speech by the Minister for Justice.  I had the text in front of me when he was making his speech, but the most interesting things he had to say were not in the text.  They were the parts he added at the end.  He scrapped the last page or two of his printed text which he had circulated and talked about one or two Fine Gael amendments, including the amendment about reviewing this Bill at the end of 12 months.  If I heard him correctly he said he thought there did not seem to be any great difficulty there.</P>
    <P>Looking at this amendment today I see that this Bill will go out of effect after 12 months.  I wonder if that will be the case? If the alleged safeguard which is contained here, the one we are trying to replace by what I think is a better safeguard, is such that it will be allowed to go out of effect after 12 months then it cannot be much of a safeguard.  Is it necessary to have this legislation enacted just for 12 months in order that the pressure under which the Government find themselves, internally or from behind, can be overcome and that then we can get back to what many people might call normality?  If it is a 12 month safeguard it seems to be not just an illusory safeguard but a very temporary one indeed, and it is one the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, among others, might well put their minds to at present.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to debate this amendment which goes to the very root of this Bill without adverting to the context in which the debate is taking place.  Last night I found it disturbing at this time of the existence of the Anglo-Irish Agreement when, on the face of it, Anglo-Irish <Col N="392" /> relations should be at their best, to find salvos crossing the Irish Sea between Westminster and this House, between the British Prime Minister and the Irish Minister for Justice.  I am not blaming the Minister for Justice for the rather limited amount he said, but it is a regrettable regression to the bad old days that Anglo-Irish dialogue appears to be carried on once again in terms of public recriminations.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement has been in existence for two years.  One of its several purposes was to allow disputes and difficulties between the two Governments to be sorted out on a daily basis within the machinery set up for the resolution of such difficulties or disputes. My information is &mdash; and it is not a sudden flash of light or anything because it has become increasingly clear over the past six months &mdash; that the day-to-day working of the apparatus of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which should be used to sort out this type of problem, has largely fallen into disuse, that the agenda is getting shorter and shorter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was putting the amendment which is central to this issue because it is proposing a much less objectionable provision for an objectionable provision.  I said we have to do this in the context of the Anglo-Irish climate which, unhappily, has deteriorated.  We hear all <Col N="393" /> these recriminations, and I heard more this morning on radio.  If we try to view this purely from a British point of view, we can see why they are dissatisfied and unhappy about this provision in section 2 which we are trying to change.  They may be unhappy with what we are trying to substitute as well, but it is very regrettable that things have come to this.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Dukes said he thought the Anglo-Irish Agreement was being adopted by the Government and was being used by them, and he sought to be as helpful to the Government as he could to try to prevent any great falling out with regard to this Bill.  I have to say to him and to others that the truth is that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been gradually let run down.  You can kill something with a knife or let it die gradually through malnutrition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the amendment deals with the necessary application to our extradition law &mdash; Article 8 of the Irish-US Treaty.  Article 8.4 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>When the request for extradition relates to a person who has not been convicted, it shall also be supported:</P>
      <P>(a)  by the original or an authenticated copy of the warrant of arrest, or equivalent order, issued by a competent authority of the Requesting State;</P>
      <P>(b)  by the original or an authenticated copy of the complaint, information or indictment; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a request emanating from Ireland, by a statement of <Col N="394" /> facts, by way of affidavit or statutory declaration, setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed and that the person sought committed it.</P>
    <P>We have adapted that concept and feel it should be adopted here because by anyone's standards it is reasonable.  It is reasonable as far as the British are concerned because they have been working it for a long time.  It is reasonable as far as we are concerned because we are working it also with the Americans.  Since both of us are working it with the Americans, there is no reason why we cannot work it with one another.  It is not suggested that it conflicts with any of the treaties or conventions.  It is compatible with our existing law and practice.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the proposal which it seeks to replace is constitutionally very dubious; it is very doubtful also if it is workable.  The point made by my colleague, Deputy McDowell in regard to it the other day was not replied to last night by the Minister for Justice or anyone else. The point was that in section 2, which we seek to replace, there is no obligation on anybody to bring any such application for extradition before the Attorney General. The section is drafted in a most convoluted way which tries to prevent a review of it by the courts and one of the traps into which it has fallen as a result is that there is no obligation to have it examined by the Attorney General. What safeguard is there, therfore, for anybody if it is possible to ignore the Attorney General if it so suits the authorities at any given moment?  How can it be argued by anyone here that this constitutes a safeguard if you do not have to go near the man who is supposed to make the decision as to whether you will be extradited?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech that they would all have to go to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can say all he wants in his speech but that makes no difference.  The provisions of the Bill <Col N="395" /> and, ultimitely, if they are passed in the Act, are the only things that count.  A person whose extradition is sought cannot go down to the Four Courts in a couple of months' time and argue that while the Act does not make it necessary to go to the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice on 1 December in Dáil Éireann said it was.  A person would get short shrift if he tried that argument.  I am amazed, in view of the fact that this was pointed out by Deputy McDowell several days ago that no effort was made by the Minister to try to cover this point.</P>
      <P>It seems there is not a great desire to make this work or to make it permanent. The real desire is to get over the political hump which the Government see facing them at present.  If they can get through the next week or so in relation to this and placate those behind them they will be happy and will have achieved their objective. They do not greatly care whether this Bill, when passed, complicates the situation, provides a safeguard or becomes a happy hunting ground for all kinds of complicated litigation.  That is all immaterial to them; they will have achieved their political objective in the short term.  Unfortunately, that to a great extent is what it is all about as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
      <P>I am disturbed to find the Fine Gael Party going to the lengths they are to try to ease the Government's situation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the Deputy be surprised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that they are making it as open as they do because, unfortunately, the question of constitutionality, workability, safeguards or anything else of that nature is secondary to the anxiety at least of Fine Gael to ensure that nothing is done that will rock the boat electorally.  Their electoral preservation takes precedence over any other consideration that might be relevant.  That is not the way to approach this or any other Bill.  If something is wrong &mdash; and there seems to be almost <Col N="396" /> universal agreement that section 2 and the use of the Attorney General in this judicial fashion is wrong &mdash; then it should be replaced by something that is (a) fair, (b) workable and (c) constitutional.  Our amendment meets all those points.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into a long legal argument, because it is a bit sterile, in regard to the whole question of the constitutionality of this but I notice that Deputy Kelly spoke yesterday and that his arguments were adopted last night by the Minister for Justice.  What the Minister perhaps did not have time to put into his script last night was the fact that Deputy Dukes, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, very gently and politely repudiated the views expressed yesterday by Deputy Kelly, as well he might, as do a very high proportion of lawyers in so far as the constitutionality of this Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always possible that the Supreme Court will stand on its head in so far as its recent decisions are concerned.  If it does not stand on its head in so far as several of its recent conditions are concerned, then this provision in section 2 which I seek to remove must be found unconstitutional.  It is always possible that the Supreme Court, composed of fallible human beings, will act on some occasions otherwise than in accordance with common sense.  We had a recent example in this regard when three of the judges in that court upset the ratification of the Single European Act on constitutional grounds.  That sort of decision could always happen again and law is an imprecise science.  One is always floundering to some extent in a grey area.  You can never speak with absolute certainty.  You can only speak with a feeling engendered by what has happened in recent years in respect of matters of this kind.  There is no question that what has happened in the High Court and in the Supreme Court in recent years in regard to matters of this kind makes it abundantly clear that it is most unlikely that the superior courts would uphold the procedure proposed there.  It does not make it certain &mdash; nothing is ever certain in that regard &mdash; but it makes it most unlikely that they <Col N="397" /> will uphold the procedure proposed by the Minister for Justice.  If he is that committed to it, it is fair for us to ask why he is prepared to envisage a period of only 12 months existence for this Bill.</P>
    <P>In fairness to myself and many others, I should make a brief reference to Deputy Kelly's remarks yesterday.  I do not want to labour the point but he said that the proper test of whether something would be regarded as a judicial function is the historical test and that one should look at historical precedent.  He thought there was no reason, therefore, to suggest that bringing in the Attorney General to make this decision as to whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> case or sufficient evidence to warrant extraditing someone was unconstitutional. He also said that if a thing was done in a particular way for a long time it must be assumed that it is non-judicial if it is done by somebody other than a judge.</P>
    <P>I respectfully remind him of a case decided last year &mdash; the State Clerk <i>v.</i> Roche known as the Senezio case because that was the name of the defendant.  A District Court clerk in Dublin had been issuing summonses for countless decades, as his predecessor had done for countless decades before that &mdash; back to the Petty Sessions Act, 1851 &mdash; was found by the Supreme Court at the end of 1986 to be acting in a judicial manner by issuing a summons for dangerous driving.  The Supreme Court found that it was necessary for the clerk to weigh up whether or not there was sufficient evidence before he would issue the summons and since he was not a judge he was not allowed to do that because it was a judicial act.  If that trivial matter of issuing a summons for a traffic offence was held by the Supreme Court within the past 12 months to be a judicial act, how, in God's name and in all common sense can the Supreme Court hold otherwise than that the activity proposed for the Attorney General in section 2 is a judicial act?  It is about 100 times more serious.</P>

      <P>It is certainly not in the script as supplied.  The Supreme Court in that case made it clear that the assessment of evidence, which is much less than the assessment which is required of the Attorney General, is in the words of Chief Justice Finlay inescapably a judicial function.  In this respect that case clarifies an issue which was left undecided by the Supreme Court in an earlier case to which Deputy Kelly referred.  Citing the Costello case Deputy Kelly neglected to draw attention to or overlooked the fact that the Supreme Court decided that the very act of sending someone for trial based on sufficient evidence was a judicial function.  I do not see any real difference between that and what is proposed here.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Kelly but which I do not want to overplay because he was clearly in error in this was his reference to the power of the Attorney General to bring into the Special Criminal Court if he was satisfied that the ordinary courts were inadequate. The Attorney General has no such power.  It is brought in by order of the Government and it does not purport to be an administration of justice and at the same time compatible with the Constitution. There is a specific provision under the Constitution to enable the Government to do that and to enable the Attorney General subsequently to send people for trial before the Special Criminal Court.  It is recognised in the Constitution that those activities would be unconstitutional if a special provision was not made in respect of them and, of course, the special provision is in Article 38 where a special allowance is made for the existence of the Special Criminal Court at particular times and for this use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of any form of non-judicial personage in this capacity will not succeed. I see no point therefore in the substitution, as Fine Gael propose, of the <Col N="400" /> Director of Public Prosecutions for the Attorney General.  While the Director of Public Prosecutions may be more independent and more acceptable from the general point of view because he is not politically involved, the constitutional invalidity of seeking to grant judicial powers to a non-judicial person remains no matter how acceptable he may be as an individual.</P>
    <P>There is also the practical point that if we were to appoint the Director of Public Prosecutions to perform these functions, we could not appoint him without his consent.  Is that consent fortcoming?  Has it been sought?  The Director of Public Prosecutions was appointed to an independent statutory office as a civil servant of the State and not as a civil servant of the Government, subject to various conditions.  The conditions did not include performing any functions under this Bill.  We cannot thrust functions of this nature on him without his consent. It is futile and rather academic to discuss whether or not he can be given these functions if he has not indicated his willingness to accept them.  I have not spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions perhaps since his appointment but I doubt very much that he has been asked or has indicated his willingness to have these powers thrust upon him.  Even if he had, his constitutional invalidity is just as great as the Attorney General's.</P>
    <P>The one proposal that has been put forward that will avoid these difficulties and will still allow us to retain a workable system of extradition which we have an international duty to retain, and which we have a duty to ourselves to retain, is this proposal.  Our proposal will not complicate things or clog them up.  It will not make extradition unworkable as a much more detailed procedure would and there is no real danger of its being in conflict with the Constitution.  Our proposal affords a reasonable degree of safeguard of a kind already in operation without objection from this country or from Great Britain and therefore it should be acceptable to both.  Our proposal is simple and straightforward.  It is public; it is fair; and it is not open to the <Col N="401" /> very serious objections that the alternative provisions proposed would be open to.  For that reason I ask Members of the House to forget about their various prejudices and pressures and agree to this as a reasonable proposal which reasonable people can reasonably agree to.</P>

      <P>The thrust of amendment No. 3 has a fair measure in common with the amendment moved by Deputy O'Malley but it differs from it in one major respect.  Our amendment provides for a hearing before the District Court, as does Deputy O'Malley's amendment, but it also provides that the statement of facts which he refers to is to exhibit within it sworn statements of the witnesses.  That is a very reasonable provision.  Before a person is extradited the basis on which he is to be extradited must be shown to a court at first hand, not at second hand. I do not accept the format that a statement of facts is furnished saying what witnesses may or may not say.  If witnesses are on hand who can set up a case let their statements be put on oath, let them be exhibited in the affidavit of the British Attorney General and submit it. Let a judicial authority, the judicial institutions set up under the Constitution, namely, the courts &mdash; in this case the District Court &mdash; look at them.</P>
      <P>The concept of the Attorney General doing this job I find quite remarkable and unacceptable.  The more I have read this Bill and the sections the more I despair of it having any hope of working in an acceptable manner.  It is full of inconsistencies and difficulties.  Quite frankly, if it ever comes to be operated, I pity the poor Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us in the course of his remarks &mdash; although it is by no means <Col N="402" /> clear from the Bill itself &mdash; that all warrants must be referred to the Attorney General with such back-up information as there may be for them.  That is by no means clear from the Bill, as drafted.  If the Minister says that all warrants are in the same category, what is the meaning of the words &ldquo;or not required&rdquo; in line 33 of the Bill?  That seems to show that there are two categories of warrants, those where the direction is required and those where it is not.</P>
    <P>So the Attorney General, then, receives all warrants &mdash; the Minister tells us &mdash; in the privacy of his room and he looks at them.  I do not know what else he is going to look at.  For example, will he look at a letter from the British Attorney General?  Will he look at statements of witnesses?  Will he look at a statement of facts?  Will he have a telephone conversation with his counterpart in London?  Will he have a discussion about the case?  What will he do?  Nobody knows and nobody will now.  Yet extradition orders will be made or authorised by him or not authorised by him.  Even assuming everything was one hundred per cent and that he operated in a completely independent, objective and judicial manner, even assuming that in fact all that happened, the big difficulty is that nobody will know that.  Nobody will know that it was all above board, even if it was above board.  People will suspect, people will comment.  The media will comment and say it is very strange that an extradition order was made in this case, or very strange that an extradition order was not made in this case.  He is not going to be able to answer for that to the media.  I will tell the House where he will have to answer for it.  He will have to answer for it in court.  It seems to me that in every single case the unfortunate Attorney General will be amenable to be brought into the District Court and put into the witness box.  There will be the pressure.  &ldquo;Mr. Attorney General, take the oath;&rdquo;&ldquo;I swear by Almighty God&rdquo; and so on, and he will be amenable there to the examination and cross-examination of solicitor and counsel for a person who is sought to be extradited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> The Minister is correct, of course, in that he who asserts must prove.  If he wants to assert about the Attorney General he will <i>sub poena</i> the Attorney General in every single case.  I ask the House if it is an acceptable spectacle, that the Attorney General of the country should find himself in the witness box in every single case?  The sorts of questions that will be put to him will be: what papers did you examine, Mr. Attorney General? What intention did you form?  What was your opinion as to the British Attorney General's view of the evidence?  Did you satisfy yourself that the British Attorney General will continue with the case?  On what basis did you satisfy yourself that the British Attorney General will continue with the case?  I contend that that is a totally unacceptable situation.</P>
    <P>We are here dealing with evidence, be it the Attorney General making the decision or be it the District Court making the decision.  In section 44B (b) one is talking about sufficient evidence. Therefore, the question of the sufficiency of evidence comes into play.  If this goes through, one way or another, the Attorney General will have to make a decision as to what is or is not sufficient evidence.  He will be asked about every single warrant, about what papers were produced to him.  He will find himself in an impossible, unacceptable position. Why put him in that position?  It is totally wrong.  It may well be unconstitutional. It is totally unfair to a high legal officer of the State to put him in that position when there are already set up a team of judicial officers, namely, district justices, whose job it is to examine the evidence in cases of this nature.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised here about the constitutionality of the Bill.  There have been arguments put forward that it is constitutional or is unconstitutional. The truth of the matter is that none of us here can pass any definitive opinion on that.  It would require a decision of the Supreme Court to determine whether this Bill is constitutional.  We are talking about a completely new situation. <Col N="404" /> Precedents may be helpful &mdash; and precedents have been cited here on both sides of the House to argue for or against the constitutionality of this Bill &mdash; but none of them covers the case exactly.  We are dealing with a new situation.  If this goes through I have no doubt that the matter will be referred to the Supreme Court for determination.  I will give my opinion for what it is worth: probably it is constitutional but, by no means, would I bet my bottom dollar on it, far from it; one could not be certain about that.  None of us here in this House, giving our opinions and quoting law cases, could be certain of it by any means.  It is a completely new situation, a completely unwarranted situation.  At the very least there must be a fair chance that it would be held to be unconstitutional.  Whether it is unconstitutional or otherwise, the point of the matter is that the scheme of operations set up here is totally unacceptable, totally unworkable.  It will lead to the Attorney General being in the witness box in the District Court and/or in the High Court in every single case.</P>
    <P>How will we operate an extradition system on any basis if we find ourselves in that position?  How will we operate an extradition system in which the whole legal minefield of cross-examining the Attorney General as to what was in his mind, what he examined, what decision he came to is up for grabs?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a misnomer, the Extradition (Amendment) Bill.  Somebody here ought to be proposing an amendment to the title, perhaps something like the constitutional and criminal lawyers endowment and enrichment Bill might be altogether a more appropriate designation. I would imagine that the constitutional and criminal lawyers down in the Law Library must be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of the litigation to which this will give rise.  The purpose of it all is to provide safeguards &mdash; of course that is essential &mdash; but the concoction, the cocktail that is produced here &mdash; as I said in the course of my Second Stage remarks &mdash; is an attempt to find a compromise position between the <Col N="405" /> requirements of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers on the one hand and the British authorities on the other.  It would appear that the Bill has failed dismally on both counts.  Certainly the British are far from satisfied with it and, by all accounts, the Fianna Fáil backbenchers do not seem to be happy about it either.</P>
    <P>We say simplicity is the essential requirement in an extradition position. There is a basic, fundamental decision that has to be addressed here.  I want the Minister to address himself to this.  Does he regard this function, the decision of the final arbiter on extradition &mdash; yea or nay as to whether a person is to be sent out or not &mdash; a political decision or a judicial decision?  We ought to know that. Is it a political decision or is it a judicial decision?  If it is a political decision the Minister himself is the political officer. He already has the power under section 44 of the 1965 Act to withhold warrants, not to back warrants.  In addition, he has the power to refer the matter to the High Court for determination.  If it is a political decision why bring in the third element of the Attorney General?  What does that add to the procedure?  If political decisions have to be made as to whether or not warrants should be backed, then let the political officer concerned, namely, the Minister, exercise the powers that he has and has always had under section 44 of the 1965 Act.  The Attorney General is also a political officer.  He is the adviser to the Government. He is appointed by the Government and can be sacked or removed by the Government if they are so minded. He is caught up in a political situation.</P>
    <P>We know that the present Attorney General and any other Attorney General would do his best to apply an independent mind to any decision that was put upon him, unwillingly put upon him, I would imagine.  Nonetheless, he has a close political affinity and that will be seen and called into question in the public eye. Therefore, it is a political decision.  There is no need to involve the Attorney General. It should be left to the Minister to deal with it.  He is the political personage <i>par excellence</i> on this issue.  He already <Col N="406" /> has that power.  He can give a directive under section 44 that a warrant should or should not be backed.  I believe it must be a judicial function and that it is not in any way comparable to the types of decisions that are given in tribunals or by commissioners of income tax where decisions are given by people who are not judges.  This is a different category altogether.  It deals with assessment of <i>prima facie</i> evidence even the Attorney General's own function under the Bill puts a <i>prima facie</i> decision-making process up to him.  He has to deal with whether or not there is sufficient evidence there.  The Bill itself refers to sufficient evidence, and if you are talking about sufficiency of evidence you are talking about a <i>prima facie</i> situation.</P>
    <P>The words <i>prima facie</i> have been bandied about.  The Minister referred to what I said on that matter in 1986.  In return I should refer to what he said on the issue in 1986.  On 12 December 1986 in the debate on the Extradition Bill, 1986, column 2688, volume 370, the then Deputy Collins said of the Minister for Justice:</P>
    <P>He must have been very upset later in the week when the Taoiseach on a visit to Galway, having flown from London with his batteries charged afresh by those he met in London, felt it necessary to take on the strong-arm approach again and say there would not be any surrender whatsoever in regard to the <i>prima facie</i> matter.  I regret that.</P>
    <P>Those were the words of the present Minister for Justice in 1986.  Deputy Woods who was then Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice said on the Extradition Bill, 1986, on 4 December 1986, volume 370, column 1389: &ldquo;...we will be pressing for the requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be shown in extradition proceedings where appropriate&rdquo;.  On the same day Deputy Woods stated at column 1409: &ldquo;The safeguards which were associated with the old <i>prima facie</i> rule must be restored.&rdquo; There are many other examples not only by the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for <Col N="407" /> Justice but by quite a gamut of Fianna Fáil backbenchers who argued the point.</P>
    <P>The 1957 Convention was raised and the difficulties that would arise in that regard.  That is a contractual arrangement between states.  As we know the UK have not ratified the 1957 Convention and consequently there is no objection whatever to having some form of <i>prima facie</i> requirement introduced to provide a very basic and bottom line safeguard before our citizens are extradited to the UK.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the expression, <i>prima facie</i> requirement, has been bandied about but it can mean different things, and different conditions can be set to it. The Taoiseach, when he introduced this measure, proceeded on the basis that a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would mean statements of witnesses and the production of those witnesses from the UK or Northern Ireland or wherever, in the courts here.  That does not necessarily follow.  I agree that would be too untoward a requirement to have.  We have deliberately avoided any question of a necessity to call prosecution witnesses in the District Court to enable the district justice to make his determination. We have provided that the district justice would look at the sworn statement of facts and the sworn statements of the witnesses that would be exhibited in the British Attorney General's outline of the facts.  It is on those statements alone that the district justice would base a view as to whether a reasonable case was established.</P>
    <P>Any <i>prima facie</i> test, whether it be a full blooded one on oral evidence or simply based on sworn statements, is a very low level of safeguard.  I would have little trouble in devising far more substantial safeguards than a <i>prima facie</i> requirement based on sworn statements of witnesses.  I could devise a much stronger scheme than that.  That is about the lowest scheme that one could devise unless one is to say that all that is required to extradite somebody is the request &mdash; that a warrant is sent and no reason or explanation is given.  If anyone is advocating that kind of proposition, that you <Col N="408" /> just ask for the person, receive him and deal with him thereafter, they should say so.  However, if we are saying that a safeguard is required, what I and the Labour Party are suggesting in amendment No. 3 is the lowest possible form of effective safeguard.  It is a basis safeguard.  It is the bottom line and I do not see how we can pitch the matter lower than that.</P>
    <P>Our citizens are entitled to that protection. We are entitled to know that the right person is being extradited, that there has not been some mistake in identity and that there is some basis in sworn statements whereby if the evidence in those statements stood up at a trial the person could be convicted.  It may be that the witnesses who are making those sworn statements would be proven to be liars or unreliable, that their evidence would not be acceptable, and the person would be acquitted.  At the very least it must be shown, where it can be seen in open court, that this is the person, that the identification is there and the evidence on sworn statements.  The district justice looks at those statements and decides whether, if all the evidence and documents shown are correct, there is a case to answer.  That is what district justices do day in and day out in every District Court up and down this country. For the life of me, I can see no basis for getting away from that established set up which is already there.  We do not have to create or devise any new procedure for this purpose.  It is not necessary.  The whole establishment is set up.  The judicial procedures are set up.  It is well taken care of.</P>
    <P>To come to this weird concoction of the structure of these sections, 44A, B, C and D, it is so convoluted that quite frankly what it will give rise to down in the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court just does not bear thinking about.  I just cannot imagine that this will work in any way at all.  The mind boggles at what the effect will be.  With the negatives and the double negatives, the Minister's suggestion that every single warrant will now come to the Attorney General to be examined with goodness knows what material, goodness <Col N="409" /> knows how he will look at it and in what context he will assess it.  Yet he will be answerable in the witness box in every single case for what he did, how he came to various conclusions and were they reasonable.  He may be asked if he telephoned the British Attorney General to see what else he had on offer, that perhaps the British Attorney General is &ldquo;faxing&rdquo; things over to him.  Maybe he will do it all on fax machines, and we have seen how that system operates.</P>
    <P>We want to be helpful on this issue. We do not want to see enacted into law a system that will bring the matter of extradition and our whole administration into disrepute, and I firmly believe there is a fair possibility of that.  As it stands, the whole thing is totally unworkable. We want to be helpful on this issue.  We want to devise a system under which extradition, in appropriate cases, can and will work in a straightforward, open and simple manner.  What could be more simple and straightforward than a situation where the British authorities say they want to extradite Mr. X for an alleged offence, send over a warrant and statements which are examined in open court by the district justice who is trained in this job, and if he finds that there is a case, he makes the order which is seen and above board?  I urge the House strongly to consider the amendment on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were anxious, nevertheless, to be in a position to move both.  I accept the ruling of the Chair for <Col N="410" /> the moment and look forward to having an opportunity to speak to you about it.</P>
      <P>Our anxiety was that in proposing and pursuing the cause of <i>prima facie</i> case as a requirement in the extradition law it would apply not just to our affairs with Britain but elsewhere.  The discussion here today can be simplified to some degree by moving only amendment No. 5 for the moment.  Our proposal in respect of amendment No. 5 is to amend Part III of the 1965 Extradition Act to insert a new section before section 42 of that Act to provide for the following:</P>
      <P>Where a request is received for the extradition of a person under this Part, the requesting country shall be required to provide, before the District Court, evidence as to the commission by the person claimed of the offence for which extradition is sought, and extradition shall not be granted unless such evidence produced establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of involvement in the offence alleged.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment reflects the proposal pursued by the party in the debate in 1986 when we were dealing with the European Convention on Terrorism and its implementation in our domestic law and again it affects the Private Member's Bill circulated with the agreement of the Government to Members of the House earlier in this session.  For that reason it helps to illustrate the consistency that The Workers' Party have maintained on this issue, a consistency that is there simply because we are looking to first principles and to established principles in relation to a code of extradition law.  We have not, as a party, engaged in efforts to introduce hybrid arrangements, new concepts or concepts that are wholly inappropriate to the judicial process of extradition that is being sought to be entertained here by the Government and, most surprisingly, by Fine Gael in so called constructive Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment we are proposing should commend itself to the House for a number of very specific reasons.  First, it involves a specific declaration of requirement and involves no play on <Col N="411" /> negatives or double negatives, as is involved in the scheme of things under the provisions of the Government's Bill. In this regard we do not accept the obligation by implication that the Minister spoke of last night on the Attorney General to scrutinise all warrants seeking extradition of persons from this country to Britain.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is specific in using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  We cannot see why, if the Government seek or want an active obligation to rest on the shoulders of the Attorney General, they cannot specifically say so.  We are completely suspicious of the use of the double negative ploy that is involved in section 2 of the Bill as they propose it.  Our reading of it, rightly or wrongly, is that there is no active obligation on the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to convey any warrants to the attention of the Attorney General to seek his views on the matter at all.</P>
    <P>Second, our amendment requires the procedures of establishment or not of a <i>prima facie</i> case to be taken in the District Court in the first instance.  It is essential, if we are talking about safeguards of the liberties of innocent people, that that is done openly and in full view of all concerned. The concept of this being dealt with privately, however well intentioned, on grounds that will never be made known to us, in a context that will never be clear to us, is not an acceptable way of dealing with this matter.  It amazes me that those persons within the Government party who are concerned about the introduction of safeguards could have accepted this as an effort to introduce a concept of safeguard.</P>
    <P>Third, it introduces the notion of evidence. There is nothing in section 2 of the Bill that suggests what will be the standard of proof or what will be the equality of proof the Attorney General must or should be satisfied with before he acts under the provisions of that section.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the very clear regime that until all these matters are satisfied, no order for extradition should be made. Central to our amendment is the whole <Col N="412" /> question of the desirability of the <i>prima facie</i> test.  We have consistently pursued that as a principle of safeguard to be incorporated not just into our arrangements with any one country, in this instance Britain, but with regard to all countries.  It is a standard, internationally recognised feature of extradition law. There is nothing new, untypical or unusual about it.  It is employed world-wide. We fail to see why the Government, who less than a year ago argued so forcibly for such a concept, would now a short time later have abandoned it for entirely spurious reasons.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his address to the House when introducing the Bill on 27 November 1987, advanced two reasons as to why a <i>prima facie</i> case now would not be acceptable to Fianna Fáil.  First, it would in some way or other involve us having to depart from the 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  That, of course, is grossly untrue and is misleading this House, because Britain to whom we are addressing this Bill is not a party to that Convention.  It may well be that they are contemplating it, it may well be that for some short time now they have recognised the trend of the deliberations and discussions taking place both at Anglo-Irish level and in the Dáil on extradition. It may well be that the views of Fianna Fáil and many others expressed in this House over a year ago have spurred them on in their efforts to seek accession to the 1957 Convention.  As it stands at present they are not a party, and any introduction in our affairs or relationships with Britain of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement has no implication for us at present in regard to our ratification of the European Convention of 1957.</P>
    <P>The second point raised by the Taoiseach in his address was that the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would be, and I quote, &ldquo;a major practical obstacle to extradition&rdquo;.  Again, we would refute that suggestion.  There is no reason why a <i>prima facie</i> requirement should ever be seen as an obstacle, and to the extent that it might ever become an obstacle it would be so as a mechanism <Col N="413" /> of safeguard that Fianna Fáil themselves so eloquently spoke about a year ago and have been so concerned about in the context of this Bill.  If there is a balance to be drawn, we would say that if an extradition request is to be delayed and made more cumbersome in the pursuit of safeguarding the rights of an innocent person, then that is a desirable set of circumstances and the balance must tilt in favour of the innocent in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is always a source of regret that major legislative reform, particularly in the criminal law area, is debated in the context of some major atrocity where the prospects of reasoned, measured debate is very limited because of the exigency of the moment.  However, if one applies and stands by first principles in these debates, then I do not think we should get ourselves into the difficulties and contortions the present debate is presenting to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in his closing remarks took up substantially the Taoiseach's second point as to a reservation about <i>prima facie</i> presenting, and I quote, &ldquo;an excessive restriction on extradition&rdquo;. As I have stated, the <i>prima facie</i> requirement exists on a wide scale throughout international arrangements in regard to extradition and in all of those cases presents no obstacle or no excessive restriction than any of the practitioners or observers, academic or otherwise, on the working of extradition have ever identified or sought to state.</P>
    <P>What are the reasons the Minister and the Government consider they might well represent an excessive restriction?  It has been suggested that it may involve bringing forward witnesses or documentation and evidence that would make the process cumbersome.  The Minister has stated:</P>
    <P>It could or would also mean if the same level of protection were to be afforded as in an internal case, that witnesses from the foreign jurisdiction would have to be available to be examined upon their sworn depositions should they be called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>Under the 1967 Criminal Procedure Act, <Col N="414" /> the District Court engages in a preliminary investigation, so-called.  It is laid down clearly what that investigation should be based upon, what documents should be produced and procedures established to deal specifically with that. Nowhere in the 1967 legislation are the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i> case&rdquo; used.</P>
    <P>The section, if I recall it correctly, talks about the district justice making orders if he is satisfied there is a case to answer &mdash; that is often used in court parlance as amounting to a finding of <i>prima facie</i> case.  That term, as far as I understand, is nowhere legislatively defined, nor has it been given very clear judicial definition. It is a term loosely employed, probably wrongly, in the context of a determination of a preliminary investigation, but it is a concept well known, as I have stated, to extradition law, but again without clear judicial definition. There is nothing to stop the Government in relying upon it as a process or concept to make specific statutory definition or regulatory definition of it.  There is nothing that makes it incumbent upon the Government, if they were to employ it in extradition law, to make it similar, analogous or as extensive as the requirements under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party in proposing the concept of a <i>prima facie</i> case in the context of extradition make no case that it should be as extensive, as involved, or to use the Minister's terminology &ldquo;as cumbersome as&rdquo; the procedures under the 1967 Criminal Procedure Act.  We are seeking to establish that the cause for the warrant of extradition is subtended by sufficient evidence and that that adjudication is made in open court by a member of the Judiciary.  That is all we ask for.  If that can be done, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, on the basis of documentary evidence, so be it.  If it involves the restriction on the calling of witnesses, so be it.</P>
    <P>The Government under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, brought in an amendment to restrict the working of the 1967 Act procedures, whereby a district justice, where he or she is of the <Col N="415" /> opinion that a witness called for by the defence is outside of the jurisdiction and it would be impracticable to call them, may rule and dispense with the calling of such witnesses.  That happens on a daily basis in our District Courts.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the proponents of the <i>prima facie</i> requirement in extradition law make no case that it should be the same regime as applies to the procedures under a preliminary investigation in the terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  We are contending for open deliberation by a judicial person, where the individual concerned has the right to be represented, to be heard, and to question.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Taoiseach, in particular, sought to underscore the importance of this Convention of 1957 and warned those who talked about a <i>prima facie</i> case that if they advocated the <i>prima facie</i> requirement we should be absolutely clear that that is what it would mean, namely, departure from the 1957 Convention.  Even if that were so, we would seek to argue that the consequences of that are not as disastrous as the Government, or anybody, would like us to believe they would be.  There are many procedures available to the Government in the context of the 1957 Convention.  There is nothing to stop us from denouncing, under the Convention, our membership and seeking to renegotiate, or indeed under the terms of our ratification to seek an amendment, or a further delcaration or reservation, to that ratification.  On close examination of that Convention, looking at the various positions of the parties to it, one wonders whether the Convention, was ever necessary. Clearly, it was a desirable development in so far as it got countries talking and agreeing and, for example, it may well have been the vehicle that prompted us to bring in our 1965 Act in the first place, because within a short number of months of that, in 1966, for the first time we ratified the Convention.</P>
    <P>Let us look very briefly at some of the positions of our partners in Europe under that Convention.  Let us see what they <Col N="416" /> have achieved in the protection of their citizens and other persons, how they have sought to implement the terms of that Convention.  Austria, for example, requires that where a provisional warrant is sought it should be accompanied by a short statement of facts.  That country will not, for example, extradite people to countries where there are special courts established, or where the death penalty may or will be imposed.  Austria, consequently, under the Convention would not extradite persons to stand trial in this country before a Special Criminal Court for a capital offence.</P>
    <P>Cyprus will not extradite its own citizens or nationals and again will not extradite for an offence involving the death penalty.  Denmark will not extradite persons to stand trial before special courts, and has a special reservation that it can consider the age, health and other personal reasons of the person sought before it will agree to the extradition.  It has a very important reservation that goes far beyond that of <i>prima facie</i>.  I shall quote it because it is worth looking at what countries are prepared to do and are doing under this universal European Convention on Extradition.  It has a reservation under Article 12 in regard to the area of <i>prima facie</i> evidence and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Danish authorities may require the requesting country to produce evidence establishing a sufficient presumption of guilt on the part of the person concerned.  Should such evidence be deemed insufficient, extradition may be refused.</P>

      <P>There we have a position where Denmark, a party to the 1957 Convention, has, in effect, a <i>prima facie</i> requirement built into its agreement to and participation in that Convention and does not, as a consequence, have to depart from, or leave the Convention. Why cannot Ireland work to achieve that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The Federal Republic of Germany, for example, makes a requirement that when the documents are sent from a requesting country they should be in the German language, not in the language of the country asking for extradition.  France will not extradite people under the Convention to a country which is trying people before tribunals that it considers do not respect the rights of the prisoner or person in the dock, or that do not respect the proper rights of defence.  It will not extradite its nationals and requires a short memorandum of facts to support the request for a provisional warrant.  That does not involve France having to depart from the Convention.  This is a position they negotiated under it.</P>
    <P>Iceland reserves the right to request evidence to be produced to support any request for extradition.  Italy refuses to extradite for capital punishment, or with regard to an offence involving capital punishment.  Liechtenstein does the same.</P>

Norway has a specific requirement that a <i>prima facie</i> case be established and, again, it is not called into question with regard to its membership of this Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spain refuses to extradite to a country where the trial will take place before a special court.  It is quite interesting to consider this.  We have agreed to the Convention under which, if the perpetrator of Enniskillen, or whoever has committed a terrorist offence in this country, finds his or her way to Spain, we will not be faciliated in an application for the extradition of that person back to our jurisdiction because Spain reserves that right not to extradite to special courts.  I wish to <Col N="418" /> underline that, in all, upwards of seven of the countries with which we have negotiated this Convention reserve the right to refuse to extradite people back to stand trial before courts like our Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Sweden, most strongly of all countries, reserves not only the right to question the basis for extradition to stand trial, but the right to question the actual trial, conviction or sentence imposed by a requesting country.  Even if the person is a fugitive from conviction in another country, Sweden can say that it is not happy with the way in which the trial was conducted, that it feels the verdict was perverse, or that the sentence is unreasonable and may refuse to return a person back to meet that conviction, or serve that sentence.  Yet Sweden is a member of the Convention but has no difficulties whatsoever.  The same applies to Switzerland, in regard to refusing to send persons before an &ldquo;extraordinary court or tribunal&rdquo;, the terminology used. Israel requires sufficient evidence.  Finland refuses to extradite for trial before special courts.</P>
    <P>The point that I am coming to is this: the bland statement of a threat from the Govenment to those persons who pursue the cause of <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it has some serious implications for us in regard to our international obligations abroad is doubly wrong, first, because Britain is not a member of this Convention in the first place and, secondly, even if it were, there is nothing to stop us from renegotiating our position, drawing ourselves into line with the positions adopted by countries which are parties to that Convention.  We would certainly not be out of step.  If anything, even if one takes a brief review or overview of the positions of the other countries, Ireland was very dilatory in 1966 when it negotiated its ratification of the Convention without having any regard to proper safeguards and adopted a position where by it abandoned, for the first time, the long-established principle of <i>prima facie</i> evidence was a precondition to the extradition of any person from our country.</P>

      <P>More recently, our agreement with the United States contains the clause &ldquo;reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo; that the person sought was responsible for the crime under investigation or pursuit.  What is so exceptional about our ratifying the Convention of 1957?  The amendment we have tabled relates only to Britain.  It is open to us to pursue the cause for a <i>prima facie</i> requirement independent of the considerations of the 1957 Convention.  I hope the Government do not look to the provisions of that Convention as an aid or source of inspiration in trying to put down the cause for a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government will not advance the argument that a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would be a gross interference or an excessive obstacle.  If the Government are abandoning the case they made less than a year ago, they will have to admit they are doing so for other reasons.  Those reasons may well be found within the confines of their deliberations with Britain as to how their relationship will progress in the future in the context of cross-national and cross-Border security co-operation and the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is quite clear that the Government in drafting this Bill had received no commitment or agreement from the British authorities to co-operate with our Attorney General in the exercise of the functions he may have under this Bill.  Because there will be no positive duty on the British authorities to convey the document to the Attorney General's Office and because the old arrangement under the 1965 Act where the document was forwarded from one police commissioner to another still stands, it is quite clear that there has been no promise of co-operation with the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not made clear in the Bill as to what documents the Attorney General will consider in the course of making his deliberations and there has been no promise or agreement received from the British authorities as to what documents <Col N="420" /> they will send.  In the McGlinchey extradition debacle, the Supreme Court was convened at short notice to sit late into the evening following which McGlinchey was sent across the Border to meet a case in which clearly there was insufficient evidence against him.  We then had to seek his return to this country to meet a charge where there was clearly sufficient evidence against him.  All this was done in consultation with and on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>No other case illustrates better the pitfalls and dangers that will creep into the process under this Bill than the McGlinchey saga.  There is no doubt the Attorney General was involved on a day-by-day and a minute-by-minute basis in what had happened then and that he advised the Government on it.  At the end of the day can we say that he as a law officer and as an independent legal mind gave due consideration to better or proper procedures in that case?  I doubt it.  I have no doubt that in the future similar situations with equally important political considerations will arise and that equally foolhardy and unsafe decisions will be made if this procedure is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I thought this House might address the comments which are being made by British political commentators but I am more prompted to address a comment which I heard from the Fine Gael benches a few months ago which seemed to suggest that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement was not known to our law in regard to extradition prior to 1965.  I see Deputy Birmingham nodding his wise head slowly in agreement.</P>

      <P>I refer him to any of the basic standard textbooks on extradition. The one I have to hand is not by Mr. Ford which is the one everyone else seems to be relying so heavily on but even he accentuates the point which I would like to make and perhaps in the first instance I will refer to what he said, <Col N="421" /> namely, that the vast majority of extradition arrangements throughout the world contain some <i>prima facie</i> evidence requirement.  We supported the argument, which I put forward earlier, that it is open to each country in the context of each agreement to establish what it considers to be sufficient for the <i>prima facie</i> process when he said what precisely is meant by a <i>prima facie</i> case depends on the very terms of the legislation and the treaty in question.  Therefore, there is no hard and fast rule which says it must be what is envisaged under the 1967 Criminal Procedure Act in regard to domestic proceedings.</P>
      <P>This morning on radio we heard Mr. Ivor Stanbrook, QC, who is an MP for the Conservative Party.  He is very concerned about what we are doing in this country.  His textbook on extradition published in 1980 underlined the fact that from the inception of the extradition procedure as a phenomenon in criminal practice arrangements between countries, Britain and Ireland &mdash; we were then a party to the jurisprudence of that country at the time of the Extradition Act of 1870 &mdash; inserted in their arrangements with Commonwealth and foreign countries that in addition to the formal matters which must be proved, the evidence taken as a whole must prove <i>prima facie</i> guilt of the crime being evidence which would justify the committal for trial of the accused person if the crime had been committed in England.  Section 10 of the Extradition Act, 1870, established in statutory form internationally accepted principles with regard to extradition and they were equally applied in this country. He also dealt with the relations between Commonwealth countries and said that the same considerations applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made that the reason Britain never ratified the 1957 Convention was that it wanted to reserve a position of superiority over its erstwhile colonial countries.  It was repugnant to their notion of the great empire that a former colony could look for one of its citizens to be sent for trial for crimes committed in the colonial country without that country establishing a <i>prima facie</i><Col N="422" /> case or rule.  That was why they never entered the 1957 Convention.  That is why they did not want to be tied by the basic principle of that Convention and why they reserved to themselves and have done so to this date in their relationships with many of their former colonies, the requirement of the <i>prima facie</i> rule.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have from the outset of this debate argued that <i>prima facie</i> is nothing unusual.  It is typical of extradition relationships and order.  It is standard to this type of jurisprudence because it enables the requesting country to safeguard its citizens or those persons found within its territorial bounds in the tradition of asylum.  While the PDs' amendment in substance and in the majority is non objectionable, for some curious reason it is confined to Irish citizens. That may well be because they borrowed it substantially from the Washington agreement.  Perhaps they will consider before the debate concludes whether the wording &ldquo;being a citizen of Ireland&rdquo; should be deleted from their amendment.  We fail to understand why the rights sought to be introduced here in a code of extradition should be confined to Irish citizens with a consequence that a person who, particularly in the context of the EC or whatever, is residing here but is not a citizen of this country would not be entitled to the same standards of proof as we would seek to introduce for our citizens.</P>
    <P>I must make it clear before I sit down that we find the position of the Fine Gael Party, utterly contemptible in the whole debate on safeguards.  Deputy Barrett sought to imply that the high water mark of their contribution to this debate is to transpose the Office of the Attorney General with the Office of the DPP and there it ends.  Unfortunately, it does not. In amendment No. 14 they are suggesting that at no stage, once the DPP gets hold of it and makes his ruling, will any court, district, high or elsewhere, have any right, good, bad or indifferent to comment, review or examine that direction or finding.  It is unbelievable in the context of safeguards that they want to take away from our courts the right to have <Col N="423" /> any function.  Even the Fianna Fáil Bill in all its imperfections concedes that where the Attorney General takes action it is open to court review, but the Fine Gael Party are denying all that in pursuing amendment No. 14.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 15 they are restricting substantially the right of representation to the Attorney General.  By implication they accept their defeat on the issue of the DPP in preference to Attorney General because further on in section 2 they say that the Attorney General cannot be represented to for and on behalf of a person whose extradition is being sought and who is subjected to the direction.</P>

      <P>Our arrangements under the 1965 Act and under the Act which came into force 36 hours ago do not contain such a requirement.  It is central to this whole discussion that the regime of extradition we have had with the British for the past 22 years by itself completely gives the lie to what Mrs. Thatcher is reported as having said in the British House of Commons yesterday.  Far from the British being the least favoured nation, they have been for 22 years &mdash; at least in every respect except that of the political offence until lately &mdash; the most favoured nation.  They are the only nation or state in the world in respect of whom a simplified, streamlined extradition procedure has been provided here by Statute.</P>
      <P>There is no need for a treaty between ourselves and the British; nor has there been since 1965; whereas every other state must go through the negotiation of a treaty with all the built-in provisions, affidavits, requests and so forth.  That is not and has never been necessary in arrangements between ourselves and the North or between ourselves and Britain. It has been a purely administrative police procedure, rightly or wrongly, whereby a warrant issued by the British or Northern Ireland police authority is endorsed and executed here and <i>vice versa</i>.  No other state in the world has got that treatment and, for Mrs, Thatcher when she finds the first obstacle thrown in her path, to speak petulantly as she did yesterday is out of place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure here has been, rightly or wrongly, an administrative procedure. When I hear complaints about this <Col N="425" /> Government, admittedly due to their own internal political actions in order to try to keep happy people whom their ludicrous posturing for a number of years on these matters has disposed to be difficult, let me say that at least they are trying to undo the damage which they themselves caused.  When this Government try to interpolate something which they represent as a safeguard and which I accept they intend as a safeguard, which does not go very far but goes far enough in giving us a fair chance to be certain that the intention to prosecute is there and is reasonably founded, to have the insinuation cast in the House of Commons that we are now going to make it easier after all for this country to harbour terrorists reflects the very bad advice the British Prime Minister was getting from somebody.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as a member of a party who presumably are keen to see the Act which came into force yesterday stay in force.  We passed it against a lot of opposition which I will not go back on and raise weals about now.  We passed it and presumably we still believe in the principle of it and we are anxious that not only should it have come into force but that it should stay in force.  If a certain price has to be paid in order that that should happen I, for one, am not unwilling to pay it.  I would have hoped that the British Government would take enough interest in what goes on here to understand that there were only two alternatives. Everyone who has followed events in this country for the last month must realise that.  Either this safeguard, such as it is, or something like it, is inserted in order to keep the bulk of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers happy or we will not have any additional Act at all.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt in my mind whatever, and I had no doubt from the moment when the Government Press Secretary floated his absurd chestnut about the British Ambassador twisting arms, that the intention that side was to bring resolutions into this House and the Seanad to prevent that Act from coming into force.  Events made them change their minds.  I respect anyone who changes his <Col N="426" /> mind for a good reason, we should be glad that they changed their minds.  If the price they had to pay in their own ranks for changing their minds was this Bill that should dispose, some of us at least, to see what can be said in favour of the Bill and making it as easy as we can.  That would not lead me to say something I did not believe.  I would stay quiet or stay out of the House rather than that.</P>
    <P>I genuinely do not share the apprehensions expressed from that corner of the Chamber in regard to the impropriety of creating this additional function and vesting it in somebody who is not a judge. A member of the Garda Síochána or a private citizen when initiating a prosecution has to make up his mind in his own humble way as to whether there is a sufficiency of evidence.  This is for his purpose, namely, will he make a fool of himself by launching a prosecution which nothing can be got to support.  If he is a member of the Garda Síochána he must ask himself whether he will run the State into needless expense by launching a clearly baseless prosecution.  Everybody has to make decisions &mdash; civil servants and other officials have to make decisions all the time but that is the decision a member of the Court has to make for himself.  That does not make it a judicial decision but if I were to believe the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party of The Workers' Party, it does.  A member of the Garda Síochána is in the same position in that regard as the Director of Public Prosecutions or as, until 1974, the Attorney General was.  They, too, have to make up their minds whether there is sufficient evidence there to ground a prosecution.  I hope I do not need to labour this point to any lawyer in the House.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in quality &mdash; in concrete terms it would be difficult to explain it to a layman &mdash; between the degree of certainty, the degree of conviction that you are required to carry in your mind between the amount of evidence you believe you can produce, and which you feel will justify you in launching and conducting a prosecution, and the amount of evidence which, if you <Col N="427" /> were up on a bench, would allow you to feel justified in convicting someone.  Do not ask me to weigh on a diamond scale the difference in the weight of these two volumes of evidence.  I cannot do that but the function of deciding whether you have enough in the dossier to justify the expense, the trouble and the possible humiliation and public annoyance of prosecuting someone if you fail is a different legal and intellectual function entirely from the function you would be discharging if you were a judge or a member of a jury or a member of the Special Criminal Court sitting and trying to decide whether beyond reasonable doubt somebody is guilty.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that there is any serious difference between the function the Attorney General is sought to be given by this Bill and the function which until 1984 he had in regard to deciding whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute someone.  He was not required to decide whether the person was guilty.  All kinds of slips can happen between the time when a decision is made to prosecute and the moment when the judge or jury must find a verdict.  All kinds of things can go wrong.  There can be thrills and spills all along the way, technical, factual and everything else.  That was not the Attorney General's job.  It is not the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions and it is not the job of a member of the Garda Síochána to decide whether there is sufficiency of evidence.  All he is required to make his mind up about is whether, for his purpose, for the purpose of the operation of his cog in the machine, there is enough evidence to justify him in doing what he is paid to do, namely launch a prosecution.</P>

The Attorney General, if he were to address <Col N="428" /> his client on the question of whether somebody should be extradited, in discharging the function which this Bill proposes to give him would be acting <i>ultra vires</i>.  He would be completely exceeding his function and to that extent I think that what was said by Deputy Taylor an hour ago is correct.  He did not make this point but he did make the point that there is a political discretion in the Act, in the first subsection of section 44, vested in the Minister and that is where it should be vested.  The Attorney General is not given that discretion.  If he allowed his modest and limited function under this Bill to be overborne, to be distorted or to be reflected by considerations of whether he should extradite someone, he would be doing something over and above what the law here &mdash; if it becomes law &mdash; will entitle or authorise him to do. He is required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The consequences of what he may do cannot affect the jurisdiction which is confined within four corners.  He is required to decide only two things; whether there is an intention and whether there is sufficient evidence to support that intention.  He may be bitterly opposed for personal, political or for all kinds of reasons and he may have his own ideas about the policy of extraditing a person. If he allows these matters to influence him he is stepping ouside his lawful authority. I am not so naive as to suppose that it will be easy to pin that on an Attorney General who misbehaves.  What I am saying is that the sections which are proposed to be interpolated into the 1965 Act give the Attorney General one function and one function only, that is, to make up his mind, under two heads, in accordance with section 44B.  He has no function whatever to decide in that context whether an extradition is desirable. It would be completely incompetent of him to decide because he is not supposed to have any knowledge or official understanding of the degree of proof which a particular court is likely to require. <Col N="429" /> Possibly he should be given that discretion and if he were, there might be stronger substance in what we hear from that side of the House.  I have no objection to it one way or the other.</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday, there is no such difficult and obscure area anywhere in public law as the question of where the judicial power begins and ends. I do not believe I will be able to produce a better description of it than anybody else has succeeded in doing, back to Chief Justice Kennedy in the first decade of the State.  I will not attempt it.  Therefore, I am perfectly open to the possibility that this Bill, if it becomes law, may be shot down.  It will not in the least amaze me if it is.  I am not trying to belittle the arguments I am hearing.  I can see the substance in them.  For my own part I think they are wrong and I say so without any special arrogance or pride.  There is no certainty in these matters.  I have every possible objection to the history of the Fianna Fáil Party, back to its foundation, in regard to the whole area of national existence and I have lambasted it here, time out of number.  I would do so again except that I am anxious that we would all understand that we are all to some extent in this boat together economically, politically in regard to the North of Ireland and in regard to terrorism and savagery also.  There must be a limit and an end to the old style politics.  I know <Col N="430" /> that one's supporters do not like it if one is not weighing in to the Opposition non stop but there will have to be an end to it sooner or later or we will find that we are talking away as the Cuban's are landing.  We are going to have to climb out of the cock fight pit that we have been occupying here ever since I can remember. Maybe this is not a bad time to do it.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are entirely to blame for the exigency in which they now find themselves.  They probably are anxious to make a go of the Anglo-Irish process.  I do not think they would want to have it said that they wrecked it. Neither do I think that the voters would thank them for wrecking it.  The voters would not thank Fianna Fail for letting it be seen that the agreement had fallen down because of flaws in their background and temperament.  While they are entirely to blame for the exigency in which they now find themselves, we have to understand that we are in the difficulty, too.  That would not lead me to say something I, did not believe about this function but it does oblige me to say whatever I think can be said in favour of this proposal while it is going through this House.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy McCartan's contribution but I must confess I did not understand the second last point he made about the Attorney General and his responsibility for what happened in the McGlinchey case.  My understanding of the McGlinchey case is that Mr. McGlinchey sought the assistance of the superior court on the question of whether he was being charged with a political offence and that the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the activity with which Mr. McGlinchey was being charged did not, on the definition they introduced into the law, constitute a political offence.

If the Deputy wants me to give him examples I have a list with me of legislation which went through this House on which Deputy Taylor contributed at length.

That is all the legislation proposes to do.  I do not think anyone can argue reasonably that on the occasion the next warrant comes from Great Britain, the Garda Commissioner will go ahead and back that warrant without referring the matter to the Attorney General.  The Garda Commissioner, being a reasonable <Col N="432" /> person, knows from just looking at this Bill that the Attorney General has to consider the matter and has to refuse to give a direction that the person should not be extradited.  If the Attorney General considers that matter and does not give that direction, then the matter will go ahead in the ordinary way under the terms of the 1965 Act.</P>

      <P>Forgive me.  Deputy O'Malley referred to the Senezio case. He stated quite clearly in this House and in various media over the weekend that that case is authority for the proposition that the issue of a summons by a District Court clerk is a judicial act.  I suspect that Deputy O'Malley knows &mdash; I will be disappointed if he does not &mdash; that that case is authority for no such proposition. <Col N="433" /> The Senezio case decided that the issue of a summons by a District Court clerk under section 10 of the Petty Sessions of Ireland Act, 1851, is a judicial act.  That decision by the Supreme Court is right. There was good reason for it.  The Supreme Court came to that conclusion because section 10 of the Petty Sessions of Ireland Act, 1851, gave certain functions to a justice.  It envisaged the situation where a matter is put before a justice and he has to decide whether to continue the process.  That function is judicial because the Petty Sessions of Ireland Act, 1851, created it as a judicial function and gave it to a judicial person. Because the legislation created that as a judicial function, the Supreme Court held &mdash; and in my opinion they were perfectly right to hold &mdash; that it was not open to an administrative person, namely, a District Court clerk, to perform that function because by Statute it had been created judicial.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley quoted from the judgment of Chief Justice Finlay and I submit that his quotations from that judgment were selective.  Chief Justice Finlay stated that he was satisfied that on the terms of section 10 of the 1851 Act &mdash; and that is the key phrase &mdash; it was an inescapable conclusion that the issue of a summons upon the making of a complaint was a judicial as opposed to an administrative act.  If that was not enough for Deputy O'Malley, Chief Justice Finlay further on in his judgment said:</P>
      <P>Consideration, therefore, it seems to me, should be given to replacing ss. 10 and 11 of the Act of 1851 with statutory provisions more suitable to the modern District Court which could include the procedure for the issuing of summonses, in criminal cases at least, as being an administrative procedure only....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words Chief Justice Finlay envisaged that District Court clerks could issue summonses in circumstances other than in the circumstances contained in section 10 of the Petty Sessions of Ireland Act, 1851.  Something has just been brought to my attention.  I notice in the first page <Col N="434" /> of the case that the person who appeared for the defendant in that case was a Mr. Michael McDowell.  I do not know how many Michael McDowells are practising in the Law Library but if this Mr. Michael McDowell is the same Mr. Michael McDowell who sits over there on those benches I would urge him to take Deputy O'Malley to one side and explain Chief Justice Finlay's decision to him in simple terms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly, in the course of his Second Stage speech, quoted the various authorities but I do not propose to go over that ground again.  In the Shanahan case of 1961 or 1962 the terms of section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, was under consideration by the Supreme Court.  That section allowed the Attorney General to intervene where a District Court had decided not to send a person forward for trial on indictment.  In other words, the Attorney General was empowered to ignore, in effect to overrule, the preliminary decision of the District Court.  The Supreme Court found unanimously that that power in section 62 was not unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>In the last case I referred to the functions and powers of the Taxation Appeal Commissioners were under consideration. Anybody who has had occasion to appear before the appeal commissioners will know that a hearing of the Taxation Appeal Commissioners resembles that of a court hearing.  People on both sides make their case and there is an adjudication.  Indeed, the decision <Col N="435" /> of the appeal commissioners can have far-reaching and profound consequences on the livelihood of the individual tax-payer appearing before them.  Mr. Justice Barron concluded that the functions of the appeal commissioners, as set out in the Income Tax Act, 1967, were not judicial functions but were merely administrative functions.  Looking at all the cases, and considering what has been said &mdash; law is an imprecise science &mdash; I cannot understand how anybody who is reasonably skilled in the use of the English language or who is reasonably cognisant with the meaning of ordinary words can come to the conclusion that what we are proposing is a judicial as opposed to an administrative function.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley went on to propose an amendment along the lines of what happens in the United States but I must point out to him that this is a different jurisdiction to the US with a different legal tradition to that of the US.</P>

      <P>It is entirely inappropriate for Deputy O'Malley to suggest we should have a similar provision to the US. I do not have any first-hand knowledge as to how such a provision works in the US but I do not think a similar provision could work here.  Opposition Deputies are not united in their views on the type of safeguards we should have and that is why there are so many amendments before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That illustrates to me that there is room for a number of different views as to the type of safeguards we <Col N="436" /> should have.  However, there is unanimity &mdash; I give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt in regard to this &mdash; that we should have some safeguards.  It is an extremely difficult balance to find.  Some Opposition parties have suggested that such a hearing should be in open court but to me that seems to imply, like Deputy O'Malley's reference to secret proceedings and secret decisions implies, that the Opposition do not trust the Irish Attorney General.  If that is the case, and we must be inescapably driven to that conclusion, it is very sad.  The various Attorneys General who have served as legal advisers to successive Irish Governments, including Deputy Kelly, have been people of the highest integrity.  In many cases they have been promoted to the bench.  It is very sad if the Opposition parties do not trust the Irish Attorney General.</P>
      <P>District justices have no particular monopoly of wisdom or knowledge.  The Attorney General is the best placed person to make the decision we are requiring him to make.  Deputy McCartan argued long and eloquently for the <i>prima facie</i> case and there is much merit in what he has said.  I would prefer if we were presenting the option of a full blown <i>prima facie</i> hearing but we must remember we are talking about an administrative procedure, the extradition procedure between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  That procedure must be workable.  While I can see powerful arguments for the <i>prima facie</i> case, the problem is one of workability.  Deputy Taylor has said that the <i>prima facie</i> safeguard is probably the least there is.  He and I could devise better safeguards, but we are concerned now to have legislation that is workable and to have some form of safeguard so that a person will not be simply transferred to the tender mercies of the courts in Britain and Northern Ireland.  The amendments before the House today illustrate to me, as they must to all people outside the House, that it is a very difficult task to perform, a very difficult balance to strike.  In my view the Government have just about stuck the right balance.</P>

    <Col N="437" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What is at issue here is seeing that there is in place a workable system of extradition but a system of extradition that provides proper and adequate safeguards for those whose extradition might be sought.  Since we are concerned primarily with extradition between this country and the neighbouring jurisdiction then, obviously, the view is taken by the jurisdiction that might be making those requests is relevant. Already in the course of the debate there has been some comment on the views expressed by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in the House of Commons yesterday.  If she is correctly reported as being of the view that the Bill will have the effect of placing Britain in a less favoured status then I find that quite extraordinary.  As Deputy Kelly said, the factual position is that we treat Britain more favourably than we treat any other country.  Britain also treats this country more favourably when it comes to extradition requests than they treat any other country.  As I understand the position, <i>prima facie</i> is a normal feature of British law and at the moment Britain seeks that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made out in their dealings with every country other than this one.  That has put us in a most favoured nation status and we in turn, in the 1965 Act, have differentiated Britain from everybody else in that we have been satisfied to operate a backing of warrants procedure there while in the case of every other jurisdiction we have required formal extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what shape the Bill is in when it has passed through the Dáil Britain will continue to enjoy a privileged position and there is a logic why that should be so.  It is so because of the volume of traffic that takes place between our jurisdictions, because of the ease of travel and the fact that no documentation is required, no passports or visas.  Deputy Kelly said he found it strange that Mrs. Thatcher should make such a comment and wondered if she had been adequately advised.  I have to say &mdash; it may be that I am being unduly Machiavellian &mdash; that it seems to me likely that she was very well advised indeed and that she made that <Col N="438" /> intervention in the belief that it would do the Taoiseach no harm at all in attempting to sell these measures to his backbenchers. Backbenchers might be told by their comhairle ceantair that the safeguards amount to very little but if they were able to tell those raising the point that it was apparent they were enough to cause disquiet to Mrs. Thatcher they might find the fig-feaf a bit more substantial than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about whether we are in a position to ensure that we will have in place a workable system of extradition. That was our concern 11 months ago when we were on the benches opposite.  On that basis we opposed amendments &mdash; even to the extent of putting the Government's existence on the line as we defeated three amendments on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; that would have resulted in insuperable obstacles or obstacles that would have been difficult to surmount and we opposed the concept of the introduction into our law of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  I want to repeat that <i>prima facie</i> has not been part of our extradition tradition.  I invite Deputy McCartan or any other Deputy to find any extradition treaty to which this country is a party where we have made it a requirement, before responding to a request, that a <i>prima facie</i> case be made.  There is no such treaty in existence at the moment, by definition not with Britain or with any Part II country.</P>
    <P>As I said, we opposed <i>prima facie</i> 11 months ago essentially for two reasons: first, because it would provide us with treaty difficulties and that it would be incompatible with the 1957 Convention on Extradition; and, secondly and more substantially, because on the merits it does not stand up and the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> case is incompatible with an effective operating system of extradition. I say that second ground is more substantial because if it was established to my satisfaction that by putting aside or entering a reservation to the European Convention we were doing something worthwhile and useful, I would be prepared to pay that price, but I am far from <Col N="439" /> so satisfied.  I believe the introduction of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement would mean effectively that extradition would come to a stop.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House of the present position.  The present position at least so far as extradition between this country and the neighbouring jurisdictions are involved is that the Act contemplates a very streamlined system, indeed, a simple backing of warrants procedure. Yet, we can all think of how many cases have gone wrong in recent years even with that simplified procedure in place.  It does not require any imagination to work out that, if you start introducing additional elements, opportunities will be provided for those whose business it is to see that extraditions do not take place.</P>
    <P>In referring to the difficulties which occurred to date even with the simplified procedures I mean no criticism of our courts or of those who have been ingenious enough to point out the flaws.  I made clear on Second Stage exactly where I believe the blame rests.  I believe the blame rests very firmly with the British authorities who have shown a remarkable ineptitude and slovenliness when it comes to taking account of the proper requirements of our courts.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago we set our face firmly against a <i>prima facie</i> requirement and we do so again today.  The PDs have tabled an amendment which I understand they present as being something of a half way house.  They feel it would achieve something of the perceived advantages of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement, but without giving rise to the difficulties which they now accept, 12 months on, that a <i>prima facie</i> case would involve.</P>
    <P>It seems that one of two things is the case.  The scheme would operate as they intend, in which case it would provide no safeguard whatever.  Indeed, it is fair to say it would provide a lesser safeguard than that now offered by the Government with the Attorney General or what is already in place, because of the obligation, undertaken in good faith, on the <Col N="440" /> British Attorney General to satisfy himself about the position.  If it really is the case that all that would be required for extradition would be this simple statutory declaration, what is the value of that?  If it is a statutory declaration which cannot be challenged, and which has to be accepted at face value, what possible use is that to anyone?</P>
    <P>We are told one of the advantages is that someone could proclam their innocence in the press.  If someone whose extradition is sought finds himself confronted by a statutory declaration or affidavit which makes various contentions in relation to his behaviour, establishing that he committed an offence, and finds the only remedy open to him is to protest his innocence and hope it may be reported in the following night's <i>Evening Herald</i> he might reasonably wonder to what extent a safeguard had actually been provided by this House.  I do not think that is the way it would work, because I do not belive the courts would be satisfied to leave it simply on the basis of saying you put in your declaration and that is the end of the matter.  Once the declaration was presented, the issue of the sufficiency of evidence would become justiciable and we would be into the <i>prima facie</i> ball game and very substantial pre-trial procedures with all the difficulties that would entail.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said the one thing to be said for his amendment was that no one could say there was any constitutional doubt about it.  Let me say there is at least a possible constitutional doubt about it.  His amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary a person who swears an affidavit or makes a statutory declaration for the purpose of this section shall not be liable to be summoned before the Court or crossexamined thereon in the course of any proceedings under Part III of the Principle Act.</P>
    <P>My recollection of the decision of the courts in the case re Padraic Haughey &mdash; the case arising from investigations by <Col N="441" /> the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; was that the courts established that where someone was being inquired into in circumstances which put his position analogous to that of a defendant, he had a right to cross-examine and to be represented by counsel.</P>
    <P>If someone who is simply at an inquiry as a witness, albeit a witness to whom very searching questions are being put, is entitled to cross-examine and test any evidence presented against him, it would be hard to uphold a section which suggested that someone whose liberty was at stake, who was facing immediate expulsion from the country, was in any less precarious a position than a witness before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have to say that the Progressive Democrats' amendment is suspect. I concede that it is an attempt to make progress but I do not believe it achieves it.  I also do not think it is compatible with the 1957 Convention in that Article 12 of the Convention stipulates the documents that can be required to accompany a request.  Nowhere in that list is there provision for this substantiating declaration which the Progressive Democrats contemplate.</P>
    <P>I suppose they would say in answer to that, that is their reason for confining the provision to Irish citizens but, for the reasons given by several speakers on Second Stage and which featured prominently in the debate 11 months ago, any attempt to differentiate between the way we treat our citizens and other citizens who find themselves involved in extradition proceedings would be quite invidious and I do not see any particular merit in that.</P>
    <P>All these amendments have been put forward as alternatives to the role of the Attorney General.  All the people contending for it have raised arguments about the constitutionality of the Attorney General provision which is proposed by the Government.  That was put most strongly this morning by Deputy O'Malley and it has been answered with considerable vigour from these benches by Deputy Kelly.  It seems to me that both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Kelly <Col N="442" /> overstate the position.  It is not true, as Deputy O'Malley contends, that the Supreme Court would have to stand on its head for this Bill to be free from challenge.  It is not true either for Deputy Kelly to suggest that what is involved is as simple and straightforward as a Garda sergeant forming a view that he has enough evidence to prosecute you for not having a light on your bicycle or whatever. The reality falls somewhere in between.  It is a grey area, as Deputy Kelly said and, for that reason, we are very keen that the constitutionality of the measure would be referred to the Supreme Court by the President because there are overwhelming advantages in having this constitutional issue tidied up one way or another, here and now.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that if anybody goes down to the Four Courts today and takes a poll among senior counsel who specialise in constitutional law there would be a split decision as to the likely outcome of a constitutional challenge because we are in a very fine area of administrative and constitutional law and it is by no means clear what the decision would be.  On that point, Deputy O'Dea, in supporting the case that the Bill would be constitutional, relied on the Shanahan decision, which is the Singer stamps case and it is less than frank to rely on a decision which has been expressly overruled by the Supreme Court in a reported judgment on the basis that that power to send forward for trial vested in the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions did constitute an interference with the judicial function. The Shanahan case, to which he referred, is expressly overruled in the case of Costello <i>v.</i> the Director of Public Prosecutions, reported in the <i>1984 Irish Reports.</i></P>
    <P>We are dealing with a Bill of doubtful constitutionality.  I do not mean that in a pejorative sense, it is a Bill about which serious arguments can be made.  Let us consider how those arguments can be resolved.  They can be resolved if the President sees fit by a reference to the Supreme Court under Article 26.  If that happens, a time limit is set down by the <Col N="443" /> Constitution within which the case is heard and within which judgment is delivered. If that happens to the Act and if it is approved of by the Supreme Court and signed by the President, it is immune from further constitutional challenge. We will all know where we stand.  If it does not happen that way, what are the alternatives?  It is inevitable that the first person whose extradition is sought will seek to bring a case first to the High Court and will appeal it all the way to the Supreme Court.  That means that extradition will come to a standstill for perhaps 12 months because, while that case is before the courts, everyone else whose extradition might be sought will, inevitably, seek to make the same points as the person who first raised the case.</P>
    <P>If, eventually, the Supreme Court decides that the case is constitutional we will still have been faced with a situation where for 12 months or so our extradition procedures will have been put in abeyance. If the Supreme Court finds the Act unconstitutional, a consequence will be that it will order the release of whoever the individuals are who challenged it and they may prove to be people of very little merit indeed.  I suspect that very few people in this House would be happy if those sought for the atrocity at Enniskillen and who, under existing law and that of many years past, would be liable to be extradited, were to seek to challenge this Act in the courts and because they succeeded on a fine point of constitutional law were able to evade extradition and avoid facing trial for that atrocity.  That would be a very unhappy consequence.</P>
    <P>There is a further possibility, although I do not believe it is likely, that a court in striking down this measure would bring all or part of the entire extradition legislation down with it.  However, even if the court takes the view that this measure is unconstitutional they are quite capable of severing it from the rest of the extradition procedures.  A doubt arises on that point which was referred to by Deputy Desmond O'Malley on Second Stage.  For that reason as well, it is desirable that <Col N="444" /> the doubts should be resolved as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The effect of each of the three amendments would be to place difficulties in the way of effective extradition.  For that reason, none of these amendments will find favour with us.</P>

      <P>On a procedural point, we put down an amendment to section 1 which was to insert a subsection saying that this Act come into operation on such day as may be fixed by order of the Minister for Justice.  It went on to say that the Minister shall not fix a date earlier than the date on which judgment has been given by the Supreme Court following a reference of the Bill to it by the President pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution. For all the reasons which Deputy Birmingham has just outlined, it would be exceptionally useful if the Minister or the Taoiseach could indicate to the House whether the Government would indicate that they have no objections to the Bill being referred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On almost every occasion on which this House has indicated to the President that it would desire him to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court, the President has acceded and it would be extremely helpful on this occasion if a representative of the Government, preferably the Taoiseach, were to do so. The Government up to now have not conceded that there may be any doubt <Col N="446" /> about the constitutionality of the measure before the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one or two other points.  First, I should like to clear up a matter which has arisen in the reporting in <i>The Irish Times</i> today of the position of the Progressive Democrats.  It stated that we are proposing the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  I did not state that in the House yesterday: I was incorrectly reported.  I went out of my way to say that at the parliamentary party meeting we had spent a considerable time examining other safeguards which would be short of the full blown <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  We eventually came up with the idea that a district justice should look at the extradition process in line with the Irish-American Treaty of 1983. After all the talk by lawyers in the House this morning and at various stages of the Bill, I should like to pose one question. As a lay person, would you prefer that your demand for extradition was looked at secretly by an Attorney General who is the political officer appointed by a Government or would you prefer it to be looked at by an independent district justice in the court?  I would prefer the district justice, who would be making the extradition warrant anyway, to examine the extradition process.</P>

      <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is reviewed from time to time in the light of military requirements and does not differentiate between male and female personnel.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This has arisen practically every year and my predecessor, who is a colleague of the Deputys, gave him the same answer. Enlistment in the Defence Forces is on a voluntary basis.  Compulsory military service was not resorted to even during the 1939-45 emergency period.  Furthermore, there is no legislation in existence under which compulsory military service could be introduced in peace time or in an emergency.</P>

It would help the community by ensuring order and a lack of crime and prevent people being prey to drug pushers if the Government would open their minds to examine this question in detail.  Is it a fact the Department are fearful of training subversives and this is one of the reasons against voluntary national service?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> That matter does not arise because the necessary precautions are taken in advance <Col N="466" /> with regard to any recruitment.  Voluntary enlistment has always been a matter of policy.  From the military standpoint, compulsory service would ensure a substantial reserve of manpower with military training which could be drawn on from time to time.  From a social point of view many people would feel that young men would benefit from Army discipline but from a practical point of view the level of compulsory military service would give rise to enormous problems in the administrative, organisational and financial areas.  Compulsory military training would not be a once-for-all operation; it would be necessary to introduce a system of annual training for those so trained.  The cost would be enormous.  I cannot visualise it at present.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 23 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>As part of its ongoing review of public expenditure, the Government decided that there should be a reduction of £200,000 in the provisions for the Army Equitation School from 1988 onwards. The total estimated cost of running the equitation school in 1988 is £1.17 million after the reduction is taken into account and the reduction must be seen in that context.</P>
      <P>The role of the equitation school is to advertise the Irish non-thoroughbred horse and it is my policy to ensure that the school will continue to fulfil that role to the highest possible standards for the future.  The reduction in the amount of money available for 1988 will not affect the functions of the school but will mean that the most effective use must be made of the resources allocated.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that making more effective use of available resources will damage the non-thoroughbred horse industry nor am I aware that it has had any effect on the morale of those concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We shall be adequately represented.  Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that Army riders are committed to the use of the Irish horse exclusively in both show jumping and three-day events.  Irish civilian riders now have no such commitment. The total cost of running the equitation school is well in excess of £1 million per year, including personnel costs.  That is a substantial State contribution to the development of the non-thoroughbred horse industry.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister is side-stepping the question that I am putting to him.  Will the Army team, both the riders and the horses, be attending as many international shows in 1988 as they did in 1987?  It is a simple question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my final supplementary question.  The Minister is side-stepping the main issue.  Everybody who has a connection with the horse industry will acknowledge the fantastic contribution that our international teams have made in so far as the Irish horse is concerned.  Nobody disagrees with the Minister there.  However, if he pulls away the frontline ambassadors the glare of publicity which follows international show successes will be lost.  My understanding is that our teams will attend less than one-third of the international shows that they attended in 1987, that the 1988 attendance will be cut by over two-thirds. Could the Minister explain if this is a priority to the Army?  Surely, if the Minister agrees that attendance at international shows is a priority, he will make it his business to see that the Army teams are allowed to compete at all the big international shows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the type of warning and monitoring network which is available to the Civil Defence to protect citizens against the hazard of nuclear fallout; if this equipment was in use during and after the Chernobyl disaster; and if he has satisfied himself with the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated recently in response to a previous question by the Deputy, the Civil Defence wartime warning and monitoring network consists of Department of Defence personnel, the Army Observer Corps, elements of the Garda Síochána, the Meteorological Service, Irish Lights, RTE, certain local authority personnel and volunteer personnel of the Civil Defence Warden Service.  It includes radiation-protected national, regional and county control centres with communication links and a broadcasting facility from the national control.  Its equipment includes radiation measurement instruments.  The network is tested once a year through national fallout exercises and has performed well in these tests.  The last exercise was held on Sunday, 1 November last, and included a television broadcast on RTE.</P>
      <P>Arrangements exist also for advising the public on shelter and on other steps necessary for survival in a fallout situation.</P>
      <P>While primary responsibility in relation to nuclear accidents rests with the Department of Energy, Civil Defence was involved, following the Chernobyl accident, in collecting samples of milk and vegetables for testing for radioactivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil Defence will, however, have a more comprehensive role in support of other agencies in the emergency plan to deal with the effects of a nuclear accident which is now being prepared.  This role is likely to include such measures as monitoring radiation levels throughout the country; monitoring radiation levels on ships, aircraft and vehicles at seaports. <Col N="482" /> airports and Border crossings, and implementing decontamination measures as necessary; participating in the collection of samples of water, grass, vegetables etc. for analysis and assisting where required in the implementation of control measures.</P>
    <P>To enable Civil Defence to carry out these duties, very sensitive new radiation measurement instruments capable of giving readings down to background level have been purchased and training in their use has been given to local authorities scientific staffs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Civil Defence can meet their responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had a somewhat similar question not so long ago in relation to radiation levels and Civil Defence work in liaison with the Department of Energy who are primarily responsible for monitoring nuclear fallout. Civil Defence act as a backup service in the event of serious fallout being reported by the Department of Energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

I have a strange feeling that we were caught unawares even in Civil Defence as we did not have the type of equipment necessary to record the fallout in the circumstances. I would like the Minister to give the House his comments on that.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1986 a total of 4,350 high range portable radiation survey meters had been purchased by Civil Defence and these were distributed to each local authority.  This equipment was designed to measure fallout in the <Col N="483" /> aftermath of any nuclear incident or of nuclear war.</P>

Did the entire Civil Defence organisation click to 100 per cent efficiency for Chernobyl and can we be sure that they will do the same in the eye of some similar serious incident again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> At the press conference I gave last August relating to the defence review and following the meeting of the Council of Defence earlier that day, I indicated that I intended to give some final thought to the conduct of the review itself.  I did so without delay and I am glad to report that the review is going ahead, on schedule, as planned.  The review structure has been set up and each of the main review bodies have been established and brought into operation.</P>
      <P>The basic structure is comprised of a primary body which is known as the Defence Review Committee and a number of working groups which will examine and report on particular areas of policy and operations.  Where the task is wide and complex, a working group may, in turn, create secondary bodies to facilitate and expedite the completion of their task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to my direction, the Defence Review Committee are directing, guiding and generally facilitating the review process and will ultimately produce the defence review report.  They have met regularly since the Council of Defence <Col N="485" /> meeting on 6 August and have completed their initial task of structuring the review and bringing into operation a number of working groups.  These working groups include the Defence Forces Working Group who are conducting a range of studies relating to all aspects of the Defence Forces; the Civil Defence Working Group who are studying all aspects of Civil Defence, distinguishing between peacetime and wartime requirements and the Finance and Administration Working Group who are studying the budgetary systems, financial accountability, administrative and liaison arrangements and procurement procedures of the Department of Defence with a view to bringing about any possible improvements in administration and financial control and in co-ordination between civil and military units.</P>
    <P>As regards the composition of the review bodies, in addition to top management representatives from the civil and military branches of the Department of Defence, there is representation, as appropriate, from other Departments such as Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice and the Department of the Environment. Should any additional professional expertise be required in relation to any particular area of study, it will be provided.</P>
    <P>The review, involving as it does an indepth examination of the entire defence area including Civil Defence, is a major time-consuming undertaking.  It will be pursued expeditiously but I would not expect the task to be completed and the final report to be available to the Government in less than a year.</P>
    <P>At my press conference last August, I made it clear that the review is not just a cost-cutting exercise and that it will not in any way undermine the Government's unshakable commitment to maintaining security and having an appropriate level of defence preparedness.  It is, as I then pointed out, a fundamental comprehensive review of the entire defence area with the objective of developing the most relevant and realistic cost-effective defence arrangements.</P>

    <P>1.  &mdash;(1)  In any proceeding under Part III of the Principal Act in respect of any warrant for the arrest of a person who is for the time being a citizen of Ireland and is accused of an offence, a final order shall not be made under section 47 of that Act unless documentary evidence within the meaning of this section shall have been produced to the District Court.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section, `documentary evidence' means an affidavit or statutory declaration setting forth reasonable grounds for believing that the offence to which the request for extradition or warrant, as the case may be, relates has been committed and that the person before the District Court committed it.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by regulation made under this Act in relation to `documentary evidence' provide for any or all of the following matters:</P>
    <P>(a)  the persons or classes of persons who may swear an affidavit or make a statutory declaration,</P>
    <P>(b)  the persons before whom an affidavit may be sworn or a statutory declaration made,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> (c)  the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration and the manner and place in which it is to be sworn or made,</P>

    <P>(f)  such other matters as appear to be necessary or expedient for the proper working of this section,</P>
    <P>(g)  the revocation or amendment of any order made under this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  A document purporting to be an affidavit or statutory declaration for the purposes of this section shall be received in evidence by the District Court when tendered without further proof and it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that the document was made for the purposes of this section and in accordance with the provisions of any order for the time being in force under subsection (3) of this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  In considering whether or not an affidavit or statutory declaration sets forth reasonable grounds for believing that the offence, to which the request for extradition or warrant relates (as the case may be), has been committed and that the person before the District Court has committed it, the Court shall have regard only to the matters set out in the affidavit or statutory declaration and any matters duly exhibited therein.</P>
    <P>(6)  Notwithstanding any rule of law or practice to the contrary a person who swears an affidavit or makes a statutory declaration for the purpose of this section shall not be liable to be summoned before the Court or cross-examined thereon in the course of any proceedings under Part III of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as may be <Col N="536" /> after it is made and shall not have effect unless a resolution approving the said regulation is passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Before lunch the Taoiseach made the point that the Progressive Democrats in their amendment were proposing to offer the Minister for Justice the discretion to say when there was sufficient evidence in extradition cases.  This is quite incorrect.  We are not proposing that.  We are saying that the Minister would set out the technicalities governing the case and set the rules before the court and that we would be quite happy if a rules committee of the District Court were to do so instead.  This is quite different from inferring that the Minister for Justice would carry out the power which this Bill is giving to the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>The other issue I would like to refer to is the deplorable effect which I think this Bill is having on Anglo-Irish relations. The comments of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, in the House of Commons yesterday were unhelpful. They were ill-informed in that, even with the passage of this Bill in whatever form, our extradition procedures will still be among the most favourable in the world. What I deplore most of all, despite these unhelpful comments by the British Prime Minister, is that Anglo-Irish relations have returned again to the stage where members of this Government and the British Government are shouting at one another across the Irish Sea.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and which basically proposes that a district justice in open court would assess the extradition matter rather than the Attorney General within his own office.  We find that having the Attorney General in charge of this procedure will not satisfy Irish public opinion on this matter.  He will have a discretionary power which he will exercise privately without any access to the Irish courts for the person whose extradition is sought.  In framing the amendment we went out of our way to ensure not to seek a full blown <i>prima facie</i> requirement and we think we have achieved that objective by stating in our amendment that a person could go before a district justice, that an affidavit setting out the facts should be brought forward, and that witnesses could not be summoned. We believe that the amendment would not in any way slow up the extradition process.  In our view it will meet the two absolute requirements which all parties want to achieve, workable extradition and a safeguard for our citizens in that they will have redress to a court on such an important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would welcome some indication <Col N="539" /> from the Government that they would favour the President referring the Bill to the Supreme Court in accordance with his power under Article 26 of the Constitution. This is an extremely important point that has not been dealt with by the Government in the form of an amendment, and rightly so, but it would be most helpful if the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Justice, indicated if they would favour adopting that procedure in the case of this Bill.  If the proposal concerning the role of the Attorney General turns out to be unconstitutional, as we believe it will, it would have the most undesirable effect of bringing down with it Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The result would be that far from having unworkable extradition procedures we would have no extradition between Britain and this country at all.</P>

I should like to suggest to him that before he makes such mischievous remarks in the future he should at least go to the trouble of reading what was said by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, on 30 October during the course of his speech in Oxford.  He said that the agreement and the Anglo-Irish process which they had carried forward with two Irish administrations marked a watershed in his Government's policy towards Northern Ireland and had inaugurated a new more creative period in Anglo-Irish relations as a whole in which we could co-operate more closely together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is over-influenced by the British tabloids at present.  If he was a little more discerning with regard to his sources and had a little more concern for the truth he would not have been making the wild allegations he was making this morning.  They are totally untrue.  Everything that has been said publicly by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland goes to show that what the Deputy was saying was untrue.  If the Deputy wishes to play politics on this issue that is another matter but it should be known why he is doing that.</P>
      <P>These amendments all relate to the establishment, in one way or another, of a <i>prima facie</i> case in our courts before extradition can be granted.  The fatal objection to the imposition of a <i>prima facie</i> requirement is that it would be a very serious obstacle to extradition, as it has proved to be in cases in British courts down through the years.  During the course of Second Stage on this Bill yesterday, I pointed to procedural difficulties which would arise in relation to the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case in the District Court by foreign prosecuting authorities in an extradition case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of difference of opinion in the debate as to whether witnesses would be required to be produced in support of sworn affidavits before the court.  I would maintain that, irrespective of how the <i>prima facie</i> requirement would be couched, the reality would be likely to be that the person whose extradition is sought would be in a position to raise such issues about the adequacy of the case against him, that the foreign prosecuting authorities would be forced to produce witnesses or forfeit the case for extradition.  Leaving aside for the moment the argument as to whether there would be a requirement to produce witnesses there can be little doubt but that this arrangement, even if it were confined to documentary proofs, would be likely to represent a considerable increase in the delay and complication associated with extradition requests.  It is my fear that any variation on the <i>prima facie</i> requirement which would involve evidence having to be established in the <Col N="542" /> relevant court proceedings would be likely to result in the failure of legitimate requests for extradition.  I do not think that this is an acceptable situation for us to contemplate at any time but it is particularly unacceptable at this time when there is a very wide public consciousness of the need to bring terrorists before the courts to answer for their crimes in every part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have already in the debate on Second Stage referred to the difficulty which would arise for the prosecuting authorities in a foreign jurisdiction in preparing a book of evidence in compliance with our court rules and procedures in the very short timespan that would be available to them.  We all know already the potential for error and omission in relation to the production of the relatively simple extradition warrants.  The potential for mistakes in the production of a complete book of evidence must be, therefore, all the greater.</P>
    <P>There is public concern about insufficient safeguards in our legislation.  Careful examination of this question indicated that, despite the attractiveness in principle of the requirement, it would make for an undue restriction on extradition arrangements between this country and Britain and Northern Ireland.  I do not make this statement lightly.  We have looked at this very closely and are absolutely convinced that the <i>prima facie</i> requirement is simply not a viable option.</P>
    <P>After examining this question in detail we have come up with an option which is workable and which would ensure that extradition applications would proceed only where there was a clear intention to prosecute and where that intention was founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are proposals by the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party to insert a new section requiring documentary evidence being presented in court.  I fully appreciate that the proposers of these amendments are conscious of the danger that a full <i>prima facie</i> requirement is likely to be unsatisfactory in extradition cases and it would <Col N="543" /> appear they are offering this new section as an alternative.  Unfortunately, as I pointed out in my reply on Second Stage of the Bill last night, the production in court of affidavits and declarations of the type suggested would be bound to invoke a response from the defendant and his legal representatives which would surely, in turn, lead in practice to further evidence of the case against him having to be adduced.  Otherwise doubts would be raised as to the case against the person and those doubts would be left unresolved.</P>
    <P>One should acknowledge the ingenuity which the proposers of this amendment have put into their efforts to confine the evidence which would be required to be produced to documentary evidence only and I respect the intent behind that. However, I am far from being satisfied that the concept could be made to work without undue complication and without posing a decided obstacle to extradition.</P>
    <P>The amendment by The Workers' Party is to insert a simple <i>prima facie</i> requirement into Part III of the 1965 Act.  This proposed amendment does not have the merits of the earlier amendments in seeking to confine the requirement for <i>prima facie</i> evidence to documentary proofs and it is open to all the objections to which I referred on Second Stage about the impracticality of a simple <i>prima facie</i> requirement.</P>
    <P>As I said in my reply to the Second Stage debate, ultimately the problem about the <i>prima facie</i> requirement is that in legal systems similar to ours it has tended to afford an excessive degree of protection to the accused.  It has proved very difficult in practice to apply the requirement successfully when there is an external prosecution system involved.  I am very much afraid that any of the variations upon a <i>prima facie</i> requirement that we have heard advanced during this debate would be likely to suffer equally from such disadvantages in practice. Obviously, I cannot accept any of these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a few <Col N="544" /> words to what the Minister said.  I want to deal with the amendment by the Progressive Democrats.  Frankly, I find it mystifying what is intended by amendment No. 1. Deputy O'Malley made a lot of play about the Attorney General exercising certain functions and coming to an opinion.  He was very melodramatic about this and painted a totally artificial picture of the Attorney General in a secret place coming to these decisions. That does not stand on its merits because, by the very nature of his office, the Attorney General, often has to come to decisions and form opinions.</P>
      <P>I will leave that aside and turn to what the Progressive Democrats propose instead.  The amendment specifically says that the Minister for Justice can, by regulations, not in the statute, decide who can swear an affidavit which will go before the court and be the documentary evidence on which the court will decide. Maybe I am wrong but that seems to be leaving this area as wide open as a gate. The Attorney General has some tinge of political office about him, but the Minister for Justice is a totally political person and the Progressive Democrats are prepared to give this political Minister for Justice authority by regulation to decide that anybody can swear that affidavit.</P>

I may be wrong but that seems to be totally and utterly ridiculous.  If there is an objection to the Attorney General having some function in this matter, surely there must be infinitely more objection to the Minister for Justice, by regulation, deciding that anybody he thinks can exercise this function. I wanted to make that simple point at this stage.</P>

      <P>There are a number of matters I want to deal with in response to the remarks made this morning on amendment No. 5 in the name of The Workers' Party.  The first point was raised by Deputy Kelly in regard to initiating proceedings or a decision not to initiate proceedings by a member of the Garda Síochána, and saying that that qualitatively was no different from a decision of the Attorney General in relation to initiating proceedings for extradition. While that may be so, there are greater implications to draw from a decision to extradite or to commence proceedings to extradite.  We want to be clear in our language here.</P>
      <P>The decision to commence or not to commence proceedings with regard to extradition will lie, we are told, actively with the Attorney General, although I do not accept that from the reading of the section.  That active decision is there and following from it are consequences far greater than the consequence of initiating criminal proceedings.  This is why the debate about safeguards with regard to extradition has been entered into.  The consequences are that a citizen will be removed from our jurisdiction, from all the protections in our written Constitution, to the jurisdiction of another country to be tried according to the rules of that country.  That is of far greater consequence than the initiation of criminal proceedings in the domestic courts.  It is because of the quantitative differences that we are discussing the notion of safeguards and to what extent they should be applied.  It is for that reason that Britain, in her own legislation dealing with extradition, relies on the <i>prima facie</i> safeguard for her citizens when dealing with other countries, over 70 of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the argument by analogy and, as a legislator and politician, I am not interested in getting into a debate on the constitutionality of the role of the Attorney General in this regard.  That is for another tribunal on another day.  Well and good, if the lawyers in the Four Courts want to make hay of this, that is their business, but our job is to look at <Col N="546" /> the overall scheme of things.  I want to say to the people who say there is a comparison between a police officer investigating or initiating and the Attorney General initiating or deciding to initiate within our jurisdiction, that there is a vast difference between that and the implications that flow from the decision to commence proceedings with regard to extradition.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea said he was at a loss to understand my remarks with regard to the Attorney General's role in the McGlinchey affair.  I have no argument to make with the Supreme Court findings that the antics of Mr. McGlinchey were anything but political &mdash; they certainly were not the actions of a mad terrorist. What I am concerned about is the subsequent events which transpired in the McGlinchey saga.  Eventually, having been located in Ennis after a shoot-out, a decision was taken at the highest level, in consultation with the Attorney General, not to prosecute him in this jurisdiction at the first stage for offences he had undoubtedly committed and was subsequently convicted for.  During his apprehension and arrest in Ennis, it was decided he would be taken before hastily convened High and Supreme Courts over the weekend &mdash; before the courts could reassemble themselves in the normal course of their business on the Monday morning, sit at midnight and have the man transferred out of our jurisdiction without any consideration or time taken to investigate legitimate and properly pursued legal arguments that Mr. McGlinchey was concerned in articulating before our courts at that time in relation to the propriety of the intentions of the authorities to remove him from the jurisdiction.  The decisions not to prosecute for offences clearly committed in the course of his apprehension, to remove him on foot of the then existing extradition warrant as opposed to trying him here initially, in regard to requesting the convention of the Supreme Court late at night and then moving him without delay over the Border, were all taken in clear consultation with the Attorney General. They helped to illustrate the fact that <Col N="547" /> if we are advancing the Office of the Attorney General as a potential safeguard for persons threatened with extradition, the McGlinchey affair clearly illustrates that it can be a very thin safeguard indeed when &mdash; to use a horrible expression &mdash; the chips are down.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that similar events will arise in future.  Those kinds of pressures and circumstances will leave us in the position where improper decisions will be taken from the point of view of the safeguard of the person sought on extradition. It is, in the Minister's own words, why we are here, accepting something less than Fianna Fáil advanced and argued for less than 12 months ago.  In 1986 Fianna Fáil were all in favour of a <i>prima facie</i> case but now, because events are more serious in regard to terrorism, the Government believe they must persue something less than a <i>prima facie</i> case, although things were just as bad in regard to terrorism here in 1986.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point of referral to the Attorney General, in answer to an observation by Deputy O'Dea, penal statutes are by fundamental first principles construed strictly and I have no doubt that that is the type of construction which will be put on this legislation when it comes to be reviewed by the courts.  It will be asked if it was the specific intention of the Legislature to ensure that all warrants are referred to the Attorney General and why the Act did not specifically say so.  It does not and, for that reason, I am at a loss to know, when it is the expressed desire of the Government that it should involve the Attorney General in all instances, why it does not simply say so.  No explanation has been given to the House as to what was in the mind of the artful draftsman when he employed the double &mdash; and in some instances, if one can understand the wording of the section, the treble &mdash; negative to try to introduce into legislation a positive duty on the part of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is in relation to the Minister's reservations about the need for <i>prima facie</i>.  The more <Col N="548" /> he advances his reasons against the notion of <i>prima facie</i>, that it will be an obstacle, create an oppressive load on the process and will open up the potential for mistakes, the more I am convinced that the motion of the Attorney General is simply a device.  The more the Minister denigrates the notion of the undesirability of an independent court inquiry into the sufficiency of a case, the more I am convinced that he is foisting upon us a mere rubber stamp through the office of the Attorney General which will involve virtually no inquiry.  I cannot put the matter any further but I am utterly at a loss to understand the persistence of the Minister and the Taoiseach in suggesting that a process that is engaged in on a daily basis in District Courts around the country, which in no way delays the prosecution of indictable offences, can be presented in the context of extradition as being oppressive and unduly obstructive.</P>
    <P>I again put down a challenge to the Minister.  Since the Costello judgment on the restriction of the right of the Director of Public Prosecutions and previously the Attorney General to override a decision of a district justice on a preliminary investigation ruling, there have been very few indictable cases discharged or arrested by district justices at the conclusion of the preliminary investigation when they come to read books of evidence.  Despite all the artful devices, arguments and counter-arguments presented by lawyers for defendants in preliminary investigations, the time honoured phrase used by district justices is &ldquo;all that is very well but it is a matter for the trial judge at the eventual hearing&rdquo;.  The district justice is only asked to decide if there is a sufficient case and if the documentation discloses that there is a case of substance which indicates that a trial can be embarked on. I have no doubt that a reliance on what I explained previously is an internationally accepted mode of conduct of extradition proceedings and will not present the slightest difficulty or obstruction to the process of extradition.  It will afford our courts the opportunity to safeguard the rights of persons apprehended and sought on extradition for removal out of this <Col N="549" /> jurisdiction.  It is a meaningful means of supervising that process which will present no administrative difficulties whatsoever.  The final suggestion of the Minister to invoke the English experience is the most laughable of all, to suggest that Britain is getting out of it because they have had a hard time with their colonies is a lamentable excuse.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, as I said at the beginning of the debate this morning, there are 26 amendments and six sections and we have spent three and a half hours discussing three of them.  I appreciate that the Order of the House does not allow for the question to be put at a particular time but, in fairness to everybody, and for the Bill to get a proper and adequate discussion, Members on this side of the House should behave more reasonably and allow us to move to other amendments.  We could talk all day and all tomorrow about those three amendments.  Our amendment was not grouped with the first three amendments and we have not had an opportunity of discussing it.  I do not deny the rights of others to discuss their amendments but unless we can have an assurance that there will be more time on Committee Stage or that the question will be put, we will never be finished.  We feel obliged at this stage to ask that the question be put unless there is an agreement about fairness in the division of time.</P>

In that regard, I was about to announce to the House that, as far as I was concerned, Deputies were developing points to a position where it would exclude opportunities for other people to make shorter and more relevant contributions on Committee Stage.  The point made by the Deputy is one entirely for the Members of the <Col N="550" /> House and Deputy Barrett can personally ask that the question be put and the Chair will adjudicate on it.  I had indicated that I was calling Deputy Cowen and I also indicated that I might give Deputy O'Malley an opportunity of making a comment.  I know that Deputy Taylor and Deputy Blaney also wanted to speak.  Deputy Barrett having made his point should leave it to the good judgment of the Deputies whom I mentioned and see what he might do following that.  We will all accept that the point has been reached where anything worthy of being said has been said and that we could agree to move on to the next business.</P>

      <P>Whatever about brevity, I am glad to be allowed in, having waited in the wings since 11 a.m.  That is more a reflection on someone else's brevity rather than on mine, which might or might not arise.</P>
      <P>All the melodrama on Second Stage about the role of the Attorney General has dimmed somewhat in view of the lack of credibility that can be given to such statements.  Under Article 30 of the Constitution the duties of the Attorney General can be increased either under the Constitution or by law.  What we are doing is not something that was not contemplated by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>With due respect to the Director of Public Prosecutions his duties relate to functions in this jurisdiction.  Because of the administrative arrangements agreed under the 1986 Bill the Attorney General is already involved in the vetting of warrants and accompanying documentation before the endorsement of the warrant. There should not be an objection to the Attorney General pursuing those responsibilities on a statutory basis as outlined in this Bill.  The administrative arrangements in the 1986 Bill meant that the British Attorney General was in informal contact with our Attorney General before a warrant was actually issued and that there would be a tacit agreement that there was sufficient evidence on which to endorse the warrant and have it served on the defendant.  The arrangements in operation before this amendment Bill was brought to the House were on an Attorney General to an Attorney General basis.  The Attorney General in Britain scrutinises extradition requests there.  I do not see the need to object to this Bill, or to object to our Attorney General scrutinising warrants in the same way as does his counterpart in Britian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision by this Government to give a statutory basis to an arrangement <Col N="552" /> already in operation under the 1986 Bill is correct.  Clearly the Attorney General is the person who should get that statutory responsibility.  As the Minister for Justice pointed out in his Second Stage speech, the responsibility for prosecutions with an international dimension is already vested in the Attorney General. The Minister mentioned various Acts including the Official Secrets Act and the Criminal Law Jurisdiciton Act, 1976.  The Minister's point showed that this is not a novel idea in relation to international offences.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats put up an argument that the Attorney General under this Bill would be involved in a judicial function.  On balance, as Deputy Kelly said, it is very much more likely that this would not be considered as a judicial function.  Section 2 of the Bill requires the Attorney General to form an opinion as to two matters only, that there is an intention to prosecute and that that intention is based on the availability of sufficient evidence and that the evidence will be such evidence as the Attorney General deems appropriate in any given case.  Deputy McCartan said that this was a rubber stamp procedure. If the Attorney General is empowered to seek such evidence as he deems appropriate in any given case so that he can be satisfied that there is an intention to prosecute based on sufficient evidence, the flexibility in that provision ensures that it will not be a rubber stamp procedure. Deputy McCartan is over-stepping the mark in dismissing the provision in that way.  Under this Bill the opinion of the Attorney General must be given before an endorsement of the warrant.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan believes that the wording does not allow for the compulsion on the Garda Commissioner to get the consent of the Attorney General. Perhaps Deputy McCartan would read the transcript of Deputy Kelly's Second Stage speech and he would see that Deputy Kelly believes that there is that requirement on the Garda Commissioner. I will not go into it any further than that.  Having listened to Deputy <Col N="553" /> Kelly's contribution on that point I am satisfied that a Garda Commissioner will not endorse a warrant without the opinion of the Attorney General.  That being the case, I fail to see how the Attorney General's formation of that opinion can be deemed to be a judicial function, because the warrant is not valid in this jurisdiction until such time as there is an endorsement of that warrant.  If that is the position, any involvement of the Attorney General prior to endorsement of the warrant cannot be deemed to be in the judicial domain because no judicial process, no legal document, is in existence at the time of the formation of that opinion.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the judicial controversy about which everybody is talking, I contend begins at the point at which the Garda Commissioner endorses the warrant. If the Attorney General gives his opinion prior to endorsement of the warrant I fail to see &mdash; on the basis of logic if not law &mdash; how he can be deemed to be performing a judicial function in any way when the subject matter to which this function is being attributed is not even a legal document at that stage.  That is my understanding of the position.  That is the way I worked it out in my head.  If it is inaccurate I shall be glad to hear somebody else propose something different. If the warrant is not endorsed, it has not been issued in this jurisdiction, then in what way can the opinion of the Attorney General be deemed to be a judicial function, because the judicial process has not begun at that stage?</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, in forming his opinion, the Attorney General is involved simply in the scrutiny of evidence, he is not involved in committing a person for trial.  That happens only on endorsement of the warrant, on its being served on the defendant, on his being brought to the District Court to satisfy the relevant district justice that, first, it is an extraditable offence, that there is a corresponding offence in the other jurisdiction and that the constitution of the warrant is valid.  Within 15 days he can go to the High Court seeking a <i>habeas corpus</i> application to ensure that he will <Col N="554" /> not be extradited.  Committal for trial would begin only when that person was over on the other side.  It is conceivable that a <i>prima facie</i> case could be proven, a person be brought over to the other side and no proceedings begin against him; it is not likely but it is conceivable. For that reason, since the Attorney General is not involved in committing anybody for trial under the additional role he will play under the terms of this Bill, I fail to understand how he can be brought into the judicial domain on that basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the <i>prima facie</i> case &mdash; which is the bone of contention &mdash; and the amendments put down and in regard to the Progressive Democrats' amendment, my understanding is that written submissions will be made in the District Court but it would not be open in any way to the defendant to question what is contained in those submissions.  The fact that they were taken on affidavit and had been sworn before a commissioner for oaths would deem them to be fairly accurate. But it would not be within the remit of the defendant to seek oral evidence on those written submissions.  It would appear to be the case that if what is alleged against a defendant were true then there is an assumption that there is a sufficiency of evidence to extradite him and he would be sent off.  I do not believe that a written submission is superior to the highest law officer of the land examining the position before a warrant is issued at all.  Perhaps that is one point that has been missed and maybe one of the pluses in having the Attorney General involved under the terms of this Bill.  His involvement affords us an opportunity to ensure that no warrant issues.  Even if there was a <i>prima facie</i> case without the safeguard of the Attorney General's involvement, once a warrant is sent from England and endorsed by the Garda Commissioner, that person will be immediately subject to the extradition process, he will have to go into the District Court, face that situation, go to the High Court and face that situation.  Automatically there will be a process set in train even with a <i>prima facie</i> case.  The involvement of the Attorney General <Col N="555" /> means that he can ensure that no warrant at all will issue.  Where, on the face of it, there is not a sufficiency of evidence, there will be no question of a warrant being issued against a person and he having to defend himself.  The onus will be on him to prove that he should not be extradited once the extradition process begins.  The Attorney General's function will be to ensure that the warrant will not issue in the first place.  Surely, in the majority of cases to which it will apply, that constitutes a very real safeguard?  It will ensure that the process will not begin at all.  If that is not deemed to be a safeguard I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The <i>prima facie</i> requirement, which as Deputy Taylor says does not constitute a very high standard of proof &mdash; which it does not &mdash; would still ensure that that person would have to go through that process, could be extradited on a very low level of proof and sent off.  That is the practicality of that requirement. There is a big mystique about what is a <i>prima facie</i> case, as if that constituted the solution to all our problems.  I would suggest that the Attorney General's role will constitute a much greater safeguard because he will be working independently, examining the evidence and if it is not found to be sufficient, then no warrant will issue.  If that is not as good a safeguard as can be got I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a problem with regard to the <i>prima facie</i> case on the basis that the country or authorities seeking extradition would require the book of evidence to be collated fairly quickly under their rules of evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I have not taken even a quarter of the time other speakers have.  I have taken about 10 minutes to make approximately five points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I am making is that the book of evidence will have to be collated fairly quickly under the laws of evidence <Col N="556" /> of the country seeking extradition.  What could happen is that people would be extradited purely on legal technicalities without going into the merits of the case at all.  To my mind there are some pluses to the <i>prima facie</i> argument.  I advocated them last year and again recently. However, there are also minuses which have been pointed out to me and that is one of them.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about extraditing people who should be extradited if there is sufficient evidence against them, then the <i>prima facie</i> rule could detract from that case if the legal technicality argument is to take over because of the differences in rules of evidence.  Take the example of some continental countries where hearsay evidence is allowed.  We do not allow it.  We could have people coming from those types of jurisdictions not acquainted with our rules of evidence. The argument could be made that that is their problem and I accept it.</P>
    <P>This <i>prima facie</i> evidence requirement does not constitute a full solution.  It is not the panacea that Deputy McCartan would have us believe it is.  In practical, pragmatic terms &mdash; and it is that that will matter in the case of defendants about whom we are talking &mdash; the Attorney General's involvement, which will ensure that a warrant will not issue in the first place for people who are clearly innocent, against whom there are no grounds, is the best safeguard that can be had in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Cowen on playing a blinder and making matters even more obscure than they have been.  I know that was not an accident; he is far too bright for any accidents of that nature.  The discussion on these three amendments was much more like a <Col N="559" /> Second Stage than a Committee Stage debate.  In particular it seems as if the House could have duplicated for a law school.  For those of us who are not qualified in that gentle art it would have been intriguing if it was not such a long drawnout waste of time in that there was little if any input from the Minister.  On Committee Stage the nub of the matter should be the putting of the amendment and if the Minister would then give his views at that stage it would make for much clearer discussion thereafter.  We could find out whether there was any common ground between the Minister or the Government's point of view and that of the proposers of the amendments.</P>
      <P>I detected something in the Minister's contribution that is somewhat disturbing. I gathered from his contribution that expeditious extradition is something to be desired even at the expense of the innocent who may be sent for in what I might call a slot machine extradition operation such as we are now engaged in.  The Taoiseach also intervened, not for the first time, and pushed one aspect about which I have no particular grievance. His concern that a provision whereby the Minister by regulation would appoint someone of whatever hue, kind or colour, size or importance is more dangerous and less desirable than having the Attorney General as proposed in this Bill.  If it is done by way of regulation by the Minister, he is subject and answerable to this House while the Attorney General is not.  Secondly, if regulations appointing such a person were dealt with in the normal way, I take it those regulations would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and could be amended or otherwise as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the overall Committee Stage debate, law lectures, or whatever you like to call it, that we have engaged in so far today is concerned, the Government and the Minister, with the Taoiseach at his side, should get wise to the idea that the concern throughout the country is not as they have been projecting here about getting quick expeditious slot machine extradition of <Col N="560" /> our citizens but rather is about the 1987 Act and the way the 1965 Act is being amended.  In so far as the application of the two Acts is concerned in sending people to the Six Counties and to Britain, the public do not want that when we can deal with them here ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One expression has been bandied across the floor of the House today and that is &ldquo;the most favoured nation&rdquo;.  The British complain they are not the most favoured nation as far as this matter is concerned and there has been talk as to who is or who is not the most favoured nation.  That is an expression that is appropriate to trade agreements.  It is in the context of importing sacks of coffee beans, sacks of rice and so on that one normally talks about the most favoured nation.  It has no bearing when one is talking about people, where they will be tried, if they are to be tried and if they are to be extradited from this country.  Neither does it refer to the history of a matter of extradition.  I have heard Deputies quoting from Acts as far back as the 1870s.  We are planning for the present and the future as to what is right and proper for us in this House to adopt.  It is not the concern of anybody else, other than the Seanad perhaps.  We are not involved with an extradition treaty; we are involved in updating our law and this has come about by reason of the coming into force of the Extradition Act, 1987, and the new situation it brings about.  We are dealing with a new position, we are planning henceforth and the question of past arrangements should be neither here nor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to devise an acceptable and safe system and we have suggested a revised form of <i>prima facie</i> evidence as the necessary proof.  The Minister is disclaiming with some force the concept of the <i>prima facie</i> situation but his Bill imports a <i>prima facie</i> situation and it can and will lead to the question of a <i>prima facie</i> situation in court.  What will the position be?  The Attorney General will make his decision on the matter and the case will be brought to the District Court. Whether it is brought to the District <Col N="561" /> Court or to the High Court, the matter will come up for review in virtually every case.  The Minister himself admitted that last night and he was quite right.  His decisions on this issue will be open to review at least in the High Court and possibly in the District Court when the matter comes up there.  What exactly is it that the High Court will be reviewing? It will be reviewing whether the decision of the Attorney General was reasonable having regard to all the circumstances. That is what the review will be.</P>
    <P>We can be sure of one thing.  High Court judges are pretty thorough in these matters and when the High Court comes to decide whether the Attorney General has been reasonable in the decision he made it will go into all aspects of the matter and that means that sufficiency of the evidence because &ldquo;sufficiency of evidence&rdquo; are the very words used in section 2 of the Bill.  Therefore, the High Court will examine the sufficiency of the evidence and decide whether the Attorney General's decision was reasonable, having regard to the sufficiency of the evidence and if that is not a form of <i>prima facie</i> adjudication, I do not know what is.  It is the Attorney General in the witness box &mdash; and I would not envy him in the position &mdash; who will have to explain to the High Court judge or to the district justice, as the case may be, what he saw, what he asked for and why he made a decision, why it was not a capricious decision, what it was based on, what more information he may or may not have sought.  What is this sufficiency of evidence?  It is <i>prima facie</i> by another name.  It is, even on the Minister's own Bill, a <i>prima facie</i> situation.</P>
    <P>Why then leave us open to the delays and complexities involved in having these cases taken to the High Court quite unnecessarily?  The Minister says he is very anxious that there should be a swift, speedy procedure for dealing with these cases, that great delays are the one thing that should be avoided and that would be avoided if the matter were dealt with on sworn statements in the District Court. It is the Minister's procedures which will cause incredible delays.  I do not think <Col N="562" /> there is any undue delay in the British Attorney General sending over sworn statements he will have to take from his witnesses anyway when the matter comes up in the District Court and is dealt with there.  That is a quick speedy procedure. There should be no undue delay involved there because, presumably, the British Attorney General will have the statements from his witnesses.  Otherwise he would not or should not be setting about the business of seeking extradition.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's system I can see prolonged delays in all cases because they will end up for review in the High Court, which is a very lengthy procedure, involving dates for oral hearings for examination of the Attorney General as to exactly what he was about in coming to his decision.  By the time that is all done and that High Court review is possibly on appeal to the Supreme Court, where is the Minister's speedy efficient procedure? That is the crucial question, the reasonableness of the Attorney General's decision can be called into question on review.  Let us be absolutely clear about that.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General could even be served with a <i>sub-poena</i>.  I know one of the sections says there are certain presumptions that arise on the issue in favour of the prosecution.  That is true and I see the purport and intent of that but that presumption is a rebuttable presumption. It will not debar counsel or solicitor for an arrested person from seeking to rebut the presumption by calling the Attorney General and putting him on the spot to explain himself as to whether he even saw the warrant and what else he saw and be cross-examined about it even in the District Court.  The person in the District Court is perfectly entitled under the proposed section 44C to set about trying to prove the contrary and the one way he would do that would be by sharing a subpoena on the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>This argument about speed and efficiency does not stand up.  I see the reverse happening.  We would be much better off having the statements sent over, having the thing done clearly and openly.  It is unfortunate if that does not <Col N="563" /> please the British authorities and I would regret that very much because we should have the best possible relations with them.  However, that is not to say we must compromise our position on what we regard as the bottom line on providing adequate safeguards.  It is our decision and that should be the sole criterion motivating this House in dealing with this new situation that arises from the coming into operation of the 1987 Extradition Act.  It is the affair of this country, this House and the Seanad, of the Oireachtas here and of nobody else.  We are not in the business of negotiating treaties; we are in the business of making new law for a situation that applies now, a position that has not applied hitherto.  We should have a care on how we do it and that has not happened here.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned that the thing will end up in one prolonged litigation mess in the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  It will cause endless delays, endless difficulties and will complicate the procedure.  If we are having difficulties with the British authorities on the basis of what has happened until now they will be very much compounded if we go ahead on the basis of this Bill.  We have prepared these amendments, very carefully and moderately formulated, to try to avoid that highly undesirable situation from arising and the difficulties it would give rise to.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House in view of the time constraint so I will be as brief as I can.  I want to deal first with the Taoiseach's intervention. The only reason I deal with it is because the Taoiseach made it, and it might appear to have some significance as it was his only intervention at this stage. The Taoiseach made great play of paragraph (3) of our amendment No. 1 as if it were something of tremendous significance. In fact, it is purely procedural in relation to the rules of procedure in the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are proposing in paragraph (3) is purely procedural. I feel sure the Taoiseach knows that even though he seeks to suggest that the making of regulations or orders by the Minister under this Bill as proposed would be in some way enormously significant. The Taoiseach sought to give that impression which, of course, would mislead anyone who did not know what was the position.  Under section 3 of the Bill the Minister has power to make regulations but there is nothing about that.  I have been looking at the other two Acts. In the 1987 Act, the one that came into force yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is given power to make regulations about one aspect of that Act and the Government are given power to make regulations about another aspect of it. <Col N="565" /> There is no question of anything secretive or unusual being done.  In section 8 of the 1965 Act there are no less than eight separate references to powers given to the Government to make orders and regulations.  Of course, the Government from time to time, acting via the Minister for Justice, have done that and there is absolutely nothing unusual in it.  It could just as easily be done by the District Court Rules Committee and, in fact, it is similar to the District Court Rules on Extradition which I see were made by the committee on 7 September 1971 by four of them, two district justices and the other two either solicitors or District Court clerks.  I concurred in the making of the rules on 23 September 1971.  It is routine, a thing which is done every day of the week and it is only an attempt to mislead the House to suggest something sinister or unusual in this.</P>
      <P>It is interesting, Sir, that the only point in relation to our amendment, which is relatively lengthy, which the Taoiseach felt that he could or should make was this rather hollow point in regard to the rule making powers of the District Court. He did not raise any point in relation to the substance of the amendment.  The substance of it stands and is perfectly valid.  It is certainly short of the full <i>prima facie</i> procedure which has been suggested by some others &mdash; I do not deny that but one must try to achieve a balance between protection of rights and workability. This has workability; it is not open to challenge in the way that the Attorney General procedure is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Taylor has said about bringing the Attorney General even into the District Court is probably right.  He certainly can be brought into the High Court and asked to account for his decision.  One cannot give him an unreviewable discretion in relation to matters of personal liberty of this kind.  In addition to bringing him in personally and his being examined in this regard, it is open to the party whose extradition is sought when he is challenging this in the High Court, as he has a right to do under the 1965 Act, to ask for discovery of <Col N="566" /> documents.  That would not arise if our procedure were followed.  The only document in question would be the affidavit which he would have anyway and he would have nothing else to get.  He can do some very lucrative fishing, I suggest, with an application for discovery of documents in relation to what the Attorney General reads privately in his room in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>The documents will, in the nature of the thing, consist for the most part of police reports from some police force or other in either Britain or Northern Ireland.  I was going to say if that becomes the norm, but if it happens even once the whole thing will dry up because what police force in Northern Ireland or in Britain will send documents down here to the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General if as a result of an application for discovery of documents they are going to be paraded down in the High Court?</P>

      <P>It is another example of why this proposal in section 2 is not going to work.  A point was made, I think by Deputy Birmingham, and it is an absolutely valid one.  As we have all said, the first person who will be extradited under this law will challenge it.  He will go the whole way through the three courts &mdash; the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  All extradition procedures will stop for about a year until those three courts have been gone through.  It will take the best part of a <Col N="567" /> year, even with unusual expedition, to get the same case decided in those three courts.  That is a frightening possibility for us.  All those difficulties can be overcome. There will be fairness and some reasonable degree of safeguard if our amendment is accepted.  The other proposal is wide open and because it seeks to exclude the courts and to exclude the power of review, it seems that they will fall over backwards in trying to establish the right to protect the individual concerned.  It would be much better if the procedure were reasonable and straightforward as in our amendment.  I have listened now for quite a while to all the arguments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am absolutely convinced from all I have heard that what we propose here is the superior method. It is not open to the same objections and it cannot be used to obstruct legitimate extradition in the way that the other rather grotesque procedure will be by being challenged in order to obstruct extradition.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to point out to the House, and invite the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice to take on board once again, the point that Deputy McDowell made the other day and which has not been replied to.  This is if you read section 2, that there is no obligation on anybody to submit any of these cases to the Attorney General. There is nothing you can do about it because by section 44C, there is a presumption that the order was not made and that it was not required to be made. That very presumption strenghtens what I am stating, that there is no obligation to submit any of these warrants to the Attorney General.  It is one of the consequences of the way in which this is drafted.  It is drafted backwards for the purpose of trying to exclude that.  If this is not going to be dealt with and if it is not going to be denied, we are entitled to assume that it is as we say and that is quite ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  That was one of the points I felt must be clarified. I am very concerned and I want to make my concern known.  Perhaps about 10 per cent of the membership of the House have taken a detailed interest in this Bill. The Bill itself is confusing.  When the Explanatory Memorandum arrived some days after the Bill, I must say sadly that it was confusing rather than the reverse. At 5.20 p.m., if the Minister for Justice holds the line which he is at present holding, we shall make a serious error in terms of the law which is going to be implemented.  Recently, one of our Supreme Court judges said that law in this country is coming into disrepute.  I believe that we are actually going to help that process now because we are going to pass into law something that even the 10 per cent of us who have taken an interest in this Bill are absolutely uncertain about. I cannot find in either the Bill or the Explanatory Memorandum the obligation <Col N="569" /> to which the Taoiseach has just referred. From reading the Bill and consulting people in the profession, I cannot see the absolute obligation that every warrant has to be transferred to the Attorney General.  Perhaps the Minister in replying might get an opportunity of actually spelling it out to us.  We are entitled to know.</P>
      <P>We may all be wasting our words here. I think that this will be discussed in a relatively short time at another venue because we can all be certain that this Bill will be challenged.  It is obvious from comments that have been made by lawyers outside this House that they think it has weaknesses.  Obviously, that is the process which has to be gone through. In relation to the office of the Attorney General, I would argue with the Minister and the Taoiseach present in the House that what we are proposing to do is an absolute disservice to that office.  Anybody who has served in Government in this country knows the pressure and the strains on the office, of the Attorney General, particularly in relation to the preparation of legislation.  If the obligation which the Taoiseach says is there is, in fact, there, we are piling the burden on to that office in terms of the preparation of legal advice, in terms of consultation with the parliamentary draftsman, in terms of preparation of legislation, which is an ongoing process. I have as much respect as any Member of this House has for the present incumbent of the Attorney General's office who is and has been a good servant of the State but we are doing a great disservice to his office.  It is not in the best interests of the Government to do so.  Even if it means having consultations and discussions with the Opposition parties in relation to the amendments we should find another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could give us some of the background as to where this idea came from.  Did the idea come from the office of the Attorney General, did it emanate from the Department of Justice or did it come from outside lawyers as is commonly believed?  Perhaps, the Minister would give us some insight into the legal advice he is operating on.  There is <Col N="570" /> a depth of confusion among most of those Deputies on this Bill and this is not doing a service either to this House, the people we are trying to protect or to the efficacy of law.  This matter will probably have to be clarified in another venue which may well be the European Court rather than our own courts.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that the highest legal officer in the State is going to be a witness, possibly on an every day basis, in the District Court.  It is ludicrous that the Attorney General is going to be both a defendant and a witness in court cases. That is not in the best interests of the office he holds.  The Taoiseach has intervened on one occasion and seems to feel with a certain degree of certainty that there is an obligation to transfer every warrant to the Attorney General's office. I do not see that in the Bill nor is it clarified in the Explanatory Memorandum. It would be of some assistance if the Minister could do that even though I fundamentally object to what is being proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I urge the Minister to reconsider what we are doing because it is not in the best interests of this House nor in the interests of making legislation which is our primary function. It will not stand the test of time.  The amendments put forward in Deputy Taylor's name on behalf of the Labour Party offer better safeguards and the Minister has given us no reason why they cannot be taken on board by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Government are <Col N="571" /> totally convinced that the wording of the proposed sections 44A and 44B is such that the Attorney General must by this Statute examine every warrant.  Section 44A says that such a warrant shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs.  There is an obligation implicit on the Attorney General in that to examine every warrant to see whether or not he will direct.  Section 44B says that the &ldquo;direction of the Attorney General shall be given... unless the Attorney General is of opinion&rdquo;.  Again, clearly there is an obligation implicit on the Attorney General in that to look at every warrant to see whether he should come to such an opinion.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the contribution made by Deputy Cowen to the debate.  To those who will say at the end of this debate that we have not answered the observations which were made from the Government benches I would like to say that the procedures proposed by the amendment advanced by the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party are preferable for one simple reason and that is because they provide for a determination to be made in open court where justice will not only be done but will be seen to be done.  That is fundamental to our objections to the procedures proposed by the Government. So far as The Workers' Party are concerned, that is not to be taken as a reflection on the integrity on the office of <Col N="572" /> the Attorney General or on the constitutionality of his functions if ultimately he assumes them.  That is not what is sought.  What we are concerned about is that active and proper safeguards in any judicial process are ones which are dealt with, pursued and exercised in open court by judges appointed for that function and where the parties have an opportuntiy to be heard.  Therefore, when it comes down to all other matters, that one remaining factor is the one which convinces The Workers' Party that such a procedure is far more preferable.</P>

      <P>A question from Deputy Taylor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Attorney General would be compellable and amenable to the court as a witness on review of his decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is considering his reply to that question let me say that is a point which occurred to me independently this morning.  Proceedings will issue and they will either be plenary proceedings or proceedings in the District Court.  Although Deputy Cowen is right in saying that there is a presumption in this matter it is a rebutable presumption and it is open to somebody to seek to rebut it by all legal evidence. It is not simply a matter of serving a <i>sub poena</i> on the Attorney General.  A <i>sub poena duces tecum</i> will also be served on him so that he will have to bring everything on how he reached a decision with him to the District Court.  He would have to queue up there with the drunks of last night waiting to be heard on an extradition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I am concerned about the time factor.  A question has also been put by Deputy Taylor and the Taoiseach or the Minister should be <Col N="573" /> afforded an opportunity to reply before the appropriate time arrives to put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything in this Act to immunise the Attorney General from being amenable to the courts as a witness, bringing all his records with him, and from the process of discovery?  I believe there is not and that this will be the single measure which will destroy the Office of the Attorney General, if implemented.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, if the logic of the Opposition is correct why is it that the DPP is not being asked to justify every prosecution?  In the same way, in relation to this office which happens to have an international dimension, why should the Attorney General be asked to go to the court?  If the DPP had to justify in court every prosecution, Mr. Eamon Barnes would be in court day in and day out.</P>

Undoubtedly, there is consensus among us that we all want safeguards. The Government are satisfied that we have struck the right balance between the rights of the citizen and what is required to make extradition work.  The suggestions we have heard here today during the course of the discussion on the three amendments would upset that particular balance and, therefore, make the extradition procedures unworkable. We cannot afford that and that is why we are more than satisfied that the approach adopted in the Bill is the right and proper one.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair in regard to my amendment but I must point out that moving that amendment would have afforded the Minister the opportunity to tell the House if the Government would welcome a decision of the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution.  I do not claim to be a constitutional lawyer but, having listened to the debate for many hours and to the many legal opinions put forward, I am sure that in the Law Library there is a 50/50 split on the issue. Deputy Birmingham mentioned this morning that if the Bill is not tested in the Supreme Court, following a decision by the President to refer it to that court, the chances are that the first time it will be tested will be when the first case is brought before the District Court after the passing of this legislation, if that happens. It would be wiser if the President saw fit to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court for their ruling rather than having somebody who may be as guilty as hell <Col N="580" /> walking free from a court after winning a constitutional case in the Supreme Court. In my view the Minister should avail of the opportunity to state publicly whether the Government would welcome a decision by the President to refer the matter to the Supreme Court.</P>

In reply to Deputy Barrett I should like to say that the Chair gave his decision in respect of Deputy Barrett's amendment because the constitutional position to him is quite clear.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely welcome the Chair's observations about the role of the President.  It must be understood in the House, especially since the Chair has made it clear that one has to be a member of the Law Library to understand this basic point, that the President's power to refer a Bill under Article 26 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court is his decision and his decision alone.  This House would exceed itself and trample down a basic constitutional convention if it started at any stage during any discussion on any Bill to contemplate preempting the President's total discretion in this matter or obliging him by political pressure one way or another to exercise <Col N="581" /> what is his function under the Constitution as a last guardian of the Constitution. The point I should like to make is that any party who comes to the House with an amendment like that proposed by Deputy Barrett &mdash; thank heavens it has been ruled out of order &mdash; seems to misunderstand the function of this place. We are here to bring in legislation that is good and is constitutional.  We are not here to throw up legislative balls in the air and then pop them at the President and see how he will react to them.  We have a duty as legislators to bring in legislation which we believe in our hearts is constitutional.  If Deputy Barrett, or any Member of the Fine Gael benches, has any doubt about the Bill let them vote against it at Second Stage, Committee Stage, Fourth Stage and Fifth Stage. They cannot opt out, do a con job or a snow job on this.  If they have a constitutional doubt about this Bill they should say so in public and vote against it. They should not put it up to the President and try to use his last ditch safeguard as a way of getting them off a hook.</P>

      <P>The House has a deep duty &mdash; I will not be barracked out of saying this &mdash; to enact constitutional legislation.  It is a total misunderstanding of our function if we are to say that we will have a flier at a Bill, rush it through the House and then expect the President to save us from the consequences of our own folly.  That is not what the Oireachtas is about.  The President is part of the Oireachtas as is this House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but it must be understood that the House has a duty to do its best.  If there is any Deputy in the House who believes that section 1, or any other section in the Bill, is unconstitutional that Deputy has a duty to vote in accordance with his or her views and not to indulge in gimmickry, nonsense and intellectual flim flam for the benefit of the journalists who observe our proceedings.  That is what is going on; it is a con job and I am determined to expose it.</P>

      <P>This will be a brief intervention on my part because the House has agreed that these votes should take place now so that we can get on to discussing other amendments as fully as possible in the time available.  This is all by the way because what happens after legislation leaves the House is something <Col N="583" /> over which we have no control.  I do know, however, that there is some dispute among constitutional lawyers as to whether a reference by the President to the Supreme Court is a good thing.  In one way, as I understand it, it brings certainty into the matter and from then on everybody knows exactly what the law is.  On the other hand I know, because I have been a member of the Council of State, that there is another argument which says that in regard to any piece of legislation which should only be tested <i>ad rem,</i> it should only be tested in relation to a particular set of circumstances when all the arguments are marshalled properly which, to some extent, they might not be under reference provisions.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for lawyers to make up their minds as to which is the best procedure. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned we want to be very careful about this matter.  We fully recognise that it is the right of the President, totally in his own jurisdiction, in the exercise of his constitutional powers to decide whether there should be a reference.  In all cases, however, he has to consult with the Council of State first but then it is a matter for him after that whether he refers something to the Supreme Court. I do not think it would be appropriate for the Government when legislation is going through the House to say whether they would wish the President to exercise his exclusive constitutional powers.  The Government are in a special position in this regard.  However, it is open to any Deputy to say that in regard to this piece of legislation, he/she would like to see it referred.  This is perfectly legitimate.  I do not think it is a matter for the Government sponsoring the legislation to say whether we would wish to see it referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the bounds of propriety I am permitted to say this: if the President in exercise of his constitutional powers so decides, as far as we are concerned, there will be no objection and we would not view that with any reservations or doubts, or anything of that kind.  As far as we are concerned, as a Government sponsoring <Col N="584" /> this legislation, we will leave it entirely to the discretion of the President in the exercise of his constitutional powers and as far as we are concerned we would have no objection if he does so.  On the other hand, we could not have any objection if he does not.  I think that is a fair statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), to <Col N="591" /> delete lines 11 to 27, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;44A.  &mdash;(1)  A warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence under the law of a place in relation to which this Part applies shall only be endorsed for execution under this Part if a Judge of the High Court certifies that he is of the opinion that:</P>
    <P>(a)  there is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case may be, to continue the prosecution of, the person named or described in the warrant concerned for the offences specified therein in a place in relation to which this Part applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(2)  A Judge of the High Court shall only certify a warrant under this section when a request for extradition is accompanied by a statement of fact, by way of affidavit or statutory declaration, which satisfies the Judge that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed, and that the person sought committed it.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments follow from the consequent loss of the vote in respect of the main issue impinging on section 2, that is the question of the introduction of the <i>prima facie</i> process or some analogous process.  What we seek to achieve by these amendments, in particular the substantive one, No. 6, is to introduce improvements into the scheme of things, as proposed by the Government's Bill, and to ascertain whether there is Government agreement to meet our concerns as voiced in the course of the Second Stage debate and our reservations already expressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the record I want to state what is intended.  We are seeking to supplant the new section 44A of the 1965 Act, as contained in section 2 (1) <Col N="592" /> (a) of the Bill, as circulated, by the substitution of the new section 44A prepared in our amendment No. 6.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are consequential amendments, substituting in three places in the Bill, the words &ldquo;a Judge of the High Court&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo;.  The basic proposition here is very much a second best for The Workers' Party but one we are now thrown back on in view of the weak approach of the Fine Gael Party to the whole question of safeguards and their non-support &mdash; here at least one has to give them credit for an element of consistency &mdash; for the notion of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  Therefore we are thrown back to what we consider to be the next desirable position.  We propose that instead of the Attorney General dealing with these matters a judge of the High Court would deal with them.  We are concerned not so much from the point of view of the Constitution but that what is in the realm of judicial and quasi-judicial process, what requires adjudication and determination, should be undertaken by a member of the Judiciary so appointed under the Constitution with all the constitutional obligations that are imposed upon a holder of such a high office.  A member of the Judiciary is obliged under the Constitution to take an oath to uphold the principles contained in the Constitution, principles that should be applied in the determination of a decision to act or not to act under section 2 of the Bill as proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is also a preferable arrangement because it does not throw on to the shoulders of any one person the very onerous responsibility being visited upon the Attorney General by the Government's scheme.  We envisage that any member of the Judiciary available or appointed for the purpose will exercise the functions. We have drafted the amendment in a way that allows for that person to engage in the self same exercises and towards the self same ends as the Attorney General would be asked to do under the Government Bill.</P>
    <P>Our amendment goes a little further in relation to establishing in subsection (2) <Col N="593" /> what will have to be specifically before the judge when he or she deals with functions under our proposed amendment. We say that it should be by way of affidavit or statutory declaration involving a statement of fact to such an extent that he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed and that the person sought is the person who has committed it.  We made this point in relation to the current scheme proposed by the Government. There is no indication as to what extent the Attorney General will have to go in regard to reaching a decision under the Bill.  This is the second best option but one that is preferable to invoking the office of the Attorney General in this way.  The reasons it is preferable have been advanced in the arguments earlier in this debate for a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not see any reason for the introduction of this legislation.  During my Second Stage speech I mentioned that the arrangements that were in place when the Extradition Act was passed in 1986, now known as the Extradition Act, 1987, were quite adequate and could have worked quite well without having to enshrine them in legislation.  What I have to say is based on that principle, that we do not feel there is a need for this legislation.  I also covered in my Second Stage speech the reasons I thought this Bill was being introduced.  I said at the time that it was being introduced solely to satisfy unrest among the Fianna Fáil Party as a result of the welcome decision of the Government to allow the Extradition Act, 1987, to come into force on 1 December.  We are operating on the basis that we have legislation before us that was introduced for political reasons. There is no question in my mind that the reason the Attorney General has been chosen by the Government to perform the functions set out under the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, was to satisfy political unrest.  Let us not put a tooth in it; That is the reason this Bill was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the 1965 Act was inserted <Col N="594" /> because at that time Britain had not ratified the 1957 Convention on Extradition. To date they have not ratified it.  The indications are that the British Government intend proceeding with legislation to remove from their Statute Books the <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  My clear understanding is that if we were to insist on a <i>prima facie</i> requirement being inserted into this legislation or into the 1987 Act we would be forced to withdraw from the 1957 Convention on Extradition.</P>
    <P>I respect the views of The Workers' Party and of the PDs who consistently argued throughout the debate in 1986 for a <i>prima facie</i> requirement.  The PDs have since changed their position and have produced a different amendment today. During the course of Deputy McCartan's contribution he made it quite clear that he did not see anything wrong with Ireland having to withdraw from the 1957 Convention on Extradition.  That is where The Workers' Party and the Fine Gael Party immediately part company because we have no intention of bringing about a situation where this country would be seen to be withdrawing from the 1957 Convention on Extradition.  Of all the countries that need help at this time this island does.  We are plagued with acts of violence and terrorism and it would be strange if we gave the impression abroad that we were not too keen to co-operate with others to deal with that horrific problem of violence and terrorism.  Therefore, it is in our interest to have the closest co-operation possible with our neighbour, Great Britain, and with other European countries to see to it that people who commit these crimes of terrorism and so on are brought to justice and are dealt with fairly in the course of whatever country has to deal with them.  We should not be afraid to state our position quite clearly.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for argument sake, that the bomb that exploded in Enniskillen had exploded in Cork city, Dublin city or Limerick, how would we feel if the person or persons involved in that horrific act were safely across the Border in Northern Ireland and that because of changes in legislation in that part of this island it <Col N="595" /> became more difficult to have them brought to the South to face justice?  How would we feel about co-operating in pursuance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement if we saw that happening in either Great Britain or Northern Ireland?  That is another question we should ask ourselves. For that reason I do not see why the administrative arrangements that were outlined by me and by the Leader of my Party last night, which built in as a result of the passing of the 1965 Act, could not have proceeded along the lines intended without having to be enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>We have heard all the arguments, this morning, this afternoon, for the last number of days about whether this legislation is constitutional as a result of inserting the requirement that the Attorney General, before he gives a decision in relation to a warrant, must have sufficient evidence.  That does not arise if there is a clear understanding between two governments that certain procedures will be followed before a warrant is sent over her for execution; we do not face constitutional problems.  These things can be dealt with by two friendly countries operating and co-operating together to deal with a common purpose, the horrific problem of terrorism and violence and other severe crime.  Once we get into the area of legislation we have all these constitutional problems and a feeling abroad that perhaps we are making it more difficult to extradite people who may or may not be responsible for an act that none of us would agree to.  That is the reality of the situation we are now faced with.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have tabled this amendment substituting the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Attorney General. Lest there be any fear that this is some new idea, I would argue that it is far more consistent with the attitude of the Oireachtas ever since the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974 was passed.  The function proposed by the Attorney General in this Bill should be accorded instead to the Director of Public Prosecutions. We decided that back in 1974. <Col N="596" /> It is not a new idea but in this Bill we are now loading on to the Attorney General additional responsibility before he can make a decision.  I do not profess to be a lawyer or a constitutional expert but this, in my opinion, puts the Attorney General in a judicial or quasi-judicial role which could be contrary to the Constitution.  I am not in a position to say any more than that; I just have to listen to the advice I get from various people.  Having listened to various experts one tells me that it could be; another tells me that it might be and others say it is not.  For that reason, we tabled an amendment which we accept was ruled out of order and, as Deputy McDowell said, may not have been the correct thing to do.  But at least it afforded this Parliament the opportunity to debate the issue and seek the views of the Taoiseach, the Minister and his Government on the issue.  We make no apologise whatsoever for that.</P>
    <P>I do not feel it is reasonable to ask the Attorney General to take on the role that this Bill sets out for him and which puts him in an extremely awkward position. Whether we like it or not, there is a perception outside that the Attorney General is a political figure.  He is appointed at the same time as the Government, by the Taoiseach.  He is very close to his colleagues in Government and to the person who appointed him.  He is, whether we like it or not, regarded as a political figure.  There have been cases in the past where Members of this Dáil have been appointed as Attorneys General.  The professional lawyers say that the Attorney General behaves in a professional manner, does his duty as the legal adviser to the Government and will not in, any way, be influenced by any representations, hints, nods or winks from anybody.  That may be so, and I do not for one moment suggest that the present incumbent of that position would act in any way not in keeping with the standards his predecessors have set.  I am not suggesting that the Taoiseach or any member of his Government would make representations to or approach that person but that is not the issue.  The issue is that <Col N="597" /> the great public outside have a feeling that this person can be got at.  When I say that I mean no disrespect to the holder of the Office, to those who may follow him, or to those who have gone before him but that is the position, and for that reason it is far more satisfactory to replace the Attorney General with the Director of Public Prosecutions in this Bill because, again, the public perception is such that the Director of Public Prosecutions is not regarded as a political figure or as somebody who is close to the Government of the day; he is not a person appointed by the Taoiseach or any member of his Government, and he is not a person that people would consider making representations to.  For that reason we feel that it is perfectly logical and understandable that the public would have more confidence if they saw the Director of Public Prosecutions fulfilling the role the Attorney General is being asked to do in the Bill now before us. That is a perfectly acceptable argument on our part.  I urge the Government to accept, in good faith, the reasons we are putting forward that amendment.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other points I would like to make in relation to the amendment.  The suggestion is that the Director of Public Prosecutions must have reason to believe that there is not a clear intention to prosecute before he agrees to endorsing a warrant.  That is far more acceptable and a better way of wording than what is presently there in relation to the Attorney General.  We also feel that it is better that we word our amendment in such a way that the Director of Public Prosecutions shall be of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute.  Therefore the Director of Public Prosecutions is not required to satisfy himself of that intention, nor is he required to consider any particular information or facts.</P>
    <P>People may say that we are soft, that we are not looking for safeguards.  My argument would be that if that amendment were accepted it would, without doubt, remove any possibility of a constitutional challenge, and it would also leave room for the Government of the <Col N="598" /> day to continue with other administrative arrangements with the British authorities just as are there at present, without having to include in legislation the need to be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence. There is no reason whatsoever that two soverign governments cannot get together on the basis of a new Act which specifies certain requirements with, in addition, a clear understanding that before a warrant is sent here for execution the British Attorney General or the Crown Prosecution Service would be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute.  That is a perfectly understandable and logical stand to take because, whether we like it or not, all extradition treaties between countries are based on trust.  We assume that a country we enter into an agreement with will act in good faith.  We should have no reason to believe otherwise.  Similarly, the British Government should feel that we will act in good faith in respect of warrants we send to them for execution.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that if this legislation is passed in its present form we will bring about a situation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland where there will be an insistence that their Act, which sets out the arrangements at present for the execution of warrants, will also be altered.  That is something we have to consider, and it is reasonable that we should take that into account.  Therefore it will be equally difficult for us to bring to justice here somebody who may have committed an atrocity in this jurisdiction. It is not all one way traffic.  To listen to some of the contributions here today, one would think that it was all one way traffic. It can happen, and it has happened in the past &mdash; and I sincerely hope for all our sakes that it will not happen in the future &mdash; that people have come here and planted bombs and killed and maimed people who are citizens and residents in this country.  We must consider what is likely to happen in the future.  We do not want to be in a situation where the Government we are dealing with are putting obstacles in our way to bringing somebody into our jurisdiction to face <Col N="599" /> justice.  I would urge those who feel that this is all one way traffic to think again.</P>
    <P>We have also heard that there is a danger that Irish people extradited to Leeds or Scunthorpe or wherever may not get a fair trial.  I, as a layman, would say that the longer we keep talking like that the greater the chance in the future that Irish people facing juries in Great Britain will not have their chances of getting a fair trial improved.</P>
    <P>If we give an impression abroad that we do not trust the British public to give a fair trial to an Irish citizen, we are putting many obstacles, many dangers in the way of innocent people who are at present living in Great Britain and earning a living there.  We are not improving their chances.  We should be very careful of the language we use because, at the end of the day, there will be 12 men and women sitting on a jury, and their impression of what the Irish might think of them might be coloured by some of the dangerous statements that have been made on this issue over the last number of days.</P>
    <P>I urge every Member of this House to recognise that we entered an agreement with the British Government back in 1965 when we inserted Part III into the Act.  I do not, for one moment, object to safeguards. They are needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not shy about them.  The reality is that in 1986 the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Alan Dukes, outlined to the Dáil that it was intended to tighten up the administration arrangements whereby a warrant for the return of a fugitive would not be sought unless the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland or the Crown Prosecution Service in Britain had considered the evidence and was satisfied that it was sufficient to ground a clear expectation of prosecution.  We, for our part, have made a reciprocal decision that we would continue our existing practice of having our warrants assessed for evidence by the <Col N="600" /> Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions before they are sent for execution in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.</P>
      <P>I challenge anybody to tell me what has changed in the last 12 months that we urgently need legislation.  Has that not worked?  Can the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice outline to us a number of examples where the present administrative arrangements have not worked that there is now a need to bring in legislation to force other people to do things? Is it just a question of satisfying members of Fianna Fáil, Members of the Oireachtas and members of cumann throughout the country because it is an emotive issue?  If people are not given the real facts, if they are not led properly, they will have an impression foisted upon them by certain public representatives for their own purposes.  Certainly as far as I can see from what I have read in the newspapers there is nothing that has happened over the last 12 months which would suggest an urgent need for legislation which must be passed within the space of three or four days.  I cannot discover one case where as a result of the present administrative arrangements this legislation is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in putting forward our reasons on this side of the House for substituting the Director of Public Prosecutions in place of the Attorney General and in putting forward our wording, we show that we are as concerned as anybody else with regard to safeguards.  We are also practical.  We realise that there are difficulties and that the more you try to put into legislation, the more problems you can create for yourself.  In the end, we could have a constitutional challenge as a result of a case appearing in court and may find ourselves in the position of its taking 12 months before anybody could be extradited.  Perhaps Part III of the 1965 Act, also could be deemed to be unconstitutional.  We could find the country being terrorised.  We could be unable for a period of 12 months to extradite somebody for perhaps a very serious crime, be it in Northern Ireland or in <Col N="601" /> Great Britain.  There are other consequences of this legislation.  The more one tries to build into it, the more difficult it will become.</P>
    <P>If you are going to enter into a treaty or agreement with somebody, there must be good faith on both sides.  You must assume that both sides will behave responsibly.  Surely in 1987 we can expect that two civilised countries can have arrangements whereby the case of somebody who is clearly capable of being prosecuted for a particular offence can be examined to see if there is sufficient evidence to bring about that prosecution and that this can be agreed upon without having to produce legislation to make certain that it does happen.  Every time we enter into negotiations on anything with anybody, be it across the table in Europe on agriculture or in any other area, we assume that people are acting in good faith and for a common purpose, for the betterment of the citizens of the European Community and the betterment of the citizens of our own country.</P>
    <P>I fail to see, first, why we need this legislation.  I fail to see why we should revert back to putting the Attorney General in a position in which he can be suspected, perhaps without any foundation whatsoever, of making a decision which could ultimately be regarded as having been made, one way or the other, for political reasons.  That is wrong; it is unwise.  I would urge the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and his colleagues to think again and accept in good faith that we are putting forward this amendment to avoid the office of the Attorney General being dragged through the political mud, with accusations perhaps being made against him in the future, totally unfounded, but which will demean that very high constitutional office that he at present holds.  I have also outlined other reasons why we should think again about being so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - National Social Service Board: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Howlin on Wednesday, 25 November 1987:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes that the range of services provided by the National Social Service Board is managed by a total staff of 20, operating with a budget of £475,000.  Dáil Éireann considers that continued operation of the NSSB would be the most cost effective and efficient way of providing the essential community services involved.  Dáil Éireann also believes, that it would be counter productive to disperse the experience accumulated within the NSSB, and that it would be disastrous to attempt to distribute the services provided among different sections of the Department of Health, health agencies and other Departments.  Accordingly, Dáil Éireann instructs the Government to rescind its decision to abolish the <Col N="603" /> NSSB; and further, to provide sufficient resources to enable the NSSB to continue to function as efficiently as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, where it first appears, and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the decision of the Government to provide £1 million from funds made available by the National Lottery for further development of the services provided by the community information centres and for the support and development of voluntary community effort.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I hope this debate on the National Social Service Board will remind us of something we all need to be reminded of, namely, the incredible success of the National Social Service Board within their terms of reference. Although this country is besieged with agencies which need to be examined in regard to wastefulness, inefficiencies and <Col N="604" /> cost effectiveness, the one thing which is clear from this debate is how successful and effective has been the National Social Service Board.  As a result of an increased awareness there is an even greater demand for their many services and that is a compelling reason why the board should continue in operation.</P>
      <P>The National Social Service Board did not receive the support they deserved. That is what this debate is about tonight and, hopefully, even at this late stage the Government will give them due recognition. The National Social Service Board received the support of up to 300 separate organisations who have demanded that for their survival and continued effectiveness the National Social Service Board should continue in their present structure and under the present management. Those support organisations not alone acknowledge the work which has been done efficiently by the National Social Service Board but they also recognise the need for the board and their independent role.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the speech which the Minister made in this House during this debate last week.  He said:</P>
      <P>An enhanced fostering of community voluntary effort will be developed and specialist training will be made through health boards by the Institute of Public Administration, for example, regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about a fostering of community spirit and voluntary effort which had already been brought about by the National Social Service Board and which had been developed through the specialist training they had made available without having to sectionalise or centralise it in the health boards or institutes which were already overloaded over with work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently spoke to a person who is involved in one of the community information centres, who was involved in the training programme and who is aware of the kind of training and support which the National Social Service Board give <Col N="605" /> not alone to community information centres but also to other voluntary organisations. He said the spirit and idealism that is infused in and which is part of the training of the National Social Service Board could not be replaced in any other group and certainly not in a group which would be more official, which would have to be more careful and which already had enough work to do.  Are we going to allow the knowledge and information which poor and disadvantaged people need to come through in the same clear, direct, careful, caring and compassionate way or are we going to allow it get bogged down with red tape, with Civil Service discretion and bureaucracy which strangled and is still strangling every directive in regard to public information?  The National Social Service Board slashed through this Gordian knot but we are now seeking to put them back into the centralised bureaucratic tangle from which they emerged and for which so many people are grateful.</P>
    <P>My colleagues have put forward the argument that it will not be cost effective to abolish this board and that is the central issue.  We, as legislators, must insist on maintaining the independent services which are provided by the National Social Service Board to those in poverty, to those with no voice, to those who feel powerless and to those who do not have control over their own lives.  They were able to avail of the services of the board and receive their magazines and information. They saw them as their entitlement. I am sure the Minister of Social Welfare would agree with me when I ask how can we attempt to put a further burden on the clinics of Deputies?  These people have a right to receive their entitlements through an independent agency.  Why should they be forced to line up, confessional-like, in the overcrowded clinics of Deputies, thus reinforcing the dependency from which our people are only now emerging?</P>
    <P>It is not only socially or financially criminal but also morally criminal to attempt to put the clock back in that way. I am speaking not alone on behalf of the many women's organisations who have <Col N="606" /> only been able to survive because of the training which they have been able to receive from the National Social Service Board but also on behalf of the many women who on training programmes found themselves in a ratio of 20: 1 with men.  I have received representations from women who make up half the population and who are among the most vulnerable and most powerless but who also make great sacrifices and are among the most generous people in our society. Nothing less than the retention of this board will do.  The funds from the national lottery must be channelled only through the National Social Service Board.  This is the one board we should fight for to the last and it one of which we should feel very proud.  It is incredible that the Government should attempt to remove one of the few successful, flourishing and independent agencies.</P>

      <P>With the agreement of the House I would like to share my time with two of my colleagues, Deputies Dempsey and Wright.  I welcome the opportunity tonight of speaking on this motion.  The Minister for Health in his contribution on Wednesday last outlined the proposals which had been approved by the Government for the continuation of the services, heretofore, carried out by the National Social Service Board.  He indicated that responsibility for developing voluntary services would be taken over by his Department and future activities in this area would take place in conjunction with the health boards.  He also said that his Department would assume responsibility for co-ordinating the training needs of those involved in the voluntary services area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> The Minister for Health also indicated that responsibility for the community information centres and the training needs of those involved in these centres would become my responsibility as Minister for Social Welfare.  It is with this aspect of these services that I would like to concern myself mainly to-night.</P>
    <P>The people who operate the community information centres do so voluntarily. They give of their time and energies in performing a very worthwhile and important community service and they deserve our admiration, gratitude and support for this.  We are indeed fortunate that so many in the community are willing to give of their time in this way.  I know that recently many of those volunteers have been concerned about the future of their centres notwithstanding the assurances already given by the Minister for Health.  Tonight I want to reassure members of the community information centres that the Government proposals in relation to the NSSB will not affect the quality of the service they provide nor the independent and impartial manner in which they provide it.  Furthermore, I want to assure them that the new arrangements will enable the centres not only to continue to provide the existing services but also to expand and develop those services.</P>
    <P>In 1985 over 110,000 inquiries were dealt with by the community information centres.  These inquiries included tax, housing, health services, employment, family matters and social welfare.  It is perhaps relevant to mention here that at least half of the inquiries relate to social welfare matters.  These figures underline the important role that the community information centres play in the life of the community.  They also illustrate the great need that exists among the general public for first-hand information about the services which affect them or which are available to them when they run into problems in their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>If one also takes into account the fact that, during the last year, local information officers of my Department dealt with over 300,000 queries, there can be <Col N="608" /> no doubt that there is a growing need for the dissemination of information about the social services.  I regard the growing demand for information as a fundamentally important function of the modern democratic socially concerned state.  To be effective such an important service must meet all the essential requirements of its clients.  It must be flexible and adaptable to meet their changing needs and it must have the capacity and resources to anticipate, to the maximum extent possible, those needs.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals for the reorganisation of these functions will give a new dimension to the provision of information on State services to the individual. They will also set new parameters within which local communities can develop the capacity to meet their needs from within their own resources with immediate backup and support from the State.</P>
    <P>Since their development in the seventies community information centres have played an important part in providing information to local communities on a wide range of services including those for which my Department are responsible.  Through this network my Department distribute booklets, leaflets and other items of information about the social welfare system, schemes and services. As already mentioned, some 50 per cent of the inquiries dealt with by the community information centres relate to social welfare matters.  In addition to giving information and advice, volunteers in the centres also help claimants to fill in forms accurately and fully.  As Deputies will appreciate, this greatly facilitates the speedy determination of entitlements as well as taking the pressure off my Department by resolving problems there and then.  I accept that the centres have an important function to fulfil and I find it difficult to understand suggestions that have been made to the effect that the Government are in some way or other attempting to downgrade them or diminish their role.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputies can see from what I have said that my Department have a keen interest <Col N="609" /> in the future of the community information centres.  I am pleased that the Government have acknowledged that situation and have allocated to me responsibility for the support and further development of the centres.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, I am keenly aware of the need for people to have easy and quick access to information. Despite all the efforts that are made to inform people, we still come across cases where new claimants for social welfare schemes have a particularly poor knowledge of their entitlements.  In this country we can be proud of our wide range of social welfare schemes and services that cater for a wide variety of needs.  However, this is not enough.  A survey carried out by the Commission on Social Welfare pointed to a general lack of awareness of the services among potential users and to the need for local access points where information would be available from an official source.  We must ensure that the services we are providing are delivered to the client quickly, efficiently and with due regard to his or her dignity and rights.  We must at all times keep the needs of the client uppermost in our minds, and that includes their information needs.</P>
    <P>I am at present developing an integrated approach to the delivery of the social welfare services, including information needs, through the introduction of &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; around the country. What is involved here is the development of a comprehensive service to social welfare clients by bringing together the various personnel and agencies involved so that all the needs of the client can be met more quickly and in a more co-ordinated manner under the one roof.</P>
    <P>The aim is that the clients will have available current information on their claims, general information on the full range of services available, on the spot means assessments for social assistance schemes as well as current information on job opportunities, placements and training courses which are available locally. I am convinced that the quality of the service we provide will be judged by the success we achieve in bringing our <Col N="610" /> services to those members of the public who need them, where they need them. An essential element in the better delivery of services is better and more accessible information, better trained and caring staff in general, a more client orientated approach.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals for continued State support for community information centres will, I believe, enhance and add to those objectives. Here we have the development of a greatly improved social welfare delivery on the one hand making information available throughout the country. Indeed, we have the largest network of computers in the country and we are making our information available through this network.  Our information there is exceptionally good and we intend to develop and improve the services we provide particularly through the &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; mechanisms.  Notwithstanding that, we recognise fully the function and part to be played in co-operation with the work of social welfare by the community information centres.</P>
    <P>In common with the views expressed by many who have spoken publicly on this issue I accept that it is most desirable that the community information centres should have operational independence. This would enable them to provide services and articulate the needs of the people they serve.</P>
    <P>In line with this objective and the responsibility which has been entrusted to me in relation to the former NSSB I am proposing that the community information centres will in future operate as a unit from within the Combat Poverty Agency, which as Deputies are aware, is a statutory body under the aegis of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I believe, therefore, that the proposed new arrangement will provide an ideal and positive framework within which the information services to the community can continue to grow and expand where necessary.</P>
      <P>To enable the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out these additional duties an extra ten to 12 staff will be assigned to them.  These posts will be available to existing staff in the NSSB who will be able to transfer to the agency on similar terms and conditions to those they currently enjoy.  The experience, commitment and expertise of this staff would be a significant asset to the agency.  I hope that they will respond positively to the opportunity to serve under the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to take into account their new expanded role it may be necessary to modify and extend the present statutory functions of the Combat Poverty Agency. <Col N="612" /> I will be looking at this matter urgently to see whether the present functions are adequate to meet the role I envisage for the agency in the area of social services information and publications.  I would like to give Deputies a brief overview of the general direction I expect the agency to follow in this area.</P>
    <P>First, I think it is important that they will continue to promote services and schemes in local communities for the dissemination of information about social services.  Secondly, they will also develop contacts with statutory and voluntary organisations and co-operate with those bodies in order to improve the provision of social services information to the public.  They will provide support for the training of volunteers for the information centres and will act as a resource centre for them.  The support may take the form of either financial aid or the supply of materials as suits the situation.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the information bulletins and other newsletters currently published by the National Social Service Board will continue to be published.  In particular, I would like to mention <i>Relate</i> which was first published in October 1973.  Since then, it has come to be recognised as an invaluable and reliable source of information on a wide range of social issues and entitlements affecting members of the public.  I am glad to be able to ensure that publications like <i>Relate</i> will continue under the new arrangements. Deputies may not be fully aware of the extent of the co-operation which exists at present between the publishers of <i>Relate</i> and the other publications of the National Social Service Board and the information section of my Department but I can assure them that it is regular, continuous and very heavy in volume.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that information services should be as widely available as possible throughout the country. Where the agency bring to my attention areas where no service currently exists or where the service provided is inadequate, I will be glad to have proposals for further developments and improvements.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the agency will also be <Col N="613" /> responsible for looking after the financing of the community information centres and I will expect them to examine the adequacy of financial arrangements and to recommend any changes they consider necessary in this area.</P>
    <P>In the long term I feel that the whole question of information needs in the social services area should be subject to a detailed scrutiny with a view to closer co-ordination and closer co-operation between local voluntary services and those of the State.  Finally, therefore, I will be asking for plans to be prepared for a new comprehensive information service which will build on the structures currently in place and show how these structures might be developed in the future.</P>
    <P>As an indication of their interest in this whole area the Government decided to allocate £1 million from National Lottery funds towards the continuation and development of the services formerly performed by the National Social Service Board.  Out of this a sum of £500,000 will be made available to service the new arrangements by way of the Combat Poverty Agency.  The NSSB had a budget of £578,000 for 1987.  This included £100,000 for the National Council for the Aged which will continue to be provided separately.  The £500,000 which is now being made available to me is, therefore, greater than the whole budget which was available this year for specific NSSB purposes. It is clear, therefore, that substantial additional funds are being made available for continuing on a national basis the community work of the former NSSB and for its further development.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that the arrangements I have outlined will not only ensure that the very worthwhile services of the community information centres will be maintained but allows scope for significant development and improvement of those services.  Sufficient resources will be available to enable the centres to carry out their functions and to enable the role of the centres to be developed substantially.</P>
    <P>Overall the Government's proposals provide for a well co-ordinated approach <Col N="614" /> to the services provided by the community information centres and their further development.  In these circumstances I urge Deputies to support the Government amendment to the motion and endorse the Government's plans for the future of the community information centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak in support of the Government's decision to provide £1 million for the further development of the services provided by the community information centres and for the support and development of voluntary community effort.  The Government propose to dispense with the board of the NSSB and to leave their services totally in place. Not only will they leave them in place but they will be more secure, expanded and enhanced with increased funding.  The proposal is designed to give a more extensive service to a wider public.</P>
      <P>Let us look for a moment at the service at present.  It is a good service.  Why is it so good?  It is so good because the people who serve the offices of the community information service are people of the highest calibre.  It is so good because these people serve a vital local need in the information area and do it diligently, faithfully and intelligently.  They are not dependent for the quality of their work on the NSSB: the same people would do the same job irrespective of who sits at the top table or if no one in particular was left to bask in their reflected glory.  I know the excellent teams who serve the centres in Malahide, Swords and Skerries. Their quality as community volunteers is an essential ingredient in their success.  I suggest that it would be insulting to them and less than truthful if I did not say emphatically that these people are the reason the community information centres are so successful.  It is their success that we see in measure.  The information comes from the Departments of Health and Social Welfare for the most part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would these people be less effective if the information came via one channel rather than another?  The answer, in my view, is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The volunteer workers in <Col N="615" /> the community centres are the service and they are indispensable.  I would be the last one to say that the National Social Service Board did not do its work well.  I am happy to pay tribute to those who served on it and I am pleased that deployment to the new service is an option for NSSB employees.  I hope they take up the option.  I would not be so naive or so singularly lacking in developmental thinking to concede that the former board is the only body that could deliver this service.  The system now proposed by the Minister has the capacity and the potential to do an infinitely better job.  It will not be unmindful in its day-to-day operations of the valuable lessons that have been learned through the work of the former board.</P>
    <P>All functions of the NSSB will be replaced and enhanced considerably under the new arrangement.  We are guaranteed an expanded and enhanced service, a service that will feed directly from the information services that are its life.  More and better services are assured.  The National Council for the Aged will continue as before.  The volunteers at local level will have access to training programmes.  This will be provided via the Department of Health and the health boards.  This training will enable an expansion of the service in the area of voluntary community care.  Each centre will identify local needs which they can service over and above what they provide now and which can be accommodated within their remit.  Special needs are required to deal with social deprivation.  Services for young adults with special needs require counselling and specific interactive skills.  In my view the involvement of the Institute of Public Administration and the regional colleges in training programmes is a bold and imaginative step.  The idea of providing training at this level for voluntary field staff could be a pilot for the updating and enhancement of skills right across the frontier of voluntary community associations.</P>
    <P>The community information service will become more and more an integral <Col N="616" /> part of the basic community service.  The new proposals will provide a challenge and what the Minister is really saying is, &ldquo;let us change to meet the challenge.&rdquo; One of the greatest fears of those who have approached me on this issue is that under the new scheme the community workers will lose their independence.  It has been said that the Minister's scheme will result in that loss of independence to the community information network because the new centre of operations will exist under the Department of Social Welfare.  I was glad to hear the Minister say tonight that there will be an extension of that programme to ensure that the new unit will work within the Combat Poverty Agency.  We all know that the former board was a statutory board.  The parameters of its independence are clearly defined as are those of the new unit under the Department of Social Welfare and within the Combat Poverty Agency, no more and no less.</P>
    <P>The field workers are independent volunteers, have always been independent volunteers and will, under the new scheme, continue to be independent. Their independence will be enhanced by the confidence they will gain from the new training proposals.  The new unit within the Combat Poverty Agency will be created specifically to meet the purposes of the Minister's scheme.  It will be readily accessible at the end of a phone or otherwise.  It will be staffed adequately with experienced personnel, will provide an ongoing and fully updated service and will produce bulletins &mdash; the Minister has mentioned that those that are in place will be continued, in particular the publication <i>Relate</i>&mdash; and circulars.  The major difference will be that the funding will be increased generously up to £400,000.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that he is still open to suggestions from other units.</P>
    <P>The expansion of services within the community, especially in relation to the disadvantaged, can best be facilitated by a direct contact with those agencies which have a specific responsibility for the disadvantaged. The Departments of Health and Social Welfare have a major role to <Col N="617" /> play which could be shared effectively with voluntary movements and by working directly with them.  By trimming the linkages between the agencies and getting rid of what would seem to be superfluous the Government are adhering to their central policy of rationalisation. It is a challenge to both politicians and people.</P>
    <P>It would seem, however, that many in this House want neither change nor challenge.  The development of a service, and the raising of it to a new plane of effectiveness, would seem to be a worthwhile goal.</P>

      <P>If it is the view of this House that a sound and better service is to be denied to our citizens after extra funding and rationalisation has taken place then it may be that it is a community information service we need to set up in the House to show our honoured friends on the Opposition benches how to resolve their shortsighted interpretation of the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Government to incorporate the services provided by the National Social Service Board in the Department of Health and Social Welfare must be seen as part of the Government's determination to provide the best possible service for the people who need it.  There have been numerous misconceptions in relation to the decision by the Government, the chief one being that the Government were attempting to abolish the services provided by the NSSB.  That is not true.  Indeed, as we learned tonight the opposite is the case. <Col N="618" /> Not only will all the services be maintained but they will be expanded, as the Minister indicated tonight.  The reason the Government decided to discontinue the funding of the NSSB at the end of the year was not for any small-minded or petty financial gain, as was alleged by Members of the Opposition.  It was to provide a service which would be better, more co-ordinated and broadly based. That is clearly illustrated in the Government's provisions for an expanded framework for social services as announced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Rather than describing the Government's decision as socially regressive it should be regarded as socially progressive. Surely it is progressive to maximise the availability of the services to as many people as possible.  In view of the statement last week by the Minister for Health and the statement by the Minister for Social Welfare tonight that to pursue this motion would be a serious mistake, I should like to state that if the motion is carried it will have the opposite effect to what is intended by its proposers.</P>

      <P>The Government have shown their commitment to voluntary social services by providing £1 million from the National Lottery this year.  Are the proposers of the motion now suggesting that we should reduce the funding to the level of previous years?  Are they saying that we should use up a substantial portion of that lesser amount of money that they are seeking in administrative costs and the other costs associated with running the NSSB?  I am surprised that a party that continually advocates increased State involvement in every aspect of the lives of our people should now be screaming for less State involvement and participation in the delivery of essential services to the weaker sections of the community.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that a party which advocates cutting out bureaucracy and excessive administrative costs should lend their name to a motion such as the one before the House.  There are some strange bedfellows involved in this motion.  With regard to the community information centres I should like to state that like most Members I would be very concerned if there was any threat to the services being provided by those centres.  I am pleased to note that the Minister proposed to strengthen the role of those voluntary organisations.  I sincerely hope that those involved in the research unit that serviced the community information centres up to now will remain in the reorganised unit announced by the Minister.  I appeal to them to participate fully in the revised arrangement so that the best possible service can be delivered to those who need it.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record the fact that one of the big worries people had in relation to the abolition of the National Social Service Board was that the insurance scheme operated for voluntary organisations through the NSSB would be abolished as well.  I am pleased to note that the Minister announced last week that that would be continued.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers I want to take this opportunity to compliment the volunteers who work in the community information centres for the valuable work they do for the community.</P>

      <P>I second the motion in my name and in the names of other Deputies and which was moved by Deputy Howlin. With the permission of the House I should like to share my time with Deputy Colley.</P>
      <P>The decision to abolish the National Social Service Board is politically motivated. It has no administrative merit and as has already been seen, bringing their work into a Government Department is resulting in a doubling of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of the Progressive Democrats is to encourage personal initiative and voluntary effort and we <Col N="620" /> laud the work of the National Social Service Board in the development of so many voluntary organisations, in improving their efficiency and effectiveness in disseminating valuable information to the most needy section of our community and for acting as a watch dog against bureaucratic indifference and, indeed, even mistakes.  It is this independence of action that has won such recognition and respect for the National Social Service Board and is mainly the reason all Opposition parties are united to defend this valuable organisation and to demonstrate that the wishes of Dáil Éireann supersede the narrow political objective of this minority Government.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the importance of maintaining the National Social Service Board as an independent information service, I would refer to their August information bulletin, <i>Relate</i> where the National Social Service Board highlighted how the Department of Social Welfare misinterpreted the 1987 Social Welfare Act and underpaid large numbers of claimants between April and August 1987. Even after the error was pointed out, the Department appear to have decided to do nothing to correct the many illegal underpayments to disability benefit claimants which they made, and may still be making, in cases where their staff failed to correct manually the computer programme which the Department know to be incorrect.</P>
    <P>No sound logical reason has yet been advanced by Government speakers to justify the abolition of the National Social Service Board.  If the Minister stands back and examines his decision, he may recognise how utterly unjustifiable it is.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, with a large number of backbenchers, many of whom will never achieve ministerial office, need desperately to preserve the illusion that TDs have great powers in decisions affecting entitlements to social welfare and health benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every week we see evidence of this <Col N="622" /> Government's hamfisted approach.  Last week it was the infamous Education circular 20/87 which because of the ambiguity of the Fine Gael Party still remains in force.  This week it is the National Social Service Board.  Next week it could be ACOT/An Foras Talúntais, and the following week An Foras Forbartha; the list gets longer.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats will support well thought out improvements and rationalisation measures but we must have the facts.  III thought out moves for politically vindictive reasons cannot claim our support.  Already we have heard of new alternatives to what was earlier proposed by the Government for the National Social Service Board: firstly, it was a cost saving exercise, secondly, it was to eliminate duplication and to ensure rationalisation; thirdly, its functions would be transferred to health boards by 31 December 1987; fourthly, an all party committee was suggested to review the work of the Departments taking over NSSB functions; fifthly, it was proposed that community information centres be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and sixthly, now today, we are hearing another proposal, that these functions be transferred to the Combat Poverty Agency. Let us now look at cost cutting.  In the Estimates debate on 23 October the Minister stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy realise that the Combat Poverty Agency are under the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to quote from the Minister's speech on 23 October.  He said:</P>
      <P>the Government were not primarily concerned with cutting costs but rather with reorganising the services in a more effective manner so that the best use is made of available resources.</P>
      <P>In answer to two Dáil questions on 28 October the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was considered that the services <Col N="623" /> could be provided at less cost without diminishing the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>In exchanges in the debate on 25 November 1987, the Minister complained that &ldquo;the problem in the House is that everybody is in favour of correcting the imbalance in payments, in controlling Government expenditure but as soon as the Government move to do it in any one area there is concerted opposition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his speech in the debate on 25 November 1987, the Minister said &ldquo;some savings will accrue in the area of administration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of the provision of a sum from the lottery money, almost twice as large as the annual NSSB budget, it seems obvious that the measure is not a cost-cutting one, although there has been confusion in the Government's statements on this point.</P>
    <P>It is implied nonetheless in some of the Minister's statements that the NSSB are top heavy with expensive administration which is now to be replaced by more generous direct aid on the ground.  This is absurd if one looks at the NSSB's budget, staffing and more importantly, their record.  The lie is given to any such suggestion by the rejection of the Minister's current approach by hundreds of voluntary organisations who quite obviously do not see things the Minister's way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presented the NSSB abolition as the result of an overall consideration of resources with a view to cutting out duplication and achieving rationalisation.  In his speech of 25 November it appears that the NSSB abolition is something carefully planned.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, however, from the confused references to cost-cutting earlier, and from the six week delay between the announcement and the Minister's justification of it, that no such plan exists. The Minister and his colleagues are reacting to the pressure exerted by the voluntary sector nationwide.  This is proved by comparing the Minister's plans as outlined on 25 November to the circular his Department sent out to all health <Col N="624" /> boards on 27 October which told them that NSSB functions, including the support of the community information centres, would be their responsibility in 1988. The community information centre's support is now apparently to be provided by the Department of Social Welfare through the Combat Poverty Agency. There was, and is, no grand plan for rationalisation because the game changes day by day.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the Minister outlined a number of bodies which would take on functions at present carried out by the NSSB: two Government Departments, eight health boards, nine regional technical colleges, the Institute of Public Administration and now the Combat Poverty Agency.  Twenty organisations in all will be given the functions at present performed by a staff of 20 in the NSSB.</P>
    <P>This dispersal, according to the Minister, means that the services will be expanded and enhanced and that duplication will be done away with.  While a variety of proposals have been considered and even canvassed by the Government over the past few weeks, and indeed over the past 24 hours, they appear determined to ignore the simplest and most straightforward one: leaving the existing body to carry on the work, the NSSB.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the NSSB?  Why have the Government attacked it?  The Minister for Health said on 25 November:</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion &mdash; and I want to emphasise this strongly &mdash; that any of the functions prescribed for the NSSB is redundant nor, indeed, that the discharge of them has been defective.</P>
    <P>No criticism has been made of the way the NSSB carry out their functions. Indeed the recognition of the value and importance of their services is also a recognition of the judgment and flexibility of their staff, who have, for the most part, initiated and developed these services in response to the needs they perceived and the requests they received, <Col N="625" /> rather than as a result of explicit detailed statutory provision.  So why abolish it?</P>
    <P>While the Government have tried out various proposals in the wake of their hasty and ill thought out, unplanned decision on the NSSB, they appear unwilling to recognise the importance of the independence and flexibility of the organisation.  While there may now be some recognition of these qualities in relation to the information services of the board, the Minister's speech showed us no such recognition in relation to the development and training functions which the Minister for Health wishes to disperse among so many statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The insurance scheme for voluntary organisations, which the Minister has promised to maintain, is a good example. While the Minister has promised to keep this particular service, he has not recognised that the way it came about is important. It came about because voluntary organisations, both national and local, had a problem, and had a national body which was in a sense &ldquo;theirs&rdquo; with which they could discuss it and with whose assistance a solution was arrived at on a national level.  Under the Minister's new scheme of things there will be no such body.  There will be no national body charged with assisting and responding to the needs and requests of the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>It is this loss that has the hundreds of voluntary groups that use the services of the NSSB's development and advisory section still protesting despite the Minister's promises about funding; this, plus the recognition that in the area of training the Institute of Public Administration and the health boards will have priorities of their own, as will the Combat Poverty Agency.  Indeed, it is ironic that health boards and the NSSB have liaised quite effectively in developing training services and in fostering voluntary-statutory co-operation, something which would hardly have been the case if the NSSB were &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo; as the Minister suggests.</P>
    <P>The Minister changes his position by the hour; the latest is the appointment of community development officers in each <Col N="626" /> health board area.  That was not suggested in the House but it was one of the numerous suggestions which the Government have been making to Opposition parties but, interestingly enough, not to the Progressive Democrats.  We have had no approach from the Minister, despite the fact that today and yesterday on several occasions he made approaches to two other parties who have amendments or motions tabled.  I refer to Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>A variety of suggestions has been forthcoming from the Minister, all of which only goes to prove how little planning was involved initially when this decision was made.  This reflects very poorly on both Ministers who have taken on responsibility here, the Minister for Health &mdash; who spoke last week &mdash; and the Minister for Social Welfare who came in here tonight with the latest peace offering from the Government.  In my years, I have seldom seen such pathetic attempts made by a Government to save their skin by making such fundamental changes in what they had originally proposed.  That is all being done because the objective of destroying a threat to their party, namely the NSSB, is no longer their priority. Their objective and priority now, of course, centres more on the survival of their Government and that is why they have demonstrated their willingness to do an about-turn in so many of the proposals which had earlier emanated from them.</P>
    <P>Where will all this end?  Why is there such confusion and panic in Government thinking?  How could any Opposition party be expected to support this move when the Government do not know exactly what they are proposing?  I only have to quote the Minister for Social Welfare tonight.  He does not know yet what is involved by the decision he announced.  He said that in order to take into account their new expanded role &mdash; he was referring to the Combat Poverty Agency &mdash; it may be necessary to modify and extend their present statutory functions.  The Minister proposes to transfer all these functions to them but he is not even sure what statutory changes will have to be made.  He went on to say <Col N="627" /> that he will be looking at this matter urgently to see whether the present functions are adequate to meet the role which we envisaged for the agency in the area of social services information and publications.</P>
    <P>The role which he envisaged only dawned on the Minister today or yesterday because there was no proposal last week from the Minister for Health who spoke on behalf of the Government.  Two Ministers spoke in this debate and the man who spoke last week had a completely different set of proposals from the Minister who spoke tonight.  It is stretching the imagination to think that any group of Opposition parties could offer their support for Government proposals when the Government themselves are not clear what exactly is involved.  The truth is that the whole thing was ill conceived. It was motivated by political vindictiveness. It should be roundly condemned and immediately thrown out by those who wish to preserve the good name of democracy.  We will be voting against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to state at the outset the bare facts about this because with all the wriggling that has gone on on the far side of the House some facts may have become somewhat clouded.  The National Social Service Board were set up by statute, the National Social Service Board Act, 1984.  They consist of a board and a small number of employees operating on a small budget, providing back-up for the community information centres, training development for voluntary organisations and a link and a co-ordinating role between many voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their independent status ensures that a broad base of information flows to the people in need of these services rather than confining it to one particular Department or under their aegis.  Without consultation or consideration of the implications involved, when the Estimates were published some time ago it was found that there was no allocation for the board.  The Minister did not even <Col N="628" /> have the courtesy to have consultations with the board or the chairman and the chairman received a telephone call 20 minutes before the Estimates were published to let him know what was happening.</P>
    <P>The Government assumed that because it was a small organisation there would not be much noise about it, that nobody would kick up about it but they could not have been further from the truth.  It was an unthought out decision which had absolutely no regard to the consequences throughout the nation.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up a point which the Minister for Health made today on RTE's radio programme &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo;.  He referred to Opposition parties responding to street politics.  I am quite appalled by his remarks.  The Minister may be dismissive of the wishes of the people who have expressed views on this subject but I will put the record straight regarding my views and those of the Progressive Democrats.  At our party's annual conference on 9, 10 and 11 October, I referred twice in speeches to the abolition of the National Social Service Board and I also referred to our opposition to it.  Our party leader, Deputy Des O'Malley, also did so on a number of occasions over that weekend.  That was before there was any public move to counter this Government decision.  Now the Minister finds himself in a very awkward situation, having to hastily cobble together some kind of rationale to the own goal he has scored.  I referred earlier to the suggestion re the Combat Poverty Agency with regard to the community information centres.  I understood that that was perhaps the fourth suggestion from the Government but I believe now that it is the sixth.  That merely underscores the unthought out nature of the whole decision.  As Deputy Molloy said, it was a barely disguised political attack on a statutory body operate independently of the State in favour of the most needy in our society.</P>
    <P>We have a growing number of people for whom the only lifeline is through State services.  It is very strange that if one <Col N="629" /> provides a thorough and widespread State service in terms of social welfare, one does not provide a proper information service.  By doing that one is minimising the effect that those services may have on the needy in our society. There is obviously in innate lack of tolerance on the part of the Government for any usurping of what it may regard as the stock-in-trade of politicians, that is the gift of so-called favours.  Parallel moves have occurred against the Ombudsman and his office.  It is clear where the Government are moving in terms of independent agencies operating in the State.</P>
    <P>These are very difficult times for many people and they are now forced, with the reduction of services in the Ombudsman's office and if this goes ahead, to seek their rights through the medium of a TD who is not supposed to act in that capacity but who is supposed to be a legislator.  Some small moves had been made to give people information in an independent fashion as to their rights and to give them a chance to pursue those rights on the failure of the State to deal fairly with them.  These moves are now being dispersed in the case of the NSSB and denigrated in the case of the Ombudsman. There is a real danger that both bodies and the services they provide will become meaningless.  I see this decision along with a number of others as an onward step towards centralism.  The voluntary sector has had a lot more pressed on its shoulders because of problems in State finances.  That would be all very well, to a certain extent, if they were given the support they should have but the State has decided that the voluntary sector must take on the burden and seeks to remove the supports it has and its tools to operate with.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe in the development of communities and the development of independence from central Government as much as possible so as to leave as much decision making as possible to those on the ground.  This depends on State encouragement for those willing to work voluntarily for their community.  What kind of encouragement is this decision <Col N="630" /> supposed to give?  What kind of encouragement is indicated by this Government's decision to cut by 50 per cent the grant to Muintir na Tíre, a body who are also engaged in developing community organisations and self determination on the ground?</P>
    <P>I want to put a point to the Minister in relation to his right to frustrate the will of the Oireachtas as expressed by the passing of the NSSB Act in 1984, by denying the board the funds to carry out their functions.  If the Taoiseach wishes the board to be abolished he should say so, and he should move in a legislative way to give effect to that.  If the Taoiseach brought in any amendment to the legislation to repeal the board he would not get the support of this House.  If a Minister can abolish statutory bodies in that manner what would be the point of obtaining the support of the House for the legislation in the first place?  The legislation that this board operates under did not envisage the Minister withdrawing all of their functions.  Such an interpretation would involve the Act itself in seeking to negate the very purpose for which it was passed.  The Minister has not the power to do that.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say what is the status of the NSSB Act of 1984 after the board have been abolished?  Has the Minister made any regulations under the Act? Does the Minister intend to do so and if so when?  There has not been a board in existence for some months now because the Minister failed to reappoint the members.  That board bears the responsibility for appointing or dismissing their employees.  In the absence of a board how, legally, is the transfer of employees to any new body to be achieved?  What will happen to the pension rights of the employees of the board?  Has anyone given consideration to the people involved and to the rights they have built up and will possibly lose?</P>
    <P>As for the supposed munificence of this Government in allocating £1 million from the national lottery for this year to the functions the NSSB carried out, a number of points occur to me.  The national lottery is purely a temporary phenomenon. <Col N="631" /> This is the first year of its operation.  It has taken off fairly well which is a very good thing as it is benefiting many organisations which need funds.  However, it is fleeting.  Who knows what will happen next year?  Will people subscribe to the lottery in the same way as they have this year?  What about the year after next?  Is there any commitment to the whole idea of providing these services?  I maintain that there is not.  What about the effect of any other lottery, including the one recently launched, on the national lottery?</P>
    <P>Will the Government and the Minister say why we should abolish a body who have been acknowledged to have worked effectively, who have shown their ability to expand and take on new challenges? According to another Fianna Fáil Deputy here tonight, part of the reason they are being replaced is because they could not take on new challenges and rise to the new ideas that are floating around the minds of the members of Government. This body have obviously worked well. They have co-ordinated, with a small staff, a lot of voluntary work in the community. Rationalisation loses the meaning normally attributed to it, in the way in which the Minister for Health used it in his speech last week.  One board's functions are to be divided between about 20 other bodies including the one suggested tonight, the Combat Poverty Agency.  I reserve the right to oppose Government decisions made for base motives with no rational basis and with no knowledge of and even less regard for the consequences of the decisions.  This is one of those.</P>

      <P>I want to nail a couple of the more serious deceptions which have been foisted by Deputies on the other side in the course of the debate.  First, on the issue of independence, I should say that the National Social Service Board was a statutory body appointed by the Minister for Health under an Act of the Oireachtas with defined functions and is no more or less independent than any other State body supported fully by tax-payer's money.  The National Social Service Board is no more independent than the self-contained unit in the Department of Social Welfare which will have the exclusive function of providing an expanded and authoritative information service on the same range of services the National Social Service Board undertake at present.  Also, the same style of publications will continue to be distributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The job of the National Social Service Board was to provide factual information in a helpful and easily understood format.  This is a most desirable type of service.  Indeed, I should say that every State agency has a duty to communicate with the public in this way. If necessary, such agencies should be equipped with the necessary skills.  As the House has been told, the Government propose to review this aspect of State services generally quite apart from their plans for the community information service's specifically.</P>

It was somewhat disquieting to discover at 5.30 p.m. this afternoon that negotiations of one kind or another had been going on for the past two days or so in relation to the matter before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that I signed the motion when it was presented here I was not informed that these negotiations were taking place with both the Fine Gael and Labour parties. It is quite unfortunate because I am sure that had the Minister adopted the same approach before announcing the abolition of the National Social Service Board, had he approached the board to discuss how best these services could be provided, the board would have assisted him by way of providing an even better service.  Indeed, had the Minister offered £1 million to the National Social Service Board I am quite sure they would have provided an excellent service, far superior to that which will be provided henceforth because the services are being divided between so many agencies.</P>
      <P>The decision to abolish the board does not appear to withstand scrutiny even on the basis of saving money because, clearly, that was not the aim of the decision.  We are now told there is £1 million available as distinct from a figure of less than £500,000 to the National Social Service Board.  Neither does the decision hold good in regard to rationalisation. Clearly it does not make sense to take services from a body which has provided them on a satellite basis in a very effective way for a small amount of money and spread them across a whole range of agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly there is no rationale to the decision taken.  It would appear to me that initially there was a deliberate <Col N="637" /> decision taken to eliminate the idependence of the services being provided. The Government now appear to have backed off that and are offering money to the Combat Poverty Agency to provide some semblance of independence in relation to the community information services centres.  That is not the only service the National Social Service Board provided.  I do not have sufficient time to go into the whole range of services they provided, and could continue to provide in a most effective manner.</P>
    <P>The reality is that another mess has been made of a decision, of a service and a body which was providing a good, independent means of people obtaining information.  It is important to note that the whole philosophy behind the community information services was to ensure that people could go to a body with no political taint whatsoever, that they could obtain information and advice which they knew would be independent of any political persuasion.  They knew that had they wanted to appeal they could go to that body, knowing that their appeal would be dealt with independently.  They knew they did not automatically have to go to their local public representative, of whatever persusion, in order to obtain their rights.</P>
    <P>The Government have to accept responsibility for what they have done. It is unfortunate that they took the view it was more important to fatten up the constituency services they provided for themselves in their own ministerial offices rather than maintain the independent community information services and all the other services which the NSSB have provided and have had experience in the last 14 years in providing.  It is unfortunate that the fairly soft position which is being adopted tonight by the Government in order to attempt to avoid a defeat in this House was not adopted before they announced an arbitrary decision in October to abolish the NSSB. They should have negotiated with the NSSB and I am quite certain that had they done so, that body would be retained. We would all have been delighted if they got £1 million to maintain and <Col N="638" /> develop the service which they have provided so well over many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this motion last week I set out in detail the work and services given to the people of this country by the National Social Service Board.  No Government speaker has sought to contradict me or to take from a single point I made in support and praise of the work of the board.  No Government speaker has put forward a single, sustainable, cogent reason that the National Social Service Board should be abolished.  Last week I said I was at a loss to know why the Government arrived at the decision to abolish the NSSB. During this three hour debate I have not been enlightened by any Government speaker.</P>
      <P>In winding up the debate I would like, first, to acknowledge my debt to the spokespersons of the other parties in Opposition in this House, to Deputies Molloy, De Rossa, Kemmy and Gregory who have added their names to this motion.  I would like also to confirm once again that we are accepting the amendment from the Fine Gael Party and I thank Deputy Allen for his co-operation in this matter.  I would like, too, to acknowledge the efforts made by the Government Chief Whip and by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare to endeavour to find solutions which are acceptable to the Opposition parties and to the NSSB in their contacts with us in the last 24 hours or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the search for solutions those Ministers have today accepted that it is essential that the NSSB retain their statutory base to perform their work.  The Government have proposed a mechanism that will go part of the way towards meeting our legitimate objections to what the Minister for Health originally proposed and outlined.  It is, however, both ironic and sad that the Ministers could not find it in their hearts to go the whole way towards meeting our legitimate needs and our legitimate objections.  The vote which will shortly take place and the defeat of the Government which I hope <Col N="639" /> will be inflicted could have been avoided. The Ministers, having accepted the fundamental principle we were pursuing, would not have had to go much further to accept that the only practical way of operating that principle is the retention of the organisation the Government intend to abolish.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the proposals made to myself and to Deputy Desmond by those Ministers.  First, they proposed to subsume the community information activities of the National Social Service Board <i>in toto</i> into a newly created autonomous office of the Combat Poverty Agency which is of course an independent statutorily based body.  The financial allocation for the Combat Poverty Agency would be increased by an extra £500,000 to take account of this activity.  The net effect, while retaining the independent nature of that aspect of the NSSB's work, would be to transfer it from the aegis of the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  I must enter the caveat that we still regard it as profoundly disappointing that the allocation for the Combat Poverty Agency has been cut to £1 million in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
    <P>The second tier of the proposition put to us was that the Council for the Aged would continue as heretofore as an independent body under the aegis of the Department of Health with their own allocations plus £100,000 from the national lottery.  The third suggestion was that the developmental functions in relation to voluntary agencies would be divided among the eight health boards, an allocation of £400,000 would be available and the health boards would be instructed to appoint liaison officers within that allocation in order to ensure maximum community activity and coordination of voluntary agencies.  That includes an element of training, using the RTCs and the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>The reason I have read these proposals into the record of the House is a simple one.  This is a Private Members' motion and it has been suggested that the Government might feel no obligation to <Col N="640" /> abide by it if it is carried by this House. That would be undemocratic and a breach of faith by this House.  It is a suggestion which would question the democratic nature of our affairs and the accountability of Government to the democratically elected Parliament of the people.  If the Government decide to ignore the vote carried this evening, and fail to accept the fundamental principles of an independent statutorily based body and the continued life of the NSSB, despite the instruction of this House, they will have degenerted the democratic process itself.  I would welcome the acknowledgment from the Minister for Social Welfare that contrary to the clear impression given by the Minister for Health in his speech last week, it is clear today that an independent statutory board will be involved in co-ordinating the activities of the community information centres.</P>
    <P>Why have we not accepted these new mark six proposals as outlined today? The basic reason is that they do not make sense.  It does not make sense to solve the problems created by a silly Government decision, made at the behest of faceless bureaucrats in the Departments of Health and Finance.  The National Social Service Board provide a dynamic, efficient, independent, focal point for hundreds of community groups and organisations, all of whom perform essential services to the community.  It makes no sense to replace that focal point with innumerable different ones.  It makes no sense to dissipate the concentrated energies of a small but hardworking staff in other areas.  It makes no sense to run the risk of creating management, organisational training and industrial relations problems for two organisations by trying to solve a simple political problem that the Government have made for themselves.  It makes no sense to create a precedent which will have untoward ramifications for the Government's own rationalisation plans in other areas of the public service.  It makes no sense to remove an asset whose value can be measured in terms of the <Col N="641" /> lives it has improved and whose cost benefit ratio is very high.  We have in the contacts we have had with Ministers in the past day or so pointed all this out clearly.  We have also told them their original decision was wrong and any justification it might have had, even in their own eyes, disappeared entirely when additional money from the national lottery became available.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain of the Government's utterances over the past few days have been designed to give the impression that this motion will be seen as intolerable because it represented a chipping away of the fundamental strategy of the Government.  To be fair to the Ministers we spoke to in the past day or so, they did not threaten us with the <Col N="642" /> general election.  If they had, it would not have deflected us from the view that this was a fundamentally wrong decision.  The Labour Party tabled this motion in the first instance and worked assiduously to secure a consensus on this side of the House because this is a basic Labour Party issue.  The Bill establishing the NSSB aimed at consolidating the fundamental work undertaken by Deputy Frank Cluskey when he was Parliamentary Secretary to my predecessor, Brendan Corish.  For all these reasons I hope this House will now tell the Government they must undo the wrong they have done.  I commend the motion and Fine Gael's amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>As I was saying before I reported progress, we on this side of the House felt it was impossible to support the PD's amendment, The Workers' Party amendment and the Labour Party's amendment for the simple reason that we regard those amendments as making extradition far more difficult than it is at present.  We recognise, of course, that there is a need for safeguards.  We would argue that those safeguards are already in existence by way of the administrative arrangements that are presently in place. As I have said it was up to the Government of the day to see to it that those administrative arrangements were operated. That obviously is not the case and, therefore, we put forward this amendment and we are seeking the support of all sides of the House in having it passed. I am conscious that there are others who want to speak and for that reason I will conclude for the present.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 8a which is in the names of Deputy Gregory and myself, states:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 15, after &ldquo;directs&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;all such warrants shall be forwarded to the Attorney General in the first instance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this amendment will be acceptable not only to the members of the Opposition but from what we have heard from the various speakers on the Government side they cannot possibly object to it.  In various forms they have indicated that no warrant will be handled by the Garda Commissioner without the <Col N="653" /> Attorney General being aware of it, that it is unthinkable that this should happen and that the precedent and procedure are implicit in the Act &mdash; wherever it is I do not know.  Since that is the case and it has been the edict, of various speakers particularly those from the front bench, I see no reason whatsoever why the Government should not agree to such an amendment that all warrants shall be forwarded to the Attorney General in the first instance.  If we could get the agreement of the Government on that I am sure the members of the Opposition would not create any great problem about it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10a in the names of Deputy Gregory and myself states:</P>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), line 27, after &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and such evidence is in existence at the date the Attorney General forms such opinion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That all hinges on the Attorney General forming an opinion but that opinion can mean the extradition or a decision not to proceed with the extradition of a named or requested person.  I am proposing that my amendment be added to the Bill so that there will be no possibility that evidence adduced after the extradition will be used in the prosecution of the person whose extradition is sought and who is extradited.  It is the prevention of that gathering, seeking or, perhaps, interrogation for evidence that I want.  That may be in the mind of the Minister, and may be contained in the Bill, but in order to make the position more clear we are seeking to add, in line 27, after the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;, the following:</P>
    <P>... and such evidence is in existence at the date the Attorney General forms such opinion.</P>
    <P>In other words we do not want any digging up, no beating out of or supergrasses produced to give evidence in order to make a case stand up after an extradition application has been considered by the Attorney General and the person extradited. This is a protection for the person who is unfortunate enough to be sent <Col N="654" /> into the maw of the jurisdiction of the maladministrators of justice either in the Six Counties or in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In the interest of saving time I should like to refer to other amendments in the name of Deputy Gregory and myself. Amendment No. 10b proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (a), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and,</P>
    <P>(c) there is good and sufficient reason, where the offence under or pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 or is an offence specified in the Schedule to that Act, why the person named or described in the warrant should not be prosecuted in this jurisdiction under or by virtue of the said Act:</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared that &ldquo;good and sufficient reason&rdquo; shall not include the fact that evidence on commission may be required to be taken in respect of the said prosecution or that any witness or witnesses reside outside the jurisdiction; and that the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; appearing in section 44B shall include evidence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Any prosecution that maybe followed in our courts under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, or the Schedule to that Act, should be so pursued rather than extradition taking place on foot of a warrant. That makes eminent sense to me and I have no doubt it will appeal to all sides of the House.  We should use our own courts and our own laws and by doing that we will ensure that there is a fair trial of the suspect rather than shipping him or her across with God knows what result. The only expectation we can have is that the result cannot be good.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10c states:</P>
    <P>10c.  In page 2, subsection (1) (a), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" />&ldquo;(2)  The word `information' in section 44B shall include evidence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That amendment is worthy of the support of the entire House.  At the moment it is proposed to amend the Principal Act to read:</P>
    <P>44B.&mdash;A direction of the Attorney General under section 44A shall be given unless the Attorney General, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, is of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  there is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case may be, to continue the prosecution of, the person named or described in the warrant concerned for the offence specified therein in a place in relation to which this Part applies.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>In our amendment we want that evidence to be in existence.  We want the information defined.  In other words we do not want the information to consist of a telephone call, hearsay second or third hand but evidence on which the Attorney General can form his opinion that may decide whether a person requested on a warrant is to be extradited or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the amendments in the name of Deputy Sean Barrett I should like to highlight the difference of approach represented by our amendments as against the Government's position.  Essentially, there are three differences in what we urge on the House.  First, we urge a change from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We seek to make a <Col N="656" /> change in the way in which the opinion is formed, the process that leads to the formation of an opinion, and we propose to make a change in the requirement that we place on whatever Office is going to be involved in this process.  The arguments for moving from the Attorney General to the Director of Public Prosecutions have been put during Second Stage, and have figured in the debate earlier today so I do not want to repeat them at any great length.</P>
      <P>I accept that the case put by the Minister in respect of the Attorney General is not without merit.  There are arguments to be put on both sides but I am on balance convinced that the better view is that the Director of Public Prosecutions is the desirable figure to entrust with this task.  I am convinced of that view because of the stand taken by the House in 1974 when it passed the Prosecution of Offences Act.  At that stage we took a conscious decision that it was appropriate to remove the decision to prosecute or not to prosecute in a domestic case as far away as possible from the political scene. If the view then was that domestic political prosecutions might potentially be so sensitive that it was proper to distance them, how much more true is it true in this instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative before the House, the suggestion from The Workers' Party that the task should be entrusted to a High Court judge.  I have thought about that and it was an option that we considered within the Fine Gael Party before deciding to put our money, as it were, on the Director of Public Prosecutions. The advantages of the High Court judge are clear.  There is no doubt that a High Court judge enjoys a very clear status in the community and that people would accept that a High Court judge would not be capable of being influenced in a decision as to whether to order that the warrants be endorsed.  The difficulty we would see with that amendment is that a judge would not be sitting in court when performing this function. The judge would be exercising this function in private, just as it would be exercised in private by either the Attorney <Col N="657" /> General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Inevitably, decisions whether to allow extradition to proceed or to interrupt an extradition process are going to become controversial, are going to become the source of political comment and, perhaps, of political controversy. Indeed, all parties on this side of the House hope the operation of this section will be the subject of annual debate.  It would seem invidious to ask any High Court judge to operate that section, to make decisions on the basis that they would be debated once a year.  The effect on the long-term independence of the Judiciary could not be helpful.</P>
    <P>The second change we suggest is that the direction should only be given if the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General is of the opinion that there is not an intention to prosecute.  We have to be clear about what we are doing here.  We are seeking to facilitate extradition. There have been complaints, particularly from Deputy McCartan, about the failure of the parties in Opposition to make common ground but he has to accept that we do not approach this from the same postion.  Last year, and again this year, The Workers' Party argued to make extradition more difficult.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>More safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>They justify making extradition more difficult by saying they are concerned to preserve particular possible safeguards.  Our concern last year and today is to ensure that extradition is workable, that it will take place where appropriate and that it will not be impeded by the introduction of unnecessary obstacles.  There is no common ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward this case we are saying clearly we are shifting the decision-making process to facilitate extradition. At the moment an Attorney General who is unsure of what the position is, an Attorney General who is indecisive and cannot make up his mind whether there is clear intention to prosecute, exercises discretion by saying &ldquo;do <Col N="658" /> not endorse the warrant because I am not sure of the situation&rdquo;.  We are reversing that and saying that only in a case where the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General is positively of the belief that there is no intention to prosecute should he intervene and give a direction that the warrant not be endorsed.</P>
    <P>The third distinction that separates our approach from that of the Government is that we do not require the Attorney General or the DPP to consider the question of sufficiency of evidence.  It is still a matter we would want to be the subject of an arrangement between the requesting Government and the requested Government but, in order to make this measure as immune from constitutional challenge as possible, we propose to remove this requirement because it seems to us that this aspect of testing the adequacy of evidence is very particularly judicial in character.  It is this aspect which leaves the Bill open to the greatest possibility of constitutional challenge.  It is for that reason we propose to simplify the procedure. Our measure is clearly and unequivocally designed to ensure that effective extradition takes place.  We accept the Government have no counterintentions but our concerns are that, with the best will in the world, the Government measures might run into difficulties. We believe ours is clearer and it very determinedly shifts the balance in favour of easier extradition.</P>

      <P>The amendments with which we are dealing &mdash; and we have left ourselves 25 minutes to deal with them &mdash; cover a proposal that the powers the Attorney General is to enjoy under this legislation should, as an alternative, be exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Workers' Party amendments propose that these powers be given to a High Court judge.  These amendments raise fundamental issues of principle. They are substantial issues in themselves and should not, and could not, be adequately debated in a few minutes.  I find it remarkable that we have put ourselves in the position of attempting to do so.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes to give these powers to a High Court judge, not in the context of a court hearing but simply that a High Court judge will exercise the same powers in the same manner as the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Progressive Democrats believe this is a judicial decision and to exercise these powers constitutes an administration of justice. It follows also that an adminstration of justice must take place in a court, and not in private.  In principle, we cannot consent to a High Court judge, the Chief Justice or anybody else exercising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is our view that this is fundamentally a judicial act and carrying out these powers is an administration of justice and must take place in a court. Whether a High Court judge, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General does it, it is impermissible in our view under the Constitution for any of them to do it, unless it is part of the administration of justice and is in a court.</P>
      <P>Although we can see why The Workers' Party put down these amendments in an attempt to bring into this area a judicial ingredient &mdash; that is, that the person exercising these powers would be a judge &mdash; it is not putting in place a system which involves the carrying out of these powers as part of the administration of justice.  Therefore, we must oppose them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> I am deeply mystified by the Fine Gael Party's amendment.  This party said they thought that this should not happen and that the Bill is unnecessary.  They said they believed that there are perfectly adequate safeguards behind the scenes on a diplomatic level between London and Dublin and that it is a mistake to introduce this legislation because, to use Deputy Birmingham's colourful phraseology, any safeguard creates a difficulty and then becomes an obstacle to extradition.  He wants the easiest possible extradition.  I want to remind him that the rule of law always has to differentiate between what is an obstacle to easy imprisonment or easy extradition and an adequate safeguard for the individual in question.  If the Government have done anything in this legislation they have at least recognised that whatever the political demands of the moment may be, the rule of law requires that safeguards of some kind should be put in place. When a party comes into this House and says the safeguards should not be there as a right and that they should have them implemented by one person rather than another, if they must be there, then there is something wrong.  It goes further than that because Deputy Birmingham and his leader, Deputy Dukes, indicated to the House that they believed that these powers proposed by the Government are unconstitutional.</P>

They have, of course, made this concession to the press gallery in the Chamber. They talked about the role of the President and, in order to give themselves <Col N="663" /> as opportunity to speak on that role, they put down what can only be described as a derisory amendment to this Bill which was ruled out of order.</P>

It is my understanding that they have so little faith in this legislation that they also propose &mdash; I cannot go into its merits and demerits &mdash; tomorrow, with the Government's acquiescence, to put forward an amendment to say that it will have a lifetime of only one year.  What safeguard was that for the Fianna Fáil back-benchers? This measure, the passage of which was so important to the survival of the Government, is now being agreed behind the scenes to have a lifetime of one year.  That is a remarkable state of affairs.  This important, deeply needed and vital safeguard turns out to be something which is expendable, which has a limited lifetime and, in the last analysis, for the purpose of securing its passage and kicking the ball out of the political arena, the Government are willing to give it a limited lifespan.

      <P>I can see no objection in principle to Deputy Blaney's first amendment in relation to the requirement that warrants should be forwarded to the Attorney General in the first instance.  It is a very sensible arrangement. We made the point that this should be an explicit provision in the Bill and should be accepted by the Government. I do not think that anybody in this House &mdash; even Deputy Blaney &mdash; would disagree with that proposition and we accept the amendment from him in the spirit in which it is offered as it is an improvement to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The fundamental issue here is that Ireland, alone in all the countries in the world, has this strange arrangement with a neighbouring jurisdiction which emanates from the fact that we were once part of the same jurisdiction.  It also follows from the peculiar arrangements which we have inherited from history that we have a system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will finish in a couple of minutes.  There is no principled basis for giving powers to the Director of Public Prosecutions which any Deputy in this House does not believe should be conferred on anyone.  It is also the case that the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot be forced to exercise these functions and it is my belief that he refused to have these functions conferred upon him.  Therefore, it seems a monstrous suggestion that we should attempt to confer these functions, which are of doubtful constitutionality, on a man who finds them unacceptable.  That is a point which is blithely ignored by the people who propose this measure.  Why have we no assurance that the Director of Public Prosecutions would be willing to undertake these functions if the House saw fit to confer them upon him?  We have no such assurance.  In fact, we know from other sources that that is not the case.  It is an outrage that people can posture in this House as being willing to give him powers which they know in their heart of hearts he will not accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we have only ten minutes left in his debate and that it has been conducted in the manner it has been is the result of a deliberate decision of the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party to allocate the time.  If there has been adequate time to discuss these ten <Col N="666" /> amendments to the Bill instead of providing equal time, an hour tomorrow, to discuss individual amendments which suited the Fine Gael Party and Fianna Fáil Party, if there had been a fair allocation of time there would have been plenty of time for all Deputies to contribute. If there had been a responsible attitude to this legislation from the very beginning because it is a matter of fundamental importance, sufficient, the Taoiseach said to bring this Government down if they were defeated on it, it would not be rushed through.

The Progressive Democrats will vote against all the amendments with the exception of Deputy Blaney's first amendment on the basis that they are sweeping under the <Col N="667" /> carpet a fundamental issue and on the basis that the Government and the Fine Gael Party are pretending that there is no constitutional problem in relation to the Fine Gael amendment.  These are judicial functions and they must be carried out openly in the courts.  We therefore signify our deep loathing at the kind of double standards that are behind this proposal.  This proposal to give these powers to the Director of Public Prosecutions comes from a party which do not want the powers to exist at all.  That is a double standard and the people are entitled to know precisely how forked is the tongue they are listening to from those benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>The essential effect of these amendments would be to provide for the functions of the Attorney General under section 2 of the Bill to be performed, in the case of the amendments tabled by The Workers' Party, by a Judge of the High Court and, in the case of the amendments tabled by Deputy Barrett, by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The Government remain of the view that the Attorney General is the appropriate person to perform the functions which require to be performed under section 2 of the Bill.  Nothing that was said on Second Stage and nothing that I have heard here today has convinced me that the case should be otherwise.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons why the Government believe that these functions are appropriate to the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Attorney General has already important functions in relation to extradition applications and these new functions are consistent with his existing duties in the extradition field.  He has responsibility for representing the State in court cases in extradition applications. In addition, under arrangements which are already in place, he has an important role in relation to the vetting of warrants as to form and content to ensure compliance with Irish legal requirements. Similarly the Attorney General advises me as Minister for Justice in much the same matters in relation to requests <Col N="668" /> which are received from countries with which we have extradition agreements under Part II of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned in my reply yesterday evening that the non-statutory arrangements on sufficiency of evidence which the previous Government intended to put in place were to be operated on an &ldquo;Attorney General to Attorney General&rdquo; basis.  I asked the question that if the previous Government accepted that this should be the case when they were proposing purely administrative arrangements, why should the position be different now that the Attorney General is being given a strengthened role and now that that role is being placed on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The second reason why the Government believe that the function is appropriate to the Attorney General is related to the considerations I have just mentioned. It has been the practice since the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was established to reserve to the Attorney General the decision as to whether proceedings should or should not be instituted in prosecutions which involve an international dimension.  That practice is reflected in the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974 itself.  Under section 3 (5) of that Act, the Attorney General's consent is required for prosecutions under the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, the Official Secrets Act, 1963, and the Genocide Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>These statutes create offences which, of their nature, are likely to have something more than purely domestic implications. That practice has continued in the period since the enactment of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974.  Both the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 and the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1978 give the Attorney General a function in prosecutions under those Acts.</P>
    <P>There is, I would suggest, a close analogy between what the Oireachtas set out to do in those statutes and the provisions we are making in this Bill.  Responsibility for prosecutions was reserved to the Attorney General in those statutes because prosecutions under them would as likely as not have an international <Col N="669" /> dimension.  That dimension obviously exists in the case of the functions which the Attorney General will be performing under section 2 of the Bill as well.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the specific terms of the amendments now before us.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are proposing, in part, to substitute a High Court judge for the Attorney General for the purposes of the functions to be performed under section 2.  That is not necessary because the functions which the Attorney General is to perform are in no sense judicial functions.  The new procedure which is being provided by section 2 is intended to be preliminary to the formal extradition process.  I have already adverted to the involvement of the Attorney General and his Office in other aspects of the arrangements we operate with Northern Ireland and Britain under Part III.  The new duties he will perform will complement those existing functions.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party amendment would also provide that a Judge of the High Court would certify a warrant only when a request was accompanied by &ldquo;a statement of fact&rdquo;, by way of affidavit or statutory declaration, which satisfies the judge that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the offence has been committed and that the person sought committed it.  The existing terms of section 2 allow greater flexibility in that the Attorney General will consider such information as he deems appropriate. That flexibility is desirable in that it will enable the Attorney General to decide in the light of each particular case, the nature and extent of the information which will be necessary, in the particular case, for the purpose of forming the opinion which is required by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's amendments would have the effect of substituting the Director of Public Prosecutions for the Attorney General for the purposes of section 2.  This would not be appropriate either, because the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions relate to the prosecution of offences within this jurisdiction.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has no function in relation to extradition applications whereas the <Col N="670" /> Attorney General has extensive responsibilities and functions in this regard which I have already outlined in some detail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's amendment is also unacceptable because it would involve a significant weakening of the safeguard to be provided for in sections 44A and 44B. As the Bill stands it is necessary for the Attorney General to be satisfied both as to the intention to prosecute the person sought or to continue a prosecution and that such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  Deputy Barrett's amendment would only require the Director of Public Prosecutions to be satisfied that an intention exists to prosecute the person sought or to continue a prosecution already underway. There would be no requirement to relate that intention to the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 8a by Deputy Blaney, this amendment is unnecessary.  The effect of section 2 of the Bill when read with section 43 of the 1965 Act will be to require the Garda Commissioner to refer all warrants covered by the Bill to the Attorney General before any such warrant is endorsed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>You only got that line from Deputy Cooney this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because it is clear from the provisions of the new sections 44A and 44B that the Attorney General will be required to form an opinion one way or the other in the case of all warrants to which the Bill relates, that is, a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence.  Under the terms of those sections, the Attorney General will be entitled to decide not to give a direction when a warrant shall not be endorsed.  It will only be endorsed if he is of the opinion that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that the intention is founded on sufficient evidence.  The duty which section 43 of the 1965 Act places on the commissioner to endorse a warrant is made subject to the provisions of Part III.  The effect of section 2 will be, <i>inter alia,</i> to insert sections 44A and 44B in Part III.  Given the duty which is being <Col N="671" /> placed on the Attorney General by those sections the Garda Commissioner will be under a statutory obligation to refer any such warrants, covered by the Bill, to the Attorney General prior to their endorsement. I am prepared to have a look at that amendment between now and Report Stage to ascertain whether it warrants my further attention on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 10a, its acceptance would add to paragraph (b) of the proposed new section 44B a specific requirement that the evidence on which the intention to prosecute the person ought to be in existence on the date the Attorney General forms his opinion.  Therefore, the addition proposed is unnecessary.  The section requires the Attorney General to give a direction under section 44A unless he is of opinion that there is clear intention to prosecute or to continue prosecution of the person sought and, by virtue of paragraph (b), that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence. The conclusion seems inescapable to me that, in so far as paragraph (b) refers to the existence of sufficient evidence it means, and can only mean, that the Attorney General must form his opinion on the basis of evidence which exists. Therefore the proposed addition is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 10b and 10c, the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976 makes it a criminal offence under our law for a person to commit, in Northern Ireland, certain scheduled offences which, if committed within the States, would constitute an offence here. Those offences include murder, manslaughter, arson, kidnapping, false imprisonment, explosives and firearms offences.  The Act also has provisions for the admission at trials in the State of evidence taken in Northern Ireland or for the taking of evidence in the State for use by courts in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>May I remind the House that, in accordance with a decision earlier today, it was agreed to take a group of amendments &mdash; amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 &mdash; and dispose of them by midnight which is ten minutes away?

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) An officer authorised to issue a direction under this section or by virtue of section 4 (1) of this Act may, without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder, revoke a direction at any time.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General, in giving a direction that a warrant should not be endorsed under the proposed new section 44A of the 1965 Act may, therefore, render that warrant valueless for any future use.  This amendment will allow the Attorney General, if he so wishes, to change his mind with regard to such a direction.  By giving the Attorney General this power we will save ourselves a lot of difficulties in this regard in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is by no means unlikely that the Attorney General would find himself in the position where he would originally have directed that a warrant was not to be endorsed and then find himself faced with ample evidence that a genuine intention to prosecute the extradited person did in fact exist.  In such circumstances, an explicit power granted to the Attorney General to revoke the direction that the warrant should not be endorsed could be of considerable benefit.  Therefore, I urge <Col N="687" /> the Government to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sensible proposal. It means the Attorney General can change the direction which he may have given.  We are prepared to accept the amendment in its present state but I would mention that on Report Stage we would like to have the opportunity of bringing forward perhaps a revised draft of the amendment just to make it perhaps more appropriate.  For the moment on Committee Stage we accept the amendment as put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entering a voice of reservation on two grounds.  The principle that should apply in all matters relating to the criminal law is that there should be certainty in proceedings and finality. We are not at all happy at the notion that on a warrant or on a decision being taken in a process that there can be this review, revocation, review and revocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to say that a requesting authority of the British authorities can, in the light of fresh evidence, or fresh development, issue fresh warrants, but it is an undesirable feature to see it built into any process so that there is no element of finality or certainty.  I would ask the Government to reconsider.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) A decision to give or not to give <Col N="688" /> a direction under section 44A (inserted by this section) of the Principal Act shall not be reviewable for any reason by any Court.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate, concern was expressed by Deputies on various sides about the possibility of the Attorney General being brought before the courts and cross-examined as to his state of knowledge and how he came to his decision.  A number of people pointed out the very undesirable consequences that could flow from that.  What we attempt to do here is to put a decision beyond review.  We are not unaware of the difficulties in attempting to do that but we still believe it is an attempt that should be made.</P>

We have serious constitutional difficulties about it but we will see if something to meet the point in the amendment can be brought forward on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section it shall not be lawful to communicate with the Attorney General or an officer of the Attorney <Col N="693" /> General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, or an officer of the Director, the acting Director, a member of the Garda Síochána or a solicitor who acts on behalf of the Attorney General in his official capacity, for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision to give or not to give a direction under section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(b)  If a person referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection becomes of opinion that a communication is in breach of that paragraph it shall be the duty of the person not to entertain the communication.</P>
    <P>(c) (i) This section does not apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  communications made by a person who believes that an extradition request in respect of him has been made,</P>
    <P>(II)  communications made by a person involved in the matter either personally or as legal or medical adviser to a person involved in the matter or as a social worker or a member of the family of a person involved in the matter.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In this subsection `member of the family' means wife, husband, father, mother, grandfather, grand-mother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, grand-daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, a person who is the subject of, or in whose favour there is made, an adoption order.&rdquo;.</P>

Such a provision already applies in regard to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We would propose on Report Stage to bring forward an amendment which will achieve this purpose but we could not accept <Col N="694" /> this amendment because of its drafting.

      <P>I wish to make a brief observation.  The Government will deal with this matter on Report Stage when they propose to put down an amendment. In all of the proceedings and discussions, particularly those advanced by Deputy Cowen &mdash; again supporting this notion that it was an administrative function &mdash; it would antedate any action on the part of the commissioner and the warrant would not come into existence or its existence would not become known to anyone until after it was passed on to the commissioner. How, in those circumstances, when the Attorney General's function would have ceased, could the whole question of representation to the office of the Attorney General arise at all?  Would the Taoiseach explain that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Naughten gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of cuts in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  The Deputy has five minutes <Col N="695" /> to make his case and the Minister three minutes to reply.  That is all we can afford tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity of speaking on the Adjournment on this very important subject.</P>
      <P>First, I refer to the Official Report for Thursday, 12 November at column 579 when the Minister, replying to questions put by me and other Members of the House, stated in regard to redundancies:</P>
      <P>The Estimates do not make any reference to a figure of 1,000.  It is very important that that be put on the record of the House.  I did not make any statement of that kind and the Estimate did not...</P>
      <P>However, I have a press release here by the Minister for Agriculture, with his compliment slip clipped to it, that states that it was the Minister's intention to amalgamate AFT and ACOT, and that in this process the establishment of a new body would require legislation and would result in a substantial reduction in the order of 1,000 in the current staffing levels of 2,200.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that on that day he did mislead the House.  I now ask him to put on the record precisely what the situation is.  We are faced here with an unprecedented occurrence in that the major industry here is faced with a 44 per cent cut in its educational and advisory elements while the administrative section of the Department is only reduced by 2 per cent.  It is extremely difficult to understand how the Minister can justify this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to inform me and the other Members of this House, and of course the farming community, the advisory service and the staff of AFT whether he will accept that investment in agriculture, advice, research and development here is probably the lowest in Europe and would compare favourably with the Third World?  Will the Minister explain how he could cut the productive side of the Department, namely, ACOT <Col N="696" /> and AFT, by 44 per cent and retain the administrative side practically intact?</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance for agriculture that we have research to keep the farming community up to date with new farming techniques and that we have advice to educate farmers and promote new advances in research and development. We are one of the best beef producing countries in the whole of Europe.  At a time of massive unemployment, of unparalleled emigration, it is vitally important that we develop this major industry to create jobs for our young people.  Instead, the Government have taken a retrograde step.  They have cut the finance available to ACOT and AFT by 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose to do with the 1,000 staff who will be redundant as a result of the cuts in this Vote?  I understand that 400 of those have opted for the redundancy scheme, 250 in AFT and 150 in ACOT.  What is the Minister going to do with the other 600 staff?  Some have given a lifetime of service, others 14 or 15 years to the agricultural sector. What would they turn their hand to? What precisely does the Minister mean by redeployment?  Does he mean transferring staff from the midlands down to Goleen or up to Achill or somewhere like that, or does he intend to retain them on the payroll of some Department as happened with the Irish Land Commission staff who, today, receive a monthly cheque, have not done any work since last April and are not even sure what Department they are employed in? Is this what the Minister means by redeployment? The Minister owes it to this House, to those people who have given a lifetime of service to agriculture, to the farming community, to specify precisely where ACOT/AFT or the combined new body are going.  I appeal to the Minister to take this golden opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I sincerely hope the Minister answers the questions I have asked, not as happened the last day.  I certainly will allow the Minister to come in and I would ask him not to proceed along the road he is going, but to make additional money available to ACOT and AFT, to retain the excellent staff and research facilities so that agriculture can develop on into the next century.</P>

      <P>Let the record show that the Deputy has allowed me two and a half minutes at after 27 minutes past midnight to respond to what he presents as being important issues.  If he really wanted to have these matters debated seriously he would not present them at this hour of the night knowing that next week I will, as I indicated already today, be bringing the full legislation before the Dáil.  This is a piece of play acting on the Deputy's part and must be exposed as such.  I have two minutes to deal with all of the questions he has asked.  I will deal with some of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I want to put it on record that I have raised this issue for the last month in this House and, at the request of the Minister's colleague, this matter was not taken last week.  The Minister is being grossly unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally asked the Deputy today, in view of the late hour, if he would postpone this because we know we would have no chance to talk about it.  So let me deal with two or three points in a minute and a half now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I want to give the lie to the statement that we have the lowest investment in agricultural research in Europe or anywhere else.  The fact is that of our total investment programme over 30 per cent of our research and development programme in Government expenditure is <Col N="698" /> devoted to agriculture.  That is, the highest percentage in Europe of Government expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy checks the records he will find that to be the case.</P>
      <P>The second fact is that the Deputy's party, as in so many other areas for the last four years, sat back and looked at this and did nothing about it.  Everyone recognises that it was time to integrate, in a very effective way the research, education and advisory services to ensure that there would be an immediate flow of information from the research to the primary producer in one intergrated authority which is what I am proposing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

        <i>Limerick West):</i> The programme for the <Col N="489" /> establishment of protected control centres in each county and region is continuing.</P>
      <P>Fire appliances, personnel and equipment vehicles, uniforms, welfare trailers and first aid kits have been or are being purchased this year.  A further supply of radiation measuring instruments capable of giving readings down to background level is also being acquired.  Communications have been considerably improved by the installation of facsimile machines in control centres, and hand-portable radio telephones and mobile units for local training and operations have been obtained.</P>
      <P>For the information of the younger generation an information package for inclusion in the civics curriculum for postprimary schools has been launched for issue to the schools in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on Civil Defence in 1987 is expected to amount to £2,308,000 that is £1,750,000 from the Vote for Defence and £558,000 expenditure by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Latest returns from local authorities indicate that the total strength of volunteers throughout the country is over 40,400, of whom about 21,500 are active members.</P>
      <P>Civil Defence is organised in five distinct services.  They are; The warden service which is a significant element in the warning and monitoring network details of which are given in reply to another question today; The welfare service which would provide shelter and sustenance in the event of the displacement of persons; and the casualty service, rescue service and auxiliary fire service which would assist the front line emergency services as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Civil Defence organisation through all its services would help to mitigate substantially the effects of war on the civilian population should such a disaster occur.  Moreover, Deputies will be aware of the considerable assistance afforded by Civil Defence to the public in various ways in peacetime, whether on the occasion of flooding, accident or other emergency. This peace time role has recently been <Col N="490" /> extended by the involvement of Civil Defence in the emergency plan being prepared to deal with a nuclear accident abroad, and new monitoring equipment has been acquired for this purpose. Deputies will, I am sure, join with me in acknowledging our indebtedness to the fine body of public spirited volunteers who make up the Civil Defence organisation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to two separate incidents which occurred at Shannon Airport recently.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 19 November 1987 two Iranians, a male and female, requested political asylum at Shannon, after they failed to rejoin a flight <i>en route</i> from Moscow to Cuba.  The applicants were interviewed by immigration officers. Their cases were considered by my Department by reference to the United Nations 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. The representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Department of Foreign Affairs were consulted.  Following consideration of their cases, it was decided that they did not qualify for asylum under the Convention and Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> My decision to refuse both applicants asylum was conveyed to them by immigration officers and they departed Shannon for Beirut via Brussels and Moscow on 21 November 1987.  Incidentally, the Iranian passenger is incorrect in stating that his wife was granted asylum here. She did not qualify for asylum but was allowed stay here on humanitarian grounds.  Her permission to stay in the State has since been withdrawn in the light of additional information which has come to my attention.</P>
    <P>At 12.50 a.m. on 21 November, 1987 an Indian passenger arrived at Shannon on a flight from Delhi via Moscow.  He sought leave to enter the State for study purposes.  He was interviewed by immigration officers.  As a result of the information obtained by them during the course of their inquiries, it was decided to refuse the passenger leave to land under the provisions of the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975.  He was handed the refusal notice indicating the reasons he was refused leave to land. He was also allowed talk to a person claiming to be a relative for about half an hour.  The passenger departed Shannon for Delhi at 1.50 p.m. on 21 November 1987.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the three persons referred to by the Deputy had their cases fully examined and were dealt with in accordance with law and the correct procedures. I am also satisfied that relatives of passengers refused leave to land at Shannon Airport can get all appropriate information at all times, including weekends.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long-term social <Col N="499" /> welfare or health board payments.  This year for the first time the scheme has been extended to the long-term unemployed where they are living alone or with dependants.</P>
      <P>While the person concerned is in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance, he apparently resides with a person who is in receipt of a separate social welfare payment and is not, therefore, his dependant within the terms of the national fuel scheme.  Accordingly he is not entitled to a fuel allowance under the scheme.  A notification to this effect was issued to him on 11 November 1987.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 10 September 1987 after which date benefit was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and on 26 November 1987 was examined by a <Col N="500" /> different medical referee who considered him to be incapable of work from 11 September 1987.  Payment of disability benefit resumed from 30 November 1987. Arrears of benefit, less supplementary welfare allowance paid during the period of the appeal, will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>Details of the workforce by county are not available.  Table 4 gives a breakdown by region.</P>
      <P>In the time available, it was not possible to compile the data requested on smallholders.  This will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on a claimant being the holder of a qualification certificate and to obtain a qualification certificate the claimant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of <Col N="505" /> the legislation governing the unemployment assistance scheme, the value of any benefit or privilege derived by a claimant from any source must be taken into account in the assessment of means. In practice, this is taken to mean the value of board and lodging to the claimant residing in the home of his parents or a relative.  The purpose of the assessment for board and lodging of claimants living with relatives is to achieve a degree of equity as between claimants living in relatively better off circumstances and those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    <P>In this case the social welfare officer to whom the case was referred is satisfied that the claimant is mainly residing with his parents.  He has, accordingly, requested that details of their earnings be submitted in order that the value of board and lodgings enjoyed by the claimant can be determined.  As soon as the required information is received his case will be submitted to a deciding officer for assessment of means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of this assessment.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was examined <Col N="506" /> on 20 September 1987 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in nine months.  A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was notified on the 17 November 1987 of this decision and of his right to appeal.  No appeal has been received to date but this parliamentary question has been taken as an appeal on his behalf and arrangements are being made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 21 December 1987.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of that examination.</P>

      <P>Persons on training courses continue to be paid the same amount as they would have recieved had they remained on social welfare.  SES and Teamwork participants are paid a wage which is usually greater than their previous welfare entitlements.  For example, single persons on these schemes receive £60 per week; on unemployment assistance they would receive a maximum of £37.80 per week.  Furthermore, persons on the SES are employed part-time and many work elsewhere during their time off.  In these circumstances the question of a Christmas bonus does not arise.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 9 (ii) of my Department's letter of allocations states that &ldquo;in determining their overall budgetary strategy for 1988 health boards should ensure that key services for the old and housebound are protected, services such as community nursing services, home help services and meals-on-wheels, services for the handicapped, child care services particularly day care and pre-school services for deprived and disadvantaged communities and after-care services for children leaving long-term residential care are maintained, at 1986 approved levels in real terms&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The letter also advocates that resources be specifically allocated to health education projects.</P>
      <P>The letter of allocation for 1987 also advised health boards of the need to protect community services, including those provided by voluntary groups, in as far as possible.  Given the very difficult financial positions of the boards in the current year, I am satisfied that this advice was acted upon.</P>

The psychologists are located as follows: Dublin 13, Cork 14, Galway 3 and one in each of the following locations, Drogheda, Sligo, Limerick, Portlaoise, Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are the duties and functions of the psychologists: To monitor, advise on and support the provision of guidance and remedial education in post primary schools.  To assess pupils with psychological or educational difficulties as requested and to advise parents, schools and teachers accordingly.  To <Col N="521" /> advise schools and teachers on the provision for exceptional children e.g. the disabled, the disadvantaged.  To provide teacher in-service training e.g. basic training in remedial education as well as short term in-service training for teachers. In addition to the above, the psychologists contribute to the development of various programmes, such as vocational preparation and training courses.  They also contribute to the development of social and personal programmes for pupils, e.g. drugs and substance abuse education.  They engage in research and development of educational materials.  They contribute to the development of programmes to promote equality of opportunity for girls and boys. An extension of the service is not envisaged in present circumstances but the role and functions of the psychologist are being developed continuously in response to the changing needs of pupils, of schools and of education generally.</P>
