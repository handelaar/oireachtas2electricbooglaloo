      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to allow the Minister for Finance to write off amounts outstanding on a loan from the local loans fund where he considers it appropriate to do so.  This is essentially a technical provision which arises from a decision to simplify the system of financing capital programmes operated by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system has developed into <Col N="344" /> an expensive and time-consuming circle of payments and has been in need of reform for some time.  The changes will have no adverse effect on the finances of either the Exchequer or local authorities but will reduce administration costs.</P>
    <P>The local loans fund was set up by the Local Loans Fund Act, 1935.  Prior to this a non-statutory fund was financed by a grant-in-aid, voted annually.  The origins of this fund go back about 100 years. Loans from the fund are available for local capital programmes, repayable over periods of 25 to 50 years, the principal programmes being house building and sanitary services.  The fund is also used to finance housing mortgages issued by local authoities.  When formally established in 1935 a limit of £5 million was set on advances from the fund.  The most recent amendment in 1986 increased this limit to £4,500 million.</P>
    <P>The financing of repayments has changed substantially over the past 20 years.  As local authorities undertook more capital programmes and borrowed more from the fund, their burden of repayments increased until it became necessary to introduce subsidies on some loan charges.  These subsidies were gradually increased and the Exchequer now subsidises the vast bulk of the repayments. The subsidies on loan charges now range from between 40 per cent and 60 per cent for sanitary services programmes up to 100 per cent for local authority housing.  Such subsidies are not paid on the loans for house purchase.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the majority of the loans to local authorities are loans in name only.  Giving a 100 per cent subsidy means that, having provided the loan, the Exchequer also provides the repayments.  Even where a loan is partially subsidised the Exchequer in effect meets all the repayments, a portion through the loan charges subsidy and the remainder through the rates support grant.  The result is that the Exchequer meets the entire cost of funding local authority capital programmes by means of an elaborate, expensive and needless circle of payments.</P>
    <P>In order to break this circle and reduce <Col N="345" /> the administration costs I propose to alter the system.  From 1988 onwards grants will be given for all those programmes which previously qualified for subsidised loans.  In consequence of this change I must also have power to write off the outstanding principal and interest due on existing loans.</P>
    <P>The writing off of the loans will have no net effect on either local authority or Exchequer finances.  Where a loan which was fully subsidised is written off obviously there will be no change in the finances of the local authority or the Exchequer.  Where a loan which was partially subsidised is written off, the rates support grant payable to the local authority concerned will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the unsubsidised portion of the loan charges.  Overall the net cash position remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Loans for house purchase mortgages will continue to be provided.  There is no need to change the present arrangement in this case as the householders repay their mortgages and there is no circle of payments due to subsidies.</P>
    <P>This legislation will allow the arrangements for funding local authorities capital programmes to be greatly simplified and will remove a costly apparatus required to administer the present method of subsidised repayments.  The legislation will have no adverse effect on the amount of funds available from the Exchequer to local authorities but will reduce the administrative cost of providing these funds.  Arrangements for the actual writing off of existing repayments and the adjustments in grants to local authorities will be made in consultation with Ministers concerned.  The intention is that the substitution of capital grants for loans and the adjustment of the rate support grant will take effect from 1 January 1988.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Finance may waive the repayment of any unpaid balance, including interest, on a loan advance from the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a statement of such waivers shall be laid before each <Col N="346" /> House of the Oireachtas from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for consequential amendments in two other Acts which have sections dealing with the writing off of sums outstanding on loans from the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is a technical Bill which brings about administrative improvements in the way the local fund is administered.  I welcome it. I have absolutely no objection to it.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that the Bill will not have an adverse effect on the amount of funds available from the Exchequer to local authorities but that it will reduce the administrative costs of providing the funds.  I welcome the fact also that details of any action he takes under section 2 of the Bill in the area of waivers for loans will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas from time to time.</P>
      <P>The local loans fund which was set up in 1935 has been an effective vehicle for investment in local authorities for a long time, especially in the area of houses and sanitary services.  This Bill makes no changes in the effectiveness of the local loans fund except in the administrative area.  I do not want to delay the House. Practically everything in the Minister's speech is already included in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask one question.  I understand that in calculating the national debt there is an element of double counting when one takes the local loans fund into account.  I wonder will this movement from a loans scheme to a grant scheme change the methodology of the arithmetic and will it eliminate some of the double counting in the area of the national debt?  I would like the Minister to comment on this in detail.  I had already put down a parliamentary question which was answered before the summer recess.  The Minister gave me some information but that did not make the position totally clear to me.  I would like the Minister to go over that ground <Col N="347" /> again, to explain how the double counting occurs and say whether this Bill will affect that in any way or if he intends to bring in legislation to change the system.  We are perceived to owe enough already without artificially inflating that amount by double counting what the Government lend to local authorities and what the local authorities owe.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Noonan I, too, welcome this Bill.  It simplifies public accounting procedures and does away with what is in effect a myth &mdash; that is, that central Government lend money to local government for capital purposes. That is desirable and I commend the Minister for substituting an honest and realistic scheme of grants where grants have been given and for simplifying the local loans procedure or effectively abolishing it so as to reflect the realities of the situation.</P>
      <P>This is only the tip of the iceberg because in two respects this Bill has a significance which should not be lost here today.  First, a number of things have happened &mdash; I do not want to trespass on next week's Estimates consideration &mdash; which suggest that funding of two local authorities is being reduced and that the rate support grant which is referred to in the Minister's speech is to be substantially reduced.  I get the feeling that the slow death of local democracy which started some time in the seventies, depending on what side of the House you were on then, is now reaching a critical point and that we are hearing and will hear over the next year the death rattles of local democracy. This calls into question the financing of local democracy and how it is to proceed about its business.  Is central Government to continue to give grants to local authorities for capital purposes or are local authorities, who make the decisions in many cases, to seek their own funding?  I do not want to blow my own trumpet or to sound my own death knell but it is about time this House seriously addressed the issue of local authority financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this is a welcome reform it is <Col N="348" /> an accounting reform.  There is a substantive reform to be made and that is to permit local authorities to finance their own statutory functions, to redefine those functions and to reassign responsibility for making decisions and financing those decisions.  It can only be in the light of the trend of public finances that that must increasingly fall on local authorities themselves and that they must be more and more liable to fund their own activities from some form of revenue.</P>
    <P>I have looked back at all the White Papers which were published by the Minister's predecessor in office in 1972 about funding local government.  It seems, and it would be the consensus of virtually all this House if everyone addressed their minds to it and were not afraid to speak of it regardless of political consequences, that the only way to finance local government is by local taxation and the one practical way to achieve local taxation is by a tax on property.  I do not want to expand further on that save to say that when local democracy makes decisions on capital projects it should not simply come with a begging bowl to the Minister for Finance looking for a grant.  Local government should be able to capitalise on many things and repay the capital debts themselves, and raise money if necessary to do so.  I think this country is about to take that step one way or the other, whatever party are in power and whatever influence any political party have over the process in the next five years.</P>
    <P>The PDs do not want to prolong this debate or make unnecessary or irrelevant points, but on the occasion of an improvement of this kind, which is a procedural improvement, substantive improvements are to be made and the agenda is still there regardless of whether this House chooses to address it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is being introduced to make the system easier and more manageable, but when local authorities are being notified of a reduction of 14 per cent in the rate support grant one is suspicious that perhaps there is something that one does not see at this <Col N="349" /> time.  I want to avail of this opportunity to say that the subsidy on loan charges is 100 per cent on housing but 50 per cent &mdash; it can vary &mdash; on the sanitary service charges, and the Minister should make the necessary arrangements to have the subsidy on the loan charges for sanitary services 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>We are aware that when smaller local authorities undertook major capital schemes in their areas there was a special subvention payable which was in excess of the 50 per cent on loan charges.  Will the Minister clarify whether that will still be available to the smaller local authorities? The Minister said that where a loan which is partially subsidised is written off the rate support grant payable to the local authority concerned will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the unsubsidised portion of the loan charges, but overall the net cash position remains the same.  In this year of 1987 local authorities are looking to the 1988 Estimates.  How will the position be affected in 1988?  I am confused about that.  A Bill is to be passed in the Dail to make the system of financing easier and more direct.  Loans which were previously granted to local authorities under the local loans fund will be waived and the Minister said that in such cases the rate support grant will be reduced.  If so, will that happen immediately on the passing of this legislation?</P>
      <P>The main point on which I seek clarification is in regard to the special subvention to local authorities.  The Bill is not very important in that it is unlikely to make any difference to local authorities.  I am a member of two local authorities, Cork County Council and Mallow UDC, both of whom will be fighting for survival. I have commented publicly to the effect that if the shortfall in finances is to affect Cork County Council the business of the council will fold up in May or June 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the election campaign Fianna Fail promised a total review of local government finances and in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> they said that Fianna Fail would eliminate the present uncertainty whereby local authorities cannot anticipate what money <Col N="350" /> from the central Exchequer will be allocated to them each year.  I hope that will be rectified but I think this measure will only create more confusion in this regard.</P>
    <P>The legislation is to provide that local authorities will receive a statutory contribution each year from the Exchequer which will be sufficient to provide a satisfactory level of necessary services.  The question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but he is rather straying from the subject matter before the House.  This matter deals with local loans funding.  The matter he is referring would be more appropriate on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Most local authorities will have no money for housing, drainage or anything else and the inevitable result of the decision to chop by £145 million the allocation from the Department of the Environment will be a chronic worsening of services at local level with deteriorating roads, additional water and sewerage problems, an increase in pollution, little or no house building or maintenance and worsening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Deputy, I have already admonished you that this is a relatively confined measure and does not permit ranging widely over local authority affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, you will recall I said at the outset that at this time local authorities are being notified that there is a reduction of 14 per cent in the rate support grant and that the introduction of legislation of this nature makes one suspicious. I ask the Minister to clarify the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome this change.  It is a long overdue administrative reform.  As I read the Bill I was thinking of some ten years ago when I was an official in the Department of Finance and we were convinced of <Col N="351" /> the need for reforms of this nature.  The situation in 1987 is different from what it was in 1935 when the local loans fund was formalised.  The problem that has grown up in the local loans fund administration in the past 15 years has been that a disgraceful amount of administrative time, a good deal of administrative effort and not a small amount of public funds were invested in certain funding arrangements which served no purpose other than to be wasteful and which distorted the accounting figures in local government and, further, distorted the national accounting figures.  For that reason alone this is a welcome administrative change.</P>
      <P>As the Minister and his Department have identified this circulatory transfer for elimination, they could now extend the same principle to other areas.  Certainly other funding arrangements in subsidiary bodies of Government again involve circulatory transfers and in so far as they distort the public finances and are wasteful of the time of officials and sometimes of this House, such circulatory transfers should be treated in the same manner as this one and wiped out.  I welcome the Minister's undertaking that there will be no elimination of support for schemes by the change which is being brought about in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The effect of this administrative change will be seen in the national income and expenditure tables.  Table 17 which deals with local government has always struck me as being based more on hypothesis and speculation than on real measurements of changes and transfers between central Government and local government.  I hope that the reforms being introduced by the Minister will extend to that.  It is vital in an economy such as ours at a time such as this that we can have the utmost confidence in the way we measure the national accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate has been broadened slightly from the pure administrative and technical detail of this Bill I will make one or two brief comments.  As the Minister has discussed changing an implicit subsidy to a grant I would like some attention <Col N="352" /> to be given to the whole question of transfers by grants to local authorities. Members of local authorities are aware of the frustration at the level of specific grants in local Government.  If, while these administration changes are being made consideration could be given to broadening the block grant allocations to cover a range of capital activities by the local authorities, that would be another worthwhile administrative change.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the final points made that the death knell is somehow sounding in local government because efficiencies are being demanded.  Like other Deputies who spoke, I am a member of a local authority and we would be deluding ourselves to suggest that local authorities cannot make efficiencies of ten, fifteen or even higher percentage points.  There is not one local authority here who operate at 100 per cent efficiency.  I happen to operate in two local authorities who make efforts to be efficient but I would defy any critic of Government or defender of local democracy to prove that any local authority here are operating at anything like 100 per cent.  The final points made by Deputy Sherlock are not only not germane to this Bill but are simply a misstatement of the facts.  This is a very welcome and long overdue administrative change.  I hope that the Minister and his Department having started down this path will now take the same critical view of other transfers to subsidiary bodies with a view to tidying up the national accounts generally and the whole question of transfers from central to subsidiary government, giving us a truer picture of the reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill, not just for the Bill but for the spirit behind it.  The Members of this House especially those who are members of local authorities and other organisations are familiar with the problem we have of administration for the sake of administration. The spirit of this Bill, which I hope is only a start in tackling the problem of bureaucracy, is to be welcomed. It is simply a streamlining of the outdated <Col N="353" /> system which has been with us since 1935, which has served us well but is now no longer relevant as it is not only time-consuming but costly.</P>
      <P>Members of the House may not be aware of the administration that is involed in something like the housing subsidy paid to local authorities.  When the Department of the Environment have approved a housing scheme the local authority has to request money from the Local Loans Fund.  When the money is transferred and the houses built the local authority pays the local loans fund and then requests repayment of that money from the Department.  The Department have to check with the Office of Public Works who do all the calculations, and once it is agreed, they are sent back to the Department of the Environment and the money is then paid to the local authority. There are about six or seven stages in the payment.  All of this takes time and costs money.  I am glad that the Bill will overcome a lot of the administration involved there.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I am conscious of a number of other areas where similar pure administration exists.  I will cite a few examples.  In relation to the higher education grants scheme administered by the local authorities, the local authority does all the processing of the applications. They go into all the details and into all the checking.  When that is done they go to the Department of Education which duplicates the checking and rechecking of the application.  I know the Department must keep an eye on administration of the scheme but a simple spot check system would be quite sufficient. There is no local authority that would give grants in contravention of the terms of the higher education grants scheme. There is a useless and wasteful duplication of administration in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of VEC grants a lot of administration could be cut out.  At the moment if a student from Meath applies to Letterkenny, Sligo, or some other RTC for a grant, Letterkenny RTC have to apply to Donegal VEC for payment of that grant, Donegal VEC pay the grant and apply to Meath VEC for a repayment <Col N="354" /> of the grant and Meath VEC pay the grant and then apply to the Department for a repayment of the grant.  About five or six different bodies are involved there, whereas the simple thing to do would be to allow Letterkenny RTC to vet the grant and Donegal VEC to pay it and so cut out all this administration.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I will touch in relation to local authorities is that a number of local authorities have received demands from the Revenue Commissioners in relation to investment income they receive.  Some local authorities have managed their funds very well and have managed to lay aside capital reserves for housing and other such ventures.  The Revenue Commissioners are now pursuing these local authorities for interest on the investment income on these capital accounts.  They are asking some local authorities to go back as far as the early seventies and there is no doubt that according to the 1967 Finance Act they have the power to do so, but now, hard pressed local authorities are being asked to act as tax inspectors and go back over books for ten or 15 years. They will have to let vital and valuable services fall behind because of pure administration problems.  If the Department of Finance want to deduct tax on those accounts why could they not simply ask the local authorities to submit details of their income from capital accounts and deduct that amount from the grants that the local authorities are suppose to get. I do not agree that this tax should be taken from them.  Local authorities that have been judicious in saving money and investing it should be encouraged to do so rather than penalised and taxed.</P>
    <P>Another area where there is duplication of administration is in group water schemes.  Every member of a local authority is well aware that the local authority is the best organisation to look after the administration and vetting of group water schemes.</P>

      <P>I echo Deputy Sherlock's remarks on behalf of The Workers' Party.  We welcome in principle the ideas in the Bill.  Anything that helps to tidy up the organisation of funding and make it more cost effective is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Having said that much, I would not trumpet in this legislation with all the noise that some of the Deputies on the Government side have sought to do.  It is very important to highlight some of the dangers that might creep in in regard to the funding of local authorities consequent on this very Bill.  I would like to highlight its shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a party who have constantly made the point that local authorities can never function effectively without a sound financial basis, that is, a pre-determined, fixed, assured basis of financing that allows a local authority each year to know where it is going and what it can hope to budget for in the coming years. Since 1977 there has been a fundamental change in the basis of local authority financing consequent on the abolition of funding raised at local level.  Over the years there has been a unilateral decision by central government as to what moneys local authorities would have available to them for their use throughout the year.  I have a major concern about the explanation that the Minister has advanced in respect of the operation of the powers under this Bill.  Where central government is funding the local authority 100 per cent one cannot even begin to imagine how since 1935, we have had this circuitous way of dealing with the operation of the money being paid out <Col N="356" /> being considered as a loan and having to be returned through a fiction.  One welcomes the tidying up of that aspect but the Bill does not, for example, suggest the abolition in its entirety of the local fund.  It does not, for example, suggest that those persons employed, be it within the Department or at local level, with the operation of the mechanisms of the fund will now be available and free for other duties.  In fact, there is very little in real terms that will be saved in man hours or in persons being released for other duties.  This is a very tiny step in the tidying up operation.</P>
    <P>I do not look on this as a major step in local Government funding reorganisation. It is a very tiny step and we must recognise it as such.  The local fund will be there as will all the personnel who were working there previously.  Interestingly, the Minister has given no indication as to how this will be a great cost saving and streamlining exercise.  I do not see it except in a very small way and only in the area of the 100 per cent funding operation.</P>
    <P>There was one profound concern in the question of funding and that relates to those projects that are partially funded. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Where a loan which was partially subsidised is written off, the rates support grant payable to the local authority concerned will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the unsubsidised portion of the loan charges.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain a little more how he and his Department intend to operate that.  I am concerned about this because since 1977, on a yearly basis the cost effectiveness of the rates support grant to local authorities has been reduced.  It is not a rates support grant, it is a portion thereof because it has never kept apace with the loss to local authorities of the revenue they would have had had they been collecting rates on a local basis.  If local authorities are granted a partial support for a capital scheme they repay that, not within a year but over a period of years.  If at some stage along the way the Minister decides, <Col N="357" /> because of the scale of it, or the inability of the local authority to pay, to wipe out the portion of grant, will the local authorities rate support grant for that particular year be reduced to make up the loss that central revenue would otherwise have, or will the reduction of the rates support grant be spread over a number of years to reflect what would, in fact, have been the liability of the local authority to that partial support grant in that current year?  Will there be any negotiation by central government with the local authority in deciding, for example, what should be written off and on what terms it will be written off?  Upon what terms will the rates support grant be altered.</P>
    <P>For too long now, there has been an attitude at central government, no different in Coalition days than in Fianna Fáil days, of making unilateral decisions. Last year, there was a £3.5 million reduction in finances to Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member.  This year, it is £4 million to £4.5 million.  We have been told that at local level by letter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote:</P>
      <P>The writing off of the loans will have no net effect on either local authority or Exchequer finances.  Where a loan which was fully subsidised is written off obviously there will be no change in the finances of the local authority or the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with that but the sentence that <Col N="358" /> concerns me and on which I want some clarification is as follows:</P>
    <P>Where a loan which was partially subsidised is written off, the rates support grant payable to the local authority concerned will be reduced by an amount corresponding to the unsubsidised portion of the loan charges.</P>
    <P>To make my point in case I have not made it clearly and the Minister is missing it, I want to know on what basis that alteration or write-off of the rates support grant will be made.  Will it be made in consultation and not in the unilateral way central Government have been treating local authorities since the introduction of the rate support grant in 1977?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Roche indicated, the debate has strayed a little from the kernel of the matter.  Deputy Roche suggested that there is not a local authority that could not achieve efficiencies of the order of 10 per cent to 15 per cent but my simple answer to that is that while all local authorities like all other bodies are capable of efficiencies, those efficiencies should be sought in the spirit of consultation and not by the big stick method of unilateral decisions being made by central Government without consultation. Until central Government introduce legislation that allows local authorities to engage, for example, in the disposal of waste on a commercial basis, or the building of houses for the private sector, they will never be able to deal with the whole question of efficiencies.  When the Government with, I have no doubt, the support of some of the Opposition parties, agree to the expansion of the operations of local authorities they will get the efficiencies they require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  Anything that helps to eliminate bureaucracy, which is rampant at present, is to be welcomed.  Some of the Members have identified waste in local authorities and while it may exist I do not think the <Col N="359" /> blame lies entirely with those who are endeavouring to administer a very outdated system.  It is important that that point is made.  We must attack the system rather than those who are trying to operate it.  It has always been my contention that local authorities have an important role to play but they have been unable to do that for many years.  That has arisen because local authorities do not have any control over their own finances and that has marginalised the role of elected representatives. The efficiency level of local authorities has been reduced because they do not have any say in the spending of the funds available to them.  They cannot engage in long term planning for their own areas.</P>
      <P>From year to year the rate support grant has been varied downwards and local authorities have reached crisis level in terms of their finances.  They are facing 1988 in that state.  Where do we go from here?  In my view the Minister, in conjunction with this measure, should have introduced more wide-ranging measures in connection with local authorities.  I am sure he, like all Members, wants an efficient and effective local authority system.  The Revenue Commissioners have asked local authorities to withhold the withholding tax on statutory payments to, for example, local government auditors which amounts to one Department penalising another.  It is an example of, more bureaucracy and we must eliminate it.  The only way to do so is to overhaul the entire system.  Central to that overhaul is the introduction of some form of local property tax, as suggested by the Progressive Democrats.  It is vital in the long term interests of local authorities that they should be in a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The measure introduced by the Minister does not amount to a <Col N="360" /> huge step forward but it is a step in the right direction.  We want to encourage the Minister to go much further.  It is in all our interests that local authorities are able to function to the maximum of their ability.  It is a case of local authority officials not being allowed to do so because the system they operate under does not permit them to perform in that way.  I urge the Minister to bring forward more measures to benefit local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which makes very sound sense in our efforts to try to tidy up the way the fund is administered.  Many of us who serve on local authorities will be aware of the bureaucracy that is attached to the administration of those bodies.  While the Bill may be described as a small step forward, it is a move in the right direction. There is a great deal of duplication in the administration of local authorities. Nowhere is that more evident than in the Dublin region where three local authorities operate side-by-side in terms of housing development, planning and road construction.  Administratively that is a poor way to conduct business.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider the effect the Bill will have in relation to the authority of elected representatives on local authorities.  As I understand it, in the past a manager anxious to raise a loan through the local loans fund had to bring a request to raise that loan before a meeting of the council. It appears that will not be necessary in future under the grants system.  If that is so I ask the Minister to tell us how legislation will be changed to cope with it.  Elected representatives should always be consulted on such matters as raising loans for housing development, sanitary services schemes and so on.  I do not think a manager should be allowed ignore the views of elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain cases in this year and into next year there will be some effect on the rates support grant.  Elected members will have to have some say about any change or adjustment in the rates support grant arising out of this Bill.  It is right <Col N="361" /> that Members should have some control over the management of local authorities in relation to the raising of loans, particularly where there might be an effect on the total finances available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill in terms of tidying up a situation which has existed since 1935 and the effect of which has grown quite considerably over the years, particularly in the last ten to 15 years.  Anything that a Minister can do to improve the efficiency and operation of local authorities is to be welcomed, whether it be the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment.  For too long we have seen a great duplication of effort and service which ultimately leads to a waste of the taxpayer's money in many cases.  That is something that all of us are interested in trying to avoid.  I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister will be able to respond to the points made about the control of elected members over decisions by the management.  That is important for local democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First and very sincerely, I want to thank all the Deputies who contributed.  Every contribution welcomed this Bill and the reasons behind its introduction, even with regard to those who were trying to suggest that something sinister was being done, particularly in relation to the rates support grant which I shall come to in a moment.  I want first to deal with a very important point made by Deputy Noonan on the national debt and the elimination of the double counting and the fact that we have, at least on the face of it, reduced the amount that we are supposed to owe, or are perceived to owe.  It does not change the overall liabilities we have.  I should like to give the factual position of this switch from subsidised loans to grants which will result in reduction in the national debt statement as at present computed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the Exchequer's liability to subsidise future capital repayments by the local authorities through the local loans fund is included as an item in the national debt statement, even though the <Col N="362" /> Exchequer provides the advances in the first place from its general borrowings which are also included in the statement. Although from a gross accounting point of view this procedure may be technically correct, it means that the indebtedness of the Exchequer is overstated.  The debt which is charged to the Exchequer to represent the loan charges subsidy is, in fact, owed to the Exchequer itself.  Following the change now proposed, the figure for the national debt will be reduced by about £1,600 million.  It must be emphasised, of course, that this technical accounting adjustment to the national debt figure does not affect the real burden of the debt.  The heavy cost of debt service on the budget is not affected in any way and the necessity for reducing public expenditure in order to stabilise the debt will be in no way diminished.</P>

I am sure, too, that the same goes for every Deputy in the House, because we all want to see movement in that downward direction, however it is brought about.  However, this does not change the overall liability or the necessity for controlling and curtailing expenditure.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell raised the bigger question of local authority financing which is very important.  The Ceann Comhairle had difficulty in keeping Deputies' contributions on the rails in relation to what is contained in this legislation and the wider question of local authority finances.  I know that the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to say that the entire question of local authority functions and financing is being examined by the Minister for the Environment.  There will be other occasions in this House, as the Ceann Comhairle has said, for all of us to make a contribution in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Deputy Sherlock raised a number of very important points.  I should love to see sanitary services having a 100 per cent grant, too.  Some are higher than others, because of special concessions given in some cases.  We must consider the general situation and the burden on the Exchequer.  It is not intended that grants of 40 per cent to 60 per cent at the moment would be brought up to 100 per cent.  There are other items on the special local loans fund.</P>
    <P>The most important point and the one with which we are most concerned is the special subvention made to certain small local authorities.  I can assure the House that that will be taken fully into account in the adjustments which will be made and that the special concession which is available now to these certain small local authorities will still be available.  The local authority finance review was also mentioned.  However, I shall not go into that because it is a wider question.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question raised by Deputy McCartan, and which I think was touched on by a number of Deputies, first, while it has been said that it is important and necessary and that we are over-emphasising its importance, it is a saving. It is anything from £250,000 upwards in administrative costs and that is a saving. That is not small in any terms and we are looking around for savings of £4,000 and £5,000 under particular subheads throughout the whole Book of Estimates, as the Government have been doing over the last three or four months and as the House will be debating next week.  It may be considered small, but it is important.</P>
    <P>The major point the Deputy was making which was referred to by other Deputies was the impact on local authorities. The best that I can do is to repeat some of what I said and to add to my opening remarks.  The changeover to the new system of capital grants will be arranged so that it will have a neutral effect on local authority finances.  Local authorities will be no better or no worse off under the new system, no matter what the calculations are.  This will be achieved by writing off the outstanding capital and <Col N="365" /> interest on the local loans fund loan draws at a date or dates fixed following the enactment of the Bill.  Loan charges which would have been payable in that year on total local loan fund loan draws will not be levied on local authorities. In cases such as local authority housing where loan charges are 100 per cent subsidisable, no subsidy will be paid.  In cases where loan charges are partially subsidisable, generally around 50 per cent, neutral financial impact will be achieved by not paying a subsidy and reducing the rates support grant by the amount of the loan charges which authorities would have had to meet from their own resources.  The financial neutrality of the changeover will be maintained in subsequent years through the annual determination of the rates support grants, where account will be taken of the removal from local authorities of the burden of meeting net loan charges on subsidisable local loan fund loans from their own resources.  That should fully clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dempsey, Cullen and others raised fundamental points that we shall take fully into account in relation to unnecessary administration involved, particularly in the educational area.  I am sure we will do everything possible to eliminate any waste.  The points which were raised in relation to education will be brought to the attention of the Department of Education.  We are most anxious to eliminate unnecessary administrative details and the delays which are involved in the processing of applications for grants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey also referred to the local authorities, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in relation to the deposit interest retention tax which was introduced last year.  We will consider the point he has made and see what may or may not be done about it.  The Deputy also referred to group water schemes and said they would be better managed by the local authorities rather than by the Department of the Environment.  As the Ceann Comhairle rightly said, that is a matter <Col N="366" /> for the wider debate on local authority services generally.</P>
    <P>Most of the points which were raised were in welcome for what was being done.  I will convey to Deputy Noonan the information which was asked by him before we take Committee Stage, which I presume will be taken sometime next week, subject to agreement between the Whips.  At that time we can go into greater detail on the points which I may not have responded to this morning.  This is a short Bill comprising of only three or four sections and on Committee Stage we will be able to go into great detail on some of the points on which it was not possible to give a reply on Second Stage.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is not the point which I am chasing.  If a local authority owes money to the Exchequer the Minister has the power to write off what they owe but this goes further in that it allows the Minister to write off all or part of the interest due.  If the Minister uses that power, to fulfil his other commitment he will have to give a compensating amount in the grant-in-aid for all or part of the interest due.  I cannot envisage a particular circumstance where the Minister could write off a loan without also writing off the interest.

I contend that there is no power under the provisions of this Bill to do that.  Therefore might I have the statutory reference under which the Minister will be acting administratively.  Would the Minister not agree that, once he takes that administrative decision, the Local Loans Fund, as we know it, will cease to operate for capital projects on sanitary services and housing?

We could keep debating this forever. I can assure the Deputy that what we have said is all that is being done here, that is eleminating circular transfers, replacing these loans, because the Exchequer is responsible for giving and paying them in the form of grant, with the exception of house mortgage.  The provisions of this Bill enable us to do that.  The point the Deputy is making, that the provisions of this Bill do not afford us power to give the grants, is true because that power is a matter for the <Col N="371" /> Housing Acts.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This query arises from the point I made on the previous section.  If the Minister will look at section 2 he will see that there is an onus being placed on the Minister to lay a statement of waiver before each House of the Oireachtas.  For example, subsection (2) (c) and (d) place an obligation on the Minister to inform the Houses of the total amount of principal, the repayment of which is being waived and the total amount of interest, the repayment of which is also being waived.  It is not put in the manner of saying that the Houses must be informed as to whether the totality of the interest is being waived. It is the total amount of the interest. Therefore, the provisions of the section envisage a partial write-off of interest rather than a total interest write-off.  I am not getting a satisfactory explanation in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for implementing ATP &mdash; the Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to be Used for such Carriage &mdash; and of a Multilateral Agreement under Article 7 of ATP concerning carriage in thin-walled vehicles to and from Italy.  As both Agreements would involve a charge on public funds by their specific obligations as regards enforcement, Dáil approval of the terms of the Agreements is required by Article 29.5 of the Constitution before the State can accede to the Agreements. That is why the two motions are before the House in addition to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill may be summarised as providing the necessary framework for applying the detailed technical requirements of the Agreements &mdash; by enabling the Minister for Tourism and Transport to make regulations from time to time for the purposes of specifying those requirements as they are developing in line with developments in food and equipment technologies &mdash; and by making appropriate provision for enforcement, as specifically required by <Col N="375" /> the Agreements.  The necessary regulations will be devised in close consultation with the other Departments and interests concerned and will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas which will have power, under section 14 of the Bill, to annul the regulations if they should consider it necessary to do so.  The comprehensive explanatory and financial memorandum which was circulated with the Bill gives the general background to the Bill and a commentary on its provisions.  All I need add to that is to emphasise that the Bill and regulations to be made under it are not intended to &mdash; nor should they &mdash; give rise to extra costs for Irish hauliers or producers and to put on the record of the House my resolve to ensure that the Bill is cost-effectively enforced and that proper export activity is not disrupted.</P>
    <P>Why is the Bill needed?  Indeed, on the general level, one must ask why hauliers and producers of perishable foodstuffs need to be reminded by national and international law to operate to acceptable standards.  Commonsense and economic survival would dictate the observance of the highest possible standards at all stages from production to final destination. Unfortunately, experience has proved the need for law to be enacted to set minimum standards.  This serves primarily as a warning to those persons who might otherwise be careless, but should not, of course, lead to any complacency on the part of any other persons.</P>
    <P>Having received complaints about the off-condition of Irish perishable foodstuffs on arrival in export markets, particularly meat, the Transport Consultative Commission, in their 1981 Report on Road Freight Haulage, recommended that the State should accede to ATP as soon as possible and effectively enforce it, in order to ensure that Irish refrigerated vehicles are maintained to internationally acceptable standards and that they are not delayed or refused admission at frontiers.  It is earnestly to be hoped that Irish international hauliers have fully taken the Commission's message to heart, a message which a few months <Col N="376" /> ago I had the opportunity to reconvey to many of them at the annual general meeting of a representative body of theirs.</P>
    <P>Our exports of perishable foodstuffs now exceed £1,000 million a year.  Not only do we need to safeguard that level of exports but the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> calls for vigorous development of our exports so as to create worthwhile employment opportunities for our people.  Hauliers have a vital role to play in all this, particularly in moving time-sensitive food exports speedily.  If there is any departure from the highest standards, valuable orders will be lost, never to be regained. If Irish hauliers maintain their equipment to the best standards they can help to maximise our exports and secure new international business, thereby making a valuable contribution to regenerating our economy.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the Transport Consultative Commission's 1981 report also drew attention to the benefits of haulage vehicles having temperature recorders &mdash; thermographs &mdash; so as to monitor the temperature of foodstuffs in transit.  While neither the Bill nor ATP &mdash; nor any other international agreement &mdash; requires the installation of such recorders, hauliers would be well advised to consider having them installed for their own protection, particularly on long journeys. Of course, I fully recognise that, irrespective of the standard of carriage, the quality of the foodstuffs at loading would always be the crucial factor in determining whether the foodstuffs reach the market-place in the top condition which the customers are entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Bill itself, it is clear that legislation is needed to give a legal basis for the examination or testing of transport equipment for compliance with ATP requirements, and for the certification of equipment complying with those requirements, and for effective enforcement.  Without legislation, Irish certificates of compliance are potentially open to challenge by any one of the other <Col N="377" /> 20 European states which are ATP contracting states, with consequential risk of hauliers being delayed or refused entry at international frontiers.  So far, no problems of this kind have been encountered and it is in the national interest that the necessary legislation be in place at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As regards accession to ATP, Article 11 of ATP provides that accession by a state will not take place until one year has elapsed after that state has deposited its instrument of accession with the United Nations, which is the parent body of the Economic Commission for Europe which is responsible for monitoring and developing ATP.  Ireland's instrument of accession cannot be deposited until Dáil Éireann has approved the terms of ATP and the Bill has been enacted, hence the need for early Dáil approval in both cases.</P>
    <P>Ireland must first become an ATP contracting state before it can accede to the multilateral agreement concerning carriage in thin-walled vehicles to and from Italy.  The Bill is so framed as to enable Ireland to implement the multilateral agreement but its terms must also be approved by Dáil Éireann before Ireland can accede to it.  Thus, with the co-operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas, Ireland should be in a position to accede to both ATP and the multilateral agreement in just a year from now.  In the meantime, Ireland will continue present administrative arrangements for implementing both Agreements but will be making the necessary preparations to have any required revised arrangements ready for putting in place at latest when Ireland's accession to ATP and the multilateral agreement takes effect.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend the Bill and the two motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of what this Bill is trying to achieve.  Since we export over £1,000 million worth of perishable foodstuffs per annum, it is of the utmost importance that the equipment used in the moving of these foodstuffs is of the highest possible standard. This Bill is of vital importance since there <Col N="378" /> are question marks over the operations of some road hauliers in this respect and it is only right and proper that a very definitive set of standards be laid down to which all hauliers should adhere.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned minimum standards.  I believe a country like Ireland has an excellent future in the quality end of the market.  We should be aware not just of minimum standards but we should encourage people dealing in the perishable foods market to set their own standards above and beyond what is necessary.  The Minister referred to temperature control of goods in containers. This is an essential component when dealing with perishable foods.  All those conditions and standards should be noted at the beginning of the journey and monitored throughout the journey so that our customers can be assured on receipt of the goods that temperatures have been maintained.  That is of particular importance.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear on one or two points the Minister made, that is, the regulations to which he referred.  I believe this measure was sprung on the House and I am reacting to what he had to say.  The main thrust of this Bill is very important not just in the context of the carriage of perishable foodstuffs but in the presentation of products abroad and more particularly in ensuring that these products are delivered abroad under the highest possible standards and that those standards are adhered to.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that in Germany the standing of Irish foodstuffs is very high and that the quality end of that market is growing.  Ireland's role can be hampered in many ways by being a mass producer because of our location and the make-up of the land.  There are tremendous opportunities to go into the specialist markets and anything that can enhance the prospect of Ireland increasing her market share must be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is ensuring that minimum standards, which are already adhered to in 20 European countries, will be maintained here.  It is urgent that Ireland be a <Col N="379" /> party to that agreement in the foreseeable future.  I understand it will take a year before it will be implemented. I support the broad thrust of what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments in the Bill.  Anything that will safeguard our exports of perishable foodstuffs is to be recommended.  I have never heard of a case where Irish produce was rejected or returned because of inadequate refrigeration in the transporting vehicles. I believe the standards adopted by Irish hauliers over the years have been first rate.  Our hauliers have always been to the forefront in seeing that perishable foodstuffs are delivered in first class condition. If there are further regulations and controls necessary, as would seem to be the case, let us have them.  I do not believe the hauliers will object.  The Minister said there would not be a great deal of extra cost involved for the people concerned &mdash; hauliers, long distance lorry drivers and the owners of the equipment. In my experience the problems &mdash; if there are problems for Irish perishable goods, and by that I mean mainly meat in refrigerated form &mdash; have not been due to inferior equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of over £1,000 million worth of perishable foodstuffs being exported by our producers but I say the figure is approximately £1.2 billion &mdash; and the bulk of that produce is beef, to a lesser degree lamb and to a much lesser degree pigmeat. There is also a certain amount of butter, but beef is by far the largest item.  If there is a sharp practice in any particular area it does not relate to the condition of the Irish refrigerated trucks transporting these commodities, it is due to sleight of hand tactics adopted by some of our fellow members in the EC &mdash; countries which do not relish the thought of free and open competition.  While they may sanctimoniously preach that they do, the fact is that a number of our EC colleagues go out of their way to put impediments in the way of Irish exports.  What we must have in the EC are fair conditions of trade <Col N="380" /> and competition, and in a number of cases that is not what happens.  Some of our colleagues are not playing fair.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should name names, but it occurs to me that the countries where standards are not the highest are those which do not obey the law.  I have never heard of any difficulties getting our perishable agricultural goods, whether meat or dairy products such as butter, into Britain, Germany, Holland, Belgium or Luxembourg.  The countries with which we have difficulties are those which have a question mark over their own standards of hygiene &mdash; I refer specifically to Italy, Spain and Greece.  I ask the Minister to make sure that our produce is not prevented from entering those countries because of bogus claims of inadequate hygiene.  Our trucks conform to the highest international standards and this Bill will ensure that those standards are reinforced.</P>
    <P>We might ask why we do not sell comparable amounts of beef to Italy, Spain or Greece and those exported to Britain, Germany and some of the other countries I mentioned.  Many of our lorry drivers and haulage companies are getting a very raw deal at the customs posts on the borders of some of these countries. People can be detained not just for days but for weeks in some cases on the premise that documents are not in order or that vehicles are not adequate.  It is a disgraceful tactic and it is about time it was highlighted.  The EC should put its house in order to ensure that there is genuine free competition and free movement of goods.  No sleight-of-hand should prevent our manufacturers, processors and business people from doing trade under the terms of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>We have considerable difficulty in selling perishable goods such as beef, lamb and butter to Italy, Greece and Spain. For too long the EC Commission has been turning a blind eye to these malpractices. We are in a Community of 320 million people and we should never have any difficulty in getting rid of all the agricultural produce produced in this country. If the market was accessible we should not have any problems.  Obviously <Col N="381" /> we have a problem in regard to dairy products because we produce the commodity type products rather than on demand commodities for which there is a sale.  However, in the beef, lamb and pigmeat sectors we can sell everything we produce given that there are no restrictive practices operating at customs posts on the borders of these countries.  I want to see Irish meat being sold openly in Italy, Greece and Spain.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to ensure at the Council of Transport Ministers that our trade does not suffer because people are afraid of competition.  They are afraid that Irish meat &mdash; beef in particular &mdash; will outsell their own because the quality of our meat is higher than any in the Community and indeed in the world.  The British, Germans and Belgians, having eaten Irish meat, continually ask why they cannot buy it in their own countries. It is our prime product and there is a tremendous market for it.  We should not be virtually shut out from a market of 100 million people because some of those countries do not relish the thought of competing with Irish commodities which are of far superior quality to their own. That defeats the whole intention of the Treaty of Rome.  We are not getting a fair deal because in too many cases there is no open competition.</P>
    <P>The only problem in regard to Irish produce &mdash; luckily it has been on a small scale &mdash; has not been due to the standard of the trucks in which perishable goods are transported but to the after-effects of Chernobyl last year.  While we have had to contend with some radioactivity, which has caused slight problems particularly in regard to sheepmeat, where dairy products are concerned the problems have not been half as bad as those in the UK, for which we can be thankful. Sometimes there is not a genuine problem but certain countries for their own ends refuse Irish milk powder in the hope that they will get it at a knockdown price. Those cases generally do not occur within the EC but mainly in the Far East, the Middle East and South and Central America where people declare that the radioactive level of contamination is <Col N="382" /> higher than that accpetable by world standards.  I am convinced that Bord Bainne check all container loads of milk powder or similar products before they are exported and that there is no basis for these complaints.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister bring home to his French counterpart, the Minister for Transport, the scandalous activities by pressure groups in France who see fit to attack Irish container loads of agricultural produce, beef, lamb or pigmeat? This activity should be condemned but despite the fact that I raised this matter on numerous occasions with the Council of Agriculture Ministers this activity still takes place.  Sometimes there is a certain amount of connivance: perhaps that is too strong a word but the French authorities seem to turn a blind eye to the activities of their farmers and other groups.  There should be no question of Irish goods being attacked in this manner and lorryloads of butter being burnt.  I know that a number of drivers have been terrorised by these gangs of hoodlums who are let loose at or near ports of access, particularly in northern France. This activity is going on, year in year out, and it must be stopped because it undermines the whole principle of the Treaty of Rome.  We particularly suffer from that kind of activity and often people are loath to go back to these markets where they run the gauntlet of threats and are sometimes physically assaulted.  In extreme cases they have even seen their vehicles burnt on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should also look into the products which come back in refrigerated trucks which are referred to in the Bill.  We are exposed to a great deal of unfair competition such as, to put a cruder word on it, the dumping of fruit and vegetables by some of our EC partners.  I am quite sure that the type of dumping which takes place on a regular basis is illegal.  There may be a season where the apple crop in France or Italy is exceptionally good and where they have far more produce than they need. A cheap way to get rid of it is to put it into the trucks at a giveaway price and <Col N="383" /> to dump it on the Irish market thereby ruining the livelihood of fruit and vegetable growers in this country.  That is why there is such a problem in regard to importation of fruit and vegetables which can be produced in Ireland.  We still suffer a significant climatic disadvantage compared to some of these countries, especially in the south of France, where they can produce these commodities in vast quantities.</P>

      <P>I grow them myself as I live in the garden of Ireland.  Indeed people from County Armagh come down to see how we grow them.  However, we have our bad days too and if you get frost in May or gales in August you can have a disastrous harvest.  We cannot compete with people who have an advantageous climate.  We are probably not as vigilant as other EC members in seeing that everything is above board.  We will have to make sure that we have fair access to the markets in the countries to which I have referred.  We will have to ensure that there is not unfair dumping of fruit and vegetables into this country.  The Department of Transport and the Department of Agriculture should be extremely vigilant in ensuring that the produce coming into the country is of the proper standard.  The Government should see to it that there is not unfair trading in the form of dumping.  I fully agree with the sentiments of the Bill.  We cannot give anybody an excuse to say that the equipment we are using is not up to the highest international standards.  The Bill will reinforce that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in welcoming this Bill.  The Agreements to which this legislation refer were reached as far back as 1976 and now operate in 20 European countries including nine of the EC states. Regrettably, Ireland is one of the three EC states that has failed thus far to formally associate with the Agreement. Some of the points made by the previous <Col N="384" /> speaker are important in this regard. When there is an Agreement such as this and we do not formally adhere to it we leave ourselves open to technical barriers against our trade at boundaries and to spurious excuses against allowing the full writ of the Treaty of Rome to apply with regard to our exports.  This is an important if somewhat technical set of measures. It is very important that we, as a quality exporter of foods, should ensure that in all aspects of the exports of our foodstuffs the highest possible qualities are maintained and the highest possible international standards are seen to apply to our operations and to our exports.</P>
      <P>One interesting fact that emerges from the material that is supplied to us on this matter, and it is worth drawing some attention to, is that in the administrative arrangements that operate to date we have included some arrangements for private testing.  That is entirely worthwhile. When this legislation is passed I hope private testing will be continued and expanded.  As we all accept, this is no time for imposing additional administrative burdens on the State.  This is the first instance I have heard of where testing arrangements are made on the basis of private and State co-operation. It is a laudable precedent.</P>
      <P>The ATP was devised with the aim of increasing international trade in perishable goods and that is why the Agreement is important to us.  It is vital for Ireland because we need to be able to display that we are at the top of the market in all our operations.  It is vital that we should use this Agreement to our advantage.  We should not only ensure that all temperature controlled vehicles in use and registered in the Irish State and taking Irish goods abroad are of the highest quality but we should, as a previous speaker has mentioned, more actively police the operations of non-Irish registered vehicles within the State.  We should also police the returning vehicles with a view to ensuring that they are not used as a sealed means of dumping excess products from other countries on the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement of the law in this area is <Col N="385" /> important and therefore the legislative arrangements in this Bill are very important. Sadly, as has been said, when you try to operate on an administrative or voluntary basis, there will always be rogue operators.  It only takes one rogue operator to destroy a reputation that has been built up at great cost.  The rigours of the law being implemented in this legislation should apply to all people trading in this area.</P>
    <P>I note that the legislation and the Agreement itself do not apply to long sea journeys.  They apply to sea journeys of up to 150 kilometres and therefore to sea journeys between ourselves and our nearest and dearest neighbour.  This draws to my attention the fact that this is a particular area in transport where we are deficient.  We will soon be discussing important legislation in the House which will deal with Irish shipping in general.  It is extraordinary that we, as an island nation in the food export market, do not have a single refrigerated vessel on the Irish register.  Perhaps this legislation and the legislation which we will be discussing later today will operate as a catalyst in that regard.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is important that we recognise the value of our food industry. Deputy Deasy stated that when you visit a foreign country there is continuous reference to the quality of Irish products and to their non-availability.  I do not think the national interest is being served by our present arrangements.  It is better served by the proposals being put before us today by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will re-emphasise that it is important that Irish operators and foreign operators handling Irish goods are properly policed and that they operate, even without that policing, to the highest possible level. Full accession to the ATP and the legislative safeguards introduced in the measures before us are vital to Ireland's future.  They are vital to the expansion of our food exporting industry, an industry which has been ear-marked by Government as a sector worthy of investment, expansion and attention and an area where we all recognise that the potential for jobs and wealth creation is very great. <Col N="386" /> It is for those reasons I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a couple of aspects of the Bill which do not seem to have been highlighted so far. Deputy Deasy put his finger on an important point when he said there is a need for reciprocal emphasis in this discussion generally in relation not just to the carriage of goods out of this country but also to the importation of goods either in the same vehicles on the way back or separately. What we are talking about is perishable foodstuffs and therefore public health.  I would like the Minister to comment on a couple of matters I wish to raise.  For example, the Bill essentially provides for compliance with Europewide standards for temperature controlled equipment for transporting such merchandise.  That therefore relates to one aspect of the conditions under which food is transported.  Technology today raises equally if not more important, challenges in terms of the calibre, quality and health implications of those food-stuffs. For example, there is today a produce known as radiated perishable food&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Irradiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the use of radiation for the purposes of retaining freshness. There has long been a suspicion, for example, that some of the celery being imported into the country from Israel has been treated with radiation.  That radiation is induced into some perishable foods for the purposes of keeping their appearance fresh.  I am told it works particularly well with strawberries which, in the normal course of events, would decay in a day or two, but having been bombarded with radiation they will last, or appear to last, much longer.  That is an element of food content, nutrient and quality which seems to bear directly on the question we should be concerned about in transporting, handling and importing perishable foods generally. Perhaps the Bill or a similar Bill should deal with the question of whether that <Col N="387" /> form of radiation or irradiated food should be the subject of discussion and whether some of the goodness or nutrient in that foodstuff has been destroyed.</P>
      <P>At this time in this country there is no regulation about labelling such foodsutffs and no discrimination about whether food apparently fresh is as fresh as it appears or whether it has been artificially treated in some way.  That treatment is not just atomic bombardment.  For example, the foodstuffs are open to being treated with chemicals.  Foodstuffs produced in this country and abroad may on occasions may be treated with chemicals and the producer will say on labels that the food should not be consumed within, say, a fortnight.  It is not uncommon, depending on the weather, consumer demand on a particular day etc., for crops, lettuce, foodstuffs, perishable goods, to be sprayed or treated with chemicals, subsequently within a day or days sold openly on the market and consumed without reference to the health implications of the chemical treatment of such foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to raise unnecessary alarm but it is not generally known that we are now in the business of adding colour and chemicals to foodstuffs and bombarding them with radiation for the purpose of making them heavier and more attractive, giving them a longer shelf life and generally making them a more valuable product from the point of view of the producer or seller.  Only last night we saw to what extent the rights of some purchasers, housewives and families are being underprotected from the degree of exploitation which that market allows.  They are paying unnecessarily high prices without adequate standards of protection.  For example, we may quite rightly be closing the door on export of some foodstuffs in conditions which are not suitable but we may not be as equally concerned to insist on the higher standards applying to imported food for consumption by our population.  I would like the Minister to deal with that.  That implies that we must have an evenhanded, universal approach to insisting <Col N="388" /> on this Bill in all its aspects being enforced throughout Europe.  There have been other examples of trading arrangements whereby countries have broken the spirit of agreements by various perverse, bureaucratic, innovative devices. That might be happening here and I ask the Minister whether he is aware &mdash; I am sure he is &mdash; of the possible health risks arising from food treated in the way to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy mentioned dumping and the quality and calibre of that dumped food is an aspect of what I am talking about.  It is not just dumped; it is complemented by substantial tonnage of perishable foodstuffs which are commercially and aggressively grown, produced and sold into this country.  If the Bill is to be effective it must be policed properly.  I want the Minister to tell us who and how many such police people, in the broad sense of the word, are involved. What is the mechanism whereby that policing is to be done?</P>
    <P>The Bill in that context seems to be lacking in the area of sanctions.  I do not believe that the sanctions proposed in this Bill are effective.  They are derisory. Fines of the order of £1,000 are not at all adequate.  Not just in this area but throughout the whole area of law we must be serious about ensuring that it is seen by those to whom that law applies that crime does not pay.  That level of fine, which from the date of the passage of this Bill will decline in real terms, will undoubtedly be discounted by some people.  A fine of that nature could be lost in the petty cash account of many companies engaged in international transportation.  I do not believe that one would buy a set of tyres for one of their vehicles for that price.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about this measure then we should be serious about its implementation, and I will be seeking very severe sanctions and to index link those sanctions.  We should make it clear that the law is to be observed not because large numbers of police are hovering in every corner or officials are checking the paperwork but because it is right for people to comply.  If they do not comply <Col N="389" /> and they fall foul they should be punished severely.  Secondly, at the heart of this we are dealing with the health of people. We are dealing specifically with perishable foodstuffs which people consume. To take shortcuts in that area is pernicious and vile and should be treated as a very serious offence.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of carriage of goods it is timely for us to examine those areas where it is possible to deregulate.  In some aspects of national and international transport, deregulation is feasible, possible, practicable, economic and efficient, but not in all areas.  In protecting standards in this case, for example, it is obvious that there must be standards and they must be enforced, but there are other areas perhaps more germane to other Bills.  I ask the Minister to take a broad look at legislation in this area and consider deregulation in a number of respects.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill which refer to the limits to which the ATP does not apply I would like explained.  I do not know why the ATP does not apply to any sea journey of 150 km or more.  In Ireland, one of the smallest countries in Europe, that kind of limit would not even be the distance from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  I do not know why it is there but I am sure there is a good reason for it and I would like the Minister to explain it.  The standards that apply should be universal and I do not know why that cut-off point is specified unless it is covered by some other statute of which I am not aware.</P>
    <P>I am interested, as is Deputy Roche, in the degree to which the IIRS and a private body have been engaged in testing and certification of temperature controlled transport equipment for ATP purposes. I would be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on what the findings over a period of time were in that respect, what studies, if any, emerged from that and what conclusions were drawn so that that body of knowledge might inform the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The references to the general environment of sanction should be comparable to that in Europe.  I wonder whether we <Col N="390" /> are consistent, both in our emphasis on high quality exports and sanctions and discouragements for abuses of the law, with standards in Europe.  Obviously we do not want to make flesh of our own while others make fowl of theirs.  I want to be clear that we are dealing with this Bill in a European context as a Bill which seeks to advance high standards of transport of important perishable goods throughout Europe.  It is regrettable that we are one of the last countries in Europe to get involved in passing such a measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that commonsense and economic survival would dictate the observance of the highest possible standards at all stages from production to final destination.  I do not agree.  Unfortunately the experience is that economic survival and commonsense dictate the precise opposite. They dictate the observance of taking the shortest cut and maintaining sometimes the lowest possible standards in order to reduce costs.  People are tempted to try to sell goods which are inferior if they can get away with it.  A lot of that goes on and we all know it.  There are a number of cowboys in operation in this area and I hope the Minister will tackle that so that those abuses will be stopped.  I include in this, not just the areas of production and distribution but certain elements which are discrediting the whole haulage industry. The observance by some hauliers of the highest possible standards puts them at an economic disadvantage and that is why an appeal to commonsense and economic survival as a bulwark of progress in this area would not leave me confident.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the effective enforcement of the Bill.  Will the Minister elaborate on that?  We pass legislation and ministerial regulations regularly and it is all to some extent on a kind of a wing and a prayer and a general wish list of items that we hope will be enforced.  I am not sure that this can be enforced and I am not clear that we should employ extra people to enforce it.  The primary way of enforcing these measures is to make it clear to those who do not comply that if they break the law they will suffer <Col N="391" /> sanctions which should discourage people from getting involved in breaches in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the benefits of haulage vehicles having temperature recorders and he said that the Transport Consultative Commission's 1981 report drew attention to this, so as to monitor the temperature of foodstuffs in transit.  Experience generally, in an area like this, is that instead of consultative commissions drawing attention to these matters the Government should make up their minds as to whether these are essential, the same as in relation to the tachograph which was another element in the transport environment that was an item of discussion here for quite a while.  Certain things are essential and it is not right to simply appeal to people's sense of fair play. What will happen is that some hauliers will operate the system and others will not.  A judgment should be made as to whether thermographs are desirable or necessary or essential in the public interest.  My focus today is on the public interest and not predominantly on the interests of hauliers although that is a matter about which we are all concerned. We must ensure that foodstuffs to the highest possible standards are delivered to the tables in this country and throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I have doubts about the Bill before us in that respect, and these doubts are fuelled by research into these matters and by the discovery that it is now possible to import without monitor or control food that has been treated in a variety of ways, the safety of these ways not having been tested.  In some cases the treatment of food renders it essentially unsafe for human consumption.  I refer specifically to chemical treatment where the active ingredient in the chemical goes on for days or weeks and should not be open to human consumption.  That is my principal concern about foodstuffs appearing on Irish tables at present.  As far as this Bill gives us a chance to raise those issues I am grateful for it and would appreciate <Col N="392" /> if the Minister would deal with this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say, when replying to the House, if there have been many complaints or problems with vehicles on which we have exported food-stuffs? It is interesting that our exports of foodstuffs to the Community is worth £1,000 million and possibly more.  Is this improvement in regulations another first for Ireland as compared with our EC partners?  When one considers the problems of the haulage business here is it any wonder that they may take short cuts so as to get the product to the market as soon as possible?  This probably arises because of the internal costs here.  It is an indictment on our overall transport costs.  I know many hauliers who just cannot compete even with our friends in Northern Ireland.  One must consider that the largest beef group in the country, Goodman International, when making deals with Iran, hire a Bulgarian haulage company to transport the beef.  That is an indictment of the costs here.  I am sure this company would employ Irish hauliers if they were competitive.  It is sticking out a mile that they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my colleague about the barriers that materialise at frontiers when our products are arriving on the markets. This has not happened today or yesterday. It has been going on for years. We do not create difficulties when products are brought in from other countries. We do not stop vehicles, and check them out as we could if we wanted to slow up the import of goods.  When there is over production of potatoes for instance in other countries they are brought here and dumped on the Irish market and neither the customs officials nor Department of Agriculture officials do anything about it. Egg production here is crippled because of dumping.  Because we are the first in Europe to implement laws, we are allowing our markets to be depressed and abused.  Legislation like this should also protect our own producers.  We have had problems over the last number of years in relation to potatoes, in relation to egg production, and in relation to fruit and <Col N="393" /> vegetables although we have a Government committed to the food area &mdash; not that they look very committed now having regard to the Estimates we have just seen.  At the same time it is there and it looks as if the people producing these products will have to do that on their own as there will be very little knowledge available from any Department source.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe we are not doing enough as a Government to protect the home producers.  I am delighted that there are people in my constituency exporting potatoes at present.  Potatoes are one of the products that have been dumped on Irish ports when there was an over-supply.  It will be interesting to see how long it will be before they have problems at frontiers.</P>
    <P>Hauliers are not the main culprits. They are trying to survive.  Possibly some of them take chances, because of the costs they are trying to compete against, in order to get products there on time.  If there is evidence of products being off when they arrive at their destination it is probably because of delays at frontiers. The Minister should look at the overall position and do something positive to ensure that dumping of products does not take place.  I know it is not totally in the Minister's hands; there is another Minister involved but we must give the other hauliers some of the medicine they have been giving us.</P>
    <P>In regard to France, we know that our own farmers took it upon themselves to do something about imports and dumping and decided to dump a boat load of potatoes; they paid the price for taking the law into their own hands but we never heard what happened in connection with the farmers who burned container loads of Irish beef over the last few years.  I am not saying that that is the road to take, it is not, but the Government have the powers through the customs and the Department of Agriculture to give the Irish producer fair play.  If we are to develop the food area the Government are emphasising so much, can that be done without money behind it?  I have my own views on that and they are not <Col N="394" /> for this debate.  Will these regulations apply to the hauliers employed from outside the State to deliver beef to Iran from one of our companies in Ireland?  Will it be just a case of saying, if this beef happens to be off when it arrives, &ldquo;well that is Irish beef for you&rdquo;?  We do not want that to happen.</P>
    <P>It is important that we recognise the plight of Irish hauliers here.  I believe the majority of Irish hauliers are reputable companies trying to earn a living.  It is a tough job to keep trucks on the road. I have two neighbours who, when they return at night, spend two or three hours keeping trucks right.  That is how tough and competitive this job is.  Do the 21 countries covered by the legislation include Bulgaria, because Bulgarian hauliers haul the type of produce we are talking about from this country?  If they are not then they must be included.  I am sure the Minister will enlighten us with replies to a number of the queries that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different levels in this Bill.  First, the ideal set out by the Minister is to achieve the highest possible standards and the best possible conditions to transport goods.  There is no doubt that that is something to aim towards.  It is highly desirable that our hauliers adhere to the standards laid down in Europe.  The free movement of goods throughout the EC has been a fundamental aim of the European Community but, unfortunately, this has never been achieved.  All too often obstacles have been placed in the way of this objective and Irish hauliers have suffered as a result.  The Minister has not referred to those obstacles.  Perhaps he is hoping they will disappear.  But they will not disappear of their own volition unless determined opposition is mounted not only in this House but in the European Parliament and in the embassies throughout Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, as someone seeking to raise the standards of Irish haulage contractors, has an obligation to do the best he can.  He has set down what should be achieved.  The reality is often different. <Col N="395" /> Deputy Deasy has outlined some of the unpleasant aspects of this reality.  As former Minister for Agriculture, he is well placed to comment on this matter.  I am sure, when he was Minister, he spent many a sleepless night trying to deal with this problem.  I agree with what Deputy Deasy said about attacks on Irish goods and hauliers especially in France.  Indeed he was mild in what he said in this regard. In these situations the French, all too often want to have their loaf and eat it. They want full access to the European market for their own produce but they want to impose checks and balances on goods coming into their country from other countries.  Unfortunately we have seen too many examples of French chauvinism and jingoism in the past two decades.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred, in a mild way, to the possible connivance of the French authorities but he must be aware that the French civil service have a long Machiavellian history of this type of activity. They have a long history of being able to protect their own goods and having it both ways.  I hope that will cease.  We should ask our MEPs and our embassies in France and other European countries to oppose this type of obscurantism and chauvinism because they do not have any place in the modern European context. Our MEPs have been far too slavish and obsequious in their attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy.  They have been afraid to offend or attack some of the larger countries, notably France.  This should stop.  They should speak out clearly at the European Parliament and oppose the type of conduct I have outlined. For a variety of reasons it appears they are overawed by the larger countries. They should stand up to them and speak out clearly about the CAP and how it is being used by countries like France.</P>
    <P>We should not allow our hauliers to be treated as fools abroad.  The Minister was right to emphasise that we should aim for the highest standards and attempt to improve our position not only in regard to foreign transport but also in regard to <Col N="396" /> the production of foodstuffs.  The Minister told us he addressed Irish hauliers at their annual general meeting recently. It is good that the Minister should go to such functions but it is not good enough to breeze in, read a speech and breeze out again as usually happens.  I accept that Ministers are very busy people but they have an obligation to organise seminars and briefing sessions for people like hauliers.  It should not be a matter of simply handing a copy of the Bill to hauliers in the hope that all the problems will sort themselves out.  Briefing sessions should be held about the contents of the Bill, the conditions of transport and the problems of crossing frontiers and getting across customs barriers.  Usually our hauliers have to learn the hard way, by trial and error, but that is not good enough. We need a more professional and systematic approach to this.  The Minister and his Department should get themselves involved not in laying down the standards but in giving briefing sessions to our hauliers and co-ordinating their work.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that meat and food hauliers are very important people in our export drive.  Some Members have referred to cowboys in the haulage industry and I accept that some exist.  Some people go into that business in the hope of making a killing, like they do in other areas, but we should not allow such people to cloud our image or reputation abroad.  We should not allow them to cut corners or take chances because our national reputation is at stake.  Hauliers are in the front line of our export drive in that they transport foodstuffs abroad.  They are engaged in difficult and dangerous work and must spend many lonely hours on the road. They need our help and should be protected by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister simply to lay down standards and guidelines. He, and his Department, should be positive in getting actively involved in the whole process.  In that regard I hope to see greater co-operation between the Minister, the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="397" /> and Food and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh.  They have a great role to play and I hope that what we witnessed last week between the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State does not happen again.  Such a lack of organisation should not occur when we go abroad.  We should send the best team abroad to create the best possible image.</P>

      <P>I accept that and I do not want to be accused of introducing an acrimonious note into the debate or of being unfair but it would be remiss of me not to refer to what happened last week. I do not intend to build it up into a big deal because such things occur. However, I hope the Minister for Tourism and Transport will take note of what I said and use his good offices to co-ordinate our efforts abroad.  We all accept we are importing too many food lines.  It is a national scandal and is responsible for many of our economic problems.  I understand that in the region of £1,000 million worth of foodstuffs are imported.  In the food and food processing areas we have a whole new world to win.  There is a market available to us of 320 million people but we cannot get a toehold into it apart from selling beef and milk.  That is like throwing apples into an orchard, it cannot go on indefinitely. We must diversify and tackle that market in a different way.  To do that there must be an intelligent and co-ordinated approach and what we witnessed last week will not help in that regard. We must reverse the present pattern in regard to the import of food.  Hauliers, and the Minister, have a key role to play in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the Bill is to be welcomed and I should like to compliment the Minister on bringing it forward at a time when changes are needed in the food industry.  Many advances are taking place in it due to the advancement of technology.  The Minister said <Col N="398" /> that the Bill, and the regulations to be made under it, are not expected to give rise to extra costs for Irish hauliers or producers and it is important that that is adhered to.  At present Irish hauliers are finding it very difficult to compete on the world market.  It is not their fault that they cannot compete because hauliers in other countries get oil and spare parts cheaper.  Foreign hauliers can quote prices that are far below those submitted by Irish people.  We have all seen hauliers from Northern Ireland operating down here and anybody who pays a visit to Rosslare will notice that many Bulgarian hauliers operate through that port.  In fact, last year Members from the area made representations to the Minister to do something about that.  We also approached Deputy Wilson who was then in Opposition and were pleased that some action was taken.  What happens is very unfair to our hauliers.</P>
      <P>Last week it was brought to my attention that the contract for transporting intervention food from the country was given to a German firm and that that concern in turn asked Irish hauliers to quote for the work.  Irish hauliers should be given the contract and the middlemen eliminated.  I appeal to the Minister to investigate this because in most cases Irish hauliers do not get the contracts. They are asked to quote by foreign firms but because of the heavy costs they must bear they are not in a position to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the action taken in France and other countries in regard to imports.  I accept that a lot of unfair dealing goes on, particularly in France, and that others are not penalised for it.  It is too easy to import goods and I suggest that we should make it more difficult to bring items through our ports. I do not know how France and other countries seem always to get away with it and not be taken to task on the European stage but Irish companies and particularly Irish drivers are being attacked in a very high handed fashion.  That is not acceptable to us as public representatives and it should not be acceptable to our Minister. <Col N="399" /> The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with the other Ministers, should bring this matter to the attention of the EC to ensure that there is more protection and that our drivers do not have to suffer, from time to time, from such cowardly attacks of the lowest form, particularly in France.</P>
    <P>In every game there are rogues but generally the majority of our hauliers are of exceptionally high standard.  The road haul is inclined to bring down general standards, but this should not be allowed to happen.  We have top class hauliers and the only difficulties are caused in the area of cost competitiveness and cheaper quotations from other countries.  Our hauliers cannot compete and find it difficult to make sufficient money to keep their trucks up to the maximum standards required.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that he has received complaints about the awful condition of Irish perishable foodstuffs on arrival on export markets.  Is that always the fault of the hauliers?  Are the goods in good condition when they leave the factory?  Drivers engaged in trucking will get to the destination point as quickly as possible because they are usually paid on the basis of the more runs, the more money.  They would not hang about before taking on a load.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of regulations attached to it and I wonder about its implementation and enforcement.  The fines of £1,000 are small.  Will it be like some other legislation on the Statute Book which is never implemented?  I hope the Minister will ensure that every help and support is given to the hauliers and that a reasonable length of time will be granted for them to comply with maximum standards.  He must also ensure that they get a fair chance to quote, particularly in the area of intervention foodstuffs.  It seems that they are being kept on the outside, with companies from other EC countries being given priority.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage discussion for the ideas put before the House.  I shall try to deal with some of the points raised.  Deputy Cullen started by emphasising how important standards are and most of the contributors laid particular stress on that, that we should have the highest possible standards, enforce those standards and consequently, as the Deputy indicated, there would be great prospects, which there are, for our food export business.</P>
      <P>I was grateful for Deputy Deasy's expression of support and his welcoming the fact that there will be no great extra cost.  This point was also made by Deputy Browne a few moments ago.  There will be no great extra cost imposed on the hauliers who, as is generally agreed, have, as of now, many difficulties with which to cope in a highly competitive business.  They have extra charges for their trucks while other countries support by way of subsidy the activities in the haulage business.  Consequently, we must be very careful not to damage our hauliers' competitiveness still further by extra costs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy indicated that in his experience it was not the equipment that was to blame but the lack of commitment to a free market in the EC, that some countries actually put every obstacle in the way of our exporters.  He mentioned beef, lamb and pigmeat; the other important area of export covered here is that of fish, although hauliers in that area do not meet with the same kind of trouble as the others.  It is a very important export to the Continent, particularly to France and it is covered also by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in the Treaty of Rome, an instrument which should be enforced and if literally enforced it should make a free market available to our exporters.  There is in some cases &mdash; Deputy Deasy mentioned Italy, Spain and Greece &mdash; a system, it is true, of inhibiting, and I shall not use a stronger word than that, our exports to those countries.  The heart of the matter was expressed by Deputy Deasy when he said that at times bogus <Col N="401" /> claims of inadequate hygiene in our exporting vehicles are used to try to prevent goods from coming into various countries.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to set standards so that no such bogus claims can get any credibility whatsoever. In answer to questions raised by some other Deputies, notably Deputy Farrelly, we have not had many complaints from hauliers.  There is an <i>ad hoc</i> system in operation as of now.  The urgency of what we are doing now is to make sure of legislative support for people if such bogus claims are being made by importing countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly wanted to know if there were any complaints about the quality of the perishable goods delivered, rather than complaints about hauliers with regard to delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>He made both points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were considerable complaints about delays.  I have yet to hear complaints about the quality of our goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I took down the words that the Deputy used, which were &ldquo;bogus claims of inadequate hygiene&rdquo;. This Bill will remove any possibility of that being used as an excuse to inhibit our hauliers, our exporters.  It should cut the ground from under any such bogus complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also referred to the unfortunate accident at Chernobyl.  We were, I suppose, extremely lucky, although there were some complaints about lamb and venison at one stage but the becquerel count was at a weight which indicated that there was no need for panic.  Some countries did use this as an excuse for trying to refuse meat exports from this country.  Much of the debate was not absolutely relevant to the Bill before the House but I would back up those people who complain about the activities of pressure groups in various countries in Europe who attack our hauliers and exporters.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Foreign Affairs and Tourism and Transport should and <Col N="402" /> will &mdash; speaking for myself and I think I can safely speak for other Ministers &mdash; make their voices heard at Council meetings and indicate that we will not as full members of the EC tolerate any interference from citizens of another country with our people.</P>
    <P>Backloads were referred to.  We are entitled to examine these.  Incidentally, the Bill does not cover fruit and vegetables. We would also need to watch out for dumping but it is not a matter which is specific either to this Bill or to my Ministry.  As I have said, we do not have the power to inspect either on the way out or on the way in.  Deputy Roche referred to the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo; in his remarks.  That is a most important word in relation to our food exports.  Again, this Bill is designed to ensure quality.  We could establish in this country a cachet for the quality of our food.  Various Governments and Ministers have geared themselves to seeing to it that our natural food is not interfered with through the use of various chemicals to promote growth and so on.  All over the world at present there is a big movement to return to natural and organically grown foods etc.  Deputy Keating talked at length about this.  In the context of Deputy Roche's comments on quality, we should be alert to the possibility of getting a special name for quality and pure foods on the European market and for that matter on the world market.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the question of enforcement later as it was raised by a number of Deputies.  As Deputy Roche said, one rogue operator in a particular area can destroy a reputation which had been built up in terms of the delivery and quality of food.  In the past the availability of Irish foods specifically known as such was very poor.  I recall that while working in London years ago Irish beef for sale there was never branded as being Irish but as &ldquo;prime Scotch&rdquo;.  Even so you knew perfectly well that what you were buying was prime Irish beef.  This is an area where we have to push ahead.  What we are trying to do is to put a Bill on the Statute Book which will guarantee that food <Col N="403" /> which is exported will not suffer any deterioration in quality.</P>
    <P>In a lengthy contribution Deputy Keating, and I want to point out to him that this Bill does not cover fruit and vegetables, talked about various other matters which are not relevant either to this Bill or this Ministry.  Nonetheless, they are important.  He referred to irradiated food, to various colouration and to the treatment of food to make it look good. The Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Health have important roles to play in this regard and I am sure that imports are being monitored by the various agencies that have an obligation to do so.  I have already made reference to the increasing popularity of natural and organically grown foods.  Health food devotees now prefer to see an apple with a flaw because that would indicate that it had not been treated with chemicals and they could be sure that they would not suffer any damage to their health if they ate it. There is a great movement towards organically grown foods which have, in so far as is humanly possible, avoided contamination by chemicals.</P>
    <P>I take the point which was made by Deputy Deasy that the dumping of food along with the dumping of manufactured goods have caused problems and job losses in this country.  The powers of inspection being taken in this Bill do not relate to the quantitative importations. They relate to a different Ministry but the inspectorate of the Department of Tourism and Transport will be in a position to call the attention of other Departments to this problem wherever it is occurring.  It has to be tackled on a wider level.  When in office previously I found it was very difficult to prove dumping. One needed to get information about the country of origin and the cost on the market there, along with information on transportation costs.  It was very difficult to make any case stick.</P>
    <P>We consider that the sanctions in the Bill will prove adequate.  A number of speakers thought that they are not adequate.  I have not heard any argument <Col N="404" /> which would indicate that the sanctions will not prove adequate.  Someone made little of a fine of £1,000.  I think that that is a substantial fine.  I do not see anyone pushing £1,000 through my letter box.  It is a substantial fine when you consider that we do not have large haulage companies. Many of the companies operating in my own area are very small but they are very effective and work very hard, as Deputy Farrelly has said.  The Departments of Health, Agriculture and Food, and Tourism and Transport are involved in many of the areas raised by Deputy Keating.</P>
    <P>As a number of Deputies referred to enforcement I shall refer to it, too.  The detailed arrangements for enforcing the Bill have yet to be decided.  The intention is to avail in so far as possible of the existing inspection arrangements in relation to foodstuffs and compliance with transport law.  The Department of Tourism and Transport will be liaising with the other enforcement agencies with that in mind.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the appointment of inspectors to enforce the provisions of the Bill.  The section enables inspectors to be appointed by the Minister for Tourism and Transport, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for the Marine and by any of the eight health boards, with the consent of the Minister for Health, each of whom has already appointed suitably qualified persons for inspection work in relation to foodstuffs, as the House well knows.  My own Department have appointed transport inspectors.  This arose out of the Road Transport Act, 1986, which was very thoroughly debated.  Incidentally I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy J. Mitchell, who had done a great deal of work on this Bill while in office. As the House will have noted the Bill makes no specific reference to the Garda, but, because of their powers, they are also available in the enforcement area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly started by asking whether we were unique.  Deputy Deasy thought I was not addressing myself to what Deputy Farrelly said.  I should say that all the EC countries have already <Col N="405" /> adopted the ATP except Ireland, Greece and Portugal.  There are indications now that both Greece and Portugal are moving in the direction of legislating in this area.  I agree with what Deputy Farrelly said, that there are special problems for our hauliers.  I have already referred to them.  Deputy Browne also mentioned the fact that people were being asked to quote overall for the carriage of intervention beef, then coming back, no doubt knocking off a bit of the profit, hoping that Irish hauliers would do the work for them.  I could not agree more with Deputy Browne in that there should be first access for our hauliers to carry what intervention beef leaves the country, that they should not be brought in as a type of subcontractor.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Farrelly in his having doubts about our commitment to develop the food industry.  I do not know why, even at this early stage, he has developed that scepticism.  I want to assure the House that there is 100 per cent commitment on the part of the Government to develop that area because of its great potential.  As several Deputies said, we have the finest raw material &mdash; I am not being chauvinistic about that, it simply is a fact.  We have our strengths and many weaknesses, but that is one of our strengths, provided we look after it, preserve it and provided we do not allow the quality of our food or the environment in which it is grown to deteriorate.  Deputy Farrelly asked if the ATP applied to the United Kingdom? The answer is yes.  I should say that Bulgaria also adheres to the ATP.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy agreed with other Deputies that it was important to emphasise the highest possible standards.  He referred to the EC obstacles.  The obstacles put up by pressure groups and so on certainly are to be fought and obliterated on the basis I have mentioned already, that the Treaty of Rome is there, that we are a full member with full rights.  No citizen of any other country &mdash; under that treaty &mdash; has a right to interfere with our access in so far as the Common Market has been developed.  It is hoped that by 1992 it will have been fully developed. <Col N="406" /> All members of every Government would have been at one in that, a commitment to ensure that that is adhered to.  I do not think, as Deputy Kemmy said, that anything will disappear of its own accord.  In answering points raised by Deputy Deasy I have said that what I want to do under the provisions of this Bill is to cut the ground from under anybody who is using bogus arguments about the quality of our food, how it is handled or transported.</P>
    <P>Rather indelicately Deputy Kemmy mentioned bun-fights because I quoted something I said at a hauliers' dinner.  I do not confine myself to that kind of infantile fare.</P>

I am sure Deputy Kemmy knows already but I will inform him that, acting as agents for the Department of Tourism and Transport, the regional technical colleges provide adequate, full and high quality courses for our hauliers dealing with both national and international legislation. Those courses are a great success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I develop and deploy a deafness which suits on occasion.  Deputy Browne, who has had experience in the haulage field and who is a valued member of my parliamentary party subcommittee on transport, indicated that Irish hauliers encounter serious competitive cost problems particularly with regard to the North of Ireland.  He instanced Bulgaria as well. He also welcomed my assurance that the provisions of this Bill would not impose <Col N="407" /> any extra prohibitive costs on our hauliers. As the Deputy represents Wexford, he is aware of the problems hauliers encounter at times in the competitive field and on the Continent.  I want to assure the House that the Department of Tourism and Transport, in concert with other relevant Departments, will keep an eye on that at the various Council of Ministers' meetings and will be very glad to hear of even the slightest infringement of regulations or the slightest interference with their freedom.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly, Deputy Browne thought that the fines to be imposed for infringement are too small.  I do not.  I am still not convinced of the argument that the fines incorporated in the Bill are too small.  However, I will examine any proposals emanating from Members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point being made was that the fines range from £100 only to £1,000.  If they were all to be enforced at the upper end of the scale that would be fair enough.  The danger is that they will be enforced at the lower end of the scale, which would be a serious problem, for instance, if the fine to be imposed were to be £100 only each time. I think that was the point being made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right.  The Bill is very confined in its range.  Other legislation will have to cover that problem, particularly the pretence that documentation is not in order or that there is something wrong with the cargo, the way it has been handled or refrigerated.  It is very difficult to solve this problem but it must be dealt with at international level.  There is no other way.  If somebody arrives with a load at Le Harve, Cherbourg or Dieppe and this kind of thing happens, it can only be dealt with at Government-to-Government level.  It should be dealt with and cleared up at Council of Ministers level since we belong to the Community.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply that nine of the twelve member states had ratified this legislation and that, other than ourselves, the two remaining countries were Greece and Portugal.  It is my experience that countries like these two seek derogations from any legislation or regulations which do not suit them and I am very suspicious that these two countries might look for derogations.  As a result of that, we might find access to their markets virtually impossible.  I have repeatedly seen the Greeks refuse to take goods from other countries, saying that they could not face up to the competition since they had a special problem.  This undermines the whole concept of the European Community. I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Parliaments in Greece <Col N="410" /> and Portugal pass the necessary legislation within a matter of months.  One-third of the markets of the European Community are virtually closed to Irish produce because of malpractice.  I would not like to see the Greeks, the Portuguese, or anybody else getting away with these tactics.</P>

The <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements were working well and we now want to put statutory feet, so to speak, under those arrangements.  The indications are that Greece and Portugal are moving towards adherence to the ATP in the same way as we are moving in this House.</P>
      <P>We have had some notable success in the food area in Greece, for example, due to co-operation &mdash; which should be encouraged on all fronts &mdash; between the dairy science faculty in UCC and one of the co-operative societies.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a statutory basis for a scheme of investment for ships.  The Bill will enable grants of up to 25 per cent to be paid to Irish shipowners in respect of approved capital expenditure incurred in the purchase of new ships or secondhand ships which are not more than seven years old.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements established in 1985 to undertake a review of the country's strategic shipping needs in its report concluded that there was an overwhelming case on strategic grounds for the provision of incentives for the maintenance and development of the Irish fleet.  The committee recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that the appropriate Departments of State consider what measures could be taken to provide an effective stimulus to existing Irish shipowners and attract new investors to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A package of incentives, which included the grants scheme now being <Col N="415" /> recommeded for the approval of the House, designed to maintain and develop the shipping industry for both economic and strategic reasons was announced. Other fiscal incentives which formed part of the package were introduced under the 1987 Finance Act.  These reduce the level of corporation tax payable by shipping companies and allow such enterprises access to the business expansion scheme. While I do not propose to discuss these fiscal incentives which were dealt with in the Finance Act, they should be seen, in conjunction with the Bill now before us, as part of an overall policy of support and incentives for the Irish merchant shipping industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to provide a stimulus to Irish shipowners to acquire additional tonnage in the face of a world wide recession and highly competitive conditions in the shipping industry.  There is a need to examine how Irish owned ships can be helped to secure the highest possible proportion of the country's sea trade.  Despite efforts in the past to increase the share of our trade carried in Irish ships, the proportion is still less than 20 per cent of total trade.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years we have seen a reduction in both the EC and OECD share of the world fleet.  The policy of OECD member countries (which include the EC member states) in the field of shipping is based on the principle of free circulation of shipping in conditions of fair competition.  In general, the situation is that international shipping in the developed world is carried out on a fully commercial and, indeed, extremely competitive basis.  However, there are some countries which through unilateral regulations or bilateral agreements have excluded either wholly or partially the shipping of third countries from their trades.</P>
    <P>Irish Governments have promoted a policy of full commercial freedom of shipping on the basis that, as a maritime country, it best serves overall Irish economic interests.  If positive steps are not taken now to support the Irish shipping industry there is a danger that ships on <Col N="416" /> the Irish register will move away from the Irish flag to more accomodating administrations. This would have serious strategic and economic consequences for the Irish owned merchant shipping fleet. There is currently available very cheaply on the world market a considerable number of good quality secondhand ships in the five to seven year range.  The provision of grants for secondhand ships will enable Irish shipowners to avail of the opportunity to acquire additional, good quality tonnage at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>There are a number of restrictions attaching to the grants scheme now proposed. Grants may only be payable to individuals who are both citizens of and resident in the State, or, to bodies corporate which are both incorporated in and resident in the State or to partnerships whose members are qualifying individuals or bodies corporate.</P>
    <P>Grants may only be payable in respect of ships which are registered in the State and which are in excess of 1,000 tons deadweight and are self-propelled. Grants will not be provided in respect of fishing vessels, tugs, dredgers or offshore supply vessels because the scheme is aimed solely at the merchant shipping industry.  In addition, the grant-aiding of the same vessel more than once is prohibited.</P>
    <P>Additional conditions may be imposed with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance so as to ensure that grant-aided vessels are employed in the business of the applicant and will continue to be of practical benefit to the economy as part of the national fleet.  The Bill also provides for the repayment, in part or in full, of the grant should the vessel cease, within a specified time, through loss, transfer or other disposal, to fulfil the purposes which rendered it eligible for aid.  Further provisions empower authorised persons to enter and inspect ships or premises in connection with the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provisions in respect of offences and penalties for contravention of the Act.  Such contraventions include the giving of false information, failure to comply with the <Col N="417" /> conditions and fraudulent application for grants.</P>
    <P>The scheme will have restrospective effect to 1 April 1987.  Following the announcement of the decision in principle to introduce the scheme early this year certain Irish shipowners undertook investment in anticipation of early implementation of the scheme.  In giving this legislation retrospective effect to 1 April 1987, eligible ships purchased since then may qualify for grants under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme, subject to an aggregate amount of £7.5 million will depend on the responses received from the shipowners.  However, there is every indication that the industry will not be slow to avail of the opportunities which the scheme affords &mdash; a number of shipowners have already expressed interest in the scheme.  It is anticipated that approximately £500,000 will be provided in grant aid during 1987.  Subject to budgetary constraints it is expected that at least £1.03 million will be available in the first full year of the scheme's operation in 1988.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's hope that the scheme will prove to be a much needed boost for the Irish shipping industry. Additional tonnage will also improve the employment prospects of Irish crews and will help to ensure that the State will continue to have at its disposal personnel with the vital seafaring skills and expertise which has, for so long, characterised our merchant fleet.</P>
    <P>This country is heavily dependent on its rising level of exports and upon the import of vital raw materials for its industry. Our economic prosperity depends largely upon the shipping services available to us.  It makes sense, therefore, that as much of our trade as possible should be carried in Irish owned ships.  The grant scheme for which this Bill provides a statutory basis, together with the fiscal incentives mentioned earlier, will make a significant contribution to the achievement of this objective.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is <Col N="418" /> to provide a grant scheme to maintain and develop the Irish merchant shipping fleet for obvious strategic and economic reasons, particularly necessary in the tragic demise of Irish Shipping.  The one positive development of the tragic liquidation was that it stimulated a long awaited and much needed review of shipping policy.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, as Minister for Communications, immediately set up a committee on strategic shipping requirements, to which the Minister referred, to investigate and report on the current and future strategic shipping needs of this country.  The Bill before us, together with the inclusion in the Finance Act, 1987, of the reduction in corporation profit tax on shipping profits to 10 per cent and the consequent qualification for the business expansion scheme, is a direct result of the proposals of that committee whose conclusions and recommendations were included in Deputy Mitchell's Green Paper on Transport Policy.</P>
      <P>In peace time it is sometimes difficult to realise the importance of a strategic fleet, particularly for essential supplies. However, on the economic front, when we remind ourselves that over 90 per cent of our merchandise trade is carried by sea and 80 per cent of this by foreign shipowners, the argument for a competitive shipping industry is very obvious. There have been major difficulties in the shipping industry worldwide in recent years.  An excess of supply over demand resulted in low freight rates with the consequent litany of losses by shipowners, bankruptcies and ships being laid up; still today there is a global surplus of capacity even though the European Community's share of world tonnage continues to decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other member states like ourselves are reviewing their policies with the long term view of a Community maritime policy.  I particularly pay tribute to our own small private shipping sector which has shown great resilience in the face of the worldwide depression.  However, recent lower profitability has threatened the industry's very survival and has prevented expansion.  I am, therefore, <Col N="419" /> delighted to welcome this Bill which, subject to certain conditions, will allow grant aid of up to 25 per cent for the purchase of new or secondhand ships by Irish shipowners which is retrospective to 1 April last.  The good news is that there are at least five vessels awaiting the passage of this legislation to obtain the benefits and I sincerely hope that the list will grow rapidly.</P>
    <P>I note, however, that while £1.5 million was provided in this year's Estimates for grants under this legislation, the recently published Estimates for next year show a reduction to just over £1 million.  I am dismayed by this and I hope that the Minister will respond, as I noticed from his speech that the £1.5 million is now down to £500,000 for grants this year. Perhaps the Minister has done his homework and that £500,000 will suffice but I would like assurances from him that any ships which qualify for grants in 1987 under this legislation will get them up to the limit of the £1.5 million made available this year for the package.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of the Bill to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  He mentioned the Finance Act, 1987, and his wish not to develop discussion on it.  I appreciate that but I would like to draw his attention to the cross-reference from the Finance Act, 1987, to this Bill.  They are connected by a particular reference.  Section 8 (a) of the Finance Act, 1987 deals with the qualification of shipping for the business expansion scheme now that it is considered a designated industry qualifying for 20 per cent corporation tax.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions for such qualification according to this section is that it shall include a certificate by the Minister for the Marine certifying that the purchase of the ship was, is or would be eligible to be grant-aided under a statutory scheme of assistance for the purchase of ships administered by the Department of the Marine.  This Bill, effectively, is such a statutory scheme.  In other words, to be eligible for inclusion in the business expansion scheme that was developed in the Finance Act, the <Col N="420" /> ship had to be eligible for a grant under the Shipping Investment Grants Bill which is before us today.</P>
    <P>To be eligible for a grant under the terms of this Bill a ship has to be less than seven years old at the date of purchase, according to section 3 (2) (d).  While I do not see any problems arising with the seven year limit on secondhand vessels for the purpose of grant aiding under this Bill, I believe that a seven-year age limit for the purpose of the business expansion scheme is not in the interests of the industry. The main reason for this is that excellent secondhand boats, often up to 12 years old, are bought from, for example, the Dutch and the Germans.  Their ships do not come on the market until they are at least eight years old, in order to comply with grant conditions in their respective countries.  After the eight years are up excellent value is often available to our ship owners when purchasing these secondhand vessels.  The Minister referred to the excellent value to be had in relation to secondhand vessels between five and seven years of age and their might be some limits in this area but in the main our markets for secondhand vessels are the Dutch and German markets and these countries are constrained from selling ships until they are at least eight years old; otherwise they will not qualify for their grants for new vessels.</P>
    <P>I am not quibbling with the condition in the Bill before us.  Perhaps we can resolve this matter under other legislation and perhaps the Minister will advise me on that matter.  It is the cross-reference between the Finance Act, 1987, and this legislation that causes me some concern, as under the business expansion scheme it is far too limiting to keep the ceiling at seven years; it should be upwards of 12 years.  Perhaps we will decide on that top limit on another day but certainly seven years is much too restricting considering that these boats do not come on the market in most instances until they are over eight years old.  I would like to be advised by the Minister as to whether this matter would be best resolved under this Bill or next year's Finance Bill.  I suspect the best time to do it would be under next <Col N="421" /> year's Finance Bill.  Perhaps the Minister could bring it to the attention of the Minister for Finance as the shipping industry which we are trying to help today is his responsibility.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to draw to the Minister's attention, and perhaps he will be good enough to accept an amendment on it from me on Committee Stage or Report Stage, is in relation to section 6(2) which refers to the inclusion of loss of a ship.  The Minister referred to this in his speech.  He stated: &ldquo;The Bill also provides for the repayment, in part or in full, of the grant should the vessel cease, within a specified time, through loss, transfer or other disposal, to fulfil the purposes which rendered it eligible for aid.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister not to treat the loss of a ship or a vessel in the same way as the transfer or the disposal of a vessel.  In the case of a loss through natural causes, or whatever the definitions of loss are in the insurance business, roll-over time should be allowed.  Once the ship owner gets the insurance money for the loss of the vessel he should be allowed to re-invest that money within, say, a maximum of one year without the claw-back or the repayment of the grant.  We should treat the loss of a ship quite differently from the transfer or other disposal of one.  I will be circulating an amendment on Committee Stage or Report Stage in that regard and I ask the Minister to give it consideration as it is a very reasonable request and one which the industry feels is essential to make this most important legislation as effective as we intend it to be.</P>
    <P>I would like, in paying tribute to the Minister for bringing this Bill before us, also to pay tribute, and I am sure the Minister will join me in doing so, to his predecessor, Deputy Jim Mitchell, for the enormous amount of work he had done in relation to the shipping industry, particularly following up on the reports of the committee to which the Minister and I referred.  I look forward to the Minister's response, particularly on the two aspects which I brought to his attention, and I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Any measure which would encourage investment in Irish shipping is to be welcomed.  Deputy Doyle has referred to the demise of Irish Shipping Limited which is sadly still lingering on. The workforce are still left in a limbo.  I urge the Minister, in the context of the development of Irish shipping, to consider this matter.  It is not helping the situation in the country at the moment.  These workers deserve more attention from the Government than they have got to date and I ask the Minister to give them that attention.</P>
      <P>As the Minister identified in his speech, the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements, set up in 1985, considered the whole area of Irish shipping and quite rightly identified that it was necessary to provide incentives to develop Irish shipping in a cohesive manner and this Bill is the first step in that direction.  The Minister said in his speech that other measures on paper have been taken to support these projects.  He mentioned the business expansion scheme which was referred to in the Finance Act earlier this year.  Have any projects been approved under the business expansion scheme to date and, if so, what are they?  How many proposals has the Minister approved and does he believe that the business expansion scheme will be of great benefit in this area, as I think it should be?  I would like to know if the scheme is working.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there is a package of incentives and he referred to some of them.  I get the impression from his speech that there are others which he has not mentioned and I would like to ask him what they are.  The Minister said that only 20 per cent of the overall shipping trade in this country is handled by Irish Shipping.  This is extremely sad.  One of the main reasons for this is that there has been a total lack of proper planning in this area.</P>
      <P>This leads me to the area of planning for harbours.  We seem to operate under a system where each area is looked at in its own right without any proper co-ordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major industry cannot grow in any country when there is lack of consultation <Col N="423" /> and co-ordination, and this is no more evident than in the whole area of harbours and their utilisation at present.  As the Minister is aware, the port of Waterford has been closed for the last seven years.  This situation should no longer be allowed to continue.  It is my sad belief that there is vested interest in ensuring that this port remains closed.  It is wrong for people to blame just a few workers over a dispute which took place some years ago.  This problem has been allowed to fester because of the lack of a proper harbour authority in this country.  It is my contention that no one individual or group of individuals should be allowed to stagnate what is a national asset which belongs to the people.  This brings me back to the overall planning of Irish shipping which is not being undertaken in the right way.  I urge the Minister to consider this matter and to see what other Departments are directly affecting his ability to ensure that an efficient shipping fleet operates from this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite rightly identified this country as a maritime country.  It is a positive step that provision is made in this Bill for the grant-aiding of the purchase of secondhand ships.  I am not quite sure about what Deputy Doyle said in connection with the eight-year period in other countries.  It is my understanding that on the world market at present there is a surplus of shipping available.  Perhaps the Minister is trying to ensure that an Irish fleet is kept healthy and young and that is important.  If we are to undertake a serious programme of developing our fleet I do not want to see us purchasing ships that would be regarded as clapped out by the rest of the world and I presume that this mechanism is to ensure that that does not happen.  I would like the Minister in his reply to tell me that there is evidence that a sufficient number of ships are available on the market at the moment to meet the requirements of Irish shipping at this time.</P>

      <P>The Government has received the report presented by the working group on Irish language television broadcasting. The conclusions contained in the report will be fully considered by the Government in the light of any observations received from RTE or any other interested parties.</P>
      <P>That is not long fingering it.  We envisage about two to three months for receipt of responses to the report, so nothing is ruled out at this stage and nothing is included pending observations of RTE and other interested groups.

Will the Minister agree that at this stage of their development after 25 years in existence it is unlikely that RTE will ever be in a position to put on any more Irish language programmes than they have been doing up to this and that, therefore, a radical change is essential?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a point of view and the Deputy is more than entitled to that. There is another point of view that the establishment of a separate service would be inappropriate because of the danger of &ldquo;ghettoising&rdquo; the language itself and that maybe it would be preferable that RTE would put on more Irish language programmes rather than a separate service. They are matters to be decided.  It is only a point of view at this stage.  I would welcome any views the Deputy might have on this, and the views of other interested groups, if he would forward them to the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>

Finally, will the Minister take into consideration in examining this report the fact that a number of highly efficient professional people in the Gaeltacht areas already put on sample programmes for a period of 18 hours, and will he look at the costs and the possibilities that exist in that area when examining the report?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the statutory regulations governing cable television systems, a <Col N="428" /> cable operator may not increase his charges without the prior consent of the Minister. It will be a matter for cable television companies who propose to offer satellite or other additional services on a continuing basis following the end of the experimental period to put their proposals &mdash; including their charging arrangements &mdash; to me and these will be considered on their merits.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to prejudge any proposals that may be put forward, I have already put on the record of this House my preference that any additional charges that might be proposed should be levied on the basis that only those who wish to receive the additional services will be required to pay.  That is recorded in the Official Report of 27 May 1987, Volume 372, columns 2882 and 2883.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being examined. Opt out/opt in or a variation of it would allow that some of the cable companies might as part of their normal service provide a number of satellite stations free as an additional part of their service to their customers and then for specialised services, such as film, art or other programmes, have a charge basis for an <Col N="429" /> individual opting in if desired.

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 8 together.  The Government, as part of their on-going review of public expenditure, decided to disband the two councils with effect from 4 July, 1987.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some cable television companies have relayed the service in question as part of the current experiment in the relay of satellite services generally.  Under the terms of that experiment, as announced by my predecessor in October 1986, the selection and mix of satellite services to be relayed was left to cable operators themselves, the objective being to enable cable operators to demonstrate the range of services available and to assess audience reaction and demand.</P>
      <P>In the context of establishing a permanent regime for the delivery of satellite services, it will be a matter for cable operators in the first instance to put forward proposals relating to the services they propose to relay on a continuing basis.  These proposals &mdash; including the question of whether they intend to include the Worldnet service among the additional service to be offered &mdash; will be considered on their merits, and I do not wish to prejudge the outcome at this stage.</P>

      <P>Since this service itself is not available for transmission in America where it is banned because of its content, and in view of the great public <Col N="438" /> disquiet that has been expressed because of its close links with the propaganda arm of the CIA, surely the Minister reserves to himself the authority to intervene or make his views known to the cable services?

      <P>I do not accept as being general the concern that Deputy McCartan speaks about.  This concern has been coming from specific sources.  I have made inquiries and I am informed that the allegations that the service has close links with the CIA are unfounded.  The USIA is funded by means of an appropriation voted by Congress of the US separate altogether from the CIA.  On the question of what services should or should not be permitted, the general principle should be that we should not object to any specific service unless there is clear evidence that it could undermine public order or morality.  There is no question that Worldnet is doing that.  As to whether it will be there long term, that is to be decided and I do not want to get into too much detail at this stage.</P>

The Nuclear Energy Board was established at a time when the State was considering construction of a nuclear power station at Carnsore and it was considered that the board would carry out a licensing and controlling role in relation to the design, construction, commission, operation and de-commissioning of any nuclear power station in Ireland.  The Government, and various Governments, have decided in the last couple of years that the nuclear road is not one we want to follow for electricity generation.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18, 27, 44 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The reason for revising our offshore licensing terms was that I was gravely concerned about exploration prospects. Given the continuing low price of crude oil, recent disappointing drilling results and the small number of commitment wells in the next few years, radical action was called for.  Our existing licensing terms were unattractive to the exploration industry and there was the distinct possibility that our drilling programme would dwindle away to nothing over the next few years, unless we made the changes which I have announced.</P>
      <P>I decided to abolish royalties because such a measure was essential in order to make our terms competitive with the best currently available in Europe &mdash; that is, in the UK and Spain both of which have abolished royalties in recent years.  Even the Norwegians, who traditionally apply the severest terms of all have also abolished royalties.  That left us with no option but to follow suit if we were to remain competitive.  One must bear in mind that these other countries, unlike Ireland, are oil producers so that expenditure on exploration can be set off against tax liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While as a method of taxing developments, royalties may be attractive to the State, I am convinced that if royalties <Col N="444" /> were not abolished, drilling would quickly come to an end with little hope of a discovery being made, and the collection of royalty and any other form of income from a development would become academic.  I believe that the Irish people would prefer to have the prospect of an income from developments through the corporation tax system than to have no developments at all.</P>
    <P>The yield from any particular commercial field that may be discovered will, as under any fiscal regime, vary considerably depending on the circumstances of that field.  Before announcing the new terms, I had my Department carry out an analysis involving a wide range of scenarios to measure the effect on different fields at different price levels.  Without going into these in detail, the results were that in broad terms the State take, for most sample fields, would be about 50 per cent before taking into account the allowances which individual companies can claim for exploration expenditures. The actual amount realised by the State in an individual case will depend heavily on such factors as world oil prices, the capital cost of developing the field, and the tax allowances available to the companies, both in terms of development costs and previous exploration costs.</P>
    <P>While certain oil companies were informed of the new oil concessions shortly before the announcement on 30 September, I want to make it clear that there was no negotiation as to the content of these terms or as to what the companies would wish to see embodied in the terms by myself or by my officials acting on my behalf.  This was in contrast with the procedure adopted in connection with the adjustments to licensing terms published in 1986 and the clarification announcement in 1985.  In 1985 detailed discussions were held with a particular company before the clarification formula was finalised and the final form of the clarification took account of suggestions made by that company.  In 1986 detailed discussions with certain companies took place in London regarding the contents <Col N="445" /> of the proposed measures, and their reactions were taken into account in finalising these proposals.</P>
    <P>With reference to the level of exploration which I would consider satisfactory, my intention in announcing the new terms was to encourage the drilling of sufficient wells in the Irish offshore to ensure that if there are commercial quantities of oil or gas out there, they are found as quickly as possible.  However, one cannot command dramatic results instantly.  Prior to the announcement, I was faced with a situation where deferment of the two obligation wells listed for 1987 was being sought on technical grounds and where there were only two firm drilling commitments for the next five years; one for 1988 and one for 1991.</P>
    <P>There can be no guarantee that the revision will immediately produce a dramatic increase in drilling activity but, since the announcement of the new terms, in company with senior officials of my Department, I have been meeting on a systematic basis the companies with existing interests here and also, I am glad to be able to inform the House, that the terms have prompted interest on the part of potential new operators.  I will be meeting these also.  It is my intention as well to go to the UK and the US to promote as aggressively as I can the potential of the Irish offshore in the light of the new terms.  Already, I have been able to announce a new well in the Porcupine area to be drilled in 1988 by BP and there is a strong possibility that a second well will also be drilled in that area.  I am confident that the cummulative knock-on effect of these various initiatives will be very beneficial in terms of total exploration endeavours.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific measures to encourage exploration for gas, negotiations are in progress with certain oil companies with a view to having identified gas prospects explored and in this context the potential market for additional supplies of gas in the future is being reviewed.  No conclusions have yet been reached.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say <Col N="446" /> why he did not enter into negotiations to get firm commitments from the oil companies to match these terms?  Was the Minister suggesting in his reply that it would be wrong to seek in negotiations firm commitments to exploration?  Does the Minister not accept that reducing our position to raising corporation tax without any firm commitments was an error?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to Question No. 27 and ask him to confirm, or deny, that the position given the abolition of royalties and taking into account the price of oil, the tax allowances which can be quite extensive under the taxation regime for exploration and the exploration costs which will have accumulated before an oil discovery of a commercial size, is that if a commercial discovery of 15 million barrels takes place the net effect will be that the State will get absolutely no return?  Given those factors and the write-off that the oil companies are now entitled to claim will the Minister accept that the abolition of royalties which guaranteed a direct income to the State, and to the people who are entitled to a return from oil, has meant that that was a complete mistake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrary is the position. I have outlined for the Deputy the scenario we face in regard to our competitors in Europe for scarce exploration funds.  The Deputy makes the point that exploration write-offs are now allowable. They were allowable after 1986.  The difference now is that development can be also included, but the question dealt with exploration.  On the question of royalties, the royalty formula after 1985-86 was such that there were minimal royalties on small fields anyway at around 3 per cent. <Col N="447" /> I am quite sure that the radical measures which I propose will have the desired effect of bringing forward an intensive exploration programme over the next few years.  If the oil is there it is hoped that it will be discovered after 20 years of exploration.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that he has been hopelessly outmanoeuvred by the oil companies? His announcement came after quite a long concerted campaign by the oil barons, some of whom have newspaper interests, to persuade him and the public to surrender to their demands.  They were saying &ldquo;The State wants money from us. We will do this work if the State takes nothing&rdquo;.  The Minister has told them to do the job, that nothing is wanted.  Those are the facts on the tax issue as well as the royalties issue.  In the Porcupine Belt area very expensive exploration costs can be claimed over as many years as is wished because of the depth.  In the Celtic Sea area because of the likelihood of there being quite a number of small wells rather than any one large well, a similar process can be implemented so that there will be no tax.  The Minister has been out manoeuvred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject the suggestion of being outmanoeuvred by the oil companies or by anybody else on this issue.  The approach that the Government and I as Minister for Energy have taken is totally practicable in a situation which we have inherited of practically no drilling or exploration programme other than what I have outlined to the House. It is a nice ideological argument about the 100 per cent of take that Deputy Mac Giolla would like to see, but 100 per cent of nothing is still nothing.  That is the case unless one goes and finds the oil, which is what we are trying to do and are determined to do.  If there is a find, which I <Col N="448" /> hope there will be, in the Porcupine Belt &mdash; and I am delighted to see BP out there in water depths which have not been attempted in the Irish scenario before &mdash; I hope it will be a substantial find.  If that is over 100 million barrels, the State take is at 60 per cent, taking account of the write-off for exploration and development.</P>

      <P>My question has to do more specifically with gas exploration and what the Minister might have in mind to encourage it.  The market for gas is filled at the moment in the sense that at the present rate of off-take from the Kinsale Head gas field it would appear that the market is catered for for about the next ten years.  What are the Minister's views on opening up an export market for natural gas?  That would be a stimulus towards giving the oil companies an opportunity to go out and determine whether gas reserves exist.  Further, would the Minister favour the construction of an inter-connector into the UK gas grid?  Has he carried out any cost benefit studies in that regard?  Would he address that matter generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the suggestion that the full potential of the Irish market is the amount to which we are tied under the present contract level in Kinsale, there is potential for quite a considerable amount more there.  The amount, however, is arguable.  As part of our development of markets, we are extending the pipeline to Drogheda and Dundalk and taking in the horticultural area of the north county, to try to create a bigger market for gas.  I recognise that one of the drawbacks in exploration for gas is the question of off-take.  With that in mind I have been examining other possibilities, other industries that could take extra gas, the ESB for example.  I established a group in my Department with an outside chairman to review the question of the future of this whole energy question of gas.  On the question <Col N="449" /> of an inter-connector, I have discussed this matter with my opposite number in Britain, the Secretary of State, Cecil Parkinson. There has been correspondence on this which is ongoing and I am hoping for a solution shortly.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister propose to take any action in connection with the vast number of licences held by a large block under Marathon Corporation, which area has not been explored for over 15 years?  Does the Minister propose to take any action on that count?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the lack of exploration in this block, as this is prime territory for exploration.  I have had a number of meetings with Marathon Corporation to discuss their future activities with the intention of securing their agreement to an exploration programme in the area. These discussions are going on.  I am awaiting a response from Marathon at this stage and shall inform the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, has the Minister any plans to restrict the write-off under free depreciation by companies which might use the tax losses of other companies? Secondly, in relation to gas, has he considered declaring that an energy-related price would be given for gas discovered? Thirdly, do the terms now announced apply to the Marathon licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last question, Marathon is a separate deal with the State altogether.  There are specific arrangements there with the State, referred to by Deputy Spring, in relation to the blocks.  On the question of write-offs, that is a matter that can be teased out in the House when the legislation comes in. It is not as simple as the suggestion in the papers of one company selling their exploration costs to another and through the marketplace.  That is to suggest that one company will stay and the others will give them their write-offs.  I do not think it will work like that.  As far as an energy-related gas price is concerned, gas pricing <Col N="450" /> has been traditionally a confidential matter.  It is not something which I intend to divulge in the House today.</P>

Is there anything in relation to the benefits that might come to Waterford, or Galway, or wherever?  Have any restrictions been laid down?</P>

      <P>The extension of the pipeline originally envisaged by my predecessor took a line from Finglas through Ashbourne continuing northward avoiding the populated areas of Santry, Swords, Malahide, Rush, Lusk, Skerries, and Balbriggan.  In line with Government policy to encourage the development of the horticultural industry the Government decided that the pipeline, rather than going through virgin country, would be redirected to service the horticultural area and the industries, such as the <Col N="451" /> chemical industry, of north County Dublin.  A cost benefit analysis is carried out on all these projects as the Deputy is aware but I have not got this one in front of me.</P>

      <P>In June 1987, 18 lots of immature forests totalling 452 hectares at various locations throughout the country were offered for sale by public tender competition. The land carrying the crop was to be leased to the purchaser for an appropriate term to allow time for the crop to mature and be harvested.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 24 July 1987.  Tenders were accepted for six lots totalling 84 hectares.</P>
      <P>In September 1987, 40 lots of immature forests totalling 1,058 hectares in various locations throughout the country were offered for sale by public tender competition. The land carrying the crop was included in the sale on this occasion. Closing date for receipt of tenders was 9 October 1987 and these are being examined. Details of the acreage and locations of the lots in both sales are in the form of a tabular statement which I shall circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> The cost of advertising the lots was in the region of £6,000.  I am not in a position to disclose the details of tenders received as these are confidential.  The reason for selling State forestry is to raise funding to expand the forest estate through additional planting without recourse to additional Exchequer funding.  In the case of those tenders which I have classified as acceptable, I was satisfied that the prices offered were reasonable.  I was not so satisfied in respect of the other tenders.</P>

      <P>I was not able to reiterate the statement of the Minister of State in respect of the number of questions being taken with Question No. 14. The following questions are being taken with Question No. 14: Nos. 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32 and 39.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply intimated that only six of the 18 lots in the first offer were successful.  He did not intimate in his reply whether he was satisfied with the geographical locations selected.  Were the areas selected not in the more remote and inaccessible parts of our forests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The lots were chosen from a wide variety of areas throughout the country and for varying ages and species. In the majority of cases they were quite accessible and very good properties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that his response was not as good as it should have been, does the Minister of State feel that the marketing strategy adopted was not up to the standard it should have been?  The Minister of State may be aware that there was criticism in the press in relation to that aspect during the summer months.  Could he tell us <Col N="456" /> also whether the establishment of the proposed commercial State company, which is going to look after all aspects of forestry, will have the desired impact in the marketing area and improve the position in regard to proposed sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the second part of the Deputy's question first the new board will be established very early in the New Year and decisions relating to commercial exploitation of properties of that kind will be a matter for the board. There is always room for improvement. I would be the first to admit that the overall results from the sale of the semi-mature timbers around the country did not realise the amount of money we had anticipated.  Nevertheless, there is a clear indication from the tenders which were found to be acceptable that there are distinct possibilities, even though they may be limited, for expanding forest enterprises.  In relation to marketing strategy, this is a new development and was the first stab at this kind of marketing. It does require further refinement. I also accept that a number of the institutions who may have been interested and who have previously invested in properties abroad may require somewhat more time to process and examine this matter.  The examination of estates of this nature is a very complex matter, since it has been the first opportunity to do so.  I will have an open, flexible way of dealing with this matter in the future, when we will take into account any lessons learned in relation to the first offer.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister say that land was included in the second forty lots of 1,000 hectares, that both the land and the forests were sold?  Would the Minister not consider that to be depriving the Forestry Department of land for further planting?  What arrangements has he made for further planting in that area. <Col N="457" /> Also would he say whether there are other lots to be sold now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the legislation which will be introduced in the House in relation to the establishment of the new board, it will be my intention to include a proviso that land used for afforestation purposes will continue to be used for that purpose in the future, that it will be possible to regulate future grants to ensure that such happens.  In regard to the question of the sale of land I should say this was a decision taken by the Government.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that it was the correct decision. Indeed I should say that the funds accruing from the commercial sale of these properties will be used to enhance and increase the overall acreage under afforestation and, at the same time, relieve the taxpayer of the continuing burden of having to finance this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 36 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made in all areas of Dublin Gas operations on the safety front during the last few months.  The implementation of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report relating to Dublin Gas are well advanced and by the end of the year almost all recommendations will have been implemented in full.  The recommendations of the VEG GAS INSTITUT report are also being implemented by Dublin Gas as are the recommendations of the Report of the Task Force on Buildings which was published recently by the Minister for the Environment.  Progress on these matters is being closely monitored by officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>As I said on the occasion of the press conference when I published the VEG report, it is estimated that the cost of mains and services replacement in Dublin will be between £5 million and £10 million in each of the next few years.  Between 50 and 100 kilometres of pipeline will be replaced each year which is equivalent to a replacement rate of about 5 per cent per annum.  This is the amount recommended by the task force.</P>
      <P>Unaccounted for gas is currently about 13 per cent of the volume of gas supplied to Dublin Gas.  It is the clear intention that this figure will be reduced to the absolute minimum.  The norm for well run utilities is about 5 per cent to 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the trading and financial <Col N="459" /> position of Dublin Gas, Deputies will recall that the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1987, provides for this to be shown separately in BGE's annual accounts.  I do not, therefore, consider it appropriate to make a detailed statement on the matter at this stage.  I would like to assure the House that safety issues will continue to have priority and there will be no hesitation over necessary expenditure in this area.  Such unavoidable expenditures will obviously affect the financial results.  On the other hand, I am confident that, despite all the difficulties, sales for the whole of 1987 will be close to 1986 levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister envisage reporting regularly on specific recommendations outlined in recent reports?  The Minister referred to one of them only, that was the replacement of mains.  There are several other specific recommendations, such as the level of leak survey, the level of replacement of service connections and so on.  Would the Minister report to the House on those on a regular basis?  Has the Minister now amended the recommendation contained in the report of the task force that the target for unaccounted gas should now be five per cent to 7 per cent instead of the 2 per cent to 2½ per cent outlined in their report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunities to report to the House will arise at Question Time and on the occasion of Estimates and other debates in the House.  The Deputy can be assured that, on the Estimates debates, I will avail of the opportunity to report to the House on the safety aspects of the operations of Bord Gáis Éireann.  With regard to the implementation of the various recommendations &mdash; as I said in my reply, the implementation of the recommendations of Cremer and Warner is well advanced.  This means that, by the end of this year, almost all of the recommendations, rather than just the specific ones mentioned by the Deputy, will have been implemented. Also the recommendations of the VEG <Col N="460" /> GAS INSTITUT report are being monitored by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's comment on a specific recommendation, that is the target set by the task force that they should reduce gas loss to 2 per cent to 2½ per cent.  In the course of the Minister's reply he suggested 5 per cent to 7 per cent, substantially higher.  Does this reflect a change in the Minister's view as to what should be achieved by Dublin Gas in this crucial area of safety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see it reduced to the very minimum, which was the recommendation contained in the report of the task force.  I mentioned that a level of 1 per cent to 2 per cent is the ideal.  When I referred to 5 per cent to 7 per cent I should say that that is the norm in well run utilities.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that it is just not possible to reduce gas losses to zero. However, the principal means of reducing all losses are being followed, that is fogging, spraying, draining operations and a pipe replacement programme.  I can assure the House that everything that can be done in those areas is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the crucial nature of safety dictates that the specific targets recommended by the task force for Dublin Gas should be maintained?  Would the Minister not agree that his suggestion that the target level now be raised from 2 per cent to 2½ per cent to 5 per cent to 7 per cent breaches that target?  Would the Minister, when answering parliamentary questions here, report specifically on specific targets as they are advanced and not change the targets outlined by the task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity, by way of parliamentary question, to put questions down and I will answer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a specific question now, that is relating to gas loss, <Col N="461" /> the unaccounted gas.  Would the Minister not agree that the target set for such was 2 per cent to 2½ per cent and that he is now talking about a much higher figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that the figure is approximately 5 per cent to 7 per cent of sales, which is about average for well run gas utilities worldwide.  Primary losses are occasioned not merely by leaks in their network.  There may be metering errors.  They may not be necessarily actual losses through leakage.  There are metering errors, most likely to occur during periods of very low gas consumption and defective billing or administrative work which can, on occasion, fail to charge for the entire volume of gas supplied.  It is not a question of gas just leaking away.  The House can be assured that everything possible will be done to minimise gas losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for an early warning system and emergency plan of the kind referred to in the question are now being finalised and I will be putting my recommendations on this matter to the Government shortly.  I expect the phasing in of the plan to commence early <Col N="462" /> next year and a provision of £250,000 has been set aside for the purpose in the Estimates for 1988.  I will announce details of the plan when it has been fully worked out and approved.</P>
      <P>In the meantime interim procedures have been set up to receive early notification and details of any serious accident from abroad and to alert and bring together key personnel to assess the potential effects of such an accident.  The object is to enable the Government and the public to be advised on measures to minimise the effects of radioactive contamination that might arise.  These interim measures have involved the provision of extra office and laboratory facilities for the Nuclear Energy Board together with additional staff and equipment. The monitoring resources of the Civil Defence have also been improved and appropriate communications links have been established between all relevant public authorities, including the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>

That will involve the purchase and installation of sophisticated monitoring equipment to meet the concerns that are evident in this question.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that I see this Bill as part of what I hope will be an overall development programme and a co-ordinated plan encompassing the various Departments which impinge on shipping. I see it as part of a long-term strategy for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that companies or individuals must be resident in the State to qualify for these grants.  This is an important step in the <Col N="490" /> context of Irish shipping.  If we are to put moneys at the disposal of companies they should at least be resident or registered in this country.  The Minister is to be congratulated on incorporating that aspect.  The Minister also said that this Bill is aimed directly at our merchant shipping fleet and he specifically mentioned the exclusion of dredgers.  This might seem insignificant but one of the problems in our ports is the lack of facilities and equipment of this type for ensuring their long-term life.  Many of our ports have silting problems due to lack of funding for such equipment.  The Minister should seriously consider extending the scope of the Bill in this respect.  It is an integral part of the operation of our fleet that the ports should be capable of handling these ships.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the Bill is not aimed at fishing vessels.  While I accept that, I would hope that the Minister is not suggesting that he will not look at the matter of our fishing fleet, on which our fishing industry depends.  Perhaps he would deal with this matter in his reply and state what proposals he will be bringing forward for our fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>A mechanism is contained in the Bill whereby if companies for whatever reason do not continue to operate for any length of time after a grant has been given, the moneys can be recouped by the State.  This will help to ensure that companies will show a long-term initiative and strategy.  This is a point which has hitherto been overlooked.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made this legislation effective from 1 April 1987 because it was indicated at that time in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see that already some companies have sought funding under this Bill.  Could the Minister give us some indication of the level of activity in this regard to date and the type of funding which he will be authorising?  I am very interested to note that this Bill is already having the desired effect.</P>
    <P>Strategic importance has been mentioned a number of times, and I urge the Minister when considering projects for funding to look at the strategic implications. What I mean by this is that if <Col N="491" /> one or two companies are operating in a specific area of shipping and there are projects for other aspects of shipping, he should deal with them rather than just fund newer projects which are already being catered for.  This is inherent in the strategic aspect of the development of Irish shipping.  It would be wrong for us to continue to fund companies in competition with other Irish owned companies which are perhaps already successfully doing something along these lines, while at the same time prohibiting other companies from expanding into important areas.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
    <P>Another aspect mentioned in the Bill which is dear to all of us, and which is relevant to every Government Department, is employment.  This should be taken into consideration when granting funds to various companies.  I would like the Minister to give preference to those projects which have a high employment content.  This would be seen as a real incentive for grant aid.  Where possible, there should be a bias towards a company which will provide extra employment. This would be of great benefit to the country particularly in the light of what happened to Irish Shipping.  We have many able bodied experienced seamen who are unemployed and practically forgotten. If the Minister seizes the opportunity being presented to him now, he will be able to ensure that these people are re-employed.  I ask him to put emphasis on this aspect of development.</P>
    <P>Since we are an island, the development of Irish shipping is essential for the future overall development of the country.  Any mechanism which can ensure that is very welcome.  This Bill is a first, and a small, step in that direction. I want to encourage the Minister and his Department down that road and to remind them that we will be looking for more imaginative approaches for the development of Irish shipping.  I want to see a very vibrant and active shipping industry, preferably in Irish hands.  That is of crucial importance.</P>
    <Col N="492" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  As previous speakers said, it continues from an initiative taken by the Coalition Minister in setting up the committee on strategic shipping requirements and the outcome of their deliberations.  Progress had been such that a sum of £1.5 million had been provided in the Estimates for 1987 to cover this type of initiative.  In that respect, I am glad to see the Minister has brought this Bill before the House so that Irish shipping can get benefit.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cullen said, this is a small start but it is a welcome one.  It was sad to see in the Minister's speech that less than 10 per cent of our total trade is carried on Irish ships, but I do not believe anybody can be surprised by this when we remember what has happened in the past few years within the semi-State transport industries, particularly the shipping industry.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and if I were not in this Chamber today, I would be in Setanta House listening to the difficulties being experienced by the management and unions of the B &amp; I.  Earlier we heard from Irish Shipping.  When one compares the problems faced by these two great shipping companies in the past few years, one realises that this Bill is not only timely but is essential to give some necessary encouragement to those involved in the indigenous shipping industry.  The sad plight of the B &amp; I is taxing the Government's mind at the moment.  As well as encouraging small shipping companies, I hope the Government will be thinking of how they can rescue this very important shipping company.  As I said, I welcome the initiatives being taken in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Department of the Marine were set up, headed by the present Minister, we expected to see a number of initiatives being taken, but apart from some of the grants introduced in the 1987 Finance Act, this is the first Bill to come from the Department to encourage the shipping industry.  This measure is very welcome but it is open to minor criticism. Any criticism I make would be to highlight the defects I see which might be <Col N="493" /> remedied over the period of the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide grants of 25 per cent for new and second hand ships not more than seven years old.  Deputy Doyle suggested that that period might be a bit short because there are ships in good condition available but which may be more than seven years old.  If a marine engineer passes such ships, I hope the Minister will allow more latitude because, as he knows, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara often look at older vessels which are passed by their marine engineers.  I would ask him to take that idea on board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also mentioned a problem in the Bill which I, too, would like to raise, that is, section 6 (2) &mdash; perhaps she has the same information I have. Recently the Minister visited one of the most progressive small shipping industries in my constituencies, Arklow Shipping. I hope this progressive company will benefit from this Bill.  I am sure it will because it is most progressive and has ordered four new ships of over 1,000 tonnes.  Unfortunately, they have to be built in Germany and that is another area at which the Minister will have to look. Of course ships are built abroad because of cost; nevertheless the Minister should examine the question of competitors abroad.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Doyle that the question of the loss of a ship is quite different from a ship being transferred to another owner.  The loss of a ship is very sad for those of us who represent maritime constituencies.  We know the hazards involved and the sorrow at loss of life.  However, the replacement of a ship lost in that way is very important and I hope the Minister will be influenced by Deputy Doyle's arguments.  Perhaps he will give a wider explanation of the section and he may need to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to the effect that a ship which has been lost and which attracted a grant should not be liable to pay back the grant which should be applied to the vessel which takes its place.  I can see that there may be difficulty in that the replacement vessel may <Col N="494" /> be a totally different ship.  Nevertheless, the idea that someone should receive insurance, pay back the Department and then look for a grant for a new ship seems unnecessary.  Perhaps the Minister could streamline that area which would obviate the need for an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill also provides for the repayment, in part or in full, of the grant should the vessel cease within a specified time through loss, transfer or other disposal, to fulfil the purposes which rendered it eligible for aid.  The cost of the scheme is subject to an aggregate of £7.5 million.  The Minister said that in the Book of Estimates the scheme will only require £500,000 although his predecessor considered that a sum of £1.5 million was necessary to provide for grants.  I have experience of grants in a different area and what can happen as a result of a good scheme.  The take-up can be very difficult to quantify and, therefore, I warn the Minister that his predecessor must have had some reason for making £1.5 million available. Perhaps the sum of £500,000 is sufficient for the remainder of this year.</P>
    <P>The scheme is imaginative and I hope it will be taken up by many small industries. I do not want to widen the debate but in the document, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published by the Government before the last election there was no mention of ports.  Responsibilities changed after that document was produced but the Minister should remember that you cannot expand the shipping industry without maintaining, repairing or expanding port facilities.  This has been the Cinderella area for transport Ministers over the years in relation to money spent on airports and roads.  The Minister has now taken over responsibility for commercial ports under the Harbours Act and it is, therefore, with some surprise that I see it is proposed to reduce the amount of money available by 50 per cent, from £6.2 million to £3.1 million.  I represent a constituency with two ports and I assure the Minister that if one wishes to expand the shipping industry to keep small ports viable there is a necessity for a certain amount of infrastructure, <Col N="495" /> expansion and dredging.  I am disappointed to see the allocation to the 27 ports reduced by such a drastic amount. Although the Minister is bringing in grants to encourage the purchase of ships, there seems to be a big reduction in the amount of money allocated to develop our ports.  Fianna Fáil trumpeted their support for this policy before the election and I hope they will not forget their promises as they regard it as an area in which there could be great expansion.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for maintaining the grant to the RNLI which is so important and of such benefit to seamen.  The grant was introduced during the term of the Government of which I was a member and I am glad that the money has been maintained.  More money is being made available to lighthouses and an increase of a few thousand pounds to the RNLI would have been very welcome.  Nevertheless, I thank him for his continued support of the RNLI.</P>
    <P>Does the 25 per cent grant attract any EC contribution from the regional or infrastructural funds?  We get money for roads and sewerage schemes but it is all confined to the land-based expansion of our infrastructure.  I would have hoped that a case could be made to the EC for funds for the development of our shipping industry, in addition to the contribution which the Minister is making available.  It would not only be a help to his Department's Estimate but it would also allow him to be more generous with grants and would help a greater number of shipowners who may wish to apply for grants.</P>
    <P>This is a small beginning.  The Minister has a very difficult task in this whole area of the marine.  There has been a great deal of proper concern about the indigenous Irish shipping industry.  The Minister has an uphill struggle in this area.  Those of us who are on the joint committee are aware of some of the problems that exist. I welcome the Bill before us.  I hope the Minister will accept the suggestions from Deputy Doyle and myself about section 6 (2) and that he will let me know if contributions could be attracted from the <Col N="496" /> Regional Fund or from some other fund of the EC which should help our industry in this way.  We will have opportunities to speak on other aspects of this matter which concern me.  I congratulate the Minister in carrying forward this initiative which was first mooted by Deputy Jim Mitchell when he was Minister for Communications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and I are swapping places because I have to attend the committee which Deputy Kavanagh referred to and in which we are struggling with another shipping issue.  We are an island nation and it is extraordinary that our record in shipping has been so appalling.  That record reached a nadir during the course of the last Administration when a combination of managerial ineptitude and political indifference sank Irish Shipping without a trace.  Perhaps this is not the day to deal with Irish Shipping but in their aftermath we find ourselves without a deep sea fleet.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Irish fleet, there are at present only 68 merchant vessels on our register and of those 31 are Britishowned. The fleet is a very small one; it is about 138,000 tonnes deadweight and it is defective in many ways.  There are seven small tankers on that fleet with a very small draught.  The Irish-owned fleet is almost exclusively engaged on the short sea trade.  Primarily it is a coastal, cross-channel and near continental trading fleet and that is an extraordinary situation for an island nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obvious deficits in this area. Earlier today we spoke about refrigerated transport and one of the very obvious deficits is reefers under the Irish flag. In general, the fleet is too small and the aim of this Bill is to address that matter in the short term.  This Bill is most welcome. If we look at the legislation and the thinking behind it, even though the amounts of money involved are relatively small there are major benefits that can accrue to the economy.  The first and the most obvious is the increase in the strategic fleet.  That must be the aim of any sensible Government on an island. Secondly, the income earned by a fleet <Col N="497" /> which is expanding has two major benefits to the economy.  It displaces funds which go to non-Irish ships for the carriage of Irish goods and it has the opportunity of earning valuable foreign income for us.  Not only is there a direct import substitution effect but the added value to Irish goods has improved by having an Irish fleet.  I hope the Bill will in some way help to increase employment in this sector and will address some of the injustices which came about as a result of the demise of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>The Bill's success has already been signalled. In my own constituency one of the most progressive privately owned shipping companies, Arklow Shipping, have already put ship orders on record with a view to this legislation being passed.  There are other advantages in this legislation.  At present, unless the fleet expands there will be virtually no training of young Irish people to crew ships in future.  The other and the most obvious advantage is that developments in the home fleet and in trade with the near Continent will encourage other ventures in the future and will bring about further investment in Irish shipping by Irish people.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposals in the Bill, there are a couple of points which I wish to raise.  I share the concern which was shown earlier about the relationship between the Finance Act and this legislation. Those concerns are well founded but they will be and can be addressed outside this legislation.  I also considered the question of section 6 (2) of the Bill.  At first I felt this section could be excessively onerous to an owner who suffered a catastrophic loss of a vessel.  I thought it might be necessary to bring forward some sort of roll-over arrangement but on reading the legislation I find there is sufficient flexibility in the drafting of section 6 (2) and (1) to accommodate the views.  I hope the Minister will deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>The other sections of the legislation as drafted do not cause any problems. Shipowners must be engaged in shipping operations in the coastal and cross-channel areas.  They must be in competition with other shipowners and we agree with <Col N="498" /> that.  The Bill states that the shipping grant will be provided only to assist where there is evidence of commercial viability and we all agree with that.  Far too many grants have been given to commercially non-viable operations.  Tax clearance certificates and so on are required.  In general, the provisions of this legislation show a lot of commonsense.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay Deputy Mac Giolla who very kindly let me speak at this stage.  The general points have been well made.  This is very welcome legislation. Some of our more progressive shipowners &mdash; I have already mentioned Arklow Shipping &mdash; have already responded to this legislation and I welcome that response.  It is tremendous to see the Irish fleet being expanded.  There is another aspect to that expansion.  The Minister is to be congratulated not just for bringing this legislation before the House at this time but also because of the very open-handed way in which he has signalled his intentions to the shipping interests.  It is due in no small way to the Minister's personal intervention and the open door policy he has operated in his Department and also to the fact that this legislation was brought forward at this time, that not only did we get promises of expansion of the Irish fleet but potential losses to other registered shipowners are averted.</P>
    <P>I have long considered that one of the most important developmental steps that could possibly be undertaken in this nation is a consideration of our last major resource that we have never exploited. We are a small nation in geographic size. The land area is considerably smaller than the sea area over which we have sovereignty.  Therefore, it is appropriate that we should have addressed that development as part of general Government policy, and that has been done with the establishment of the Department of the Marine.  For some extraordinary reason successive Governments since the foundation of the State effectively ignored the whole area of the marine, the resource that was there and the capacity of that resource to be exploited in the best possible sense of the word to give <Col N="499" /> jobs and produce wealth for the people. I see the establishment of the Department as an important step.  The decision to bring the shipping operations into the expansion scheme in the Finance Bill this year is another very important step, as is this legislation.  I am pleased to note that all the speakers on the other side of the House, having merely reflected on one or two points in the Bill, have all welcomed this legislation.  It has much to commend it, and I congratulate the Minister publicly in regard to it.  A shipper told me recently that in the few months since Deputy Brendan Daly arrived in his ministry they have had more open access than they have ever had to any Minister in any administration since the foundation of this State.  That cannot be but good because the whole purpose of Government and of the Department of the Marine is to facilitate that development.</P>
    <P>Finally, having congratulated the Minister and his Department, let me say that all too often in the past technicalities in small pieces of legislation have been used by civil servants who have been assiduous in their attempts to make sure that we are good Europeans.  They have married well-meaning domestic legislation to equally well-meaning EC legislation and somehow they have come up with results that sometimes stymied development.  I hope that those who will administer this legislation when it finds its way on to the Statute Book and starts to operate will realise that its spirit is to expand the Irish fleet and that that spirit will be borne in mind in the administrative efforts which will be brought into effect then.  The aim is to expand the fleet and to do everything we have in our power to accommodate that expansion.</P>
    <P>I wish this legislation well and hope it has a speedy passage through this House. I hope too, that apart from the four or five orders that have been placed tentatively with shipyards, this legislation will be the catalyst for many more ships on the Irish register, for more employment for the people, and that as well as a return to not just looking after our inshore and coastal <Col N="500" /> shipping and our near European shipping we will be able to repair the damage done by the loss of our deep sea fleet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be supporting this Bill but we have some reservations about it.  There seems to be some <i>ad hoc</i> element about it but that is relevant to many of the things that are occurring these days in an unplanned fashion.  For instance, it is surprising that the Bill has been published and proceeded with in the absence of the publication of the report of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements who were established by the previous Government and were to have reported in 1985. We were promised publication on a number of occasions since then.  Soon after the general election I asked the Minister for Communications here in the Dáil on 31 March if the report would be made available to Deputies and the Minister, Deputy Wilson, indicated that the matter would be considered.  The report has not been made available to Deputies, so I presume it has not been issued or made available to the Minister. I do not know, but I think its findings would have vital importance in making decisions on what we are talking about here now.  I presume that strategic shipping requirements is what the Minister is trying to substitute for in this Bill.  If the report has been made available to the Minister I do not know why it has been sat on and kept secret.  Perhaps there is some damning condemnation in it of the previous Government's handling of the Irish Shipping affair, but it is unreasonable for the Government to expect the Dáil to express serious opinions in the absence of that report.</P>
      <P>In any case, the Bill is likely to have only a very marginal impact on our shipping requirements.  The total money allocated under the Bill is only £0.5 million this year and a total of £7.5 million which would hardly put you in business with a couple of clapped out coasters.  If we are serious about developing a strategic shipping fleet or any type of national fleet much more money will be required than is provided for in this Bill.</P>

      <Col N="501" /> We should, therefore, consider, if we are talking about even beginning to establish a shipping fleet, the most effective way the money can be spent.  In all the years since this State was founded private enterprise here has never shown itself to have the determination, inclination or ability to provide a shipping fleet.  That is why we were left in such dire straits during the Second World War when we had to establish the Irish Shipping fleet. It is very unlikely that the inducements offered in this Bill will change that very much.  Private enterprise here gets huge financial support from the taxpayer: over £1,000 million a year goes to support private enterprise which, naturally the Government hope when giving all this money, will help to provide jobs.  Yet we have had practically no return for it in terms of jobs.  We have the highest unemployment rate in Europe.  Throwing all that money at private enterprise for many years has not created jobs and throwing £7 million at private ship owners is unlikely to give us a national shipping fleet.</P>
    <P>However, we agree with everything that previous speakers and the Minister said.  I presume the Government believe that an island country like ours must have a national shipping fleet.  We are dependent on exports and imports to a far greater extent than any of the other countries in the EC, and we are so remote from the EC and other areas that it is absolutely essential for us.  The war years proved how essential it was for us to have our own shipping fleet.  Even in the fairly recent Falklands war the British Government acquired their own commercial fleet, cargo and car ferries etc., for military purposes.  If we were dependent on the British cargo or merchant fleet or car ferries and something similar occurred, we would be left stranded.  Similarly, all sort of conflicts can occur other than a major world war which can affect our exports and imports if we are dependent on other fleets.  Nobody will give us any benefits in the shipping area.  If some other countries have the monopoly they will screw us into the ground, so we have <Col N="502" /> to have an Irish shipping fleet to keep us in business.</P>
    <P>The only way we can provide a national shipping fleet is by the State taking a direct role in its creation.  That is what occurred in Irish Shipping and Irish Shipping served this country well for 30 years until the early 1980s, and we still have not got anything near the full picture of what happened in Irish Shipping to get it into dire straits.  One of the more objectionable features of the whole Irish Shipping affair was the way in which the Coalition Government and even Fianna Fáil in opposition attempted to transfer the blame for the difficulties in the company on to management and staff, while absolving successive Governments of any responsibility for the disaster.  No doubt serious mistakes were made by senior management in Irish Shipping but neither the Government nor Ministers of the day can evade their responsibility because those Governments appointed the boards of Irish Shipping and it was the boards of Irish Shipping who endorsed or perhaps implemented the management policy in regard to the whole sorry affair.  Those boards and the Governments who appointed those boards must take the responsibility.</P>
    <P>Our national fleet will not develop if dependent purely on private enterprise. The State must take a direct role if we are to rebuild what has been lost.  It is interesting that the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies published in March 1981, after the company had entered into these long term leasing arrangements which finally brought disaster, lavished great praise on the company and congratulated the board, management and staff, masters and crew of Irish Shipping for the highly efficient manner in which they had discharged their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The way in which £7.5 million can be found in this Bill for private shipping interests contrasts starkly with the appallingly shoddy treatment meted out to former employees of Irish Shipping. Three years after the liquidation of the company, 300 employees have still not got their rights, in comparison with other <Col N="503" /> State companies who got more in redundancy terms.  Verolme Cork dockyard workers got four weeks salary per year of service, PMPA workers got four weeks salary per year of service, NET workers got five weeks salary per year of service, RTE, the ESB, Aer Lingus, Dublin Port and Docks Board, and the Sugar Company workers, all got five weeks salary per year of service in redundancy cases. The Irish Shipping workers got two to three days salary per year of service in what was called statutory redundancy. The result is that many of them are now living at subsistence level after their long years of service to the country in a dangerous and risky area.  The Government have not lived up to their responsibilities. The Irish people all feel a responsibility to these workers and the money must be found for them.  Giving the workers five weeks salary per year of service would in gross terms cost £5 million but when taxed would cost a net £3 million to the State.  The Dáil Committee on Public Accounts are now agreed that the cost of the liquidation up to the present has been £90 million with more to come.</P>

      <P>I hope to make it relevant.  The Bill we are discussing is to bring us out from the disastrous position in which we are left following the collapse of Irish Shipping.  As a result of this Bill, I hope that some of the former employees of Irish Shipping will benefit.  These employees have established a co-op called Irish Marine Services to establish some shipping services and to set up a shipping company.  This is why I am emphasising the position of Irish Shipping employees and our responsibility to give them some priority under this Bill so as to get their company off the ground. They should be able to absorb some of the Irish Shipping workers.  When giving assistance the Government believe that there should be some production targets <Col N="504" /> and job creation targets.  It is not mentioned in this Bill.  Under the Bill a registered Irish ship qualifies for the grant, but they could still have a crew from any part of the world.  Nothing in the Bill covers the crew.  The Bill should ensure that there would be Irish crews as well as Irish registered ships.  In that way, we could provide jobs and perhaps compensate in some way the 300 unemployed expert seamen from Irish Shipping.  We welcome the Bill in that it may provide some relief for Irish Shipping workers in giving them jobs, although there is nothing yet in the Bill to ensure that.  This Bill will begin the process of rebuilding an Irish shipping fleet which is absolutely essential for our future economy.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to warmly thank the Minister for continuing in this Bill the policy which I announced as his predecessor with responsibility for shipping on 6 January last.  This is the second stage of the policy then announced, the first being included in the provisions laid down in the Finance Act earlier this year.  One change which is an improvement is that the age of secondhand ships which will qualify for grant aid has been extended from 5 years to 7 years.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Mac Giolla is still in the House I would say that among his own ranks he has legal advice.  One of his colleagues is a very eminent solicitor in this city.  The question of how one could deal otherwise with Irish Shipping workers than they were dealt with, bearing in mind the requirements of law, and particularly bankruptcy law, has escaped the Administration of which I was a member and the present administration. The workforce of Irish Shipping deserved a better fate because they were an excellent workforce.  Every proposal put forward by them or anybody else was examined thoroughly in my time as Minister and none of these proposals could be proceeded with on very sound legal grounds, as I am sure Deputy McCartan could tell Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>

      <P>It is not good enough for Deputies to come into this House with expressions of sympathy for the Irish Shipping workforce and spread the belief that an uncaring Minister and an uncaring Government just would not do what could simply be done when, in fact, there is no legal way out of it because of the law of bankruptcy and because of the law against preferring one set of creditors over another.  Deputy Mac Giolla has made these sort of utterances several times before and I challenge him to come up with suggestions as to how the law could be changed under the Constitution to meet the point.  We came to our conclusions with the best of legal advice, and we went outside the Attorney General's office to get a second opinion from senior counsel.  We recognised that nothing could be done by way of, for instance, giving extra redundancy payments, especially in view of impending legal proceedings in London against us in the aftermath of the collapse of Irish Shipping. We came up with this set of proposals to encourage the expansion of the fleet so that instead of getting redundancy money the Irish Shipping workers would get new employment.  That is what this Bill is all about, and I am very proud to have been able to steer this policy through Cabinet and I am very glad that this Government have continued with the policy.  It is practical policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the serious reservations I have about Government policy in general is that it is all cuts, frequently unplanned and frequently unthought-out, with very little emphasis on encouraging growth and employment.  Here is a Bill that does that.  However, I notice that the Estimates for next year provide us with £1,050,000 compared to £1.5 million for <Col N="506" /> this year which in itself is less than the £2.5 million which I had hoped would be provided per annum for the first three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a serious disappointment. Here is a case that needs examining, where cutbacks may be counterproductive, where by spending a little more we may, in fact, get in much more revenue.  All cuts are not necessarily good.  There are places, even given the extreme tightness of the public finances, where we should be spending more money because of the return it would yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that every Member of this House understands and sympathises with the plight of the Irish Shipping workers and I have no doubt that they will be the main beneficiaries of this Bill. I have no doubt that Members of this House would be only too happy to find a way to help the said workers.  Their experience was a very emotional one.  I was personally blamed for their plight in very emotional terms over a prolonged period.  Indeed, during the general election there was a campaign against me personally by the said people in my constituency, as if I was personally to blame for their plight.  But these are the burdens of public office.  In the case of Irish Shipping the course pursued was the only course possible.  When the decision was made and announced in this House the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, now Taoiseach, and the then shadow Minister for Transport, now Minister for Tourism and Transport unthinkingly, as was typical of their four and a half years of Opposition, promised that they would set up a new Irish Shipping. Of course that was a false promise and an unwise one, giving rise to false hopes among a very adversely affected section. It was a promise that could not be fulfilled. This policy which I have pursued and which will now be enacted in this <Col N="507" /> House was the best possible way of dealing with the aftermath of the collapse of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>I do not want to burden the House too long with the history of the situation. In the aftermath of the collapse of Irish Shipping I set up the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements, an interdepartmental committee which also included representatives of the Irish Union of Shipping.  It issued its report and a summary of recommendations of that report was published in the Green Paper on Transport which I published.  I am surprised at Deputy Mac Giolla talking about the publication of the report when already the findings have been published in the Green Paper.  The findings are quite clearly what we see as the basic strategic requirements.</P>
    <P>I hope that the effect of this Bill will be to provide on the Irish register, with Irish crews, more, and much more in due course, than our basic strategic requirements. Here is an industry which can truly be developed notwithstanding the deep and prolonged recession in shipping throughout the world.  Here is an industry which in Irish terms, by wise policies, can be extended and made bigger than it ever was before, giving more employment than it ever did before, because the policies being enacted here today in this Bill and earlier in the Finance Act are policies which open many doors.  Up to the day I left the office of Minister for Transport which was then responsible for shipping, there were many expressions of interest and very active inquiries as to when the legislation would be through.  I know there are several shipping acquisitions waiting to be completed when this Bill is enacted.  That is why I hope it can be speedily passed by this House and by the other House and signed by the President.</P>
    <P>There is one other leg to the changes in shipping policy which were brought about by me, the manning levels on our ships over which the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport, now the Department of the Marine, has control. The chief marine surveyor eased the <Col N="508" /> manning levels greatly so that our ships could be on a competitive basis with our competitors.  Indeed, he also extended the distances certain ships could travel. The boundary of the continental trading area was extended twice and other trading areas were also extended.  Those moves had a beneficial effect on the economics of the Irish shipping industry.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that there are great prospects for the future.  It is amazing that as an island nation we have had very little shipping on our register over the years.  It is extraordinary that a country like Norway with a population less than ours has had for decades a huge merchant shipping fleet giving enormous employment. At its peak that industry employed between 50,000 and 60,000 people in Norway.  It would be great for Ireland if we had a shipping industry that would employ that number of people.  I do not pretend that that is a possibility in present world shipping circumstances or given the depth of the world economic recession but, notwithstanding those problems, we can if wise policies are pursued by our Ministers achieve good results in the shipping industry.</P>
    <P>We have another shipping company and it is no secret that it is in serious difficulties.  I am referring to the B &amp; I which is now the only State-owned shipping company in these islands.  It is the only subsidised and loss making shipping concern in these islands.  The B &amp; I, in the main, services the routes between Britain and Ireland and has some cargo service to the Continent.  Sealink operate services on the Irish Sea and make a profit but the B &amp; I do not.  The House will recall that as Minister I made strenuous efforts to turn around the B &amp; I.  Indeed, the group of State companies for which I had responsibility were loss making concerns when I took office but, with the exception of the B &amp; I, they were profit making or heading towards a profit when I left office.</P>
    <P>The Bill may not relate to the B &amp; I but it raises questions about our shipping policy.  For some reason which I cannot explain that aspect of shipping is not the responsibility of the Minister for the <Col N="509" /> Marine; it is still the responsibility of the Department of Tourism and Transport. That represents a bad division of responsibilities.  It would be a great tragedy if the B &amp; I were to close but I could not support or encourage a continued pouring of taxpayers' money into that company if there is no clear light at the end of the tunnel in regard to it.  When I was Minister in 1985 the Government decided to invest in the B &amp; I £20 million and £6 million for three years thereafter. The targets set for the company were that in 1986 they should reach a profit level of £500,000 but the figures for 1986 will probably be the worst figures ever recorded by the B &amp; I.  It is possible that they will be as high as £14 million or £15 million.  I do not know what the projections are for this year.  There are some explanations for part of that gulf, notably my decision as Minister to have a definite policy of low access fares.  We decided, because of the overall economic benefit of low air and sea fares, to take on board whatever drawbacks there would be from any State companies arising out of our pursuit of such a policy.</P>
    <P>When one balances out the disadvantages for the B &amp; I of such a policy against the advantages for Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus, one will find that there is no net loss to State companies.  In fact such a policy can prove of great advantage to the economy.  It is right and fair that the targets set when the investment decisions were made in regard to the B &amp; I should be adjusted accordingly.  That was made clear by me to the board of B &amp; I when we announced our low access fares policy.  It is worth noting that that policy has had good results, particularly on the aviation side.  An estimate in the Department of the effect of that policy on the B &amp; I annually was that it would cost them in the region of £5 million per annum or, perhaps, £6 million.  That was a good deal less than half of the gap between the £500,000 profit target and the estimated £14 million loss.</P>
    <P>What has gone wrong in the B &amp; I? Something serious has gone wrong despite the decision to hire Alex Spain, a very worthy person, the enormous <Col N="510" /> investment made and the major changes in personnel policy.  An approach which I favoured as Minister &mdash; it was one which did not find favour with my colleagues in Government &mdash; is one which merits consideration.  It was my view that the huge burden of debt attached to the B &amp; I should be lifted from the company. That could be done by setting up a subsidiary company to whom the assets of the company would be ascribed with a commensurate amount of debt to give them a good debt equity ratio.  My suggestion is that the Exchequer should take up the tab for the rest of the debt of the holding company and, perhaps, discharge it over a period of years so that there would not be an upfront call on the Exchequer.  That approach has a number of advantages.  One is that the exposure of the Exchequer is clearly defined and, secondly, it would give the company for the first time in many years a healthy balance sheet thereby enabling them to seek private investment for their ongoing capital needs.</P>
    <P>Many people in the company, in the trade unions and, presumably, in The Workers' Party would on ideologicial grounds oppose that but I would much prefer to allow private investment into the B &amp; I if it meant saving the jobs now threatened.  I would prefer to save the hundreds of jobs threatened than to stand on the great ideological principle that there could be no privatisation of State companies.  Admittedly, getting the balance sheet right is only one side of the need to make the company an attractive proposition for private investment because such investors need to see profit. However, if the mechanism I have suggested is used we can present a healthy balance sheet to private investors and if the performance is good over the next two or three years the company will have the propect of attracting private investment.</P>
    <P>It is important that such a policy is pursued.  One of the major problems in the company is that there is a belief that no matter what happens they will always be able to fall back on the State, that <Col N="511" /> there is no need to perform profitably. One of the major advantages of private participation in that company would be the getting rid of that belief, that ingrained attitude.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies have given me notice of their intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the strike at the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  Among those Deputies are Deputies McCartan, M. Higgins, Colley and Flaherty.  The Deputies will have available to them 20 minutes to make their case.  They ought by now to have decided how best to allocate that time between themselves.  The Minister will have ten minutes to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment this evening the issue of the protracted strike of the workers in the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. By agreement, we shall share the time equally between all the parties because this is an issue which affects us all, right <Col N="512" /> across the party divide.  We are hopeful that by our intervention we can achieve a formula this evening that will lead to the early resolution of this dispute.</P>
      <P>This strike, as we know, is now in its fifth month and the failure of the Government to exert any pressure on the ISPCC management to agree to a solution of the dispute has been most disappointing.  The result of the strike has been that thousands of families around the country have been deprived of the vital system of community support which the ISPCC staff provide.  In addition, the staff, many of whom are married with families and mortgages to support, have had to endure particular hardship.  Anybody who has observed closely this strike will acknowledge that the attitude of the ISPCC management since the dispute began has been consistently intransigent and unreasonable. Their refusal to accept the Labour Court findings following the hearing in July last which recommended the reinstatement of the bookeeper whose redundancy sparked off the dispute is a disgrace.  The Labour Court findings on the other hand, recognise that the position adopted by the staff was one of flexibility and reasonableness and the court acknowledge the sacrifices the staff have made because of the society's difficult financial position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management structure in the ISPCC is different from that normally involved in an industrial dispute.  The executive of the society is made up generally of voluntary members and while they have overall responsibility for the direction of the society, the day to day decisions are made by a small professional management team and particularly a chief executive, Mr. O'Tierney. I know that there are many decent people on the executive and I find it hard to believe that they could have supported the arrogant and unreasonable attitude of the professional management in this dispute.  It is well known that the ISPCC have had particular financial difficulties in recent years but there must be no question of the society's management being allowed to try to sort out their financial difficulties by a lengthy strike <Col N="513" /> during which they have no outgoings on staff salaries while their fund raising activities, many of which involve students paid on a commission basis, continue as normal.</P>
    <P>Almost half of the ISPCC funding comes from the State.  Indeed, it is significant that at a time when almost every voluntary sector has been cut back and agencies like the National Social Services Board are to be abolished, the allocation for the ISPCC in this year's Book of Estimates has been maintained at £90,000, the same as last year.  There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that those to whom this money is entrusted administer the society in a fair and reasonable manner and this must include the area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The work done by the ISPCC has changed over the years in keeping with the changed needs of Irish society.  It seems, however, that the society's management have a concept of industrial relations which is still firmly locked in the Victorian era.  Our main concern in this dispute must be the plight of the families who have been depending on the ISPCC for services which, indeed, otherwise the State would have had to provide in the areas of family support and pre-school education.  One of the most notable aspects of this dispute is the absolute solidarity that has existed between those who normally depend on the ISPCC services and the staff who are on strike. Time after time delegations of families have come to the ISPCC offices and demonstrated their support.  The people of Darndale in my constituency who have been lucky enough to have had the services of an ISPCC family centre know that the real value of the society lies in the people they have working for them.</P>
    <P>The workers in the ISPCC are an honourable and dedicated group of people.  They would never have gone on strike had they felt that there was any alternative, but the attitude of the management has left them with no alternative. This strike has gone on long enough.  The Ministers for Labour and Health must make it clear to the ISPCC management that they are not prepared <Col N="514" /> to tolerate this Dickensian attitude to staff relations.  The Ministers should call on the management and try to knock some sense into them.  It must also be made clear to the society that the taxpayer cannot be expected to fund the society for services they are not providing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy McCartan in expressing public interest and concern at the fact that as our Dáil opened a dispute which started several months ago is still under way and that we could see members who had worked in the caring profession within the ISPCC standing in the rain outside the offices.  I was one of the Deputies who with others intervened with the Minister for Labour and tried to break the impasse that has arisen in relation to this dispute.  Listening to Deputy McCartan presenting the case in its stark outline, my patience is beginning to wane equally.</P>
      <P>The ISPCC internally have financial difficulties.  They set about resolving these and the history of this dispute is a very simple one.  The ISPCC were negotiating with the staff and their union about appropriate measures.  The union agreed to leave aside such progress as had been made while a task force reported. When the task force reported to the union and negotiated in good faith on redundancies and pay, once again the management, in this case a single individual, decided that he could rub the nose of the union and the staff into the dirt, simply saying that he was changing the goal posts again.  Then a bookeeper was dismissed who happened to be a shop steward of the union.  Deputy McCartan referred to solidarity.  The staff of the ISPCC have incurred my admiration for the manner in which they have stood by their fellow employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The union at that stage referred the matters under dispute to the Labour Court.  In 1987 we were dealing with the situation where a chief executive of the society involved has treated with arrogance not only the employees and the people who are availing of the services of the society but also the Labour Court. <Col N="515" /> He said that he would not be bound by a third party recommendation, even if that third party recommendation has the status of the Labour Court.  This cannot continue.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions were made as to how this dispute might be resolved.  I know of no group of workers who have made more concessions in relation to conditions of employment and pay than the group of workers involved and it is an absolute scandal that the services they provide have been curtailed.  The parents in my constituency have said that they want this matter resolved.  I have spoken on this matter previously in the Dáil and I said on that occasion that if a charter existed within the voluntary sector as to the basic conditions for workers and for the operation of societies &mdash; the Minister of State will know that the National Social Services Board made recommendations to the Department of Health in that regard many years ago &mdash; it would have provided a framework in which this dispute could not have arisen.</P>
    <P>It is important for us as elected representatives to say that this madness must stop now and that this intransigence must stop now.  We represent the taxpayers who provide the moneys which are represented in the Estimate for the Department of Health.  Unless this matter is resolved soon I will be among those who will suggest that a co-operative provision of these services to the public be provided with the assistance of the Department of Health, that is, that the workers involved in this dispute be assisted by the Department of Health in forming a new co-operative entity to provide these services to both parents and children, services of which they have been deprived because of the intransigence of a single individual. It gives me no pleasure to speak like this. We have exhausted every other option and I am delighted to see that the view has been expressed on all sides of the House that the normal procedures of the 20th century be applied to the resolution of this dispute.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  There is not a lot I can add to what the previous Deputies have said.  The length of this dispute amazes me.  My office is right beside the office of the ISPCC and I have become all too aware of the length of this dispute and the apparent intransigence which has emerged over the months.  The ISPCC have for so long had the image of being a caring society but they are now in danger of losing that image.  The administrators of the society are endangering that image by allowing this dispute to continue.  Many families are affected by this dispute and have been deprived of programmes which are absolutely essential to their well-being.  Playschools and their services have also been affected.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to understand why this impasse has continued for so long. There were times over the past five months when a resolution of this strike seemed near.  I was a member of the all-party committee which went to the Department of Health to meet the Minister. After a Labour Court recommendation had been rejected by management the Minister sent in a conciliation officer.  The Department of Health and the Department of Labour should immediately get together and meet with the national executive of the ISPCC.  As this impasse has gone on for so long a new impetus is needed.  I propose that the Minister of State take this problem on board, given that the Department of Health fund the ISPCC to the extent of £90,000 and that the health boards contributed £250,000 in the recent year, and inject a new element into this dispute.  He should demand that some compromise is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting which was to have taken place about five weeks ago between the union and management did not take place because of a dispute over who should be chairman and so on.  It is a disgrace that that meeting has not taken place and I <Col N="517" /> put the blame for that fairly and squarely on the management.  I appeal to the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Labour and for them to take immediate steps to resolve this dispute.</P>

      <P>During the last session both Deputy Higgins and I raised this matter by way of an Adjournment Debate.  The Minister at that time indicated that there was going to be a Labour Court hearing on the following Monday but unfortunately that hearing did not resolve the dispute.  As the other Deputies have said, other initiatives were undertaken but they did not resolve the dispute either.  Now five to six months later a dedicated group of workers are still picketing the headquarters of the ISPCC and many deprived families are going without the services which they need so badly.  This cannot be allowed to continue, especially when we consider the level of subvention which is provided by the State to the ISPCC for the provision of these services.  There is an appalling contradiction here.  Because of the public and traditional image of the ISPCC we have been more moderate than we should have been and we do not wish to do damage to a body who are tied up in providing services in the caring area.  We do not want to cause irreparable damage but the level of frustration which is being felt by those directly involved is clearly emerging here today through the proposals which have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new initiative is needed and the Minister of State is in a strong position because of the involvement of his Department with the ISPCC to undertake such an initiative.  He has a responsibility to do so not only on behalf of the taxpayer but also on behalf of the most vulnerable sections in our society who have been deprived of the services which they need. This is the time of the year when the ISPCC engage in pre-school work. Deputy Colley put her finger on what must be the best solution to the problem which is to bring the two parties involved to the table, broadening it beyond the <Col N="518" /> two parties involved to date.  This may help to bring some movement to this dispute.  We must make it clear here tonight that we do not want to come back here again in three months' time still looking for a resolution to this problem.</P>

      <P>Like the other Members who have contributed, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  I am also aware of the restriction of time.  As my colleagues have said, it is not often that we in this House are called upon to form an all-party committee on a matter on which there is general agreement. Members in this House realise the tremendous work which has been done by the staff of the ISPCC down through the years.  What is more serious is the lack of those services where they are most needed.  My colleagues have already spoken about the work which has been undertaken and it is a matter of great concern to all of us to see staff who have such an honourable tradition in this area out in all seasons on the street when all they want to do is to carry out the work they are committed to undertaking.  We appeal to the Minister of State, to the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Health not to allow this strike continue any longer.  As public representatives we take this opportunity to remind the management of the ISPCC that there is public money, taxpayers' money involved. There is a tremendous historical, traditional support for the society and for the other agencies who deal with children. Our fear would be that a body blow may be delivered to that tradition and commitment from which it may not recover. The seriousness of those consequences cannot be underrated.  I look forward to hearing a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I thank those Deputies who contributed to this debate, namely Deputies McCartan, M. Higgins, Colley, O'Flaherty and Barnes, for their interest and concern in having raised this matter in the House this evening.  I also wish to express my thanks to the all-party <Col N="519" /> committee who met the Minister for Labour some time ago to discuss this very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, a full Labour Court hearing on this strike was held in July last.  The subsequent Labour Court recommendation was rejected by the management of the ISPCC.  The Minister for Labour has had a report on the situation from officials of his Department, having talked to both sides.  Unfortunately, the strike remains deadlocked. Naturally, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Labour and I are most concerned that the families and children in receipt of the services of the ISPCC should continue to be deprived of those services for such a long period.  In the circumstances I have requested officers of my Department to explore every avenue possible with a view to having the strike <Col N="520" /> settled at the earliest possible opportunity. This process is now in train.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to refer to any issues relating to the strike at this time.  In so saying I mean no discourtesy to Deputies or to the House but I am loath to make any public comment on any specific issue relating to the activities of the ISPCC lest it be misunderstood and possibly exacerbate what is a most delicate situation.</P>
    <P>However, I have taken careful note of what Deputies have said and will have these issues examined in detail by my Department.  I wish to express my deep concern about this matter.  I appeal to all sides to have the matter resolved without further delay.  I hope progress will be made when my officials meet the appropriate sides very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 October 1987.</P>

The ESB maintain that, on the basis of present costs, there is little scope for a reduction at this time.  I am glad to note that the ESB do not envisage any price increase over the next few years.  I do not, however, intend to let the matter rest at that and I will ensure that the possibility for further price reductions will be kept under continuing review and that any opportunities for a reduction that may arise will be availed of.</P>

      <Col N="469" /> Notes</P>
    <P>Column (a)</P>
    <P>(i)  Income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1982 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1982-83.</P>
    <P>Column (b)</P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1982 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1982-83.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished.  Accordingly the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>Column (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the net receipt of income tax from other self-employed tax units in each calendar year by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>Columns (a), (b) and (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>

      <P>The relevant statistics available are in respect of the income tax year 1985-86. From figures contained in Table 14 of the results of the 1985 Labour Force Survey (published in September, 1986) it is estimated that 129,500 farmers were chargeable to income tax in respect of that income tax year.  This comprises some 119,000 full-time farmers together with a further 10,500 farmers who or whose spouses carry on another trade or profession.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 80,000 self-employed persons other than farmers were chargeable to income tax in 1985-86.</P>
      <P>The numbers of self-employed persons including farmers who made tax payments in respect of 1985-86 up to 31 May 1987 were close on 80,000.  Statistical records of tax payments by vocational category are not maintained.  The number of self-employed persons including farmers who are ultimately expected to make tax payments in respect of 1985-86 is provisionally estimated at 101,000 of which the number of farmers is tentatively estimated to be of the order of 26,000.</P>

      <P>Department of the Marine policy in relation to harbour and marina development is to bring all harbour works under the one administrative and planning umbrella, whether commercial, fishery or recreational.</P>
      <P>The first steps have been taken with the integration of the harbours section of the former Department of Communications, the fishery harbour section of the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry, and responsibility for marina planning in a single division of Roinn na Mara.</P>

    <P>I am reviewing strategies in those cases <Col N="475" /> with a view to more rational and integrated planning of harbour management and development.</P>

However, given the volume of grant payments being made &mdash; for example, nearly 7,500 grant and mortgage subsidy payments were made in September &mdash; it is inevitable that delays beyond the normal may, from time to time, arise in individual cases.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the dispute commenced on 16 June 1987 as a result of a dismissal.  The dispute was the subject of a Labour Court hearing.  The court's Recommendation was rejected by management and the dispute remained deadlocked.  At my request officials of my Department met the parties to appraise me of the facts of the dispute.  I am therefore aware of the facts of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Dr. O'Hanlon, TD, Minister for Health, has now requested <Col N="484" /> officers of his Department to explore possible ways of finding an acceptable formula to settle the dispute.</P>
    <P>As this process is at present under way I feel I should not comment further on the dispute at this stage.  I am, like my colleague the Minister for Health, most concerned that those who avail of the services of the ISPCC should be deprived of them for such a long time and I would appeal to both sides to give their full co-operation in attempting to find a solution.</P>

My colleague, the Minister for Labour, has had a report on the situation from officials of his Department after talking to both sides.  Unfortunately the strike remains deadlocked.</P>
      <P>I am, as Minister for Health, naturally most concerned that the families and children in receipt of services from the ISPCC should continue to be deprived of these services for such a long period. In the circumstances, I have requested officers of my Department to explore every possible avenue with a view to having the strike settled at the earliest possible opportunity.  This process is now in train.</P>
