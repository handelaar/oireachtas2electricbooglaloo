      <P>The most appropriate and effective framework in which to voice the Government's concern about Soviet policy in this area and to work for concrete improvements is provided by meetings held within the context of follow up to the CSCE.  At the current Vienna CSCE follow up meeting the Irish delegation have drawn attention to public and parliamentary concern in Ireland about the treatment by the Soviet Union of their Jewish citizens, including the denial to them of their basic right to leave either temporarily or on a permanent basis and have joined in putting forward proposals on the right of freedom of movement, including the right to leave, and the elimination of abuses of restrictions on freedom of movement on grounds of national security.  The Deputy may be assured that the delegation will continue to work to have these proposals adopted.</P>

Will he indicate to the House whether the position he has articulated as that of the Irish Government is shared by all other members of the Community? If not, would he indicate what steps the Irish delegation at Vienna, or through the EC generally, will be taking to try to make this a central issue?</P>

      <P>Within the EC and CSCE we have made human rights and freedom of movement, and all that is incorporated in what is called the human dimension, a high priority.  We very strongly believe that the conclusions now being reached in Vienna represent an admirable opportunity to have incorporated a very strong, affirmative commitment to human rights as well as a reduction in conventional arms and the other initiatives taken by the super powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps, if any, he is taking to ensure that Irish fishermen will be compensated for loss/damage to vessels <Col N="989" /> caused by unidentified submarines passing through Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 22 and Priority Question 44 together.</P>
      <P>Submarines travelling through Irish territorial waters in exercise of their right of innocent passage under international law are obliged to travel on the surface and to display identification.  These obligations ensure that submarines do not remain unidentified while in our territorial waters and also have the effect of considerably reducing the risk of accident. The Government would obviously view with considerable concern any breaches of such obligations.</P>
      <P>As I have said previously in the Dáil, the Government are of the view that the best possibility of promoting and enhancing safety at sea generally and of avoiding the type of incidents that we have seen involving trawlers and submerged submarines in the Irish Sea lies with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).  The IMO are the worldwide body whose aims and purposes include the encouragement of the adoption of the highest practicable standards in matters concerning maritime safety.  An Irishsponsored initiative in this organisation, which focuses attention on the problems posed to fishermen by submarine traffic, was adopted by consensus by the General Assembly of the IMO on 19 November 1987.  We hope that this resolution which now becomes part of the accepted code of recommended practice for mariners will contribute to greater safety at sea generally and more specifically help to avoid incidents involving fishing vessels and submerged submarines in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>As far as compensation is concerned, payment for damage by unidentified vessels is clearly problematic.  The Government will take whatever action is open to them to assist in the identification of such vessels, thus facilitating any action for damages that might be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to cloud the <Col N="990" /> undercurrents of the Irish Sea but will the Minister not recognise and agree that the IMO are hardly the body that should concern themselves with these intrusions?  After all, we are not exactly flooded with Liberian or Panamanian registered submarines and those countries have the bulk of commercially registered mercantile craft ploughing the Irish Sea.  Will the Minister agree it is necessary for him to have direct negotiations with those nations who are most likely to have submarines creating damage in the Irish Sea?  The nations in question are the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom in particular.  Will the Minister indicate, in terms of compensation requirements, what specific inquiries have been made by the Government with regard to reported damages to fishermen's trawlers to the British authorities or the Soviet Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully agree with the Deputy in regard to the IMO.  Matters have been taken up on a bilateral basis with the two countries mentioned and indeed with other countries.  However, we put a lot of effort into getting this resolution passed by the IMO on 19 November last.  It is a positive resolution but the bilateral aspects have not been as successful as we would have liked. Naturally, the countries concerned plead security considerations but at least the resolution was passed in a multilateral forum and we regard that as a very good start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I appreciate the diplomatic difficulties surrounding this issue.  Will the Minister accept that if compensation is to ensue &mdash; we are talking primarily about compensation in this instance &mdash; it can only come about by discreet diplomatic inquiries and exchanges on a bilateral basis between the probable countries involved?  Will he give an assurance to the House that if individual trawlermen and the owners of trawlers were to make direct representations to the Department of the Marine and, presumably, to the Department of Foreign Affairs, his Department will make every effort to <Col N="991" /> succeed in the proper diplomatic manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate in what way it will seek to restrict the numbers or the manner in which submarines pass through the Irish Sea and whether it will have any effect on submarines which are nuclear powered, including the ten United States submarines that carry 16 missiles each and which are currently stationed in the Clyde Estuary and use the Irish Sea to such an extent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an earlier initiative which we took which requires such countries to avoid well-known fishing grounds in regard to submarine passage. I appreciate that is more honoured in the breach than in the observance but the resolution is there as a result of an earlier initiatve at an IMO conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obvious difficulty in this case.  I do not have to elaborate on the practicalities of the matter. Security interests dominate to such an extent in this area that it is very difficult for a complainant country to get to the heart of the matter.</P>

      <P>With you permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 15, 25, 27, 41, priority question No. 46 and written question No. 50 together.</P>
      <P>On 7 November, on the instructions of the Government, the Irish Ambassador in Rome, who is also accredited to Libya travelled to Tripoli to seek an urgent meeting at a high level with the Libyan authorities.  In the course of his visit the Ambassador on the Government's instructions made clear the unequivocal view of the Government that any support moral or material for the Provisional IRA from any source is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador impressed on the Libyan authorities the widespread public concern which has arisen as a result of the threat posed to the peace and security of the Irish State by the apparent attempt to import into the State for use by the IRA a vast and sophisticated arsenal of weapons.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador informed the Libyan authorities that in the light of recent events the Government would not be proceeding with a proposed trade visit to Libya.  Arrangements had been in hand with a view to holding this visit in the period 15-17 November.  As Deputies will be aware, I availed of the opportunity when addresing the Seanad on 25 November to set out the position of the Government on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 November in the course of the most recent meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve in the European Political Co-operation context, I proposed that the Twelve consider as a matter of urgency how best the Twelve can coordinate efforts to prevent a recurrence of the type of operation engaged in by the <i>Eksund</i> and its crew.  Active consideration of this matter has already commenced in the appropriate <Col N="994" /> frameworks.  The Government are continuing to monitor closely developments in this case.  The Garda and the French security forces remain in close contact in order to ensure that all relevant information is made available to the Government as the investigation develops.  At the appropriate time when the full facts are available to them the Government will, in the light of such information, carefully assess what further action may be required.</P>
    <P>My overriding concern is to assess at all stages what are the most effective means of ensuring that neither Libya nor any other country offers support of any kind, moral, political or material to subversive elements in this country.  The course of action I will adopt will be decided on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the actions he has outlined which his Government have taken, have been taken on at least two previous occasions to no effect in that what was verbal and moral support by the Libyan Government for the IRA has apparently now been translated into much more dangerous support such as that in the <i>Eksund</i> affair?  Does the Minister not consider that it is now time to break off diplomatic relations with the Libyan Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>There seems to be a contradiction in the Minister's reply. Why did we protest to the Libyan authorities on 7 November if we were still not sure whether the <i>Eksund</i> arms shipment came from Libya?  If the shipment did come from Libya why do we not break off diplomatic relations?</P>

In the light of that positively known information and in the light of the knowledge that a Libyan agent or agents operated here providing financial assistance to the IRA, will the Minister agree that it is appalling and inexcusable that the Government have merely sent the Irish Ambassador in Rome to express our view that this is unacceptable?

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I do not wish this question to be considered as over clever.  I mean that quite sincerely. In view of the stated friendship expressed by the leader of the Libyan people with the Taoiseach, does the Minister not consider that it is now time that the Taoiseach contacted this person directly and said we do not want arms, moral support or any other type of support for the Provisional IRA?  It is not necessary for anybody in this House to take a lecture on the battle against subversion because we have all been engaged in it for a long number of years.  We do not need to take lectures on that.  We do not want any outside forces supporting an organisation one of whose objectives is to bring down this State and this Government.  Is it not time that the Taoiseach approached Colonel Gadaffi, either publicly or privately, and conveyed that to him?</P>

I made it quite plain in my original reply that we informed the Libyan authorities fully as to the public concern that exists and our concern in regard to the <i>Eksund</i> shipment which, in our view, posed a threat to the peace and security of the State.  The Government, through the Ambassador, impressed that on the Libyan authorities.  This Government are a Government of collective responsibility.  In Tripoli the Irish Ambassador speaking in that manner to the Libyan authorities was speaking for the Taoiseach, for me, and for every member of our collective Government.</P>

Dr. Arias on visits to European capitals and during the visit to him by the former president, Foreign Minister Tindemans, received advice on how to go about bringing these states together.  I would see the Guatemala Agreement as a very significant step which was taken by Dr. Arias in full consultation with the European Community who were able to advise him on how to set up structures.  I should like to see these five Central American states becoming an embryonic common market or Central American community.  They actually look on the European Community as a model.  There is a very close inter-relationship between the Community and its institutions and the democratic leaders in that part of the world.</P>

We are seeking to exercise what pressure we can.  One of the heartening things is that meetings are now taking place with a view to organising a ceasefire between the Contras and the Nicaraguan Government forces.

      <P>The Government would welcome the development of an active dialogue between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland on the range of issues of concern at present, including the possibility of establishing a basis for devolved government which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community there.  However, in <Col N="1012" /> the absence of such dialogue, it is understandably not possible at this stage to anticipate developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the fact that Ireland is taking part in disarmament talks in the European Political Co-operation process since the ratification of the Single European Act is a new development of the policy of military neutrality; and if he will make a statement on the Government policy on disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions on disarmament, which focus primarily on disarmament issues before the United Nations and at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, have long been a feature of European Political Co-operation.  These issues were discussed in European Political Co-operation before ratification of the Single European Act.  The Act, in outlining the scope of the Twelve's activities within the European Political Co-operation, as confined to the political and economic aspects of security, formalised the practice which existed before ratification. Discussions in European Political Co-operation on disarmament issues thus do not represent any change in Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality outside alliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the latter aspect of the Deputy's question the Government remain committed to playing an active and constructive role in matters relating to disarmament and in particular in the area of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.  We are encouraged by the progress in the dialogue between the US and the USSR and by the signing of the agreement on the elimination of intermediate nuclear forces.  We hope <Col N="1015" /> that this agreement will give impetus to other aspects of the bilateral dialogue, including those relating to reducing strategic nuclear weapons and space systems and that the negotiations at the bilateral level that have been initiated in the last few weeks on nuclear testing can lead to the achievement of significant progress. Ireland remains committed to a comprehensive test ban which we believe would be a positive and practical measure in halting and reversing the nuclear arms race.</P>
    <P>While the potential for significant progress at the bilateral level is obvious, and must be fully explored and developed, we remain conscious of the importance of the multilateral dialogue on disarmament in the framework of the United Nations. We are determined to play a useful and constructive role in the issues currently under discussion in this framework.  We were pleased that discussion on disarmament and international security issues at the recent session of the UN General Assembly was marked by a fresh and generally positive approach.  We hope that this can be translated into concrete results on the issues which are under negotiation at the multilateral level, including negotiations on banning chemical weapons on which considerable progress has already been achieved at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Ireland was happy to participate earlier this year in efforts aimed at enhancing the Convention on Biological Weapons which is also an important instrument in the area of arms control.</P>
    <P>The International Conference on the Relationships between Disarmament and Development which I addressed last August also allowed Ireland to make a contribution on this aspect of the multilateral dialogue.</P>
    <P>A third special session of the UN General Assembly devoted to disarmament will be held from 31 May to 25 June next. As we have done at previous such special sessions we will be actively participating at this special session and helping to ensure its success.  The success of this forthcoming special session is important <Col N="1016" /> for the promotion and advancement of the disarmament process at the multilateral level.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to disarmament is expressed also in the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, now in session in Vienna.  The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is currently the forum for discussions on elaborating a mandate for negotiations on conventional arms reductions in all of Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, as well as for elaborating further confidence and security-building measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question out of a very important point raised by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret Fitz-Gerald, in the course of the debate on the Single European Act earlier this year when he stated that, as Head of an Irish Government pursuing a policy of military neutrality, he had to remain silent during after dinner meetings with other Heads of Government.  Would the Minister, on behalf of this Government, consider that to be the correct practice?  Should an Irish Head of State not be able to discuss the whole issue of disarmament in all fora within Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for discretion to be exercised in the context of what type of discussion is taking place. As Deputy Barry is well aware, a lot of these discussions are informal and a lot are formal.  One takes a different attitude when one is having an informal as against a formal discussion.  It is a matter on which I would prefer not to generalise too much; that would be my general approach.  The division is quite clear. Military neutrality has been always our stance.  We do not want to get involved in any military discussions that arise out of European political co-operation.  Our stance in regard to arms reduction, in particular in regard to nuclear arms reduction and conventional arms reduction, is well known.  We are also very strong on the matter referred to earlier &mdash; of ensuring that there is a very real and effective human dimension in <Col N="1017" /> any arms reductions talks that take place, particularly within the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe context so far as East and West Europe are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could further elaborate for me: do we take a different attitude at informal and formal meetings when disarmament is being discussed within Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the other European Governments and Foreign Ministers are fully aware of our stance.  It is well established, well adumbrated, quite clearly stated.  They have no difficulty in understanding our position.  We are not members of NATO or of the Western European Union.  They fully understand that matters relating to those two organisations are ones in which we do not get involved.  That is the position but we do have a very real interest in disarmament, as a subject, and have expressed that interest in international fora over the years.  We have a very real view on a reduction in conventional weapons, indeed a reduction in tension generally in Europe.  That view is well known.  We do not get involved in any matters concerning military alliances.  The two main military alliances within Europe are NATO and WEU.  We do not get involved in any discussions formal or informal pertaining to those two organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek some factual information from the Minister?  I would welcome Ireland, as a neutral country, taking part formally in disarmament talks.

The other was disallowed because there is to be a discussion on emigration this evening and my priority question related to that subject.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday 3 December 1987, the following statement was issued by the Government Information Services:</P>
      <P>The Government are not prepared to consider a B &amp; I Plan of Action which has not secured across-the-board support of the company's workforce. Seven days are being allowed by the Government from today's date after which a decision will be made by the Government on the future of the B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>The Government today reaffirmed the position indicated by their statement of 3 December.  The position now is that if the B &amp; I Plan of Action has not secured the across-the-board support of the B &amp; I's workforce by the deadline given in the statement, namely 10th December, the Government will withdraw financial support from the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As things stand, it certainly looks as if the B &amp; I Company will close down.  That is why I am asking the Minister if he will intervene, seeing that the talks have collapsed.  It needs the Minister's intervention at this stage.  There appears to be a possibility that the ships officers may not be totally unreasonable in their attitude, that the manning levels which they are being asked to operate could be extremely dangerous and might lead to a tragedy of the same proportions as that which affected the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i>.  Would the Minister look at that aspect?  I am sure that these 149 ships officers can hardly be so unreasonable that they would jeopardise the jobs of 1,400 men.  It needs ministerial intervention at this stage.  I am asking the Minister if he will examine the position rather than let the company collapse.</P>

    <Title>Copenhagen European Council Meeting: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on the European Council which I attended, in Copenhagen, on 4 and 5 December, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The Minister of State at my Department with special responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was also in attendance in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>The Council did not reach any formal conclusions and was adjourned late on the second day.  It will come together again, under the German Presidency, in February 1988.  I do not wish to conceal from the House my sense of disappointment at this delay.  The Copenhagen Council is the second in succession at which the members of the Community have been unable to reach agreement on vital issues.  This is particularly disappointing against the background of the world economic situation, and the dangers of recession threatened by the fall in prices on the major stock exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community is the largest trading <Col N="1139" /> bloc in the world and must itself affect and be affected by the despatch and sense of confidence with which it can do its business.  The inability of the assembled Heads of State and Government of the Community member states to reach conclusions on matters of vital concern to the Community should be seen in this light.</P>
    <P>Because of the postponement of decisions at the Copenhagen Council, my statement to the Dáil is, in effect, a description of work in progress.  It should not be regarded as a record of definitive conclusions.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the Council the President of the European Parliament, Lord Plumb, spoke briefly to Heads of State or of Government outlining the views of Parliament on the issues before the Council.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the Council was concerned with measures for the implementation of the Delors Plan for the completion of the internal market.  Deputies will be aware of the proposals, most specifically stated in the Single European Act, for the abolition of all barriers to trade and the completion of a common economic area or European market, without frontiers, of about 320 million people by the year 1992.  The plan has many facets which I do not intend to go into now but, in summary, it is concerned with ensuring that the Community has sufficient resources to achieve its economic and social purposes and that these resources are spent so as to achieve maximum effect.  It is also stipulated that a strict code of budget discipline should apply in the disbursement of Community funds.</P>
    <P>The Summit concentrated on exploring five crucial issues all of which are related. What we were seeking was a global settlement which would encompass all five and decide their relationship to each other and their separate contributions to an overall agreement.  The five issues were: (1) a new regime of own resources; (2) budgetary discipline; (3) the settlement of new agricultural guidelines with overall <Col N="1140" /> limits of expenditure and the use of stabilisers; (4) the future size and operation of the Structural Funds and (5) the British rebate.  All decisions on these points were to form, in the words of the tentative conclusions of the Brussels Council, an indivisible whole.</P>
    <P>There was tentative agreement in Copenhagen that a ceiling should be placed on the resources of the Community equivalent to approximately 1.3 per cent of the Community GNP.  While I pressed the point that a limit of 1.4 per cent of GNP would be more satisfactory, I believe that the limit now in contemplation, which would give the Community access to about 55 billion ECUs compared with expenditure in 1987 of approximately 41 billion ECUs, is tolerable. I am assured that on all reasonable assumptions the 1992 total would enable the Community to discharge its functions satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>These resources would be raised by way of levies and duties as at present, in addition to a rate of VAT of 1.4 per cent in 1988 declining to 1 per cent in 1992. There would also be a fourth resource to be determined on a basis related to Gross National Product less the base on which VAT is levied.  This would be the marginal resource and as its weight increased while that of VAT declined, it would help to make the overall financing system more proportional by reference to relative prosperity, as decided in Brussels. The entire question of how the resources of the Community were to be provided, and, in particular, the nature of the fourth resource, was one of the points on which agreement had not been reached when the Copenhagen Council was suspended.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, the Community will continue to operate and be financed on the basis of 1/12th of the 1987 expenditure, for each month during which there is not a 1988 budget.  Though the failure to reach agreement on the nature of the Community's resources is regrettable it is not fatal to the functioning of the Community, at least in the early months of the coming year.  There is to be a meeting of the Budget Council tomorrow with a view to ensuring that <Col N="1141" /> there is the least possible disruption to the functioning of the Community arising from the circumstances where no budget for 1988 has been agreed.</P>
    <P>On budget discipline, a number of proposals are under discussion.  Since expenditure on agriculture absorbs approximately two-thirds of all Community spending, this is an area which would naturally be affected by the discipline proposals.  The first of these is that expenditure under the guarantee section of the Common Agricultural Policy should not grow by more than 60 per cent of the growth of Community GNP, in any year.  It was proposed that the base from which this expenditure is to be measured would be a figure of 27.5 billion ECUs, in 1988, with provision for costs connected with the depreciation of excess agricultural stocks to be kept outside these guidelines.  That is an important point for Deputies to keep in mind when considering the level of resources.  What is proposed as the base for agricultural spending will not include sums to be used for the disposal of surplus stocks.  They will be put into the budget separately.  To help restore some order to Community finances, payments to member states for FEOGA guarantee expenditure would be delayed for two and a half months instead of two months as under the arrangements agreed for 1987.  There would be new stabilisers to prevent the too rapid increase of agricultural expenditure, particularly for cereals and oil seeds, with provisions imposing penalties for production over certain thresholds and other provisions encouraging farmers to set aside land which would otherwise have been used for the production of commodities in surplus in the Community. If exceptional circumstances occur, relating, for example, to an unanticipated increase in subsidies for the export of agricultural produce from the Community resulting from, say, a depreciation in the rate of exchange of the dollar, or a breach by other countries of treaty undertakings in relation to the sale of agricultural produce, there would be special provision for exceeding the <Col N="1142" /> stipulated limit for agricultural expenditures. There are many details of these and other proposals, with which I do not propose to detain the House here, since the whole subject is still under discussion.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise, however, that, as Deputies will be aware, the negotiations have major implications for Irish agriculture. The proposals I have mentioned were designed to put a tight limit on agricultural expenditure and contain production around current levels.  At this stage, they are no more than proposals on which we will continue to put forward our views.  In the middle of a continuing negotiation I cannot go further in commenting on details: I shall simply say that while we are prepared to accept reasonable limits in the agricultural area we are determined to ensure that the CAP would be maintained as an effective and fully operational policy: and that it must support to a greater extent the concept of the family farm &mdash; a point on which I laid considerable stress in Copenhagen.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for dealing with production increases were, in the case of most sectors, largely worked out in the Agriculture Council, which had, however, been unable to find a basis for agreement on cereals.  The Commission proposed a limit of 155 million tonnes, for full Community guarantee as to price. Other countries wanted a higher limit. Discussion on this topic took up a great part of the time of the Council and, in the end, this was another of the points on which there was failure to reach agreement in the discussions.</P>
    <P>The measures to contain production in the other sectors are more or less in line with the majority view of the Agriculture Council.  These arrangements do not, of course, involve additional measures in the beef or milk sectors, which account for some 75 per cent of Irish production &mdash; although they do involve some reduction in the compensation for suspended milk quotas after 1988-89.  They involve a settlement of the deficit problem in the sugar sector in a way which would be very satisfactory from the Irish sugar industry point of view.  Again we have our views which we will continue <Col N="1143" /> to put forward, not least in regard to compensation in the milk sector.</P>
    <P>Against the proposals for the reform of CAP expenditures, but more especially against the background of the proposals for the completion of the internal market by 1992, the proposals for the reform of the Structural Funds, on which about 7 billion ECUs a year is now spent in aiding the peripheral and other regions of the Community and other purposes, assume particular importance.</P>
    <P>The Commission, as Deputies will be aware, proposes a doubling of the funds and their use in an integrated way for the attainment of five priority objectives: (1) promoting the development and structural adjustment of the less developed regions; (2) converting the regions, border regions or parts of regions (including employment areas and urban communities) seriously affected by industrial decline; (3) combating long term unemployment; (4) facilitating the integration of young people into the labour force; and (5) with a view to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, speeding up the adjustment of agricultural structures and promoting the development of rural areas.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals discussed in Copenhagen, the amount of the funds for less developed regions would have been substantially increased.  In addition, there were proposals for a rate of recoupment for the less developed regions of up to 75 per cent of total cost, compared with a figure of approximately 50 per cent at present.  I would regard these as favourable developments and a very necessary prelude to the completion of the Common Market; but, again, in this area what we are left with are not definite decisions but proposals under discussion.</P>
    <P>Under the Copenhagen proposals, the amount of the British rebate would have been adjusted to take account of the favourable impact on the British contribution to Community own resources resulting from the revision in the method of assessment of these contributions.  I do not think it necessary to go into detail <Col N="1144" /> here into a subject which again is still under discussion &mdash; and far from resolved.</P>
    <P>The European Council also issued three Declarations on foreign policy issues: the Middle East, Afghanistan and East-West relations, welcoming the INF agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Copies of these statements are in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>During my time in Copenhagen, I had a separate meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, to discuss current issues in Anglo-Irish relations.  As the statement issued following this meeting indicates the Prime Minister welcomed Irish ratification of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism but expressed concern about recent changes in existing extradition procedures between our two countries.  I outlined the assurances I have given in this House that it is the intention of the Government to make the new arrangements work satisfactorily and that if any difficulty should arise, the procedures will be further reviewed.</P>
    <P>We agreed to maintain and strengthen further the co-operation between our two Governments against terrorism; and we had an exchange of views on the operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The meeting was a useful opportunity for an exchange of views between us: it was frank and friendly and provided an opportunity to improve our mutual understanding of the situation.  I also had a separate meeting with Prime Minister Chirac, during which we had a friendly and constructive discussion on bilateral matters of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen Council is the second, in succession, at which the Community Heads of State and Government have failed to come to conclusions on the matters before them.  It is easy to be saddened at this inability to reach consensus on issues of such importance to the Community and its member states, but I continue to take some comfort from the fact that the Copenhagen meeting was not ended but adjourned to dates in February, when the same issues and <Col N="1145" /> possibly others will be further discussed and, I would hope, decided, under the German Presidency.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute here to Mr. Delors, President of the Commission and his staff who worked so assiduously to try to bring together the framework of a solution.  I would also like to pay tribute to the Danish Presidency, and in particular, to the ingenious and determined efforts of Prime Minister Schluter to bring the Copenhagen Council to a successful and decisive conclusion. The failure of the Council to reach conclusions was not due to any shortcoming of the Presidency but to the intractability of the subject matter and the existence of so many strongly held and contradictory views on the central issues.  Prime Minister Schluter and his aides did everything possible to bring success; and I would like, personally, to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of all he did in Copenhagen for those participating in the Council.  I should like to assure the Leaders of the parties who will be making statements that I will very carefully listen to their contributions and take them on board because these matters are still under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given us a very quiet presentation of the results of the European Council and I have the feeling, and it is understandable on the Taoiseach's part, that he is down playing this particular non-event because the fact of the matter is that with 11 other Heads of State or Government the Taoiseach has come home with one arm as long as the other on this occasion.  It is a wee bit idle of the Taoiseach to say that the &ldquo;Copenhagen meeting was not ended but adjourned to dates in February&rdquo;, trailing clouds of glory after it.  The fact of the matter is that for the second time in six months the European Council has failed to reach conclusions on all the important issues that were at the centre of the debate, not just here but throughout the Community, for the last couple of years in relation to the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first occasion, last June, we were told by the official communique <Col N="1146" /> issued by the Council that 11 of the 12 member states had agreed on a certain very clear, very comprehensive statement of what they intended to do in terms of the development of new policies and the financing of the Community.  We now find that in December there are at least three member states that do not subscribe now to that agreement of 11 June last. Unless the Taoiseach can inform me, and assure me to the contrary, it seems that the Community is going backwards on these issues rather than making progress. That is a matter of extreme concern to us because the Single European Act, the whole complex of policy developments it set out, and the whole set of commitments entered into by the member states in that Act, represents what the member states agreed between them was the best composite of measures, the best global approach to the further development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has mentioned that there was tentative agreement in Copenhagen that a ceiling should be placed on the resources of the Community equivalent to approximately 1.3 per cent of the Community GNP.  As the Taoiseach has pointed out that was not what the member states had in mind during the course of the development of the Single European Act.  What we were talking about then was a limit of 1.4 per cent of GNP.  I wonder what it is that leads the Taoiseach to say:</P>
    <P>I am assured that on all reasonable assumptions the 1992 total would enable the Community to discharge its functions satifactorily.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of argument about that at the time the Single European Act was being negotiated.  In fact, there were some who felt that on the evidence and forecast available at the time a figure of 1.4 per cent of GNP would barely be enough to allow the Community to do what is set out in the Single European Act, to increase the Community structural funds and to engage in the development of the range of new policies that have been set out there.  I do not know what may have changed in the meantime <Col N="1147" /> that will lead the Taoiseach, and the other Heads of State or Government, to be assured that 1.3 per cent of Community GNP will now be sufficient to enable the Community to discharge its functions satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>It is important that that issue is thoroughly and energetically pursued. There are other aspects to this &mdash; I will deal with them in a moment &mdash; in relation to the contributions of other member states which affect the total amount available in terms of disposable funding for the Community in any given year.  The Taoiseach mentioned the fourth resource, the marginal resource the weight of which would increase as VAT declined.  I am not at all sure, and perhaps the Taoiseach over the next few days will give us more information about this, to what extent the nature, the size and the procedure relating to that resource had been defined.  In the June Communique that was not made very clear.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is no official communique from last weekend's meeting except in relation to those parts of the meeting that had to do with foreign affairs outside the Community.  The House should know to what extent the nature and the operation of that fourth resource has been clarified.  As the Taoiseach has pointed out on every issue in the course of his remarks, anything that is now on the table is still tentative, is still subject to further discussion.  Perhaps there is an area there where that particular element of the Community's resources could be made more definite and could be given a clearer focus than it now seems to have.</P>
    <P>The failure to reach agreement also affects the 1988 budget for the Community. It is clear that a budget in the order of 40 billion ECUs is needed for 1988 in order to allow the Community to carry on and to discharge its responsibilities under existing policies.  I am afraid that there again the Taoiseach is being a wee bit optimistic in relation to what will prevail until such time as a budget is agreed for 1988.  As he has pointed out, under existing arrangements the Community <Col N="1148" /> will continue to operate and be financed on the basis of one-twelfth of the 1987 expenditure for each month during which there is not an 1988 budget.  The Taoiseach went on to say that the failure to reach agreement on the nature of the Community's resources, by which I take it he meant the budget, was regrettable but not fatal to the functioning of the Community.  That is true as far as it goes. It is not fatal in that the Community would be able to keep on functioning but only after a fashion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach I am sure will know, and I can assure him from personal experience of looking at this from two sides of the budgetary process, once in the Commission and once in Government here, that the provisional twelfth procedure is an extremely irksome procedure and one which makes it very difficult from month to month to be sure that the Community's operations can be properly carried out.  They make it very difficult for the Commission to plan expenditure and those difficulties in the Commission inevitably spill over into member states, and particularly member states which are drawing down substantial amounts from any of the current expenditure areas in the Community budget from month to month, as is our case in relation to expenditure on the market intervention system.</P>
    <P>As long as there is not agreement on the 1988 budget there will be a double disability for us.  First, there will be the inevitable difficulties that come about as a result of the operation of the provisional one-twelfths, and then there will be the other point now in discussion, to which the Taoiseach referred, that is, a proposal that payments to member states from FEOGA guarantees would be delayed for two and a half months instead of two months as has been the case in regard to the arrangements agreed for 1987.  That is another factor which will push onto the member states a yet greater proportion of the cost of funding the FEOGA guarantee expenditure.  The longer the member states have to wait, the more it costs them and the less the cost is to the Community budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> For member states like ourselves which rely very heavily from month to month on our drawings on the intervention expenditure in the Community, that will create an additional cost in that we will have additional payments to carry and to finance ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interest provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not cover the whole amount of the interest by any means and obviously any extension of the delay between obligation and payment creates an extra cost for us.</P>
      <P>We have, of course, the very complex discussion going on about the future shape of the Common Agricultural Policy and the future level of funding of that policy.  In that regard, I presided over the Council of Ministers in the second half of 1984 when we finally reached agreement on the first expression of budgetary disciplines as it would apply to agriculture.  I remember at the time that the Taoiseach and his colleagues were highly critical of that development and regarded it in some way as being a curb on the future contribution of agricultural expenditure in the Community to this country.</P>
      <P>We now find before us an even more restrictive proposal where, we are told by the Taoiseach today, it is proposed that the rate of growth of agricultural expenditure would not be allowed to exceed 60 per cent of the rate of growth of total Community expenditure.  If total Community expenditure were increasing at 2½ per cent per annum, the maximum rate of growth in agricultural expenditure would be 1.5 per cent.  That will create difficulties for us in future.  I am glad the Taoiseach indicated a deal of concern in this and I hope his degree of concern becomes sharper between now and next February because this is one of the central issues, both in the short term and in the long term, which must concern us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has pointed out &mdash; and we must welcome it &mdash; that the cost of surplus disposal is now not to be included in the base on which the budgetary discipline provisions are to be funded in <Col N="1150" /> relation to agricultural expenditure.  That is an important point and I hope that particular part of what is now in discussion will survive to final agreement in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly well agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it because this is an important matter from our point of view.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to another aspect of the restrictions in relation to agriculture, that is, that the arrangements in relation to the milk sector will involve some reduction in the compensation for suspended milk quotas after 1988-89. That is an area which would be of very considerable concern to us, and would be of most concern to the Irish milk producers who have the smallest quotas.  This is another part of a complex of measures which will make it more and more difficult for small milk producers to face the future with any confidence that there is room for them to expand.  The detailed measures we take in relation to the operation of the flexibility provisions on milk quotas must be very carefully looked at so that we do not inadvertently reinforce these restrictive measures which tend to work very strongly against the interests of the smaller milk producers.</P>
      <P>The doubling of the provision for the structural funds is essential.  This is one of the areas of most concern to us in this latest failure of the European Council to reach agreement.  The Taoiseach has not mentioned this and perhaps he might be able to clarify it for us.  The Taoiseach is speaking as if the matter under discussion were the expansion of the amount which will be available in the structural fund by 1992.  I am given to understand that there are suggestions that the date on which any expansion should fully take place should be postponed until 1995.  If that is the case we would take the most serious view of it because we will need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know it has dropped.  I am a bit worried that the <Col N="1151" /> Taoiseach thinks it has dropped so soon after the meeting.  I am very concerned that he makes sure it has been dropped and that 1992 is the date we are talking about, the date by which the structural funds should be doubled in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows perfectly well that his present Minister for Finance was the man who came into this House and twice claimed he had killed the milk quotas.  This is a many headed monster and it kept coming back.  I hope this 1995 date for the increase in the structural funds does not turn out the same way because some of these things, as my colleague Deputy Barry says, have a habit of reappearing.  I want the Taoiseach to make sure that the date 1995 stays off the agenda and that the doubling of the structural funds takes place in 1992.  It is essential that agreement be reached on that at the earliest possible moment so that we can begin to take the measures needed to ensure that we fully and properly utilise the extra resources which will become available.</P>
      <P>In some discussions I have had &mdash; and I hope the Taoiseach will not be upset by this &mdash; with diplomatic persons from embassies in Dublin over the last week or two, and I must confess I was trying to use undue influence on some of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was wined and dined and enjoyed it enormously.  I was making the point that the importance of this matter tends to be lost on some other member states.  I made the point in particular that it was grossly offensive not only to other member states but particularly to us, that there should have been even a suggestion in the weeks coming up to the Council meeting that some member states believed all the extra <Col N="1152" /> funds in the structural funds should be reserved for the two newest members of the Community.  That I would regard as gross provocation.  I hope the Taoiseach can confirm that we can take some comfort in the knowledge that that bit of nonsense is no longer on the table.</P>
      <P>I would like to go further and point out to the Taoiseach and his colleagues that the European People's Party group in the European Parliament have made a submission to the Christian Democrat Heads of State and Government in the Community insisting that the present system of spreading the structural funds over a wide area must be abandoned in favour of the system of multi-annual integrated programmes concentrated on the most needy areas.  That is the structure for which we must work because it will allow us the greatest level of control and level of selection in picking the projects and the uses of those funds which are most suited to our needs.  It is important that we get clear decisions on the timetable for increasing the level of expenditure from the structural funds at an early date so that we can get on with building up proper programmes to use the funds to our greatest advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is on the table at the moment in relation to the rate of recoupment from the structural funds is a rate of 75 per cent in less developed regions compared with a rate of 50 per cent at present.  That is a most welcome proposal and I hope the Taoiseach will use his maximum energies to make sure that that proposal stays there and is part of the final agreement. The problem of the British rebate continues unabated, to coin a phrase.  The Taoiseach dealt with this very briefly and the only thing that encourages me from what the Taoiseach said is his comment to the effect that the issue is far from resolved.  This is an area where there is a great need for the Taoiseach and indeed some of his colleagues, the heads of other Goverments, to assist the interests of common sense and of the smaller countries in the Community.  It is an argument that has been going on for some time and I am sure it will go on for some to come. It really is flying in the face of reality <Col N="1153" /> for the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany to continue to argue in the way they do about contributions to the Community budget as if that budget were all that was there in terms of activity in the Community, when the rest of us know perfectly well that the net position of the United Kingdom and Germany in relation to the Community budget is only a very small part of the total benefit they derive from the existence of the Community.  That will become more and more the case as the single market is developed in the years up to 1992 and beyond.  I hope in discussions on that issue that the Taoiseach gives full rein to the dictates of common sense because the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Chancellor of Federal Germany give full rein to a very partial view as far as they are concerned of the relationship between Community contributions and the total benefit from Community membership.</P>
    <P>In relation to that part of the business of the Council, between now and February it is essential that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food get on their bikes and meet and discuss with their colleagues in the other capitals of the Community to make sure that our concerns are fully understood by the other member states and also to make sure that when the Taoiseach arrives at the next European Council meeting he will know the ground he is fighting on.  It is a very worthwhile process and, properly carried out, can bring substantial advantages.  It stood us in very good stead in the arguments a couple of years ago about the starting size of the milk quota system.  It also served us extremely well during the debates on the Single European Act and, therefore, I urge the Taoiseach and his Ministers between now and February to get going in a determined way on that kind of direct personal lobbying and discussions with our counterparts in the other member states.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach has included a very brief paragraph about Anglo-Irish <Col N="1154" /> relations which I admit is customary in these statements.  I also note that the contents of that brief paragraph and the contents of what the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said in her own briefing after the meeting seemed to have been couched in slightly less angular terms than was the case on a previous occasion. I do not know what is behind it and I am sure the House will understand me if I say that I am more than a little sceptical about what lies behind the language.  I hope, however &mdash; I am a born optimist &mdash; that there is some reality behind the apparent improvement in relations between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister on matters connected with the Anglo-Irish Agreement generally because it is important that that process is carried through with energy and dedication. The Taoiseach has no need of my advice to know that there is no difficulty whatever involved for the process of Anglo-Irish relations if he is fairly blunt and straightforward with the UK Prime Minister on the other issues that have been dealt with in relation to the European Council because the divergence of interest between the UK and Ireland on those matters is well known, of long standing and will probably remain until the UK finally gets some common sense and comes around to our point of view in relation to those issues.  As I said, I hope there is some foundation for the apparent warming up in relations between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher in this connection.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Taoiseach's statement here this afternoon one is immediately struck at the difference between it and the kind of <Col N="1155" /> statement he would make if he was sitting on this side of the House listening to a report on the unfortunate failure, for the second Council in a row, which the Copenhagen Council has been.  It is disturbing to see that the European Community, within months of receiving a new momentum and dynamic with the coming into force of the Single European Act, should now find itself reeling under the weight of a deep and disturbing financial crists.  The plain fact is that the European Community is effectively bankrupt.  That bankrupcy arises even at the current levels of spending within the Community, let alone any anticipated increases in spending programmes.  The accession of Spain and Portugal has fundamentally altered the balances in the Community.</P>
      <P>Those two countries alone now account for an increase of 71 per cent in the expenditure on disadvantaged or poorer regions in the Community.  They have also changed the north-south plans in terms of the focus of attention in relation to agricultural issues.  Not surprisingly, this situation has led to huge pressure on the budget, both in terms of its overall size and in terms of the distribution of spending as between agriculture and other items such as regional and social spending.</P>
      <P>For the next two months at least, and depending on the outcome of the emergency Council meeting to be held by the heads of Government in Brussels in February, the European Community will be forced to live from hand to mouth on the basis of spending on a monthly basis not more than one-twelfth of last year's approved expenditure levels in each month.  This is totally unsatisfactory when we consider the state of the international economic climate, the climate within the European Community itself and the prospect of falling output and growing unemployment throughout the Community.  It places an even greater onus on the Taoiseach and the other heads of Government to ensure that at the very least, the Council in February comes to grips with the financial problems of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> In Copenhagen the Commission, through the Delors Plan brought forward their proposals for offering an essential counter-balance to the completion of the internal market within Europe.  One of the key objectives in bringing in the Single European Act was to ensure that by 1992 the market for free movement of goods, services, capital and people, would be fully completed.  To balance any negative effects which might arise in poorer regions the Delors Plan suggests the doubling of the Regional and Social Funds in order to produce a greater and more lasting economic and social cohesion within the Community.  This is absolutely vital to Ireland's national interest and every diplomatic effort should be made between now and next February to ensure that full effect is given to the Delors Plan.  Without it the Community will not only be bankrupt in financial terms, but in social, economic and moral terms, in so far as one of its objectives is to maintain a one-tier rather than a two-tier Community where the strong and the weak would jointly prosper.</P>
    <P>If at a Community level considerable effort is invested in trying to increase the Structural Funds such as the Regional and Social Funds then, equally, there should be an effort here on the ground in a nation such as ours, which from the European point of view is defined as a single disadvantaged region.  It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that over time more and more the flow of funds, especially the Regional Fund, through the Department of Finance has become a substitute for national expenditure.  It is important that the availability of significant funding for programmes of economic and social development here, coming through the Community, should be additional to whatever efforts we can make at home. To this end I would urge on the Government the introduction of a proper regional planning capacity which would allow the regions themselves to determine some of their own economic and social priorities and give them, for the first time direct access to Brussels.  This is in order to ensure that such funds as <Col N="1157" /> do come here are genuinely additional to whatever effort is being provided nationally in development terms.</P>
    <P>Although many might not presume to look to them for examples, I would suggest that it is entirely appropriate that Ireland look at one of the new member states and consider the Portuguese experience in terms of the development of regional policy.  Although it comes from an economic and social background considerably more disadvantaged than ours, Portugal offers a process to those involved in local authority and regional planning and development, a much more sophisticated capacity to plug into the Brussels network and into the European funds.  Thus they can ensure that in the region themselves those responsible for their development are capable of making a genuine input to policy making which most assuredly is not the case in this country.</P>
    <P>In addition to the need to develop new systems and structures which would open up the capacity for regions to deal with Brussels, decentralise the level of administration in this country and afford people genuine opportunity to become involved in planning and development of their own areas, it is also important that the Government here would act on a number of other fronts.  First, it is selfevident at this stage that the enormous pressure which is being exercised for reform of agricultural spending in the European Community is such that it will not go away.  In that context it is important that Irish agriculture be geared up to gain the maximum advantage in the new situation.  The ability to rely simply on intervention funds and pricing policy to shore up agricultural incomes, irrespective of the commodities being produced, the quality of the commodities being produced, the time cycle over which it is produced and so on will not do in future.</P>
    <P>It is important that developmental policies here in relation to a sector so vital as agriculture be produced in such a way as to maximise our prospects in income earning terms for that sector <Col N="1158" /> taking fully into account the kind of conditions likely to be faced within the new environment for the Common Agricultural Policy within Europe.  Simply to leave the situation standing still as has been the case to date is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, it is sad to relate that although the Single European Act has now come into force and has set a key target for the Community to achieve significant levels of harmonisation, and a Europe free from internal borders by 1992, it has been marked by a virtual total absence of emphasis by leaders here, both political and business leaders.  Much remains to be done in this regard.  For example, I am aware of the results of a recent survey conducted in France which indicated that in excess of 80 per cent of all French businessmen were aware of the fact that 1992 was a key target date for industrial and commercial activity and had serious implications for themselves and their business if they were to survive and prosper in the future.  In Britain recently, a similar survey indicated a level of awareness slightly below 5 per cent in the business community.  I am not aware of any such survey being conducted in Ireland but I would be surprised if the level of awareness of the key implications of the 1992 date was a great deal greater than is the case in Britain.</P>
    <P>If Ireland wants to play a full role in the Community then it must do so by anticipating changes which are clearly evident for all to see under the Single European Act, and by ensuring that we develop programmes and systems to maximise the advantages to ourselves within those changes.  Bearing 1992 in mind, that means that we must be gearing up now in 1987, and into 1988, for the implications of the movement towards a single internal market within the Community. It is not sufficient to wait until 1991, and late in December in that year, to start seeking a whole set of derogations for Ireland, or to start taking legislative steps that arise from it, as was the case with the Single European Act itself in this House last December.  We are in a position now to fully anticipate many of the implications and consequences of the movement towards a single market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> The growth and dynamic prospects which the European Community offers to this country which is so heavily dependent on international trade still remain enormous.  I would urge on the Government to use all of the political and diplomatic pressure at their command to ensure the success of the emergency council in Brussels next February to ensure that the Community is put on a sound financial footing and to ensure that that financial footing is such as to allow the implementation of the Delors Plan which would double the regional resources.  More than that it is vitally important that the level of resources given to the Community institutions be such as to allow the Community to get on with its business between now and 1992 and keep its eye on the firm objectives of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>Year in and year out we witness this sordid wrangling about who should pay what, to whom and when, in a Community which is on the verge of bankruptcy. That has got to stop.  In such a context, and assuming that there is a firm financial footing within the Community for a period of several years it might be well worth reviewing the six monthly holding of these Councils or Summits between the heads of state.  None of the treaties within Europe provides for the holding of these summits, other than a brief reference in the recent Single European Act.  More than that, they give rise to all sorts of uncommonly high expectations about results which are presumed to follow because of the importance of the individuals attending the meetings. These have become more and more a distraction from the fundamental Community business.  If the Community can place itself on a firm footing for a number of years, it might be better if we had fewer summits and got on with the job of completing the internal market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with Deputy Barry's view that that is the case. <Col N="1160" /> If every six months the European Council is seen as a fallback it removes the pressure that would enable decisions to be arrived at more readily in the ordinary councils.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the Taoiseach's reference to his meeting, on what is called the margins of this Council, with the British Prime Minister.  What he has said here today is not new in the sense that it has already been reported through the media but nonetheless I would like to draw attentian to one or two aspects of what has been said in regard to that meeting.  I think, Sir, at the outset there was a sense of relief that the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister was not an unseemly slagging match, which at one point a week or two ago it appeared it might be.  Because it did not, we hope, evolve into that we feel relieved.  Nonetheless, we have no particular reason to be satisfied with the state of Anglo-Irish relations at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with that point more generally, I would like to refer to what the Taoiseach said here and what he said in Copenhagen.  Apparently it was the intention of the Government to make the new arrangements work satisfactorily and if any difficulties should arise the procedures would be further reviewed. That statement assumes, Sir, that we have in place a new and permanent procedure under the Act that was passed here last week and in the Seanad yesterday and that it would be necessary or appropriate at the end of, let us say, a 12 months period, which I think was the period mentioned by the Taoiseach last week in the House, to review the procedures to see whether any changes should be made.  In spite of the constant reassurances in these terms, and I think that commentators generally on this matter overlooked the fact that it will not arise, under the terms of the legislation passed in this House last Thursday evening, the question of a review in 12 months does not come up because the legislation goes out of force in 12 months' time. These assurances that were given publicly in this House and to Mrs. Thatcher at <Col N="1161" /> Copenhagen are therefore of no relevance, to say the least of it, because the procedure enacted here last week contains a provision in section 6, I think, whereby it expires of its own terms after 12 months anyway.  I think it is fair to say that you cannot review in 12 months something which comes to an end in 12 months anyway because its own terms have put it out of existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, if it has ended it has ended, as Deputy Mac Giolla has said.  I do not therefore see what importance, relevance or meaning these assurances of a review in 12 months will have.  Attention has not been drawn to the fact that the Bill will expire in 12 months' time in any event and can only be renewed and kept in law if motions are passed beforehand in both Houses, which I get the impression there is no intention of moving.  The fact that this has not been referred to, that the Bill is self-repealing at the end of 12 months, may well be due to an unwillingness to draw this fact to the attention of a number of people who might, if they fully understood the implications, be very dissatisfied indeed with this happening.  We are told that apparently an assurance was given last March to Deputy Blaney that an earlier Extradition Act would be, to quote the words he quoted &ldquo;allowed to wither away&rdquo;.  Happily that has not happened to the earlier Act but it is itself part of the legislation in regard to the later Act which is self-withering and will have disappeared in 12 months in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister was the second, I think, since the Taoiseach assumed office in March of this year.  But each of those meetings was brief and took place in the overall context of a European Council.  It is quite some time since the Taoiseach had a meeting with the British Prime Minister specifically on the point of Anglo-Irish relations.  I think that is regrettable, as these brief meetings which <Col N="1162" /> tend to produce short uninformative communiqués of clichés about the atmosphere are not much use and are not a substitute for real working meetings where the whole question of Anglo-Irish relations, which is of paramount importance to us, would be fully thrashed out.  I referred to Anglo-Irish relations in the debate last week on the Extradition Bill as did Deputy Harney and it was noticeable that the Minister for Justice reacted very strongly and extremely defensively to the observations we made and in considering why he did so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That reaction, Sir, is perhaps on a par with the reaction of the Minister for Justice last week.

      <P>I am sure that Deputy O'Malley will appreciate that the particular reference is contained in one short paragraph, and while the Chair appreciates that being there, that similar latitude will be given to Deputies entitled to make statements, the Chair would hope that we do not want a debate on this particular matter when such provisions are not in Standing Order 41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, my <Col N="1163" /> count makes it two paragraphs, but I take your point.  I simply say in conclusion, noting the sensitivities there are in this matter and the way they have been conveyed, it seems over recent months that Anglo-Irish relations are being conducted in what I would call a normal bilateral way with ambassadors.  Anglo-Irish relations should not be conducted in a normal bilateral way between the Taoiseach and the British Ambassador. We have the privilege and the good fortune to have a particular machinery under the Hillsborough Agreement of November 1985 whereby difficulties that arise from day to day in the course of Anglo-Irish relations may be sorted out.  We, in the Republic, have the privilege of having a say in certain aspects of things that happen or do not happen in Northern Ireland and I ask the question, and note the sensitivities it gives rise to, are we utilising that machinery at the moment?</P>
      <P>Are we using the very fortunate position we are in or are we allowing our relationship with Britain to revert to the pre-Hillsborough system of carrying it on between ambassadors or between Ministers and ambassadors as is the case in our bilateral arrangements with any other country?  If we are doing that &mdash; and all the evidence seems to suggest that we are &mdash; then we are doing a very foolish thing because we are allowing to run into disuse one of the most valuable pieces of progress this country has made since independence in terms of Anglo-Irish relations.  I would greatly deplore the failure to use that agreement to the fullest possible extent.  I would be extremely sorry to see these 15-minute or half-hour meetings on the margin of the European Council being substituted for the very valuable procedure which exists for our benefit, as well as for the benefit of the British, in Maryfield in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to divide my comments between the two aspects which have been developed in the responses to the Taoiseach's statement, namely, the internal discussions of the <Col N="1164" /> Council itself and the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and Prime Minister Chirac.</P>
      <P>We can thank the Taoiseach for ensuring that in the course of these difficult meetings no hostages were given by us in relation to the fundamental issue of the 1988 budget, the preservation of our ongoing policy in relation to the CAP and the pressure we are continuing to exert that the social and regional funds should be substantially enlarged.  There is a common policy shared by almost all parties in this House that the thrust of Ireland's accession to the Single European Act should be adhered to and that we should continue even more strenuously to ensure that the commitment to greater economic and social cohesion within the community should be pressed forward.  Therefore, it is a matter of very serious disappointment that the budget for 1988 will have to stagger along in great difficulty.  There will be an over-run of about five million ECUs from February onwards out of a total expenditure this year of about 41 million ECUs.  That is totally unsatisfactory and it has considerable implications for the forecasting of the Irish budget and the general receipts and expenditures in our own Exchequer.  It is a matter of the utmost disappointment.</P>
      <P>We must remember some of the statements made in the first half of this year by our European partners regarding our failure in that period to endorse the Single European Act and the pressure they brought on us to have the ratification completed by way of referendum as a matter of the utmost urgency.  It is disappointing that in the latter part of this year they are beginning to sit back and allow German and French considerations in particular to dominate overall decisions once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Fund and the Regional Fund are of crucial importance to this country, being worth the best part of £200 million per year.  Without the income to the Exchequer from those two funds our ongoing budget arrangements would be in dire difficulty.  I was particularly <Col N="1165" /> impressed by the proposal that there should be a 75 per cent recoupment in future.  One of the ironic benefits is that it would stop the perennial arguments in the Department of Finance in relation to Exchequer contributions matching regional and social fund contributions. We have absorbed the revenue successfully and competently but we have always been very reluctant to have a matching Exchequer contribution and there have been circular arguments internally in the Department of Finance.  To that extent I share some of the criticism made by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>I do not share his criticism relating to the Irish capacity to avail of and use those funds.  We all have considerable experience of the extent to which the Greek Government, for example, continue to fail to avail of the Social Fund and the Regional Fund and I am not at all convinced from my knowledge of the embryonic administrative structures of the Spanish and Portuguese accession that they are even one-fifth as competent as we are in availing of the social and regional funds.  Ireland has benefited in very large measure from those funds and I am very disappointed that there is no enlargement of the funds on a very committed basis.  It is a matter of great concern.</P>
    <P>There has been a diminution in the health area, in which we availed of substantial benefits from the European funds, and a diminution of expenditure in the education area from which we milked a good deal of Social Fund moneys in the past two or three years. Many a third level student has gained substantially as a result.  There has also been a diminution of our Exchequer contribution from own resources in the environment area which was supplemented substantially by the Regional Fund contributions. I stress very adamantly that any reduction in these two vital funds would have a very immediate and substantial impact on the future of our own Exchequer contributions.  I hope that in February there will be this commitment, giving us some added increment into 1992 <Col N="1166" /> and onwards.  This would be a very considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>I equally stress that my party are becoming very worried that the major members of the Community will press ahead with substantial measures for the completion of the internal market by 1992 without the parallel development of those funds.  Unless these developments go in tandem there could be tremendous repercussions and implications for employment here and the overall budget situation.  For example, there would be a very serious impact on our VAT structure. Unless there is parallel development of the Social and Regional Funds with the integration of the market by 1992, we will suffer greatly in our economic prospects.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect which could be in some respects catastrophic for us in the years ahead unless a very careful and very emphatic Irish governmental policing of these developments is kept in train.  To that extent there is some merit in suggesting that we should have a White Paper from the Government because it is quite a long time since we have had a White Paper on this matter.  We had various documents arising out of the Single European Act but it might well be desirable that the Government put together a White Paper which would find considerable support in this House as there is virtually all party unanimity on national policy on such matters.  This would be of great benefit to the country and also to those of us who have contacts with our counterparts, for example, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and also at European Council level.  We could present a national coherent joint European approach from the Government in relation to the internal market, to our policy on CAP &mdash; which is undergoing continuing development &mdash; to the structural funds and particularly in relation to taxation policy, for example, the changes in VAT.  These are of major impact and it would be particularly beneficial if, coming up to the next Council meeting, we had a Government White Paper to assist us in that regard.  There is a need for a restatement and for a clear emphatic <Col N="1167" /> pronouncement from the Government as we enter the further difficult discussions in 1988 in relation to such policy matters. These are the main points I want to make in relation to the internal discussions of the Council meeting.</P>
    <P>Regarding the side meeting which is now customary between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister one can only say that one is pleased it went off all right &mdash; if I may use such mundane terms. My party are pleased that the Anglo-Irish Agreement effectively has been reaffirmed and consolidated to the extent acknowledged by the British Government. Admittedly, the British Prime Minister was very circumspect in her observations.  I understand she said that the Anglo-Irish Agreement continues.  I cannot imagine any more minimalist statement but I think we know the thrust of her intent in that regard.  In that framework it was understandable that she should make a comment of that nature. She herself has been utterly bemused at times by the true reaction of the Taoiseach and has been quite uncertain concerning the real reaction of the Taoiseach in regard to such matters.</P>
    <P>I trust that the meeting with the British Prime Minister has clarified the position in relation to extradition.  The House last week was in a state of utter bemusement as to what exactly was the Government's policy.  We have now managed to decipher all the signals.  I could not blame the British Prime Minister in having great difficulty in trying to assess and put into a framework what it was exactly the Irish Government were trying to achieve.  I appreciate the appalling difficulty the Taoiseach had with his own backbenchers on this matter but he appears to have successfully &mdash; and I congratulate him in this regard &mdash; sidelined all the recalcitrant, more obdurate and more Nean-derthaloid of those Members of his backbench who have a profound misunderstanding of the process of Anglo-Irish relations and indeed a more profound misunderstanding of the process of Irish extradition.  Therefore, the clarification has come as a matter of great <Col N="1168" /> benefit to our country and to our relations with the United Kingdom.  I have no doubt that these relations can go ahead.</P>
    <P>In that regard I was pleased to see that the Minister for Health met, in the past day or so, his Northern Ireland counterpart, Richard Needham, for discussions on matters of mutual and direct interest in the health area.  I presume that was done &mdash; as was the case when I had such meetings, with the holder of that office &mdash; under the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I presume that that equally happened at the meeting which took place in Barretstown Castle in the past few days.  I urge that that process be continued because it would be, above all else, profoundly educational and beneficial to the Government party.  It would strengthen their resolve to change their policy, as they have changed, very considerably in relation to Anglo-Irish relations and would lead to the elimination of the endemic distrust which has, unfortunately, infected a good deal of these relations.  We are, to borrow the phrase used by Deputy O'Malley, relieved that the meeting went all right.</P>
    <P>I note from the Taoiseach's comment that a separate meeting was held with Prime Minister Chirac.  That intrigued me even more.  I presume it was not just a discussion on whether a legion of honour should be given to Stephen Roche for Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it extended beyond that.  I imagine that the French Prime Minister gave some interesting information in relation to the <i>Eksund</i> affair.  In that regard I should like to say to the Taoiseach that I still find myself in a position of absolute bemusement at the fact that he has not yet commented in any way on such matters, particularly our relations with Libya.  I have no doubt whatever that the British Prime Minister raised the matter with him.  As she has referred to the matter in public presumably she referred to it in private. When one recalls that the leader of that particular country has made it absolutely <Col N="1169" /> clear that he is providing arms to the IRA for a double barrel purpose &mdash; (a) for their activities in Northern Ireland and (b) to eliminate physically from this earth the British Prime Minister, I have no doubt that she is aware of that &mdash; I would regard it extraordinary if she did nor raise the matter.  If the Taoiseach did not raise with Prime Minister Chirac the matter of the framework of our diplomatic relations with Libya &mdash; relations that should cease &mdash; the three line comment made today needs some further elaborate reading but I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the Taoiseach any further in relation to his report to this House except to say that it is highly unsatisfactory that under Standing Order 41 &mdash; this is a point which might be raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; the Taoiseach of the day should be subjected to, in the proper parliamentary sense, so many questions and so many observations without being given the opportunity to respond.  This has been a long-burning issue in this House.  I have always held the view that when a statement is made by the Taoiseach he should have an opportunity to respond to the major issues raised.  He is getting a multiple response from the four separate political parties in Opposition. He should have an opportunity to respond briefly to the major issues raised because frequently such statements, including today's, raise more questions than are contained within the statement. That is inevitable.  That procedure should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. The first thing to be said about the Summit, and probably the only thing that can be said about it, is that it was a flop. No amount of talk or suggestions of any progress having been made, or of many problems having been dealt with, can avoid that fact.  It was so much a failure that the Heads of Government had to set up another meeting for February, four months ahead of the next scheduled meeting.</P>
      <P>Despite the assurances given during the course of the debate on the Single European Act not many months ago that the doubling of the Regional and Social Funds was a virtual certainty, we are still no closer to agreement on that issue than we were 12 months ago.  The Taoiseach in his remarks today repeated that the Commissioners are all for doubling of the funds &mdash; of course the Government are all for doubling of the funds &mdash; but the fact is we have not got it.  We are as far away from that objective as ever.</P>
      <P>During the course of the referendum campaign on the Single European Act. The Workers' Party urged that the doubling of these funds should be a pre-condition to Ireland's ratification of the Act. Supporters of the Act on both sides of the House told the public, in all their propaganda in the course of that campaign, that this was a needless safeguard. Now we can see that the size of the Regional and Social Funds is regarded as a matter of trading and bargaining between the more prosperous powers in the EC.  The warning we issued during the campaign on the Single European Act, in the light of the flop of the Summit in Copenhagen, can be seen to have been sound political sense.  It will be found, in the intervening years of 1992, that the ratification of the Single European Act, without any pre-conditions or derogations, simply to show that we are good Europeans will have hung like an albatross round our necks and will have caused us increasing trouble in areas such as tax harmonisation and so on as the years progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The Workers' Party regard the European Regional and Social Funds as potentially the most important instruments in our economic development.  Right from the time of our entry to the EC they were one of the major factors which we saw as not something which had been finalised but rather was advocated as most important for those outside of farming.  Unfortunately successive Governments, Coalition and Fianna Fáil, who have been in power since 1972, failed to make the most effective use of the funds this country obtained.  In addition, the money allocated by the Community to the funds has never been adequate to meet the demands on them although, as has been said before, Ireland has received a higher than average positive response to applications for funding especially from the Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The Regional Development Fund could be of major economic benefit to Ireland because funds emanating from it can be put into productive areas of our economy, such as food processing, technology and the others outlined by the Taoiseach.  One of the reasons for the failure to use the benefits of that fund effectively has been the need for Irish investment of approximately 45 per cent. A reduction in this investment to a level of 25 per cent, if it does occur, will be of great importance.  Of the Regional Development Fund money allocated to Ireland from 1975 to 1984, over 70 per cent was expended on infrastructural development, such as roads, rail and communications, most important infrastructural developments in themselves. But, while infrastructural spending created some jobs, both directly and indirectly, as a policy it has failed simply because, in trying to create an environment suitable for investment, Governments relied on private enterprise to complete the process.  Capitalism has failed to invest and so negated the whole infrastructural spending policy.</P>
    <P>With the accession of Greece, Spain and Portugal to the Community, all countries with similar levels of development and problems to ours, it was clear that <Col N="1172" /> existing levels of spending on the Social and Regional Funds would need to be very substantially increased, doubled at least.  This has not happened and increasingly the Community is showing the strain.  Ireland must now vigorously oppose the predictable monetarist approach to this problem advocated by Mrs. Thatcher, that of seeking cuts in other areas before agreeing to any increased social and regional funding.  We must seek the co-operation of our natural allies in the EC, expecially Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, to join with us to procure substantial increases in social and regional funding.  Implementation of the single internal market by 1992 must be conditional on progress being made on the Regional and Social Funds.  Between now and February next I hope the Government will be engaging in much hard footslogging around Europe to gain support for our position.</P>
    <P>In relation to the communiqué issued after this latest Summit we welcome the positive attitude shown to the agreement on the elimination of short and intermediate-range nuclear weapons from Europe.  As the communiqué describes it, it is indeed a milestone and could create the conditions and climate for further steps towards full nuclear disarmament. The policy of this country should be a nuclear-free Europe and, by Europe, we mean not just the EC but Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. We hope that, without compromising our neutral position, the Government will pursue this objective within the EC.  The attitude of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, who apparently believes that nuclear weapons are necessary to preserve peace, is perverse.  I believe she does not speak for the majority of people of Europe in this matter if, indeed, she speaks even for the majority of the people of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, I hope that both Governments will co-operate fully, not alone to defeat terrorism, but to work for peace and political progress in Northern Ireland.  Without political progress, especially towards devolved government <Col N="1173" /> and protection of civil liberties under a Bill of Rights, the climate for the elimination of terrorism will not exist.  The establishment of devolved government was one of the objectives agreed by the two Governments when they signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement two years ago.  I do not know whether this matter was raised at the meeting between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher.  I was very shocked and disappointed to learn that the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Tom King, recently told a delegation from The Workers' Party who met him in Belfast, that the Dublin Government had not once, since the Agreement was signed, raised the matter of devolved government.  I asked a question about that this afternoon and it was not denied by the Minister.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was commenting on Deputy Boland's allegation that the new arrangements with the banks and building societies will result in inadequate funds being available for house purchasers on modest incomes in 1988. The opposite will, in fact, be the case, as the public capital programme provision for 1988 will be £100 million and this, with the additional £70 million which will be available from the commercial agencies will be more than adequate to meet demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland asked me to outline the extent to which the Agency has been successful in replacing its short-term borrowing with long term conventional borrowing. In the year ended 30 June 1987 the Agency succeeded in raising £82 million by conventional borrowing.  This borrowing consists of ten year foreign currency loans from Irish based banks and I am happy to say it has been raised at very attractive interest rates.  The House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to give specific details <Col N="1180" /> of the interest rates applicable to this borrowing due to the confidential nature of such transactions.  While the Agency has significantly reduced its reliance on short term borrowing, the level of its short term borrowing is still unacceptably high, due principally to its expanded role in funding not only income related loans but also the new convertible loans and the traditional annuity or SDA loan.  I can assure Deputy Boland that the Agency is continuing to make every effort to reduce its dependence on short term borrowing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland commented that the 1988 Estimates did not reflect the fact that there were arrangements in train to transfer demand for house loans to building societies and other commercial institutions.  The fact is that negotiations were going on with the commercial institutions about this matter but had not reached fruition at the time the Estimates were published.  It would not, therefore, have been appropriate to assume the outcome of the negotiations at that time for the purpose of presenting a more favourable picture in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland suggested that there is a contradiction between the Minister's press release and a quotation in the <i>Irish Press</i>.  There is no contradiction.  The press statement simply stated that the public capital programme provision for house loans would be reduced.  This is a simple statement of fact and it contains no suggestion as to how the saving would be used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland and Deputy Gibbons asked the cost of the guarantee.  The Deputies will appreciate that it is very difficult at this time to forecast with any degree of accuracy the expenditure which may arise under this guarantee, other than to say &mdash; as was said in the Minister's press release of 27 October &mdash; that the cost is not likely to be very significant. Experience in other countries indicates that this type of guarantee does not give rise to significant costs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn complained about the guarantee which he sees as minimising the risk of the building society or bank. This is not the case.  Our guarantee will cover only half of any loss suffered by the <Col N="1181" /> lending agency and our exposure will be limited to half the amount by which the loan exceeded 75 per cent of the value of the house.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Boland and Deputy Quinn expressed concern about the requirement that applicants should first approach a building society or a bank before seeking a local authority loan.  As both Deputies are aware the SDA loan scheme was always intended to assist those who were in need of housing and could not otherwise house themselves. Consequently, it has been a feature of the SDA scheme over the years that applicants should satisfy the local authority that they were unable to get a loan from the commercial lending agencies.  I accept that this requirement may have been implemented to varying degrees by different authorities.  The requirement that an applicant now obtain a refusal from both a bank and a building society is necessary in the light of the arrangement whereby the banks and the building societies have undertaken to contribute £70 million to the sector of the mortgage market currently catered for by the local authorities.  In the absence of such a requirement there would not be an effective transfer of applications to these institutions.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the suggestion that local authorities should assess all applicants in the first instance.  How could a local authority have access to the criteria used by each bank or building society for assessing applicants?  It would inconvenience an applicant far more if he was assessed by a local authority, told to go to a bank or a building society, was refused by them and then had to return to the local authority.  It would be preferable that he go to a bank or a building society first, so that when he arrives at a local authority he knows his application will be accepted and processed.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise once again that these arrangements with a commercial lending agency will not affect a person's capacity to house himself.  On the contrary, there will be more funds available in 1988 than would otherwise have been available.  In <Col N="1182" /> addition, the borrower has a greater choice and more flexibility in choosing the type of loan financing most suited to his particular needs.  I want to say that there were some teething problems in regard to the implementation of this scheme.  These are being overcome and I am glad to be able to say that.  If anyone has any problems in regard to it I will be only too glad to take them up with the various local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kitt and Roche asked that all loan applications on hand be dealt with by the local authorities.  The position is that the local authorities are being instructed to pay all loans which were approved and to continue to process unapproved applications where they are satisfied that hardship would be caused by reason of the stage to which the application or the house purchase transaction had progressed.  In practice, only applications which have recently been received will be referred back.  It must be borne in mind that the loan commitments entered into at this time of the year will form a large part of the actual payments in 1988.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that those who will get a loan from a commercial agency be referred to these agencies now so that the agencies can fulfil their funding commitments for 1988.  I must emphasise that there were some teething problems in regard to that with the local authorities and I have tried to rectify them as best I possibly could.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked what would happen where a lending agency agrees to give an inadequate loan.  This would, of course, be a refusal and would be treated as such by a local authority.  I want to emphasise that where a local authority decide on the reduced amount, as far as the applicant is concerned, if that is not sufficient, he can go back to the local authority.  That can be counted as a very fair arrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland referred to the introduction of variable interest rates for annuity and convertible loans.  I cannot agree that a variable interest rate at a time of falling interest rates will be a disadvantage to borrowers.  Indeed, since interest rates have fallen there have been <Col N="1183" /> calls to have the fixed interest rate at 12.5 per cent, which applied from 1978 until 1985, reduced for those borrowers on this rate.  I have indicated that the variable interest rate will not exceed the rate charged by the building societies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland stated that the agency only advanced £3.5 million in the first six months of this year compared to £78 million in 1986.  This statement was very misleading as the £3.5 million related only to HFA loans which were approved to 1 July 1986 and paid in 1987.  The agency's financing of loans in 1987 is through funds advanced directly to local authorities for on-lending to individual borrowers.  The agency will advance about £95 million to local authorities for loans in 1987.  This compares very favourably with their payments in 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons inquired as to when the Housing Finance Agency will meet their own cost.  This is a very good point and one to which I would like to be able to reply to with a degree of accuracy. However, as has been pointed out by Deputy Gibbons, the agency were established at a time of high inflation and when index-linked borrowing was attractive. This is not now the case and the agency have had to rely on conventional borrowing to fund income-related loans where the repayments of borrowers are income-related and are more easily matched with index-linked funding.</P>
    <P>The cost of this is being met through the interest swop arrangement.  As I stated in my opening speech, it is expected that on the basis of current interest and exchange rate trends and the increasing capacity of the agency to fund loans from capital repayments, the cost of the interest swop will decrease gradually over the years.  It is not possible to say exactly when the agency will meet its cost.  It should, however, be remembered that in the future there will be a return to the Exchequer on the funds which they are effectively investing in the agency on an index-linked basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland and Deputy Quinn referred to the availability of local authority houses.  As has been stated, the very <Col N="1184" /> low numbers on local authority waiting lists and the high number of vacant houses indicate clearly that the availability of local authority houses will not be a problem in 1988.  There is no shortage of local authority houses at present. We are housing large numbers of single people, unmarried mothers, the homeless and others.  I also want to point out that in many parts of the country people are now decided on the type of house they are going to take in an area.  I can speak about country areas where people can now say whether they want an end house or a middle house in an estate. People from many parts of the country have said to me that they will not take a middle house because they want and end house.  That shows that there is a new position in regard to housing and especially in regard to local authority housing.  In the Dublin area there are a number of vacant houses and I would like to see a speedier allocation of houses from the point of view of vandalism and other reasons as well.  What I would like to see happening is that local authorities would be able to process applications more speedily and that the handing over of houses would be quicker also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned about the condition of local authority housing estates.  In the first instance I must emphasise that the management and maintenance of their housing stock is a matter for the local authority.  I would point out that the remedial works scheme operated by my Department provides assistance to local authorities to carry out major works to their housing schemes. I have already approved a number of proposals in the Dublin Corporation area.  The corporation have very recently submitted further proposals which I am considering also.  The Deputy will appreciate that such a process must be gradual having regard to the financial resources available.  A capital loan is also being made available to the corporation to carry out improvement works to their dwellings under the local authority improvement works scheme.  The works involved would include the erection of <Col N="1185" /> extensions to relieve overcrowding and the provision of showers and bathroom facilities where none exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan suggested that there is a change in the way local authorities will assess applicants for loans.  This is not the case.  Once an applicant has failed to obtain a loan from a commercial lending agency, the local authority will assess the applicant in accordance with the criteria which they have always used.  The requirement that a local authority have regard to the applicant's housing needs is a condition which ensures that only those in need obtain a loan.  In considering applications for loans, local authorities are also required to be satisfied that the prospective borrower will be able to repay the loan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke at length about the conduct of building societies.  This is a matter for the Registrar of Friendly Societies in the first place and, therefore, I do not propose to discuss the matter.  I am sure the Deputy can appreciate the position in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell suggested that there should be greater flexibility for changing from income-related loans to annuity loans.  This flexibility does exist. A person can change from an income-related loan to an annuity loan at any time during the life of the loan.  The loan, will, however, continue to attract a variable interest rate which at present is very favourable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that the income limits for local authority loans be increased.  The present limits were set just over a year ago and I am satisfied that these limits are adequate.  As I mentioned earlier, the level of public funding of loans is already high and there would be no justification, therefore for creating a situation where this level would be increased even further.  I want to say in simple language that the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, took the income of both spouses into consideration for an SDA loan.  I will give a simple example of this.  If a husband earned £6,500 and his wife earned £4,000 they would not have qualified for an SDA <Col N="1186" /> loan.  The present Minister for the Environment changed that.  I think we should get some thanks for that because it is the income of the main breadwinner that is now taken into account for an SDA loan. I never agreed that the income of both spouses should have been taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt suggested that there should be different income limits for the different types of local authority loans. The reason we brought the limits together was to harmonise the income eligibility criteria for the three types of loans.  In that way we can identify clearly the people who qualify for a local authority loan and can offer them a range of loans to meet their individual needs.  I think it would be undesirable and confusing to have different categories of people eligible for different types of loans which are all operated by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa expressed anxiety about the fact that income-related loans can give rise to problems in that the amount owed can increase over the early years of the loan.  This can, of course, happen.  However, there is another side to this story, in that a loan can actually be reduced very quickly where a person's income increases.  Indeed, the Government's action in bringing down the rate of inflation has resulted in very low rates of interest applying to income-related loans and this has resulted in very many people reducing their loans much more quickly than had been expected.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to repossessions by local authorities.  Where a local authority repossess a house and it cannot be sold on the open market they can take it into stock and let it to a person in need of rehousing.  The outstanding debt on the house can be met from the local authority's internal capital receipts. Deputy De Rossa's suggestion that a borrower be allowed remain in this own house as a tenant is not practical as it would encourage default by borrowers who would make little effort to meet their loan repayments if they knew they would be left in the house on a differential rent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked how the HFA <Col N="1187" /> would dispose of the additional £500 million. There is no intention to change the basic purpose for which the agency was set up.  The additional funds which the agency will be empowered to borrow will be used to fund house purchase and improvement loans over the next four to five years.  Deputy Quinn accused us of dismantling the system which brought about the high level of home ownership. There is no basis for this allegation.  In fact, this Bill is intended to ensure that the HFA will have sufficient funds available to finance the demand for publicly funded loans over the next few years.  In addition, the recently announced arrangements which will enable the commercial lending agencies to increase their lending to people of modest means will increase the overall amount of money available.</P>
    <P>I should like to put the House on notice that I propose to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to extend the purposes for which the agency may advance money to local authorities under section 5 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981 to include the making of improvement loans and the payment of grants.  This amendment is necessary due to the expanded role of the agency in funding the provision in the public capital programme for house purchase and improvement loans and so on.  Included in this provision are funds to enable local authorities to pay house improvement loans and disabled persons and essential repair grants.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate.  If the Housing Finance Agency is to continue its important role in providing funds to local authorities for the provision of house purchase loans it is necessary that they be allowed to increase the amount they can borrow and that contributions can be made towards their costs to enable them to match the cost of funds raised by conventional means with income related payments by borrowers.  We experienced teething problems with the new arrangements with the banks and building societies but we are rectifying them.  In the case <Col N="1188" /> of all new schemes teething problems are experienced.  Any problems brought to my attention by Deputies will be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in bringing these two Bills before the House to-day.  They are long-awaited and sorely needed because on the one hand the Sound Broadcasting Bill provides the opportunity for a major and radical development of sound broadcasting services in this country while the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill will restore order to the chaos which has prevailed in the use of the airwaves for too long.</P>
      <P>I think, quite frankly, that it is an indictment of the legislative process that we have for so long failed to respond to a demand which we all know exists among the public for evolution in our radio services and that we have in effect tolerated a situation of lawlessness in the airwaves for over ten years.  Furthermore almost every major western European country has already introduced, or is in the process of introducing, independent nonstate operated radio services of one form or another and it is right that we should be part of this trend.</P>
      <P>I believe the proposals contained in the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987 are a considered and practical response to the demand I have referred to, a demand for:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>choice of radio services additional to <Col N="1189" /> those of RTE; involvement by the nonState sector in the provision of those services; the development of a new national radio service; new radio services at local level involving commercial and community interests and opportunities for increased competition.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the contents of the Sound Broadcasting Bill the first thing that has to be tackled is the situation of the pirates.  For the last ten years a situation has existed where up to 70 pirate radio stations have been operating in this country, the existence of which has brought the law into disrepute.  The Government are not prepared to allow this situation to continue.  Consequently we introduced the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill 1987.  I wish to state in no uncertain terms that the days of illegal broadcasting are numbered. Such activities will no longer be tolerated. The House has my assurance that the full rigours of the provisions of this Bill will, on coming into force, be applied systematically to those who persist in illegal broadcasting.  I should like to state that tonight we are creating history in that this is the first time in the ten years that illegal stations have been operating that legislation to put them off the air has been debated in either Chamber.  Legislation was introduced in the Seanad but not debated and the legislation introduced in the Dáil in 1981 was not debated.</P>
    <P>Examples of the offences and penalties which will apply under the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, are as follows:</P>
    <P>to knowingly suffer or permit an unlicensed broadcast to be made from a premises; to operate or assist in the operation of wireless telegraphy apparatus by which an unlicensed broadcast is made; to make available a structure or premises from which an unlicensed broadcast is to be made; to keep, have, supply, instal, repair or maintain wireless telegraphy apparatus for unlicensed broadcast purposes; to supply film or record material, to make a literary, dramatic or musical work, <Col N="1190" /> to make an artistic work, to participate in the making of film or record material for use in unlicensed broadcasts; to participate in unlicensed broadcasts as director, producer, announcer or otherwise and to advertise in unlicensed broadcasts or to publish programme schedules of unlicensed broadcasts.</P>
    <P>The penalties for all of these offences, on summary conviction will be £800 maximum and/or three months imprisonment. On conviction on indictment the penalty will be £20,000 maximum and/or two years imprisonment.  Using or allowing one's telephone or electricity service to be used to promote, further or facilitate a business engaged in illegal broadcasts will also be an offence.</P>
    <P>To turn to the Sound Broadcasting Bill 1987, I had several objectives in mind in devising this new Bill.  In the first instance I wanted it to be a workable and practical piece of legislation which would allow a wide spectrum of individuals and organisations to respond in a realistic fashion to the wide ranging demands of the public and at the same time to provide for the maintenance of certain basic standards. I think that the difference in approach between the Bill before the House and previous Bills, and I include my own party's Bills in this remark, reflects two major and connected developments.  The first is that the radio frequency planning carried out by my Department particularly in VHF has ensured that frequencies for broadcasting are no longer as scarce as they had been.  Secondly, the earlier concentration in Europe as a whole on structures, controls and regulation to ensure that the limited number of broadcasting services then available catered for all strata of society, is no longer relevant.  Accordingly taking account of these two developments I have attempted to devise a regime that will not be an obstacle to the emergence of radio services which the general public clearly wish to see developed.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty we face in preparing this legislation is to strike the right balance between the main objective of getting a variety of new radio services on the <Col N="1191" /> air and establishing the means to achieve this objective.  There are really two issues here; one, what legal framework should be put in place to oversee the development of the new services and, two, what programming requirements should be imposed on those who wish to establish the new services.</P>
    <P>On the first point I have no doubt that Deputies from all sides of the House will be able to put forward many excellent ideas and will express many genuinely held views as to how the Bill should be constructed.  However, the incorporation of such ideals has to be balanced with the acid test of practicability in implementation. The danger must be avoided of creating a situation in which nobody could afford to provide radio services which could meet the requirements of such legislation or if they honestly attempted to do so they would not be able to live up to its ideals.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies therefore to apply the critical tests of realism, practicality and workability to any views they feel inclined to put forward, to bear in mind that radio broadcasting costs money, that there is only a limited pool of revenue out there to support it and that every additional requirement or regulation they may seek to impose will have a cost implication both for those who provide the services and those who regulate them.  In addition, every additional requirement reduces the flexibility needed in legislation of this nature.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>On the second issue my own strong view is that the purpose of this legislation is to create the environment and framework which will allow individuals and organisations across the country the maximum opportunity to get involved at all levels of our society and to meet and respond to the public demands and requirements in the radio broadcasting sphere.  In this context the State cannot make the services we are talking about happen &mdash; it seeks only to provide the framework and the opportunity to allow the public make them happen.  For this reason, the State, and we as legislators, must resist the temptation to dictate to <Col N="1192" /> the public precisely what they can have. The whole pirate radio phenomenon &mdash; not just here but internationally &mdash; stemmed in large measure from the fact that establishment broadcasting services, which in the main were state-run monopolies were not responding to public demand.  Think of the effect for example which the offshore pirate stations had on broadcasting services in the UK in the early sixties.  It led to a diversification of the BBC services and the establishment of alternative independent local radio services.</P>
    <P>Likewise the pirate station phenomenon here was very much the catalyst for the establishment of RTE's Radio 2 service.  In neither case was the response adequate.  Society has changed radically since the days when State radio monopolies were established and continues to evolve &mdash; people are better educated, are more independent-minded and want greater opportunities to do their own thing.  In the field of broadcasting, they do not want to be dictated to by the State They want the freedom to be involved themselves and decide for themselves what they want to listen to and if we, as legislators, do not respond to that demand we will have failed our public. Therefore, the second objective I had in constructing this legislation was to ensure it would be flexible, that it would provide maximum opportunity for maximum involvement by the public in the provision of the kind of radio services which they themselves want, be they commercial, community or a mixture of both.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the term &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; has come to be associated with my legislative proposals.  The emphasis in my proposals is on the establishment of the simplest structure possible to administer and regulate radio services and, therefore, to minimise the cost to both the taxpayer and potential radio operators.</P>
    <P>The criteria against which applications for licences will be judged are quite specific in the Bill.  Not alone will the character of the applicant and the adequacy of the technical and financial resources available to him be very important but <Col N="1193" /> the quality, range and type of programmes proposed will be taken into account in deciding who will get the licences.  In addition, the licence issued to the successful applicants will be very specific in relation to performance.  In this regard, I see the requirement to carry 20 per cent news and current affairs programming as being a key element of the Bill.  The national independent radio to be set up under the legislation will provide a national news service.  Other requirements which will have to be complied with by licensees will relate to areas which affect the public interest &mdash; for example, the requirement to be impartial and objective in the treatment of news and current affairs, to ensure that programmes conform to good taste and decency and do not incite to crime or undermine the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of the Irish language and Irish culture to our national identity and bearing in mind the need for some offsetting balance against the numerous external broadcasting services that are going to be available over the next several years as satellite services develop and expand, it is right that we should take into account what applications propose to offer in this sphere in the selection of licensees.  We want to ensure that stations operating in areas which include Gaeltacht areas will make their contribution towards the preservation of Irish as a spoken language.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the regulation of the radio services, simplicity is the key. The emphasis under the regime I propose is self-regulation.  I do not accept that radio services need the degree of control, of monitoring or of overseeing which would warrant the creation of a new State structure.  The parallel surely is with newspapers.  We are approaching a situation where there can be more choice in our radio services than there is in newspapers. Nobody is clamouring to establish State structures to regulate the newspapers or to set down in legislation what newspapers may or may not write about.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why licensees, having satisfied the rigorous criteria and selection <Col N="1194" /> procedures outlined in the Bill, will not provide a service in accordance with their undertakings without the necessity of a permanent &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; structure to oversee them.  The very prospect of knowing that an investigation into the operations of a radio service can be instigated, that market research into audience reaction to a service can be called for, that the ambit of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission can be extended to deal with complaints relating to the services and that, ultimately, licences can be revoked should help greatly to concentrate the mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on self-regulation which I envisage in my Bill means I do not have to build up costly bureaucratic structures within my Department to regulate the services.  It can be done by a very modest number of staff who can, in addition, deal with other areas of operations within the Department.  Indeed, I can see ways in which the self-regulation approach can be strengthened.  There are many areas of important activity in the State which are self-regulated and in the case of the new radio services, I would expect that when a sufficient number of stations is established their operators would come together voluntarily and establish a code of conduct within the framework of the legislation to ensure that operators aspire to the highest standards and to deal with any complaints from the public. It would clearly be in the interests of licensees to have such a mechanism rather than to have something more costly and bureaucratic imposed by the State.</P>
    <P>Much of the initial reaction to the Bill stems from the fact that it does not provide for the establishment of an independent authority of some description to select franchisees.  I would point out that Ministers in many Departments of State have numerous licensing functions, many of them relating to areas which may be of much greater importance for the country than the field of broadcasting.  This power has not caused problems in these areas in the past.  In relation to broadcasting I do not believe that any Minister for Communications <Col N="1195" />&mdash; from any party in this House &mdash; would act dishonestly or unfairly in this area because, apart from the question of integrity, the high profile nature of broadcasting is such that unfair behaviour would inevitably come to light.</P>
    <P>I accept the argument that the licensing process should be seen to be administered fairly.  The structure which I had proposed to deal with this matter was that an advisory committee would be responsible for assessing the applications for licences. The criteria which both the advisory committee and the Minister would have taken into account in selecting licensees are clearly laid down in the Bill.  Neither the committee nor the Minister could have acted on whim and I have no doubt that if a Minister sought to do so he would very quickly find himself before the courts. However, having listened to the deeply held views of the Members of the House in commenting on the Bill after its publication, I intend on Committee Stage to introduce an amendment which will require the Minister to accept the decision of the committee as to who should get a licence.  The advisory committee will decide who gets the licence and the Minister will sign the licence on their recommendation.  The Minister of the day, irrespective of which party are in power, will have no say in who gets the licence.  That is a matter for the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>To those who may still feel dissatisfied with this approach and who may still press for some form of independent authority to regulate the services after the allocation of licences by the committee, let me make the following important point and ask them to reflect carefully upon it before proposing amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>A permanent independent authority would necessarily need well qualified and expensive staff to service it.  The interim Local Radio Commission set up by my predecessor did valuable work in spelling out the staffing and cost implications of a full-time body and I presume the objectivity of their work is not in question.  Let me give you their estimates of the costs of a full-time body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> The commission estimated the running costs of such a body at £237,000 in the first year of operation, rising to £272,500 after five years.  This body was to finance itself from a levy taken from radio station operators but at the end of five years of operation it would have run up a deficit of some £598,000 and would still be running at a loss.  A consultancy study was carried out by Touche Ross on behalf of the interim Local Radio Commission on this same question.  I only mention this because it has been referred to on a number of occasions by those commenting on the Bill.  The study proposed a commission with a three-man executive and estimated the annual cost of such a body at £170,000 in the first year rising to £210,000 in year five but even that body would have had an accumulated deficit of £204,000 after four years.  In the event, of course, the interim commission could not accept the Touch Ross scenario because they did not consider it possible to do the task they were being given with an executive of three persons.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Touche Ross, they suggested that the commission could consider contracting out its work to the Department of Communications with a view to minimising its costs but there were two difficulties with this suggestion. First, if a commission is being set up to be independent of the State executive, then it will want to do its work in an independent fashion and not be coming back to the central Government for the means to carry out its functions.  The second flaw is that the Department of Communications would not, and could not do the work of the commission on an ongoing basis free of charge and it would be bound to charge the commission the real cost of any service it was asked to give.</P>
    <P>The commission also felt that it would have to levy 5 per cent of the radio stations' turnover to finance itself &mdash; and even then it would not be viable.  The consultancy study expressed a concern that this figure was too high.  In other words, there was a real danger that such a levy would hinder the development and emergence of new radio services.  If you <Col N="1197" /> accept what Touche Ross said about 5 per cent being, in effect, a disincentive to the emergence of new radio services and their conclusion that revenue of this order would not, in the medium term, make a full time body financially viable then a licence fee or levy of the order of 3 per cent which I envisage under my proposals &mdash; £180,000 per annum &mdash; will simply not support a new State structure.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to touch on the question of the total pool of advertising revenues available to sustain independent radio services.  It is estimated that total expenditure on radio advertising at the moment amounts to around £15 million of which £11 million goes to RTE's radio services and around £4 million to illegal stations.  I believe, and the advertisers believe, that there will be growth in radio advertising under a legal regime for national and local radio but, in the medium term at least, I doubt if the total pool for independent radio services will exceed £6 million.</P>
    <P>It is purely on these considerations therefore, combined with my conviction that radio services do not need a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; type regulation, that I have come down in favour of the more practical regime in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the more detailed aspects of the Bill I think it is appropriate to explain why it is necessary to have legislation governing broadcast services at all &mdash; in other words, why not let everyone who wishes to set up radio broadcasting services do so?  The main constraint on a total liberalisation of the airwaves is the availability of frequency spectrum for this purpose.  The International Telecommunication Union in Geneva, of which Ireland is a member, is the specialised agency of the United Nations with international responsibility for the radio frequency spectrum.  The allocation of radio frequencies for broadcasting is decided at planning conferences held at various intervals under the auspices of the union, and Ireland along with all other member countries negotiates its quota of frequencies.  There must, therefore, be national control over the use of the available frequences if we <Col N="1198" /> are to meet our international obligations.</P>
    <P>The nature of the radio services we can provide under this Bill is related to the availability of the radio frequency assignments and their associated technical parameters. In addition to the national radio station, the first phase of franchising will concentrate on the provision of sound broadcasting services at city/county level. I will seek applications for licences for the provision of two local radio stations for the greater Dublin area, one for Cork city and one each on a county basis.  These stations will operate on both medium wave and VHF.</P>
    <P>The second phase of franchising will depend on demand but frequences are available for town stations with coverage of up to eight to ten miles radius and &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo; stations which will operate at low power with two to five miles coverage.  I have available over 100 VHF frequencies for town size stations &mdash; in effect one for almost every town with a population over 1,500.  Over 100 frequencies are immediately available for &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo; stations and by 1990 over 300 frequencies will be available. The franchising of the town and &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo; stations will depend to a large extent on the nature of the demand which manifests itself and these stations will be confined to operation on VHF only.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased at the manner in which the decision about a new independent national radio service has been welcomed.  In this regard the Government considered that it would be timely to allow such a development which is in line with the general thrust of broadcasting policy here and internationally. This thrust is in the direction of providing diversity and choice of service, of relaxing State monopolies and of allowing greater competition.  In addition it is important at national level that there should be an alternative available particularly in the area of news, information, current affairs and public interest programming. For many people the broadcasting services may be the main, and sometimes only, source of such information.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer specifically to the <Col N="1199" /> concept of the &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo; stations because I believe they have great potential for real community involvement in radio broadcasting services.  What we would like to see is local communities getting involved in providing the kind of service best suited to their own needs and interests.  The objective really is to strengthen the coherence of communities and neighbourhoods, to allow people to talk to and entertain each other and to air issues and concerns of local interest. I hope that the widest possible range of groups and organisations, including cultural, sporting and social groups, can come together to participate in these services. Such involvement would enrich the communities concerned, provide a further outlet for local initiative and talent and would be a manifest example of the educational potential &mdash; in its broadest sense &mdash; of the broadcasting media.</P>
    <P>I am particularly appreciative of the response from the National Association of Community Broadcasting to my proposals. They said in a recent letter to me that they are encourged by the progressive nature of the Bill.  Indeed in their response to me they have specifically recognised the key elements of flexibility and openness in the Bill which they see as vital to the development of alternative radio programming.  These are precisely the elements which I have endeavoured to keep to the forefront in preparing my proposals.  Only by doing so can we ensure that the greatest possible crosssection of the public can become involved in the new services on one level or another.</P>
    <P>I would like to make particular reference too to the potential which these services offer with regard to the Irish language.  We are all aware of the excellent initiatives taken by numerous Irish language interest groups in establishing all-Irish language schools in various communities throughout the country.  This Bill provides an opportunity for such initiative to be directed into the area of radio broadcasting, to see a significant Irish language and Irish culture input into radio services at neighbourhood level and <Col N="1200" /> to see the language in a substantial manner being brought into the maximum number of homes.</P>
    <P>I would like now to move on to the main elements of the Sound Broadcasting Bill itself.  Section 1 contains interpretations which are self-explanatory. Section 2 confers the basic power on the Minister, in accordance with the terms of the Act, to invite applications for sound broadcasting services and to grant licences for such services.  The licences must be offered on a public franchising basis and subsection (3) specifies the detail which must be contained in the public notices.  It is necessary also to give the Minister a specific power to limit the number of services that may be allowed in the interests of securing the orderly development of such services or for reasons relating to the availability of radio frequencies.  It will be noted that subsection (5) provides that the services to be provided under this Act are additional to any sound broadcasting services provided by RTE.  In this regard, any involvement by RTE in the provision of additional radio services can be done under RTE's own Acts &mdash; the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 and 1979.  I already had discussions with a group from Cork local radio and I also met the RTE Authority.  Discussions are continuing.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is one of the key sections in the Bill.  I referred earlier to the fact that specific criteria are being laid down for the evaluation of applications for licences.  This section as it stands requires the Minister to establish an advisory committee to give him advice as to the most suitable applicant to be granted a licence based on the criteria laid down in subsection (4).  As I have already said, I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to require the Minister to issue the licence in all cases to the applicant considered most suitable by the advisory committee.  I want to emphasise that the Minister of the day will have no power in relation to the granting of the licence.  That will be a matter for the advisory committee.  His only function will be to sign their recommendations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of this section provides, <Col N="1201" /><i>inter alia,</i> that the committee must have regard to the desirability of allowing any person, or group of persons, to have control of or substantial interest in an undue amount of the communications media in any area.</P>
    <P>What we are looking at here essentially is widening the range of choice available to the public.  In contrast with previous Bills, participation by newspapers is by no means excluded.  We recognise the concerns which local newspapers may have about the possibility of advertising revenues being syphoned off from them by new radio services and we recognise too the potential contribution which newspapers could make to local radio services as a source of news and information. It is right that we should include in the selection criteria a consideration relating to the extent to which an applicant controls the amount of communications media in any area. However, this is only one consideration among a whole range of criteria.  And if on balance it is clear that, as a consequence of a local newspaper being an applicant, a better service can be provided than might otherwise be the case, then the application will in no way be disadvantaged.  In many respects such an application may actually have an advantage in the selection process.  In some areas, participation by newspapers might be seen as essential in order to ensure that a service is provided.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that regard must also be had to an applicant's proposal in respect of programming in the Irish language and relating to Irish culture.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) is a specific criterion aimed at ensuring that applicants for a station in an area which embraces a Gaeltacht area must have particular regard to the importance of preserving the Irish language as a spoken language.  An applicant's contribution towards the achievement of this objective in the form of the programmes he proposes to provide will be an important consideration in the selection process.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) enables the Minister to require the advisory committee to place particular emphasis on one or more of <Col N="1202" /> the criteria in any instance.  For example, going back to the example I have just mentioned it can be expected that particular emphasis will be placed on the Irish language element and on the contribution towards the preservation of the Irish language as a spoken language in the case of stations to be established in or near Gaeltacht areas.  Where an emphasis is to be placed on one or more of the criteria the Minister is obliged to make this clear in advance to intending applicants before they put in their proposals.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) provides that the Minister must have regard to but shall not be bound by the advice of the advisory committee.  This subsection will be deleted on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) binds the Minister to have regard to the criteria spelt out in this section in reaching the ultimate decision on the granting of a licence.  As I have already said, it is my intention, by way of Committee Stage amendment to confer the power to decide to whom licences should be issued on to the committee. Obviously there will be consequential amendments to define the revised role of the committee and these will be placed in the hands of the Parliamentary Draftsman.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a standard provision relating to the appointment of an advisory committee as proposed and dealing with procedural and administrative matters relating to the committee.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the terms and conditions to be applied to licences including the period of the licence, the terms and conditions under which it may be renewed, technical conditions which in fact will make up a substantial part of the licence and prohibitions on the assignment of the licence or changes of ownership without the consent of the Minister.  On the question of the term of licences, I would envisage specifying a period of between five and seven years in general.  I am leaving this question open to an extent, because it may well be the case that potential licensees will be able to demonstrate that they need a longer or shorter period of time to remunerate <Col N="1203" /> their investment.  There is no point in putting our heads in the sand on this one. If applicants are limited to a period that will not allow a reasonable return on investment, the investment that will be needed for new radio stations will simply not be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As to the question of renewal, I would not in fact propose to use this power.  My intention would be that at the end of a licence period the franchise would be thrown open to public competition again. Apart from any other consideration, this will provide a good incentive to the initial licensee to ensure that he lives up to his obligation and has no black marks against him when it comes to the second round of franchising.</P>
    <P>The reference in subsection (4) to the effect that nothing in this Bill when enacted shall prejudice section 10 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, relates to the provision in the latter Act which enables a Minister, when a state of emergency is legally declared, to make regulations dealing with the manner in which all forms of radio communication may be used during the course of such emergency.  There is a parallel provision relating to RTE in section 16 (3) (b) of the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960-1979.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the suspension and revocation of licences.  The terms under which such action may be taken are specifically spelt out and relate to a breach of the terms of the licence or of specific provisions, for example, obligations in relation to programming, in the Act itself.  The natural justice requirements of the Constitution require that a licensee be given notice of intention to take such action, in order to enable him to make representations on his own behalf. The Minister must take such representations into account before reaching a decision on suspension and revocation. A licensee, of course, also has recourse to the courts if he feels a Minister is unjustified in taking such action.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a necessary provision enabling the Minister to vary the terms of a licence for the time being in force. <Col N="1204" /> The specific circumstances in which he may do so are specified in the provision. For example, if as a result of some future international frequency planning conference changes are made to the frequency assignments or other technical parameters available to this country, the Minister must be in a position to implement these through a variation in the technical conditions of a licence. Again, however, before any such change is made the licensee must be given a hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is essentially a technical provision. It provides in effect that licences granted under this Act shall satisfy the requirements of section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 under which wireless telegraphy apparatus may only be installed, maintained and used in accordance with a licence under the latter Act. In effect we want to avoid a situation whereby two licences would have to issue for every radio station.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the Minister to grant licences in two specific circumstances without the need to go through the whole public franchising process or the advisory committee referral procedure.  The first situation is where a person or group of persons may wish to set up a temporary radio service for not more than 14 days. This could arise, for example, in connection with various festivals held from time to time throughout the country.  The second situation is where a particular single institution may wish to set up a low-power broadcasting station, and we mention in particular an educational institution or a hospital.  The requirement to carry a minimum content of news and current affairs programming would not apply to such stations.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the essential standards which stations must meet in the national interest, that is the requirement to be impartial and objective in the treatment of news and current affairs.  This is similar to the requirement on RTE, not to broadcast anything which would offend against good taste or decency or would incite to crime or undermine the authority of the State and not to encroach <Col N="1205" /> unreasonably on the privacy of the individual.</P>
    <P>We have also proposed in this section that a minimum amount of broadcasting time will be devoted to news and current affairs.  A complication in the drafting of this provision has come to notice since the Bill was published.  The intention is that the minimum obligation will be 20 per cent of transmission time and at least two hours of that must be broadcast between the hours of 7.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. in the case of stations which broadcast for more than 12 hours per day. I will be introducing a purely drafting amendment on Committee Stage to remove the ambiguity in the current text.</P>
    <P>As I have already said I regard the requirement that 20 per cent of broadcasting be devoted to news and current affairs as a key element in the Bill.  I am aware that there has been some criticism that in the case of certain types of specialist stations this requirement may be unduly restrictive.  Deputy Richard Bruton made this point in relation to, for example, a serious music station.  I am prepared to listen to what Deputy Bruton may have to say, and to introduce whatever amendments are considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 10, which allows for party political broadcasts to be carried on radio services licensed under this Act will, I am sure, generate some discussion.  The legal advice available to me indicated that it could be found to be unconstitutional to prohibit such broadcasts. A similar provision is contained in the Broadcasting Authority Acts in relation to RTE, as well as in previous Bills in this area, and it was considered desirable to include the specific provision here.  There is no compulsion on licensees to carry such broadcasts but if they do so they are legally obliged not to give unfair preference to any party.  From the point of view of operating this provision licensees can take as a model the RTE guidelines.</P>
    <P>Section 11 enables radio services established under this Act to carry advertisements &mdash; this will in effect be their bread and butter.  They will be obliged to <Col N="1206" /> comply with the standards which RTE operates in this area which will ensure, <i>inter alia,</i> fair play between RTE and the new services.  We have proposed a maximum time limit on advertising &mdash; 15 per cent of transmission time subject to a maximum of 10 minutes in any one hour.  This is a higher limit than RTE's which is allowed 10 per cent of transmission time and 7.5 minutes maximum in any one hour but we think this is justified given that these new stations will not have the benefit of licence fee income which is available to RTE.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with complaints from the public and subsections (1) and (2) reflect the self regulation ethos of the Bill.  We are imposing a statutory obligation on licensees to deal seriously with complaints and to keep full records of the treatment of such complaints.  These records will be open to inspection at any time by the Minister or his agents.  As I mentioned before there will be scope for licensees to strengthen the self regulatory aspect, through for example, establishing the equivalent of a press council.</P>
    <P>If, however, in time it transpires that this self regulatory aspect is found not to be working satisfactorily, there is provision in subsection (3) to extend the ambit of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to deal with complaints about services established under this Act. I do not wish to impose this situation on radio stations at the outset.  Apart from the fact that a self regulatory approach is preferable, the procedure for processing complaints through the Broadcasting Complaints Commission is a fairly cumbersome one for all concerned.  I note, incidentally, that a similar approach was taken under my predecessor's Local Radio Bill, 1985.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that every direction issued to RTE under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Acts shall apply equally to stations established under this Act.  I appreciate that there are many and diverse views about the merits and demerits of section 31 but I presume there will be agreement that we must be logical and consistent in the construction of this Act and if a Government of the <Col N="1207" /> day decide that a section 31 direction is needed in the interests of public order and the security of the State, it should apply to all broadcasting services originating in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is one of the safeguards needed when adopting the self regulatory approach.  It is in effect a reserve power of the Minister.  Under the section he can order an investigation into the affairs of a licensee &mdash; at the licensee's expense &mdash; if it becomes clear that he is not meeting his obligations under this Act.  Because it is not our intention to establish a large regulatory structure to oversee the services, we would envisage appointing consultants if necessary to carry out such investigations as might be considered necessary from time to time.  Again, my hope would be that we might never have to use this power.  But the mere fact that it is there should be an incentive to licensees to ensure that they meet their obligations.</P>
    <P>Likewise the Minister may require a licensee to undertake market research in relation to audience reaction to the service in question.  One would expect in any event that licensees will be doing this if they are to persuade advertisers to use their services.  The right of the Minister however will extend to requesting that such surveys cover aspects of the service relating to its relevance to and popularity with its audience.  The results of such surveys will be of use to the Minister in assessing the degree to which a licensee is meeting his audience's needs.</P>
    <P>Section 15 enables the Minister to call for reports on the operational, programming and financial aspects of the services established under the Bill.  The main report we would be seeking would be the station's annual report and accounts.  While we would see this information being automatically sought from the national and higher tier stations we would not necessarily look for it from say the neighbourhood stations, particularly if the latter emerge in any great numbers.</P>
    <P>My intention under section 16 is to prescribe by means of regulations the fee <Col N="1208" /> which shall be payable to have applications considered.  These will be set at a level which will cover the costs involved in examining applications including, for example, the costs of the advisory committee, and secondly to ensure that only persons seriously interested in obtaining a licence apply.  Deputies may take it that only a token fee will apply for the neighbourhood stations.</P>
    <P>The successful applicant will also be required to pay licence fees and the figure we envisage would be of the order of 3 per cent of turnover with a minimum floor and an up-front payment on account on the grant of the licence.  We have been influenced in this area by the Touche Ross findings that the 5 per cent levy being contemplated by the interim Local Radio Commission was rather high and could act as a disincentive to the emergence of new radio services.</P>
    <P>Under section 17, regulations made relating to application fees and licence fees will be laid before the Houses of Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is essentially a drafting revision of the definition of broadcast used in the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 while sections 19 and 20 are standard provisions relating to expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill, the short title and the establishment of an operational date for the coming into effect of the Act.</P>
    <P>Those then are the proposals for establishing a legal regime for new radio services which I commend to the House. I firmly believe that they are realistic, practical and workable, that they strike the right degree of balance between the freedoms we want to give new radio services and the degree of regulation needed in the national interest and they do so in a way which does not involve either for the taxpayer or the radio services themselves the creation of new, elaborate and costly structures.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I would like to address myself briefly to the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, which is a necessary concomitant piece of legislation to the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987.  In terms of its principles I presume <Col N="1209" /> it will find general acceptance in this House &mdash; indeed the Bill is precisely the same as that circulated by the previous Government in the Seanad in 1985.  The purpose of the Bill is to create a series of new offences relating to the activities of illegal broadcasters and those who aid and abet them.  Part of the reason the pirate stations have been able to flourish is that we have had to rely upon the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, to take action against them.  While that Act was an extremely far-seeing Act and is still very relevant to all forms of radio communications today, I am afraid its drafters did not quite see all the problems we would be faced with some 60 years down the line.  In addition to the new offences which we are creating, and which I outlined at the commencement of my speech, we are also taking the opportunity to up-date all the penalty provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, and also to deal with some anomalies and difficulties which we have found through experience in implementing this Act.</P>
    <P>Unless Deputies particularly wish me to do so I do not propose to give a section by section introduction to the whole Bill. We will have the opportunity to go through it in detail on Committee Stage and in any event the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill &mdash; and particularly the schedules embodied therein &mdash; show clearly what is proposed.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on these two Bills and it can be taken &mdash; and I want to emphasise that &mdash; I will be open to consider any reasonable and practical suggestions which Members of the House may offer on Second Stage and which can be included on Committee Stage.  Practical sensible solutions which commend themselves to the Government will quite obviously be adopted.  This should improve the Bill.  I am quite open to comments from all sides of the House on how we can improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the fact that the Minister in his final words expressed an openness to amendments and improvements in the Bill.  I think <Col N="1210" /> there is considerable room for improvement and I hope the proposals which I will put forward will not be regarded as too much for the Minister.  We are all agreed that we want radio which is entertaining, informative and educational. Nobody is disputing that fact.  In many ways we are taking on a very difficult task in trying to design a framework for broadcasting when it is very difficult for anyone to predict the outcome of that framework.  As a result it has become a perfect stomping ground for ideology because where it is difficult to predict the outcome it is left open to very deviant impressions as to what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to bear in mind certain facts in approaching legislation in this area. Radio and television are not a market.  It is not true to say that you can leave it to the market to decide in the way you would with other products.  Broadcasting is not financed at all by consumer contributions but by taxation, on the one hand &mdash; licence fees, users' taxes &mdash; and on the other hand advertising.  Advertising is not a market, there is no way in which a consumer can express the strength of his preference for a particular radio programme by the amounts he pays, which is the essence of a market. Advertising is much more like a very poor voting system than a market &mdash; it is a first past the post voting system and people in this House are well aware of the difficulties with it.  It does not allow the listener to either express the intensity of his preference or even the ranking of different programmes.  Indeed it is interesting to read a recent review of broadcasting policy by <i>The Economist</i> where they comment on the sort of programming that advertising produces. Advertising produces programmes that are everyone's fourth choice, in other words it gets a maximum audience but it is not the first choice of the listenership. It further states that it becomes non-creative &mdash; not open to new approaches but keeps going back to the tried and trusted ways that have been successful in the past &mdash; it does not experiment or provide initiative and of course it has to be nonoffensive <Col N="1211" /> to the listeners who they hope will buy soap powders or whatever.  There are real constraints in looking at radio and television as simply a market where market forces must be let run their course because radio and television are not a market in that sense.  Equally, there are difficulties as the Minister has pointed out in going to the other extreme, and thinking that broadcasting can become entirely State funded with officials designing programmes.  Essentially that involves foisting the particular people's taste on the listenership.  Not only is that not desirable but in a small country like Ireland where audiences have many options to turn elsewhere it is not practical at all.</P>
    <P>We are in a very difficult situation, as we are trying to put in harness two horses, advertising or commercial forces and public service forces which both tend to deviate into directions we do not want to take.  That is why we in Fine Gael feel it is a mistake to abandon the idea of an authority.  The skill of an authority comprising independent, high calibre people is that they can, like the good charioteer, keep the two deviant horses in harness and produce the type of broadcasting we want.  I think at the risk of mixing metaphors, that we are involved in trying to design the skeleton on which the flesh of independent radio will subsequently grow and take life.  If it grows on a set of deformed bones it will be very difficult to correct it afterwards.  It behoves us to examine very rigorously the nature of the skeleton, the legislation that the Minister is putting forward.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has gone far too far in his emphasis on a body with four big sturdy commercial legs but with no head to direct and allow the system to develop a coherent response to what the public want, which will not automatically be produced by commercial forces alone. The Minister recognises this fact and has many references in the Bill to other interests that must be achieved.  It is not simply a case that commercial forces will rule the roost.  For that reason the whole question of an authority is not a matter <Col N="1212" /> of degree to be decided by financial cost and whether we can afford it, but is really a key issue of principle as to what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>No one disputes, and the Minister does not dispute it now, that the endowment of the privilege of a licence must be absolutely beyond political control.  I would contend that equally the public control functions must be beyond political control. The Minister has retained for himself quite significant public control functions in this Bill which are inappropriate to rest with any Government Minister.  I cast no aspersions on the present Minister but it is not proper that politicians of any hue should have that approach.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister does not really believe the logic of this minimalist approach whereby the listnership should decide and rule the roost.  If he believed in this approach the logical response would be to allow free entry and the survival of the fittest.  There would not be any talk of committees, criteria or anything else.  It would simply be a case of letting it rip, letting everybody into the fight and waiting to see what would come out at the end.  By the way in which this Bill is framed it is clear that the Minister recognises the matter is not so simple. There is essentially a special public interest in providing some framework which will go somewhat further than allowing the survival of the fittest.  In some ways it is the difference between legislating for a news stand and legislating for a library.  We want more than just a news stand and while we might not quite aspire to having a library, we want to achieve something which is more than the fourth preference of as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the legislation should provide for an authority to set and monitor standards.  The Bill as it stands provides that the Minister will set the terms of licences and he will have minimalist powers of monitoring through his powers of investigation.  I am disappointed by the exclusion of an authority.  It is a crucial element that the authority's remit should go considerably beyond granting a <Col N="1213" /> licence.  The previous legislation imposed on the authority the duty to ensure high standards.  The notion of a duty on the authority is gone from this Bill.  Also gone are references to the need to achieve local character, the code of practice which the authority would have been able to produce and the duty on the authority to make sure that broadcasting had a broad range of news, information and education. All these things have been scrapped and replaced by the requirement of a simple quota of news.  As the Minister acknowledged, this is seriously defective in many ways.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that what the Minister has produced is a non-competitive, uniform market-type solution.  He is providing 30 county stations, as well as two in Dublin and one in Cork.  These will be essentially localised monopolies which will not compete with one another except in the Dublin scene, while in Cork they will compete with RTE.  They will have a monopoly within their localised area. The Minister is providing for desirable targets of public regulation in his criteria but it is not explicity stated that these will be built into the terms of the licence. There will be no duty on any authority to oversee them and that makes them very difficult to enforce.  Admittedly the Minister says they will have to come back for a new round of licensing at some stage, as yet not specified.  In America they set out with criteria like this built into the licence but when they came back for the second round they argued that it was impractical and they were scrapped in the interests of the stations who felt they were an encumbrance.</P>
    <P>The picture the Minister has produced is not competitive and not sufficiently diverse.  I should prefer to see a more competitive and more diverse type of market solution and a lighthanded, flexible but decisive authority with the power to regulate.  There should be greater freedom of entry into this area, particularly for specialised stations which would provide diversity by catering for specialised interests in community-type broadcasting, all under the overseeing eye of an authority.  This was the demand initially. <Col N="1214" /> The Minister talks of the demand for a national station but much more fundamentally the demand was for flexibility. Classical music is not everybody's cup of tea but people hoped for the possible development of classical music stations. We have actually gone in the other direction.  We will have localised monopolies which will tend to be uniform. They will tend to comply with the 20 per cent news and current affairs and 15 per cent advertising and they will present a bland mix in their remaining programming to suit Meath, Kildare and the various areas in which they have their exclusive franchise.  I would be quite willing to surrender the county boundaries which do not have much relevance in this area and to see much larger regional areas.  I would envisage groups approaching an authority in much the same way as people seek planning permission but seeking to start a classical music station. The authority would then make a decision as to whether this would provide diversity, living within the sort of criteria which have been laid down.  I would prefer that sort of solution rather than the Minister's approach of carving out an area and allowing one station to operate within it.</P>
    <P>I sincerely welcome the Minister's rethink on the issue of the authority.  This is very important, as is the fact that their remit must go beyond simply granting licences at the beginning.  It must include as a minimum the setting of the terms of the licence, the right to set codes of practice in crucial areas like news and so on and the right to investigate complaints. I know the Minister has argued that this sort of code is inimical to the development of commercial programming and that we might end up with nothing at all.  An interesting submission was made to the Oireachtas committee by Sunshine Radio.  They were talking about the type of broadcasting that would evolve and made some interesting comments. In their view only specialised radio would survive and they argued that this is where the real demand lies.  We cannot impose a uniform mix on the listenership.  They also argued that there <Col N="1215" /> were opportunities for community radio and advocated a combination of stations which would have a number of strands. One would deal with community and specialised interests and education, another would be more middle of the road and another would be lower key.  It is interesting that people at the extreme end of the commercial market, very pirateoriented, were thinking in terms of the sort of Bill we had in mind.  They did not regard it as an unbearable burden to think in those terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann conscious of the plight of the Irish out of status emigrants in the United States, asks that the Government uses all its resources to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  get support in the United States Houses of Congress for the legislative initiatives to change their status;</P>
      <P>(ii)  establish as a matter of urgency support and advice centres in New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  supply support for Irish emigrants in the United States similar to that supplied by the Department of Labour to Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I should like to share my 40 minutes with Deputies Griffin, Higgins and McGinley. I am glad to welcome Mr. Michael Ahern who is a co-founder of the Irish Emigration Reform Movement and who is here in the gallery this evening.  I am delighted to move this important motion in the House this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time it is estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 out of <Col N="1216" /> status Irish emigrants are in the US.  They are also categorised under the terms of illegal, unauthorised or undocumented aliens.  The fact that they are illegal exposes them to all types of exploitation both in the workplace and as regards accommodation and also deprives them of health and educational benefits.  It also prevents them from applying for jobs for which they are suitably qualified.  Construction work and bar work are the main areas of work for men.  Housekeeping, waitressing and <i>au pair</i> work are the main attractions for women.</P>
    <P>The young out of status Irish live in constant fear of being caught by immigration officials.  As the full enforcement date for the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which is 1 June 1988, approaches anxiety and worry among the young Irish will intensify.  I experienced this at first hand on a fact-finding mission to the US this summer.  The young Irish feel disillusioned and isolated and are concerned that their legal status may not be rectified in the immediate future. There is a strong affinity between IrishAmerican politicians and Ireland.  If we can show an interest at home I am convinced they will respond in kind.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (i) of the motion refers to various legislative initiatives that are being promoted at present in the US Houses of Congress to help the cause of the out of status Irish emigrants.  There are three such initiatives, namely, the Immigration Act, 1987, promoted by Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Brian Donnelly, the Irish Permanent Resident Adjustment Act, 1987, promoted by Congressman Joseph Kennedy and a proposed amendment to the Immigration and Control Act, 1986, at present being promoted by Cardinal O'Connor of New York and expected to be introduced to Congress by Senator Al Damato of New York.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss the various initiatives I should like to give an overview of the historical perspective as a background to the current situation.  From 1820-1900 over 2,870,000 Irish legally entered the US and from 1901-50 the figure was <Col N="1217" /> 726,012.  From 1951-60 some 48,362 entered the US legally and from 1961-70 the figure had declined to 32,966.  From 1971-80 the figure dropped further to 11,490, from 1981-85 it was 4,004 and for the year 1985 it had declined to 515.  This figure represents roughly one-fifth of 1 per cent of the total emigration to the US from 1985.  I would like to ask the question, why did legal emigration from Ireland decline to such an extent from 1960-85?  No doubt the better economic climate up to 1980 helped.  Indeed the <i>Financial Times</i> in 1980 reported that emigration from Ireland had stopped. However, the 1985 Immigration Act has had a major impact on the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the US from Ireland, especially in recent years, as statistics indicate.</P>
    <P>The Act discriminated against the Irish and other traditional sources of emigration such as Italy, England and Canada.  The Bill closed the door to those who no longer had immediate family ties in the US.  Prior to 1985 immigrant visas were granted on the system known as national origins and the quota for each country was established proportionate to the ethnic composition of the US population based on the census taken in 1920. These guidelines established in 1924 were reinforced by the McCarron-Walker Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>As the earliest emigrants came from Ireland, Germany, Italy and England the law favoured future emigration from these countries.  It discriminated against countries who had a narrow ethnic population base among the early settlers.  The 1965 Act was an attempt to end this imbalance and discrimination.  However, one of the unintended effects of the 1965 Act was that it discriminated against traditional sources of emigration such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Special Commission on Immigration Policy in its 1980 report to Congress stated and I quote:</P>
    <P>The result completely unforeseen and unintended has been considerable <Col N="1218" /> hardship for intending immigrants from the Northern Hemisphere.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Bill gave priority to family reunification.  It created six special preferences: the first preference is for unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the US; the second is for spouses and unmarried sons or daughters of permanent resident aliens; the third preference is for members of the professions or who, because of exceptional ability in the sciences or arts, will substantially benefit the US and whose services are sought by an employer in the US; the fourth preference is for married sons or daughters of citizens of the US; the fifth preference is for brothers and sisters of citizens of the US, provided such citizens are at least 21 years of age; the sixth preference is for skilled or unskilled labour for which a shortage exists in the US.  However, in this preference a list of prohibited jobs, mainly in the unskilled category, was established.  These included bar tending, domestics, contract workers, the jobs that many Irish people had sought in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill did not take into account the peculiarities of the Irish immigrant.  Typically, the Irish immigrant has been a single person, who leaves home on his own initiative, in most cases without relatives in the US to sponsor him.  The change in legislation in 1965 made it possible for thousands of refugees to sponsor other members of their family.  This benefited countries like Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and China.</P>
    <P>The adverse change brought about by the 1965 law did not manifest itself clearly until the early eighties when the Irish economy took a downturn and also we were experiencing a dramatic rise in the population in the 18-25 age group.  When the economy could not provide jobs there was no option left but to emigrate for many of our young Irish.  From 1981-86 about 4,500 Irish entered the US legally, the remainder, 150,000 or so, entered on three week holiday visas and remained on in the US illegally.</P>
    <P>The problem of illegal immigration became a major issue in the late seventies <Col N="1219" /> and early eighties in the US.  The American public became increasingly concerned about the number of unauthorised aliens in their country.  By 1982 this number was conservatively estimated at 3,500,000.  A select commission on immigration and refugee policy was established in 1981 to deal with the problem. This laid the basis for the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.  This Act dealt with the issue of illegal immigration. It did not address the many recommendations regarding legal immigration that the commission had proposed.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act is regarded as the most comprehensive reform of US immigration laws since 1952.  It effectively closes the back door to illegal entry by requiring employers to hire only citizens and aliens who are authorised to work in the US.  The employer will need to verify employment eligibility of anyone hired after November 1986 and complete and retain the one page form 1.9.  The form will have to be presented for inspection to an immigration and naturalization and service official or a Department of Labour official upon request.  If an employer has violated the new immigration laws, with respect to employees hired after 6 November 1986, he can be fined any figure between $250 to $10,000 for each unauthorised employee. Employees who make false statements or use fradulent identification or documents which were lawfully issued to another in order to gain employment may be imprisoned for up to five years or fined, or both.  The effective date for full enforcement of the 1986 Act will be June 1988. The magnet of employment that attracts people has now been effectively removed by this Act.</P>
    <P>A small provision is contained in section 314 of the Act allowing for an additional 10,000 non-preference visas for the years 1987 and 1988 in respect of the 36 so-called adversely affected countries. The inclusion of section 314 was prompted following an amendment by Congressman Brian Donnelly, to allow for more flexibility in American immigration <Col N="1220" /> policy.  The non-preference &mdash; 5 programme produced over one million written requests for one of the 10,000 non-preference visas.  According to Congressman Donnelly, the response to the programme created a bureaucratic nightmare but silenced those who believed that there is not a great need to reform the current preference category system which, in 1965, was intended to correct discrimination against many nations.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Act also made provision for an amnesty for persons who entered the United States illegally prior to January 1982.  The INS estimated that 3.5 million illegal aliens were eligible for legal status under the provisions of the Act.  The period during which application can be made will expire on 4 May 1988.  It seems likely now that 1.5 million illegal aliens will apply for the amnesty, two million short of the expected number.  Because the majority of the out-of-status Irish arrived in America since 1982 they will not benefit from the amnesty.  However, Cardinal O'Connor of New York now proposes that the 1986 Act should be amended to extend the amnesty to include two million illegals who have arrived since 1982, one million from European countries and another million from the remainder of the globe.  This would solve the Irish problem.  It is hoped that Senator Al Damato of New York will promote the amendment to the 1986 Act.  As Cardinal O'Connor's proposal holds the only realistic hope for the out-of-status Irish every effort should be made to ensure that this proposal will be adopted.  Not only must American politicians be lobbied but also Members of the European Parliament and Heads of European Governments who are themselves directly involved.</P>
    <P>The Immigration Bill of 1987 sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Donnelly represents an attempt to correct imbalances created by the implementation of the provisions of the 1965 Act.  The Bill proposes to separate existing family reunification preferences from the employment and skill-related preferences by creating a new, expanded independent category.  It provides for the <Col N="1221" /> creation of 50,000 additional visas for older sources of immigration, especially for those from Ireland, Italy and other European countries.  The additional 50,000 visas are intended for applicants who qualify on the basis of a new points system and who, once eligible, probably would be selected by random computer selection.  Within this category the focus will be on those who are highly skilled and educated.  The points system gives advantage to applicants from the 36 countries adversely affected by the Immigration Act of 1965.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy-Donnelly Bill enjoys bipartisan support in the Houses of Congress and has an outstanding chance of success.  Therefore, every effort should be made to support its provisions, which would ensure that future intending immigrants would have a good prospect of being accommodated.</P>
    <P>The Irish Permanent Resident Adjustment Bill of 1987 introduced in Congress on 16 September 1987 by Congressman Joseph Kennedy applies only to nationals of the Republic of Ireland or to those born in Northern Ireland who arrived in the United States before 1 September 1987, allegedly because of the crisis obtaining in Northern Ireland.  Its provisions propose amnesty for the latter groups only.  Because of its limitations the Bill is unlikely to succeed.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that Cardinal O'Connor's proposal offers the only solution for our illegal immigrants in America and that the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill offers hope for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the circumstances that have occasioned the placing of this motion before the House.  I am saddened, as is every Member of the House, at the recent increase in emigration.  That is not an empty, sanctimonious platitude. Rather is it a sincere expression of regret that so many of our fine young people have, perforce, to emigrate.  As has often <Col N="1222" /> been said before, our youth are the lifeblood of our nation, whose strength, talents, abilities and creativity are needed at home to build up Ireland and not other nations who have benefited in the past. It should be remembered that they built America, England and Australia.  We had all hoped that the spectacle of emigration had ceased, had receded into the past but, unfortunately, it has reared its ugly head once again.</P>
      <P>As Members of this House, we owe it to our young people who had to emigrate to do everything we possibly can to regularise and legalise their status.  As has been indicated by Deputy Deenihan, our emigrants have been subjected to unscrupulous people.  They cannot open a bank account.  They cannot receive hospital treatment except in private wards and, if they do, the cost is so exorbitant that their savings are soon whittled away.  They are totally disadvantaged. We owe it to them to ensure that we do everything we possibly can to regularise their status.</P>
      <P>It should also go out from this House this evening that we are not unmindful, ungrateful or unappreciative of the American Government and people for the help, support and encouragement they have so lavishly given our many young immigrants of yesteryear and indeed in the recent past.  Over the past 150 years the hospitable shores of America have received our people when, unfortunately, through famine, recession or other necessity, they had to leave our shores, when our country could not guarantee them the standard of living or future they deserved.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that an amicable solution can be found.  There is a great fund of goodwill existing already in America towards these young Irish immigrants.  It is my belief that a solution will be found so that the happy relations obtaining between ours and the American Government, between the older Irish generation and the newer immigrants will not only be maintained but will be strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in that spirit that we put down this motion in Private Members' time. There is an urgency about it.  Time is <Col N="1223" /> running out for those who may qualify under the amnesty.  As you will be aware, a Cheann Comhairle, there are approximately 150,000 of our young people in America who are classified as being undocumented, out-of-status, or illegal aliens.  In order to qualify under the amnesty they would have to have been in continuous residence in the United States prior to 1 January 1982.  The Immigrant Reform and Control Act of 1986 was signed into law by President Reagan on 6 November 1986.  Its provisions are effective from 5 May 1987 to 4 May 1988, leaving only five months approximately within which people can avail of that amnesty under the 1986 Act.  It was thought that approximately 3.5 million people would avail of that facility.  To date indications are that 1.5 million approximately only will avail of it, leaving a shortfall of two million people.  Within that shortfall there may lie a resolution to the plight of our young emigrants.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, Senators Ted Kennedy and Moynihan have introduced a Bill in Congress, entitled the Immigration Bill of 1987, whose provisions propose that the number of visas be increased from 270,000 to 320,000 per annum, representing an increase of 50,000.  Of the 320,000, 50,000 would be designated as non-preference immigrant visas, to be allocated on a points system, especially to nationals of those countries adversely affected by the Immigration Nationality Act of 1965.  As has been rightly pointed out, of those at present undocumented, about 120,000 will not be in a position to avail of that because they emigrated to the United States of America after the operative date, that is, 1 January 1982. But again, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has proposed that the Act of 1986 be amended to allow those people to apply after the closing date.  He agrees that we should abide by the closing date, 14 May 1988, and any shortfall, short of the proposed 3.5 million people who entered America after 1 January 1982 should be allowed to qualify for an amnesty under that amended legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> Our notice of motion this evening introduces three elements: first, to get support in the US Houses of Congress for the initiatives to change the status. That would be on a government to government basis.  I would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is here to make every approach to the American Government, to his counterpart, to resolve this problem.  Likewise all associations such as the AOH, the GAA and all the county associations in America should be canvassed, as should the 43 million people of Irish extraction in the United States.</P>
    <P>The second element is to establish centres as a matter of urgency for support and advice in New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Already the Catholic charities in the archdiocese of New York have set up 31 pastoral centres where advice is given free <i>gratis</i> to many of our emigrants. Doctor Dermot Clifford, Coadjutor Archbishop of Cashel and Emly, has recently returned from New York and has given us a first hand account of the efforts being made.  I suggest that all the efforts be coordinated, and that we co-ordinate with the Catholic Charities Association of New York to make contact, in the most effective way, with many of these citizens.</P>
    <P>The third element asks us to give the same amount of support as the Department of Labour are giving to the Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom.  It was only this evening I heard on the news that the Minister for Labour has granted £.25 million to the Irish centres in Camden, Hammersmith and Harrogate.  I would hope that a similar amount would be given to Irish centres in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and particularly New York, where most of the Irish people congregate.  I support this and urge the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure that the status of our young Irish emigrants is legalised and formalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to thank Deputy Deenihan very sincerely for allocating some of his precious time to me, and, second, for the very clear historical backdrop and perspective he gave to this most horrific problem that now confronts this nation and our young Irish people who are abroad in the US and have no legal entitlement to be there.</P>
      <P>One of the peculiarities of the Irish persona has been our ability to at times bandy loose phrases or descriptions around without adequate cognisance of their true significance or meaning.  We have tended as politicians collectively at our Ard Fheisanna and party conferences to describe our young people as the wealth or the nation, our greatest resource.  Indeed at what was the last Ard-Fheis of Fianna Fáil before facing the reality of government, the Taoiseach described the young people of this country as our greatest national asset.  Well they might be, but an asset is not an asset unless its potential is realised.  A resource is not a resource unless it is exploited, and I mean exploited in the true sense and meaning of the word.  What has happened is that, as a result of our inability to wrestle with our economic problems, to deal effectively with the problems we have in this country, to deal with an island which has a population of little more than the greater Manchester area and a dimension 20 times as great, we have between 140,000 and 200,000 young people in the US who are in fact our greatest national embarrassment because they have no legal entitlement to be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come to accept emigration.  It is part of what we are; it is part of what we will be; it is part of what we have always been.  It is deeply etched into the Irish character but we have never got used to the idea that emigration is truly a fact of life.  The trauma of emigration today for somebody going abroad is as great and as heart rending as it was 100 years ago.  Each person who goes abroad is a branch torn from the tree; each family who go abroad is a branch torn from the national tree but the difference between emigration now and emigration then is that in days gone by, emigration was <Col N="1226" /> always tempered with the realisation that if one was prepared to work hard there was opportunity abroad.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the success stories abroad and the marvellous involvement of Irish people in commercial, political and agricultural spheres.  There were always the friends, neighbours and extended family abroad offering hospitality to these people.  That is no longer the case for the young Irish emigrant flying out from Shannon Airport.  It is ironic that while our young people are the best educated, the most self-sufficient in terms of morale, the most independent-minded, with honours leaving certificates, diplomas from regional technical colleges, degrees from Carysfort Training College but unable to get teaching jobs, medical degrees from UCD, UCG and Trinity, they are going abroad and living the life of underground aliens.</P>
    <P>The difficulty facing young Irish people in New York and Boston tonight is that they do not know but that tomorrow morning when they open the door of their apartment the federal authorities may be outside finding out how they got ID or Green cards and if they have proper visa credentials.  That knock on the door is a very definite reality from now on.  They do not know but that when they face into work tomorrow morning their employer may turn on them, having found out that they have no legal status, and the employer, because of the new federal emigration laws, can be fined up to $10,000.</P>
    <P>As has been so effectively said by the two previous speakers, the vulnerability of these young people is leading to exploitation. Despite all their qualifications, their academic frills, etc., they are being paid $3 to $4 per hour in the most menial of jobs.  They are being forced to take on occupational hazards because of their position.  They are living, nine and ten together in substandard flatlets and apartments. Last year we learned of the sad spectacle of two young people from Connemara dying in such substandard accommodation. There are no unions, no insurance cover, no sense of belonging. They are in fact nonpersons.  They have <Col N="1227" /> no legal redress if they are assaulted in the street.  They cannot cash cheques. They have to cash them in public houses, taverns etc. and run the risk of being mugged and they have been mugged. They are afraid to come home if a relative dies or is ill, because if they come home the probability is they will not be able to go back.</P>
    <P>We have confronting us the greatest Irish human tragedy since the famine, and we must do something about it now. As has been said by Deputy Griffin, this is a historic motion.  It recognises the reality.  Its particular merit is that it is precise.  It has a clear focus, a narrow angle, and we are to hone in on this because unless we sort this problem out once and for all now, this may well be our last opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Our belief that America owes us something over and above what it might owe other national groups is a fallacy but this notion is fuelled by the general euphoria that prevails on St. Patrick's Day when the entire American nation `goes green' for the day.  When the green is washed out of the hair on the following day, the American is a hard pragmatist.  It is back to reality.  The general American population do not have a special affection for the Irish over and above other ethnic groups such as Mexicans, Japanese, Chinese and so on.  We must hone in on the fact that there are 40 million IrishAmericans, that we have the Friends of Ireland, Irish-American organisations and young support groups over there such as the Irish Immigration Reform Movement. We have the Ancient Order of Hibernians, county associations, Church attachments and so forth.  We must support the legislative measures which are now going through the Houses, whether it be the Kennedy Bill, or the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill, or the Damato Bill.  These may very well be the last chance.  If it means a convergence in the American nation on assimilation of all those together, then let us give those politicians the necessary support, advice and backup that they need.</P>
    <P>These 140,000 young Irish people are <Col N="1228" /> watching us and listening to us and they have their fingers on the pulse of this House.  We should also work through the European Community to ensure that collectively we organise and mobilise the 11 member states once and for all in the trauma, tragedy and drama affecting those people, with obvious disastrous consequences should the American economy burst.  Should the bubble burst, there is no doubt that overnight there could be a mass exodus back to this country, again exacerbating the already bad unemployment problem here.</P>
    <P>Today I was gratified, as was Deputy Griffin, to notice that the Minister for Labour had designated additional money for advice centres in the United Kingdom.  This, again, is largely contained in our motion.  I note that two of the centres in question, the Piccadilly and the Soho centres, while they are very meritorious in that they give advice, give advice to other aliens or other immigrants, rather than specifically Irish. Again, I urge that he should seriously consider funding advice centres in the main centres of population to alleviate the plight and hardship and the sense of insecurity that are now confronting young Irish people abroad.</P>
    <P>We have no guarantee that this will not be the last initiative and the last chance. There is a mood in the American nation that they are entitled to roll up the bridges, close off the ports and create an unpolluted, uncontaminated, true American nation without any infiltration, integration or injection from abroad.  It could be now or never.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The tabling of this motion by the Fine <Col N="1229" /> Gael Emigration Group is the first concrete recognition in this House of the crisis facing young Irish immigrants in the United States at present, particularly those who have left here since 1982, those who are debarred from applying for an amnesty under the terms of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. For many years we were willing and anxious to ignore this problem.  As politicians we felt that an admission that emigration was rife and rampant was an admission of our own failures, of our won economic policies being unsuccessful in that we did not succeed in providing employment and opportunities for our own young people at home.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins has said, it has become almost a cliché to talk about our greatest natural asset, our young people, We boasted about having the youngest population in Europe, of 50 per cent of the population being under 25 years of age and so on.  We prepared for the education of these people, we provided the facilities in that area but, when it came to providing jobs and opportunities, I am afraid we fell down.  It is only in the past year or two that other bodies and organisations have taken up the issue seriously and begun to remind us of the fact that emigration is depriving us of our young people.</P>
    <P>One of the first to highlight the situation were sporting organisations. Indeed, the GAA did magnificent work in this respect.  In Donegal they carried out a survey and found that in these past two or three years over 1,000 young men between the ages of 18 and 25 left.  Some of them have gone to the United Kingdom, some to Europe but a significant number have gone to the United States.  These are some of the people we are discussing here now, who find themselves in that country without legal status, experiencing all the difficulties previous speakers have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It was only during the last election campaign that the Government party came out with a statement recognising that these young people were in the <Col N="1230" /> United States without status.  It is interesting to read what they had to say and I quote from a document dated 11 February 1987 from the Fianna Fáil Press Office:</P>
    <P>The next Fianna Fáil Government will undertake as a matter of urgency a major initiative to secure legal status for the large number of young Irish immigrants in the United States who have not got such status at present.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil intend to use every diplomatic and political means available to us to secure legal status for all these young people.  We will also mobilise Irish-American opinion through all their organisations to bring the maximum political pressure to bear on Congress and the White House.</P>
    <P>That statement got the fulsome endorsement of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York at the time.  In a statement made the following day they said:</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to learn that in Ireland the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party have taken note of the serious situation undocumented people are facing in the United States and that they are planning a programme to assist them.  The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York will continue to serve these undocumented people through its offices for immigration services and looks forward to co-operating with the assistance programme for undocumented persons which will be developed by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to ask this evening what has been or is being done at the moment to get legal status for these people?  The Government have been in power now for nine months.  They stated unambiguously in that statement that they would use every power of persuasion they have and we shall be expecting to get answers here this evening.</P>
    <P>One of the most committed organisations campaigning for the legal status <Col N="1231" /> of young immigrants in the United States is the Catholic Church both here and in the United States.  I must pay tribute to the Bishop of Raphoe, Dr. Hegarty, who has taken the initiative in this area.  He has spoken forcefully and frequently about their rights and welfare.  Indeed, he has already acted and given a lead to others by sending two of his young priests to the United States last summer, Fr. Cathal Ferry to Boston and Fr. Gerry Doherty to New York.  They both spent three months there working with young Irish immigrants, familiarising themselves with their problems and difficulties and giving them all the assistance and help they could.  Since their return home, the two priests have prepared a comprehensive report for the Bishop and the Hierarchy.  Some of the suggestions in tonight's motion are identical with recommendations in the report submitted by these priests to the Bishop of Raphoe.</P>
    <P>The main difficulties arising from these young people's non-status are mostly in the area of health, accommodation and the dangers of being exploited.  We all know the prohibitive cost of health care in the United States.  I know of one young Donegal couple for whom there were complications in the confinement for the birth of their first child.  They did not have the benefit of any medical cover and it cost them $15,000.  I know of another young man without status who fractured a leg while playing football and it cost him $15,000 or $16,000 to get medical care and treatment.  These are some of the difficulties such people are experiencing because they have not a social security number, or legal status, or the green card.  Another area in which they can be exploited is that of accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that it is very opportune that we are addressing the question of the out of status Irish citizens at present living and working in the United States.  In that context, I would like to emphasise that I have visited more groups of Irish men and women in Washington, Chicago, New York and Boston over the past nine months than any other Minister for Foreign Affairs in the history of this State. I had very successful and constructive meetings with them and I am fully aware of the problems involved.</P>
      <P>The first opportunity I had of meeting such groups was on St. Patrick's Day in Washington and New York.  In August, I met groups in New York and in September I met groups in Chicago, New York and Boston.  Those visits were outside the normal tour of duty which, as Deputy Barry knows, is concerned with the United Nations.  I took it upon myself to deal with this problem because of its importance in the social sense.  We all share this concern and I would not like to see this problem being thrown around like a political football.  We are all conscious of the significant number of young people who are now in the United States and this has been the trend over the past five or six years during the term of office of two Governments.</P>
      <P>This is a social phenomenon caused by a demographic problem here and forcing economic circumstances.  It is a fact of life and we must face up to it and not try to apportion blame.  It did not happen in the late sixties or the seventies but it is happening now and we must try to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is particularly acute in the United States of America.  Before coming to the dimension of the problem in the United States I would like to reiterate our attitude towards it.  We regard it, of course, as a serious national loss and I do not need to elaborate on that.  I do not need to dwell on the fact that this new emigration is in many cases a trained <Col N="1233" /> emigration and is a national loss as well as a family and personal loss.  It is a question of raising the level of confidence of people there by providing a regime where, first of all, they are entitled to their rights.  I would put that as being the first prerogative.  We could have a debate all night here on how this has developed and on the unfortunate nature of it, but I would prefer to get down to seeing what we can do about these people who find themselves in this situation.</P>
    <P>On this aspect I had talks with the Friends of Ireland Group in the United States Congress in March of this year.  I met a special committee of that group who were very concerned about this problem.  I spoke to a number of Congressmen but more particularly I spoke to Senator Kennedy and Congressman Brian Donnelly.  I would like to pay a tribute to them because they have advanced their Bill to a considerable extent.  It is now in committee in the US Congress.  It is before a subcommittee of the judicial committee and Senator Kennedy is very active on that committee as is Congressman Donnelly.  What we want to do is to get it out of that committee as quickly as possible and passed into law.</P>
    <P>The important thing about that legislation is that it will provide a permanent regime unlike the lottery regime which was a once-off arrangement for a particular year in which Congressman Donnelly introduced his proposals.  That was yesterday's business and this year's business must be to bring in a permanent regime that will provide scope for emigrants from what are called the seed countries.  We are specifically included in the schedule to the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill and emigrants from these seed countries, provided they qualify under special criteria such as education, training and English language, will get particular marks as it were.  This matter is still before the committee but about 27,000 permits will in accordance with these criteria be allocated and the most intelligent examination of what is proposed shows that about 9,000 Irish emigrants should <Col N="1234" /> qualify for these permits per year.  That is the prognostication but the significant point is that that will be a permanent regime.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we expedite this legislation in the United States Congress because there is a danger, and I appreciate the point made by Deputy Deenihan, that if we start adopting other schemes and other legislation we will only delay the process.  I warn against any delay in the process on the part of those who are friendly and well disposed towards Ireland in Congress.  Already noises are coming from other reasonably strong sources, other emigrants groups, who are not included.  Therefore, I would regard speed as being of the essence.  I also regard this Kennedy-Donnelly legislation as being the best we have seen so far.  I also had talks with Archbishop O'Connor and Monsignor Murray of the New York Diocese and he appreciates this problem as well.  There is a difficulty in regard to the amnesty for those who emigrated before 1982.  To some extent &mdash; and I say only to some extent &mdash; they were dealt with in the lottery legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but the problem is a continuing one.  If we get the permanent regime into place it will take care of that problem over a period of time but it is going to be very difficult to get the amnesty provision through.  I have been advised on this by all those people in the Congress.  I have done my homework on the Hill, as they say.  Cardinal O'Connor, with whom I talked as recently as September, is aware that this is not an easy situation.  We have to remember that this is not legislation passing through Dáil Éireann.  We sometimes psychologically do not realise that this is legislation we have to get through a United States Congress in which there are many other racial strands and interests other than the Irish interest.  I would like to pay a tribute to our officials in the embassy in Washington and to the Friends of Ireland group in the Congress and, in particular, Congressman Donnelly <Col N="1235" /> and Senator Kennedy, for the very positive interest they have taken in this matter and got it as far as it has got.  A Bill is in shape and within the relevant committee.  What we have to do is expedite it onto the floor of the House.  It is the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill that would make available this quota, based on emigrants from the seed countries and based on specific criteria of educational and training qualifications and the English language.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record our appreciation of what Congressman Donnelly and Senator Kennedy have done in that respect.  They have come together and are now co-sponsors of one Bill.  The Bill is concerned &mdash; and this is how we have managed to isolate it from other areas and elements who might make the point that they are not included &mdash; with people who are disadvantaged under the 1965 emigration legislation.  Deputy Deenihan raised this point.  It concentrates on these people.  Apart from the traditional seed countries, the countries that are getting this preference are countries that were disadvantaged under the 1965 legislation.  The reason this is put in is that we have to get away from the element of discrimination.  We have to establish our case as a matter of principle along with the other seed countries who were disadvantaged in 1965 and we have to ensure that it has got across to the American public and Congress that the set of criteria we are adopting gets away from any idea of discrimination. The American Congress, the American Administration and public were not aware of any overt element of discrimination in the legislation.  That is a fact of life so we have to devise criteria outside that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That shows the type of difficulty that is involved.  The Bill aims at redressing the imbalance that has arisen as a result of the 1965 emigration legislation not by reintroducing the principle of national discrimination but by facilitating the flow of trained and professional workers from the countries which have provided much of the basis of United States society: in <Col N="1236" /> other words the seed countries.  We welcome this Bill and we have made a very thorough examination of the various very simplistic measures that are proposed. There is no point in proposing a measure before the US House of Representatives or the Senate if it is just a simplistic measure that satisfies us if it has no chance of getting through their process. We have to be realistic and realise that it is the American process we have to get the legislation through.</P>
    <P>This is why it is tremendously important to be realistic about it and not to encourage too many legislative measures. That will only confuse the situation and give reason for delay.  We certainly should not encourage any delay because if there is delay in this matter it might not come through at all.  I think that sometimes we are not realistic: we tend to believe our own propaganda bit.  We have to get through the American legislative process what is acceptable to them, the criteria that will be acceptable to them, and within that range get the maximum for our own.  Our best estimate is that the Kennedy-Donnelly legislation has a chance, is a runner, is already in the process at any rate, is acceptable across a broad range of representatives and will give us around 9,000 a year on a permanent regime basis of people who will fully qualify under the American system. We are starting out on a process which is going to be a difficult one &mdash; and I want to emphasise that &mdash; but we in the embassy are giving full support to it.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised the fact that it is important to observe the sensitivities of people generally in the United States.  We have been advised by Senator Kennedy, Congressman Donnelly and other friends in the United States of the dangers involved in adopting too high a profile in this matter.  That has been my own experience.  I am a reasonable politician and I have been out there on the ground. I want to say that, if this is overdone in any way, it will only arouse the feelings of people who might not be as sympathetic as we naturally are to these people.  I do not have to emphasise the numbers involved.  The numbers vary and <Col N="1237" /> I will not get into any argument about the numbers involved.  It is sufficient to say that there is a substantial problem. That is my firm belief and it is a problem that must be addressed by us.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the legislative aspect. The other aspect is the practical one of coping with the social and human problems on the ground.  In that respect we have placed an officer in the consulate in New York who is already functioning whole time on this work and working six days a week.  He is working in concert with a committee in New York State representative of all the bodies who are concerned about this problem, for example, the Church.  As I said Cardinal O'Connor has been very helpful and both he and his specialist in this area, Monsignor Murray, have a wide range of social services, guidance services and welfare services within New York city and the state of New York.  The AOH, the trade unions and the new organisation of young Irish emigrants, the Irish Immigrant Reform Group, are represented on the committee.</P>
    <P>These four group represent different strands of Irish society and they are in different areas that can help in the way of advice with regard to jobs, and where to go in that respect, and welfare, which is important, in the way of housing, and so on.  That committee are in place since last September.  I attended the inaugural meeting of that committee and I am pleased to be able to report to the House that we have an official engaged full time on it.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I am sympathetic to the terms of the Fine Gael motion but I must point out that the advice given to us by three of the four Irish groups in New York was that the best way to go about dealing with this problem was through the consulate based group in that city.  I was told we should not consider setting up a separate advice centre in New York.  The consulate based group is in place in that city and we were told it would be best to have an officer available six days per week co-ordinating the work <Col N="1238" /> of the Irish societies.  The Irish Immigration Reform Movement did not agree with that suggestion but the other groups, those representing the trade unions, the Church and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, agree it was logical to work through the existing mechanism of the consular service.  It will be possible to get action using that service rather than going through an advice centre.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate some Fine Gael speakers made a comparison with the position in the UK.  While I appreciate that the Members were genuine in their statements I do not think there is the same strong presence of Irish organisations, centres and so on in New York that there is in Britain.  There are many such centres throughout Britain.  For example, there are centres in London, Leeds and Manchester.  There is no advice centre in New York that one could say covers all of that city.  We must remember that New York covers five major centres of population and the most practical way to deal with queries from Irish people there would be through an officer at the consulate.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to Boston is different because the person responsible in that city for this work is the Mayor of Boston, Mr. Ray Flynn.  I should like to pay tribute to him for establishing a special division in his office to deal with such problems.  I was pleased to hear he was re-elected Mayor of Boston since I visited that city; I did not have anything to do with his re-election.  City Hall in Boston is more powerful than any advice centre we might establish from here because everything flows from City Hall.</P>
    <P>There is a degree of goodwill towards us in America and people are anxious to help our citizens.  We get a degree of goodwill from people such as the mayor of Boston and the mayor of Chicago.  The consul in the latter city is working with the mayor on this matter.  The position is different in Britain where our people have gone another way because there is not the same establishment acceptance of us and our people there have had to establish their own advice centres and organisations.  Successful groups have <Col N="1239" /> been established in Camden Town, Kilburn and so on.  It is important to note that each case is <i>sui generis</i> and that each city is different.  The position in American cities is different from that in British cities.  In fact, in America the real problem is in New York.  There is a strong Irish community sense in Chicago and the Irish there are helped along the way.  In Boston the Irish are in because City Hall is practically controlled by the Irish.  The difficulty arises in New York and that is where we must build up a system.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that the committees that were established two months ago are working very satisfactorily.  They have addressed several key questions facing the Irish community such as the preparation of a booklet of sources of assistance and advice to newly arrived immigrants; the identification of low-cost health insurance and the carrying out of research into the banking problems of the out of status Irish.  I am happy to announce that the New York city administration have decided to publish the booklet, setting out sources of assistance and advice to newly arrived immigrants &mdash; 10,000 copies as an initial run.  The booklet was prepared by the consulate committee and as soon as it is available I will have copies distributed, via the Department of Labour, to various interested groups, to the Library of the House and the offices of the National Manpower Service system throughout the country.  I will also arrange to have copies sent to each Deputy and Senator.</P>
    <P>Health insurance is a very serious problem. Many of the newly arrived immigrants mentioned that because, by definition, they cannot benefit from the US social welfare system.  This problem is being tackled in two ways.  In the first instance the hospitals of the New York Archdiocese are, thanks to a decision by Cardinal O'Connor, open to immigrants regardless of their status.  Fees are only assessed where necessary.  A similar system obtains in Boston due to the initiative of Mayor Flynn.  I would like to record our appreciation for those two moves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> On another front the consulate based group have researched and identified sources of relatively low cost health insurance and that information is being given to Irish immigrants.  On the question of banking discussions have taken place with figures in the banking world in Boston and New York.  I understand the law will have to be changed to facilitate out of status immigrants.  Recently the New York based committees visited Washington and had talks about such legislation and about recent developments in the field of immigration law. We have two committees in Washington advising legislators and trying to get the necessary legislation through committees, on to the floor of the House and enacted.  The Donnelly-Kennedy legislation will help us in our efforts to get an amnesty for post-1982 immigrants.  If we succeed in getting an allocation for them we will be making progress.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the best possible Bill for the future.  The only omission is this amnesty matter and that is not easy.  It depends on a great deal of lobbying, work and toing and fro-ing in regard to amendments that are necessary and acceptable and that is very important.</P>
    <P>Subject to what I have just said, the Fine Gael motion is acceptable to us as a Government and I am willing to accept it.  We would prefer, though, that some details of it were put in a different way. The Labour amendment is not acceptable because it goes into too much detail which is not really required in this, but we accept fully the spirit of the Fine Gael motion subject to the fact that we might have in the administrative sense to work out some of the details of the operation on the ground in a different way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We, too, support generally the Fine Gael motion provided its aims can be achieved by co-ordinating existing consular services in the USA along the lines suggested by the Minister and without incurring any unnecessary expenditure at this time.  I believe that these aims can be met by doing things in this way.  Furthermore, I thank Fine Gael for giving Private Members' time to the <Col N="1241" /> topic of emigration, a subject which all too often is abandoned by politicians because of the political flak it causes.</P>
      <P>There is a certain poignancy in the Dáil deciding to discuss the issue of emigration in the run up to Christmas when about 27,000 people emigrated during this year. According to figures given to Deputy Martin Gibbons in answer to a Dáil question a fortnight ago, the Taoiseach estimated that a net 99,000 people &mdash; almost 100,000 &mdash; have left this country in the past five years.  Of course, the Taoiseach called it an outward flow of persons rather than using the stark word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo;. The net result of all this is that the issue of emigration is extremely important because in the past five years it has hit almost every family in the country.  I can address this issue with some knowledge because two of my sisters decided to emigrate to Australia in the past few weeks. The interesting point about their decision, though, is that they emigrated from choice.  Both had good jobs but they have now become part of the official 27,000 persons to leave the country this year.  According to the Taoiseach's estimate, 28,000 left in 1986 and 20,000 in 1985.  The figure is moving upwards all the time.</P>
      <P>The increasing level of emigration of mostly young people should lead to a fundamental change of policy within this country over and above that advocated by Fine Gael in their Private Members' motion this evening.  It is a very deserving motion dealing with the out of status Irish emigrants in the USA.  We need to change the laws of the land which are bad for business and enterprise and to rethink our education policy.  Both these issues are controlled by us in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two types of people are emigrating these days, those with good education and jobs who chose to make a better living for themselves in another country and those who leave because of unemployment. I would like to address a few words to both of these problems.  We have put in place a taxation and social welfare system in 1987 which is ranked in the world as the one most likely to discourage the will to work.  Combined <Col N="1242" /> with this is our peculiar demographic problem, the problem of youth unemployment and the difficulties it will create ahead.  This is highlighted when it is recognised that we have over one million people under the age of 15 in this country now.  We have an enormous number of dependents both young and old and as a result five out of every six of our population are now supported by one individual who is working in the productive sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>A most interesting paper was presented at the annual conference of the chambers of commerce in Ireland in May of this year by Dr. Edward Walsh, President of the NIHE in Limerick.  He outlined how in 1986, last year, we topped the list of countries in which taxation and the social welfare system combined to discourage the will to work.  We range with Italy, Greece and Spain as countries in which State interference in the economy is highest while we ranked with Italy, Greece and Portugal at the bottom of the league of financial dynamism and, again, at the bottom of the league with Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey for innovation and forward orientation.</P>
    <P>There were some encouraging aspects, however, to the report compiled by Dr. Walsh.  Ireland was ranked ahead of France, the UK and Belgium on human resources.  We joined Japan and the Netherlands at the top in terms of outward orientation ranking.  We were ranked fourth after Japan, Denmark and the USA in the availability of skilled labour category and high on the list with Japan, the USA, Turkey, Canada, Denmark and Sweden for a labour force willing to relocate, retrain or assume new functions.  We were ranked eighth in the world in the education and training category with the USA, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Canada.  The latter part of Dr. Walsh's study is interesting because it shows that if we have the will to change the laws and regulations which are dragging us downwards, killing the will to work, drowning dynamism and enterprise, we can remove the factors now inhibiting our <Col N="1243" /> economic development and our competitiveness as a trading nation.  We can change the rules and regulations here which are making young people chose to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to close my mind, however, to the other fundamental problem, that of job creation.  Because of the high birth rate we can expect to have some 70,000 young people each year entering the jobs market.  There is no prospect whatsoever, and I challenge any politician in the House to contradict me, of creating 70,000 job opportunities for young people each year for the immediate foreseeable future.  Short of creating illusiory jobs in the public sector, full employment is a myth and most people outside this House recognise it as such. The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> pledged itself to creating 35,000 jobs a year.  I believe that even this figure is mere fiction.  We are not going to be able to create sufficient jobs in the next few years to stop emigration. This means that emigration is going to continue to be a fact of modern life, and this fact leads me to two inescapable conclusions.  One is the fairly high probability of unemployment in Ireland and the other is the probability of a high number of young people who will continue to leave this country.  As politicians we should begin to address this problem honestly here before we start looking for remedies to the situation in the USA.  If young people are going to leave this country at the rate of just under 30,000 a year &mdash; that is the official figure &mdash; to seek jobs elsewhere in the world we should prepare them for it.  We should not stick our heads in the sand and say that by not talking about it, it will go away.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for one moment that we should be defeatist like the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, when he stated in his interview with <i>Newsweek</i> in the autumn, &ldquo;We can't all live on this small island&rdquo;. This island supported eight million people in less prosperous times during the last century.  We should be pragmatic.  We should act in the certain knowledge that <Col N="1244" /> most regretfully, thousands of young people, will emigrate in the years immediately ahead because of the economic problems we have to confront at home.  We should change policies to confront that reality.</P>
    <P>Given our historical and traditional attitude to emigration since the fifties, it would be naive I believe to assume that people will look at migration within the European Community any differently from how they perceive emigration to the United States.  But it is different.  If young people have to go abroad to find jobs anyway, how much more desirable it would be if they were to go, say, to Germany rather than as illegals to the United States as at present.</P>
    <P>The European Community has brought us unforeseen benefits.  The competitiveness in air fares would make it possible to come home more often; the cheaper telephone system would make contact with home all the easier.  It would increase the probability that these young people would return to a rejuvenated Ireland in the nineties.  Young Irish people would be working on the same continent.</P>
    <P>There are two specific changes in policy which I want to advocate because of the scale of the emigration problem.  I propose that instead of having major rows about small changes in the pupil teacher ratio in 1987, we should be reassessing and restructuring the whole education budget so that foreign languages are better taught in our schools.</P>
    <P>I believe that the lack of sufficient language teaching in our schools is a scandal and a handicap given that so many people are forced to emigrate.  I attempted earlier this year to get a breakdown of the amount spent on language teaching from the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, but I was told that no breakdown on the cost of the Irish language within the education system exists.  Yet more money was spent on teaching languages in primary and secondary school last year than on any other subject.  Dr. Walsh, President of the NIHE in Limerick, has assessed, in recent times, that <Col N="1245" /> it costs £160 million a year to teach the Irish language compared with £150 million spent on English; £40 million spent on French; £3 million on German and £2 million on other languages.</P>
    <P>I think it is scandalous that only 1 per cent of the language resources in our schools are devoted to the teaching of modern continental languages in this day and age.  We could greatly improve the career opportunities for our young people within the EC if they had a proficiency in one or more continental languages. I know for a fact that in Germany there are likely to be many career opportunities for young people in the coming years given the age structure of the German population.  It will create exactly the opposite problem to our own.  In Germany they have a huge number of older people whereas in Ireland we have a very large number of younger people.</P>
    <P>At a time when many parents are concerned with education cutbacks, a number of them have come to me asking if some moneys could be saved by switching some of the allocation spent on the teaching of the Irish language to other resources within the schools.  They have a point.  Yet the teaching of the Irish language is another one of those sacred cows within the educational system.  It is the ultimate untouchable but in the context of the current education cuts, parents are beginning to ask questions.  I would go so far as to state &mdash; and this is a personal view &mdash; that we should think of giving parents and children in secondary schools the choice: do they want Irish from the intermediate certificate onwards or a second foreign language which would better prepare a child for life?  This view would not be shared by my parliamentary party.</P>
    <P>I also believe Government policy should be changed in relation to career guidance in schools.  There is no point, in my view, in pretending to young people that they can go ahead to be dentists, for example, when we have trained enough dentists until the year 2000.  We are educating dentists for emigration.</P>
    <P>The time has come, in my view, for parents and students to be given guidance <Col N="1246" /> by the Government on career opportunities for the years ahead.  I believe it would be highly advisable if the Department of Education or the Department of Labour were to compile a register each year on shifts in different sectors of the jobs market.  This advice would state, for example, that we do not need any more dentists trained for a number of years, or that we have enough teachers.  The areas where there will be opportunities in the next five to ten years are, say, in the computer and technological areas. Schools could benefit greatly from such advice.</P>
    <P>It would be most helpful to parents and secondary school students if a compendium of job opportunities were compiled centrally by the group with the greatest overview on developments in the area of jobs and the economy &mdash; the Government.  This is not done at present.</P>
    <P>I now return to the contents of the Fine Gael motion.  I wish the Government well in seeking support from the Friends of Ireland and others in the United States to bring forward proposals to change the status of illegal immigrants in the United States.  I also hope the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill to change the status of illegal immigrants will come onto the floor of Congress in the near future.  I know the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, has had extensive discussions with groups in the immigration area and with prominent Irish-American politicians, but I fear we will not see this Kennedy-Donnelly Bill being adopted until well into next year.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Government establishing advice centres in the major United States cities mentioned in the motion.  I believe this service could be provided with the consulates already in the United States.  There are two members of the Irish diplomatic mission working in each of the following centres, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and three working in New York.  As far as I am aware, there is not a very large Irish population centred in Philadelphia.  I believe that if the existing services in these cities were co-ordinated and given a definite brief to provide advice for out of status immigrants, the job could be <Col N="1247" /> done just as well and as cheaply.  The Archdiocese of New York amendment should be accepted.  I would like to congratulate Cardinal O'Connor and the Catholic Church services in that city for the work they are doing for out of status immigrants.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, the Minister is looking at proposals in the banking and health areas, the areas which cause most concern to the immgrants and their parents at home.  If we keep pressure on the United States authorities, given the goodwill in the United States towards this country &mdash; we got 31 per cent of the lottery visas in the past year &mdash; we may see some changes in this area.  I wish the Government well in their endeavours.</P>

      <P>The House should welcome the Minister's speech telling us what he has been doing in the United States since we came into office nine months ago.  It is only fair to say he has achieved far more in those nine months than the previous Government achieved in four years, but as the Minister said, I do not think we should be politicking about this matter which is of deep concern to all.  I am talking about the plight of young Irish immigrants in the United States.  I do not have to tell anyone of the anxiety felt by these people in the present circumstances, wondering when the authorities will find out they are there.  If they get sick they are terrified of being discovered and then not only being deported but never allowed back to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent past, a newspaper, <i>The Irish Voice,</i> edited by Mr. Niall O'Dowd, carried out a survey of Irish illegals in New York.  I understand the number surveyed was about 200 and the main findings were as follows, and this is of interest: nearly all had jobs, 77 per cent of the men were employed in the construction industry, 54 per cent of the women were employed as nannies; 50 per cent of the men earned between $400 and $500 a week and a further 30 per cent earned between $500 and $700 a week. The women, unfortunately, were less <Col N="1248" /> well paid with only 51 per cent earning $400 or more.  Another interesting point was that 32 per cent had some third level education.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the Local Radio Bill and I argued that the question of an Authority about which there has been debate is not just a question of taking the decision to grant a licence out of the political hands of the Minister.  There is an awful lot more at stake.  Under the Bill, the Minister has very wide powers.  He can add to the criteria for deciding who should get a licence or add emphasis to one particular criterion.  I cannot think of any conceivable reason for the Minister having power to add any criterion.  If he seriously believes it is one that should be considered in the public interest, it should be in the Bill and if it should come up during the course of the work of the advisory committee, then the committee &mdash; or the Authority as we would prefer &mdash; should decide that criterion should be added in. It is not right that a Minister should retain the power to add, at his own discretion, criteria as to who should get licences and how they should be given out.  Indeed, the Minister's example as to how he would use this did not answer the question because he referred to the Irish language, which he has explicitly put into the Bill anyway, so there would be no question of him adding criteria to meet that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can also appoint and fire members of the advisory committee on a whim.  I do not see the sense of that as it is not likely to produce the sort of strong and independent Authority which we would like to see.  That provision does not apply in the case of the RTE Authority, nor was it the type envisaged in previous attempts to legislate in this area. The Minister is still retaining himself the <Col N="1249" /> right to specify the terms of the licences and this includes duration, items about programmes and so on.  That is wrongly placed in political hands.  It should be in the hands of an Authority who have expertise in dealing daily with applications and who have examined &mdash; as the Minister agreed they should &mdash; who best meets the criteria needed.  They should specify the terms of the licence.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the Minister is still retaining to himself the right to investigate stations. This is a correct public control function because there should be the right to investigate stations where they breach their terms of licence.  However, it is not one that should be exercised by a politician; it should be done by the independent Authority under this Bill.  I will come back to that item, particularly in the area of news, where its implications are most dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also retaining to himself the right to suspend or change licence terms in the light of his investigations. The powers which the Minister is retaining under the Bill, granted that he will now accept the advice of the advisory committee in relation to granting licences, are still far too wide.  The remit of the Authority must be widened.  At the very minimum they must have the right to set codes of practice, the terms of the licence and to carry out investigations where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister gravely warned us that we should take the cost of such an Authority into account.  In this area, cost is a red herring as there is a fundamental issue of principle as to how we should approach this but, even more fundamentally, the Minister quoted from the Touche Ross report which estimated that in the first year the cost would be £170,000 rising to £210,000 in the fifth year.  The Minister then pointed out that he intends to raise, by way of a licence fee, £180,000.  That sum is right between the bands of £170,000 and £210,000, admittedly slightly at the lower end, but if the Minister is seriously telling us that the problem about having an independent Authority to carry out the necessary functions is the difference between £210,000 in five years' <Col N="1250" /> time and £180,000 which he intends to raise from the 3 per cent fee, he is misleading the House in stressing the gravity of the financial barriers.</P>

      <P>As the Minister probably detected from the line I took, I do not envisage that an Authority under this Bill would be as elaborate as that envisaged in the 1985 Bill and I have been careful to itemise the areas where they should have a role.  There will be a commensurate reduction in the cost and the Minister must also bear in mind that when Touche Ross looked at it they were talking about four local stations.  We are now talking about one national station plus 30 county stations, two in Dublin and two in Cork.  The Minister has added a very large number of new stations, particularly the national station, which must have the capacity to attract new revenue and with the 3 per cent levy, provide substantially more funding than the £180,000 which the Minister suggests. The Touche Ross figures suggest that it would be higher than that, their figure of £6 million was based on fewer stations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be more work for them to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there would be more work for them to do.  I am all in favour of self-regulation, selfassessment in the tax area and many others, but it depends on someone being there to cry a halt and to spot check. There must be someone with the capacity to do that sort of thing if self-regulation is to work.  I do not see them becoming an impossible encumbrance on stations, but it is they who should be setting terms, investigating breaches of terms and &mdash; if it comes to it &mdash; suspend or change the terms of the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selection of the membership will be crucial.  Legislation of any sort cannot tie up all the ends.  We are in the realm of <Col N="1251" /> fast changing technology and if we try to specify a whole lot of details to be observed, as the Minister rightly pointed out, we are likely to choke initiative.  An Authority of high calibre should have the capacity to respond to those changing needs which undoubtedly will occur in the next few years.  The Minister must look again at the remit of the Authority and at his decision to drop the criteria of experience and capacity for the members.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will put people of experience and with capacity on to any advisory committee.  For the long term good and the development of local radio it is right that we should build into the legislation the need to have people of experience and capacity in the area of broadcasting and related issues, that they should have independence from the Minister of the day and that they could not be dropped at a whim.  That is the sort of authority we are increasingly appointing anyhow.</P>
    <P>The power of investigation must rest with the Authority.  I am critical of the very narrow focus in the Minister's ideas about investigation.  The Minister seems to suggest that audience reaction will be the main test.  Where a station has breached the terms of its licence the Minister will be looking to audience reaction by way of market survey to decide whether this is something that should be acted on but there are dangers in that.  It is very hard to survey market reaction when they have only experienced the operation in breach of the terms, and they have never experienced what the station was designed to do in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is a danger also in that the Minister has not built in a <i>sub judice</i> type provision.  There is huge potential for a station whose activity is being investigated to use the airwaves to frustrate a fair investigation.  A station running a fairly popular show but which is in breach of the terms of its licence, can use the air waves daily to comment on the investigation and frustrate it, and to get people marching on the streets protesting against the investigation.  That section is not <Col N="1252" /> tightly enough framed to be a proper tool.  The power must be put in the hands of the Authority.  Who can believe that the very modest number of staff the Minister says will be operating in his Department and who will be carrying other responsibilities, will seriously look at the issue of stations being in breach of their terms of licence?  Who can believe that they will be in a position to exercise the investigative powers given to them in the section?  One has only to look at recent experience when Departments have not attempted to enforce legislation already there.  If this is not put into the hands of an authority with a clear remit it will probably flounder.  It will end up like the American experience which started out with desirable features which were gradually whittled away.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of news coverage, impartiality is crucial.  This is not properly dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister has substantially changed features of the 1985 Bill and has suggested that impartiality in the area of radio news is similar to newspaper impartiality. There is a fundamental difference in radio broadcasting of news.  It is a much more intimate and subtle influence than is a newspaper.  Newspapers have always presented very clear editorial and sometimes partisan views but it would be dangerous if we had the same freedom in a radio station where people do not have a printed script before them and perhaps may not be so critical in the way they pick up views and assess alternative views.  It is a different ball game.  The rules of impartiality in the Bill do not go far enough.  The Minister has dropped a number of features in the previous Bill. He has dropped supervision by an independent authority and the idea of codes of practice in relation to news being published by an authority.  That is a serious change.</P>
    <P>I had experience of a programme which was not subject to normal RTE codes of practice in relation to news and it is a very different ball game.  If a politician is on an entertainment style programme trying to give an account of his stewardship, it is a very different scene. <Col N="1253" /> It is only right that we should have codes of practice for treating serious news topics.  The ability to reduce broadcasting to mere slogans rather than serious contention with issues is very easy.  If news coverage is to become part of an entertainment directed programme, we will lose out.  The dropping of codes of practice from this legislation in the news area is serious.  The Minister has also taken the initiative of not excluding newspapers from editorial control of news.  Some newspapers take partisan positions and the Minister pointed out that in some areas a local newspaper would control a local radio station, so that one could get a very high concentration of power.  I am not saying that that is wrong and that we should exclude it from the legislation, but it means that we must take a more careful approach to impartiality in the news than is now in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is simply providing for the ability of an individual to take court action when a station has breached its obligation to be impartial.  That is wholly impractical for most aggrieved parties. For a start, one cannot take the court action quickly enough.  For instance, in the course of a general election it is not much good to be able to bring a court action in a year's time.  As well as that the cost would be prohibitive so that many people could not take an action.  It is not the right approach to expect people to take court actions.</P>
    <P>It is uncanny to allow the Minister to have the power of investigation when it comes to practices in relation to news. A station trying to develop a new news programme will have hanging over its head the threat of ministerial investigation and suspension.  I am not suggesting that the Minister would use his legislation in this way, but it is bad to leave it in the hands of any Minister to have the power to investigate and ultimately suspend or change the licence terms of a station.  Under the present legislation the Minister can investigate a station as to its news impartiality.  That is an inappropriate power for the Minister.</P>
    <P>An element of the Bill with which I am <Col N="1254" /> disappointed is that the Minister is not going to activate the broadcasting complaints provisions.  The Minister pointed out that the previous Bill provided for a situation where the Minister would only bring in those provisions by order if he wished, but the Minister forgot that the previous Bill imposed a duty on the Authority to monitor standards in broadcasting. This Bill is different.  We should have broadcasting complaints provisions if there is not an authority overseeing broadcasting standards.  It makes no sense to decide not to activate the broadcasting complaints provisions when, as the Minister seems to intend, there will not be an authority doing a similar job. The previous Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, made it quite clear that he expected that the Authority would carry the job of investigating complaints and that is why he intended to suspend the application of the broadcasting complaints provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister's idea of a news quota is well intentioned.  We are all keen to see informative and educational broadcasting, current affairs programmes and so on.  I think it is a crude provision and for the reasons the Minister has suggested. It is an unnecessary burden on some specialised stations which would be quite acceptable on their own without any such quota of news.  I worry that essentially the quota is honoured by lip service and &ldquo;never mind the quality, feel the width&rdquo; with broadcasting fulfilling the definition of news and current affairs but not in any way adding to educational or informative broadcasting.  That certainly is a danger if the quota becomes a drag on stations.  The quota also creates the danger of producing unwanted uniformity in all the different stations that might emerge.  I would like to see changes in that area.  Essentially the issue of the quality and diversity of broadcasting would be much better handled by an authority who could deal with it in a flexible way, not by the quotas approach for particular type of activity.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the role of community broadcasting, the non profit co-operative broadcasting.  In this Bill it has been relegated to a poor second place behind <Col N="1255" /> commercial stations.  For a start, the Minister has dropped the references in the mandate for the authority to support community broadcasting.  He has also dropped the idea of a special tier of community broadcasting.  In addition, he has dropped the desirability that commercial stations should be providing slots for community access.  That is bad enough but worse still is the Minister's clear statement that accompanied the Bill that he envisaged many of the community stations only getting up and running after the commercial stations were established, and provided they did not impinge on the viability of those commercial operations. I think that downgrades the status and chances of community broadcasting being established.  At a minimum the Minister should be providing for their simultaneous entry into the broadcasting sphere.  I am glad to hear they will not carry levies of 3 per cent which apply to commercial stations but in the criteria listed in section 3 there should be a statement of the inherent desirability of community broadcasting.  The Minister should define and list it as one of the criteria that the authority should be nurturing in its selection of licensees.  I am sorry to see the thrust of the Bill would seem to put community broadcasting into second place.  Maybe I am reading too much into the Minister's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Touche Ross had a very restrictive view of what would be viable and I suppose we have nothing else to go on except their report.  They seemed to suggest there would be very few full blown commercial operations in the country and very many of the county operations would not be viable, some would but it would be based on substantial networking of programmes from elsewhere.  If the Minister's proposal for 30 stations goes ahead it will be very much on a network basis, taking in programming from the national station.  I wonder about that approach.  The idea of a national station is an entirely new arrival on the scene.  No doubt the competition from RTE will be good at national level and should provide diversity at that level.  I certainly have fears that like the high price, it will mean that everything underneath is killed.  There is a danger that the original intention of local radio, of providing diversity and variety in broadcasting could be very significantly damaged by a single national station.  If it absorbs a great deal of the advertising revenue that Touche Ross expected would fall to the local stations, we then might be in a situation where even the Touche Ross estimates of viability would turn out to be optimistic and we would have very few truly independent and diverse stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly not satisfied that I have seen sufficient investigation into the demand for a national station or its impact on local stations generally.  I would like to see a study of that done before the Minister proceeds with it.  I am convinced it will take a very large slice out of the £6 million pool that the Minister sees as available for independent broadcasting.  I would not be surprised if a national station would <Col N="1257" /> target half of that pool in order to bring itself into viability.  I am not opposed to the idea in principle but there is certainly a danger that we might unwittingly end up killing many of the stations we hope to see nurtured under these Bills.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> RTE.  I do not think there was any need to exclude RTE from the Bill. The previous Bill made it quite clear that RTE could only tender for a licence if they set up an arm's length subsidiary and did not have access to any licence fee money in supporting that subsidiary. That would obviously have to apply to Cork as well as to any other station. Equally, if you give the authority a mandate in the Bill for diversity and if RTE should come forward with a proposal that is a clone of their existing operations, there is no chance that they will get the licence.  I do not see the reason for excluding RTE from the very start.  If we are talking about competition on the national and local scene for RTE, I think it is only fair they can take on that competition.  If they are to have competition at national level I do not see a convincing reason why they should not have the right to take on competition at local level, provided of course that they do not use feepayers' funds to finance unfairly their operations at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also have to examine the whole issue of selling network programmes. There will be competition between RTE and the national station when it emerges.  It is important to ensure that there will be no unfair trading in selling network programmes and there would have to be some system to ensure that full costs would be charged.  Again it would be important to ensure that RTE would not use their licence fees to subsidise access into many stations.  We would have to ensure that the rules are fair.  The same criteria would apply to the other side.  RTE could not be expected to carry handicaps in their attempt to take on competition.  RTE carry broadcasting hour constraints.</P>
    <P>In addition, they carry conditions on <Col N="1258" /> the timing and percentage of advertisements. The Minister has rightly pointed out that RTE have access to licence fees which these stations will not. However, the licence fees pay in principle for public service broadcasting obligations, the orchestras, current affairs programmes, home produced drama, all of which are very expensive.  I am not altogether convinced by the Minister saying that RTE should have lower advertising simply because they have an alternative revenue if RTE are expected to carry obligations.  It is a tricky area which I would like to have seen handled, as suggested back in 1974, by some authority who were looking at the issue of what licence fees were justifiable.</P>
    <P>Having said all that and argued that RTE should have a fair crack of the whip and should be able to compete on a level pitch with commercial operations, it would be a pity if RTE became overly absorbed in the local radio scene.  They have other opportunities which should be exploited.  I hope they do not become bogged down in the local radio scene when they have very interesting opportunities to explore elsewhere.  The whole issue of RTE and their subsistence with commercial stations which will come into operation under this Bill, as well as a possible commercial television station, opens up a much wider issue than was ever addressed before by local radio Bills. It gets us into the whole area of broadcasting policy.  It will be difficult to provide a fair means by which a public service station which has to carry obligations can compete with a commercial operation.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister in his original statement when the Bill was launched said he had an open mind on the idea of an overseeing authority somewhat along the lines of the 1974 proposal. Increasingly there will be issues of conflict of interest which will have to be resolved in a fair and independent way.  The real public service obligations which RTE have to carry cannot be ignored.  It is expensive to provide orchestras and drama productions and if they are to survive they must be paid for by licence fees. <Col N="1259" /> Commercial stations will not get into these areas.  Another issue that will be raised is that RTE control Cablelink, which the Minister intends will distribute the programming of a new station.  Obviously there will be a conflict of interest there.  These and many other issues have to be dealt with in a way which is seen to be fair and independent.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case in the medium term for not compartmentalising independent radio under one authority, RTE with their Authority and their area of operation and an independent television station, if and when it emerges, with whatever authority the Minister decides to set up for it.  It does not make any sense to have three such compartments operating when we should have a single integrated broadcasting policy.  I hope the Minister will move towards the suggestion made in 1974 that we should have a single broadcasting authority which draws away the public control functions from the Minister and from the management of stations.  That is the way we should be going.  The arguments made in 1974 for a single authority which separated these functions from both the Minister and the operating stations are even stronger now with the developments which have occurred.  We do not want a heavy-handed approach but we need a single authority to deal with this in a fair way and protect the public interest.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not rush headlong into the area of commercial television without giving very serious thought to that issue.  There is no doubt that RTE will face competition on television and if it is not from an Irish-licensed station it will be from some other mix of stations coming in on the cables.</P>

      <P>The Minister would have to recognise that the cost of putting on an hour of &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; is about oneseventy-fifth of putting on an hour of &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;.  While RTE can certainly <Col N="1260" /> command higher audiences for &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; the costs are so dramatically different that they raise an issue which must be faced up to.  It is not a simple market like the market for vegetables or anything else.  We are dealing with an advertising market which tends to produce the fourth choice in programming because it can command a bland and balanced audience and get good penetration at low cost.  There is an issue there which should be assessed in a fair and independent way.</P>
      <P>I have put forward a number of amendments which will be tabled at a later stage.  They relate to the Authority and its remit and the broadcasting area in general.  I do not claim to have the monopoly of wisdom in this area and I hope we can have a very constructive debate on Committee Stage and substantially improve this Bill.  For that reason we will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but we will be tabling a considerable number of amendments and look forward to a lively debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of any Bill which sets out to establish a legal framework for independent broadcasting.  As the Minister said, several attempts at legislation in this area have failed in the past few years for one reason or another.  The unacceptable chaotic situation which has long existed with regard to pirate stations and the obvious need for an independent broadcasting service have to be catered for.  I welcome the introduction of both these Bills on the basis of their addressing these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my sincere wish that on this occasion the House will be able to agree on a new framework to enable legal commercial and community radio services to come into operation.  If such agreement is to be achieved and if this Bill is to be passed, I want to put down a marker at this stage and say that as far as my party are concerned several fundamental amendments will have to be made on Committee Stage.  The Minister has already indicated that he is amenable to certain amendments and I welcome the <Col N="1261" /> apparent flexibility of that approach.  I understand the Government will be putting down their own amendments.  To some extent this is not surprising because on the day the Bill was introduced the Minister publicly conceded in the face of reaction from the Progressive Democrats and other parties that the Bill had certain flaws and would have to be amended if it were to stand any chance of being passed.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is unusual for a Minister to accept on the day a Bill is published that it has certain flaws in it.  It is not my purpose to be scornful about that; in fact it is the exact opposite.  I hope there will be a constructive approach to the necessary amendments and that we can do what is best as far as the public interest is concerned through consensus.  I hope that consensus will emerge during Committee Stage debate on the various amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government decided on a minimalist approach to this legislation and that they did not want to over-burden the development of the proposed new services with an undue degree of State regulation.  I favour that approach but I would point out that we must ensure that safeguards are built into the legislation so that there can be an orderly development of independent radio services, operating under licence, issued by an independent authority, and subject to a clear set of criteria as far as standards and accountability are concerned. It is this lack of provision for an independent broadcasting authority, as distinct from the advisory committee the Minister has provided for in the Bill, that has given rise to most criticism of this Bill to date.  Deputy Bruton dealt at some length with this matter also.</P>
    <P>The importance of the role of this Authority cannot be understated and the necessity for it is fully justified on a number of grounds.  First and foremost, the decision to grant a sound broadcasting licence to an independent operator must be taken out of the hands of the Minister of the day.  The granting <Col N="1262" /> of such a licence involves the allocation of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has conceded that point and I welcome it but, at the same time, I should like to refer to it for a while longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The granting of such a licence which involves the allocation of a radio frequency, which is indeed a valuable national resource for exclusive use by an operator within a specified area, bestows on that operator the prospect for considerable revenue earning potential. The primary asset that a new station will have is its radio frequency.  The capital outlay and the set-up costs to get on air will be small relative to the earning capacity from advertising revenue. Consequently, it is very important that the licence is awarded on merit in terms of the overall package the company is offering and not because the company have an advantage over another company, by virtue of the fact that they have the ear of the Minister and are in a position to make more effective representations to him.  The whole process must be depoliticised.  I accept and acknowledge that the Minister has recognised that point and I welcome it.  It is not right that any Minister should be put in a position where he can bestow an economic advantage on one company over another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is plenty of precedent for that approach.  An Bord Pleanála was established to take decisions of that nature out of the political arena and to make decisions based on what was in the best public interest or in the interests of the community at a whole.  A similar type of framework must apply to granting of independent sound broadcasting licences, and indeed to independent television licences when legislation is introduced to cover that area.  I understood from the Minister in answer to a question recently in the Dáil that he had proposals <Col N="1263" /> to introduce independent television in the near future.</P>
    <P>Apart from the granting of licences it is, in any event, more appropriate to have an independent Authority to oversee the orderly development of independent broadcasting and to take over responsibility for many of the functions which the Minister would control if the Bill is not amended.  The Authority should be responsible for and address such matters as deciding the ratio for licences in various categories of stations in a given catchment area having regard to the availability of frequencies in that area.</P>
    <P>It is very important that community or neighbourhood radio stations, which are non-profit distributing, should be fostered and there should be positive discrimination towards the development of such stations.  The suitability of applicants for licences, the valuation of the range and type of services they intend providing, their relevant expertise, experience and financial status, their proposals for handling complaints and all such matters relating to what is best in terms of the development of independent broadcasting should be left to the independent Authority to decide.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting review committee which reported as long ago as 1974, was set up to make recommendations in regard to the further development of broadcasting services.  One of its main recommendations was that an authority should be established to oversee any broadcasting other than RTE and also to control cable television.  In fact, the Minister's recent announcement that he intends introducing legislation for independent commercial television has broadened the debate considerably and underlines further the necessity for having an independent Authority to oversee the whole area of independent broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>Independent television will pose a much greater challenge to RTE than sound broadcasting in terms of the effects it will have on their advertising market share.  The question as to whether RTE should retain control of Cablelink as <Col N="1264" /> Deputy Bruton has said, must be looked at when independent television comes on stream, as the Cablelink company would be distributing independent commercial television signals for the private companies and there could well be a conflict of interests there.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee proposed by the Minister in this Bill, would not be adequate in my opinion to deal with all these aspects of broadcasting.  Of course, as far as granting of licences is concerned, the proposed committee only had advisory powers which the Minister could have ignored but I accept that now he has altered that situation.  The Minister said that the reason he opted for an advisory committee rather than a separate broadcasting authority was that the new Authority would require State funding and would impose unduly high levies on potential radio services simply to finance itself.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the levies imposed on licensees would hinder the development of these services, as a relatively small sum would be required to fund the operations of the Authority and after initial set-up costs the Authority would be self-financing.  In any event, I do not think the independent Authority would be much more costly than the advisory committee.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed out, the figures are not too dissimilar. There is not a great deal of difference between the funding the Minister outlined in his speech for an independent Authority and for the advisory committee for which he has accounted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The levies paid to the Authority should be graded by category and type of station and based on a percentage of the total projected advertising revenue they would collect.  The licence fee should also be graded &mdash; I am glad to see that in the case of community radio it will be a nominal fee &mdash; and such fees should be paid directly to the proposed Authority. What is being sought then, and what is entirely possible to provide, is a truly independent, self-financing broadcasting Authority which will have a clear mandate to bring onstream new dynamic <Col N="1265" /> broadcasting services and which will allow society as a whole to benefit from these services.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there is no shortage of talent and resources in the community to become involved in the provision of independent broadcasting services.  The illegal stations have demonstrated that for the past ten years and their illegal status was brought about solely because there was no legislative framework available for any broadcasting station to operate other than RTE.</P>
    <P>The function of this Bill, the Sound Broadcasting Bill, and its sister Bill, the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, is to correct that situation and allow the talent in society to gain legitimate entry into independent broadcasting. This, as I have said before, is to be welcomed but it must be done in a fair and balanced way in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the various categories of radio stations the Minister has announced.  Section 3 highlights the desirability of having a diversity of services. The provisions of the Bill do not go into any detail in categorising the various types of station.  The Minister did so subsequently in the course of his remarks.  It is important that we examine this area and that the treatment of the various categories be incorporated in the Bill.  It is what is in the Bill that is important, not so much what is contained in the Minister's remarks.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been drafted in a very general way.  Effectively it allows anybody and everybody who wishes to apply for a licence to be given an opportunity to do so.  While this approach could lead to the establishment of many stations initially the failure rate could be quite high.  However, it is the only practical course open in that it gives all interested parties an opportunity to apply for a licence.  The independent Authority's role will be crucial at this stage in sifting the applications and getting the mix right in terms of what is appropriate for a given region or subsectors within a given region.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish one national <Col N="1266" /> station is somewhat surprising.  To date proposals for independent radio are based on the concept of commercial, local radio stations for regions and cities, and community radio for more localised, smaller communities.  This is the structure that has evolved under the existing illegal stations in the past ten years.  I am not aware of any demand for an independent national station.  Such a station would compete with RTE on a national basis and, if established successfully, could have a major impact on RTE's market share of radio advertising.  While regional and city stations undoubtedly would attract much advertising from their local catchment areas there would still remain a strong, national advertising base at present available to RTE exclusively.</P>
    <P>It is important to give careful consideration to what we are endeavouring to achieve under the provisions of this Bill.  Our objective is to establish an alternative, viable, independent broadcasting service for which there is demand and, at the same time, ensure that RTE continue to fulfil their obligations as the national, public service broadcasting station. While RTE are capable of dealing with competition from and co-existing with independent local radio, their position could be seriously undermined if a national station comes on stream.  This would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the establishment of city and county-size stations are all right as far as they go.  However, I would question whether it is right to have a rigid framework, to adhere rigidly within county boundaries, when licences are being allocated for the proposed 24 stations the Minister has scheduled.  There are many locations nationwide where, because of the geographic circumstances or the grouping of certain towns, a county or part thereof has a natural hinterland in an adjoining county.  In those circumstances the Authority should take note of those factors and have the flexibility available to them to offer licences on an inter-county basis, or whatever they deem to be appropriate.  If the provisions of the Bill seek to follow the granting of licences on a county-by-county <Col N="1267" /> basis, that would be too rigid.  Therefore, the flexibility I have mentioned needs to be introduced.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the intention to have different time scales for the phasing in of the various categories of stations.  Deputy Richard Bruton has referred to this aspect.  The phasing of the franchising will give a larger station a major advantage over the medium-power town stations and the low power neighbourhood stations.  If the initial phase of franchising concentrates on the larger commercial stations, the smaller stations will find it much more difficult to develop and get off the ground.  The town stations, which are to have a range of eight to ten miles on VHF frequency, could find demand for their services catered for already by the large city and county stations. If they are to develop and survive at all as commercially viable entities, their licence applications should be considered and dealt with at the same time as the larger stations.</P>
    <P>I accept that there will be a period of trial and error in establishing what radio services will last in a given area or what is best suited to a given region but town stations would have a unique identity and should not be discriminated against by restraining their development until after the city and county stations are up and running.  Obviously it would be much more difficult for them to get on air if that were the case.</P>
    <P>The position regarding neighbourhood or community type stations is even more important.  The development of true community broadcasting is a very worthy objective and must be encouraged.  The provisions of this Bill definitely do not do so.  The type of radio service the community stations provide &mdash; which is not a commercial service in the real sense of the word &mdash; will not develop if there are not certain safeguards included in the Bill to ensure that it has at least a fair chance. It appears to be the intention to cater for this sector by allocating a generous number of low power VHF frequencies to them but the provisions of the Bill need to discriminate positively in their <Col N="1268" /> favour.  Typically, these stations would be run by a non-profit distributing trust or co-operative.  Their commitment would be to the usage of surplus funds from local advertising and other resources generated by their local communities for further community work and development.</P>
    <P>The objective of community or neighbourhood radio is to provide access to the communications network for as many people as possible.  If given a fair chance community radio will enable this to happen and will give rise to much greater debate within our society.  It will facilitate and encourage ordinary people, together with residents' associations, sporting organisations and other community groups to speak out on matters directly concerning them and their communities. This form of radio would allow people access on the airwaves to debate issues of local community interest with their local representatives.  That is a highly desirable development.  The dynamics of commercial radio are inexpensive, pop programming and maximum advertising whereas the dynamics of community radio are the development and enrichment of the whole community.  Such a service provides a means of bringing in the voice of the ordinary people as an alternative to that of the professional broadcaster and commercial popster.  A large number of representative groups, properly organised, can participate in neighbourhood radio as the costs of getting established are not prohibitive.  A total of approximately £10,000 would purchase a low power VHF transmitter and other ancillary equipment.  The total annual cost of running one of these stations should not exceed a figure of £30,000.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is supportive of neighbourhood stations for the reasons I have outlined.  I am sure every party in the House would be supportive of them as well.  However, I contend that their prospects of development would be very much lessened if we do not positively discriminate in that direction.  I do not see that the provisions of the Bill cater for that at all.  The provisions of the Bill <Col N="1269" /> should include not just a structure for community broadcasting but an outlining of a policy decision by the independent broadcasting authority I am proposing to encourage the development of these stations.  Indeed the phasing in of these stations should be encouraged from the outset to ensure they are not overwhelmed by the larger commercial stations operating in their catchment areas. The planning and development of all categories of radio stations will be a complex job, another reason an independent authority is needed to carry out that task in a fair and balanced way.</P>
    <P>I accept that there will be possibly several failures after stations have been on air for a while.  Market forces and listeners' choice and preference will largely dictate what survives.  The important thing is to ensure that there will be a good balance in terms of the size and category of those that do survive.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the proposals in the Bill for handling licensing applications.  For example, in section 2 the Minister will invite applications for licences in a given area by way of advertisements to be placed in the national and local press.  Would the Minister not consider that applicants should be required to publish their intention of seeking a licence, similar to a planning application notice?  Such notice would give details of the type of licence sought, the catchment are to be served, the promoters of the proposal and any other relevant data.  The public and other interested parties could then go to a public office and examine the proposals in detail and be given an opportunity to raise objections or make comments, which should not be frivolous, and would be based on the content of the application itself.</P>
    <P>This practise would provide an opportunity for the licensing authority to get a better overall view of the various interests in that particular catchment area and enable them make a decision on the allocation of licences for the various categories of stations.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this proposal as I feel it would result in a <Col N="1270" /> more balanced and more representative framework.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment also on the proposed terms and conditions set out for sound broadcasting licences, as detailed in section 5 of the Bill.  In subsection (2) it states that the Minister may specify the period during which such a licence shall continue in force.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better that every licensee should automatically have to renew his licence after a specified period &mdash; say in four or five years with the Authority, of course, retaining the right to revoke or alter the terms of the licence during that period?  Under a system where a licensee had to seek automatic renewal of the licence, the Authority would be able to exercise much more effective control as there would have to be a full review of the operations of the station, going into a detailed examination of whether the licensee had complied fully with all the terms and conditions of his licence.  This automatic form of examination would be much better than the less rigorous approach which would apply if the renewal date were left open ended.</P>
    <P>Licensees should have no grounds for fears that they would not be relicensed if the system were as I have outlined, because it would always be open to them to re-apply for a licence at the end of the period.  If they had been running a station in comformity with the regulations they should have no fears about having their licences renewed.</P>
    <P>Turning again to section 3 of the Bill, subsection (4) states that due regard will have to be given to the character of the applicant company including, if considered relevant, its members and shareholders. I think it is essential that shareholding should be fully disclosed because if it is not, then a situation could rise where one shareholder or a group of shareholders could control several radio stations in a region and that kind of monopoly would not be in the best interests of the development of this service.</P>
    <P>There should be full disclosure of shareholding and that means the beneficial owners of shares should be disclosed if shares are held by nominees <Col N="1271" /> because this gets back to who is controlling a company or companies.</P>
    <P>I would argue strongly also that each licensee company should issue a report annually to the Minister.  Other companies in the State which operate under licence, such as banks, and insurance companies, are obliged to issue an annual report and detail in it directorships, shareholding, finances and complaints etc.  The same should apply to independent broadcasting stations, and all these data should be available on a public register.</P>
    <P>I would like to return briefly to the position of RTE and how it will be affected by the introduction of independent radio broadcasting.  This Bill does not provide for any role for RTE in commercial radio.  The argument has been put forward that RTE have had the field to themselves for the past 60 years and have had the benefit of being able to avail of both a licence fee and advertising revenue.  The sole income for independent operators will, of course, be confined to advertising only.</P>
    <P>I do not hold a brief for RTE and I certainly no not want to perpetuate the monopoly they have had.  I welcome competition in this whole area.  RTE's role as the primary national station is to continue to provide the excellent public service broadcasting output they have been providing over the years.  Many aspects of their programming could rightly be said to be non-profitable and this is necessitated through the obligations they have under the Broadcasting Acts to provide a service which is, in essence, public service broadcasting and not just a commercial service.</P>
    <P>The maintenance by RTE of the two orchestras, their commitment in terms of programming content to cultural, educational and current affairs material and the high proportion of home produced programmes, are all part of their public service broadcasting obligations.</P>
    <P>These services cost a lot of money to provide.  The commercial stations do not have these obligations imposed on them and, with the exception of having to <Col N="1272" /> include news and current affairs as 20 per cent of their broadcasting output, the balance of the commercial stations output would be low cost and will almost exclusively concentrate on continuous pop music and advertising.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a point Deputy Bruton made in relation to this 20 per cent.  I agree with him in the sense that it is possibly a requirement that should not be as heavily imposed as it is intended from what the Minister has said.  Whether it should be confined to news and current affairs only should be questioned.  Perhaps these independent stations would be going some way to meet the obligations the Minister is trying to get them to meet if, instead of news and current affairs, they had material on educational and cultural matters included in that 20 per cent slot.  It might be too much to expect them to confine their input in that 20 per cent to basically news and current affairs.  Perhaps there is scope to broaden that in terms of other material that could be provided.</P>
    <P>RTE's financial position has improved considerably in recent years and they achieved profits of approximately £5 million last year.  So they are in good financial shape to take on the competition that will emerge with the advent of commercial radio.  However, it is important that RTE should be allowed to compete on an equal basis with the competition that will now emerge.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that the major problem for RTE in terms of market share for advertising will come from the proposed national independent station.  RTE should be better able to cope with competition from the smaller regional and local stations.  But in order to enable RTE to compete on equal terms the Minister, if so requested by the Authority should give favourable consideration to relaxing some of the restrictions on broadcasting hours and advertising content on RTE 1.</P>
    <P>Cork Local Radio will undoubtly be put in jeopardy if the present restrictions are retained on it.  At present Cork Local Radio broadcasts for just a few hours a day and obviously this station cannot <Col N="1273" /> survive if it is going to be in competition with two or three independent stations, operating in its catchment area, which have freedom to broadcast for up to 24 hours a day if they wish.  Either the Government are serious about Cork Local Radio continuing as the only RTE controlled local radio station or they are not.  It is unrealistic to expect that this station can survive if it is not given greatly increased broadcasting time given that two other stations will be operating in the same catchment area.</P>
    <P>I also feel that RTE have a role to play in the development of the smaller neighbourhood stations.  These stations would not be competing with RTE and, as I have said already, their development should be positively encouraged by the State.  Are RTE to be prevented from providing what could be a very valuable service to the smaller stations in the form of training and supplying a sustaining service during the hours these stations are not broadcasting directly?  I would like the Minister to clarify that matter for me as I feel it could be crucial in terms of the development of these smaller stations. Obviously RTE should charge appropriate fees if they become involved in these small neighbourhood stations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the existing pirate stations, the Minister stated that they would not be debarred from making applications for licences.  This is as it should be because up to now the illegal status has not been the fault of the stations but the fault of the current legislation which has failed to cater for the reality that the public want a choice of listening service. Every station, other than RTE, is at present illegal.  The passing of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1987, will of course change all that if it is rigorously enforced as I expect it will be and thereby bring an end once and for all to the present unacceptable pirate situation which has existed for over ten years.</P>
    <P>The applications from these pirate stations should be carefully scrutinised and this is another reason why a public register should be kept giving full details about all applicants, including disclosure about <Col N="1274" /> their previous involvement, if any, in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>One of the major justifiable criticisms of these stations up to now by RTE was that they operated in an irresponsible way and were purely motivated by profit. Many of these illegal stations interfered with frequency allocations for RTE and other communications services, including the gardaí and emergency services.  In addition many of these stations did not pay royalties, corporation tax, VAT, PAYE or PRSI and they flouted the law in every possible way.  Such operators should not now be legalised and licences should only be granted to former pirate stations that can demonstrate from their records that they operated responsibly. A condition of granting licences to these stations should be that they pay royalties and outstanding taxes on the profits they made in previous years.  It is estimated in a reply to a question in the Dáil that a minimum of £4 million a year has been earned in advertising revenue by all the pirate stations.</P>
    <P>On the question of the participation of newspapers in independent broadcasting, I should like what I am proposing as an independent authority to be looked at closely.  While I do not want to debar newspapers from involvement in commercial radio, there is a danger that a media power block could be built up if they become involved in a totally uncontrolled way.  That is one of the reasons we need an independent authority to look at all the implications and ramafications of things like newspaper involvement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the intention of these Bills in so far as they will regularise the present position with regard to pirate operators and bring about an orderly development of legal independent radio services.  However, the Sound Broadcasting Bill, which is very general in its terms, has many defects which I want to see rectified.  I shall be very interested indeed to hear the Minister's response to my various criticisms. If he feels that these points can be accommodated, I and my party will have no difficulty in supporting the Second Stage but, as I said as the outset, we shall be <Col N="1275" /> putting down many amendments for Committee Stage.  I shall go into more detail at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall open my contribution by quoting Deputy Richard Bruton as saying that this is a perfect stomping ground for ideology.  There is ample evidence of that here in one of the Bills before us tonight.  In the past, the Labour Party have been accused of being ideologues but from what I have heard from the Minister I am firmly convinced that it is an ideology of the right, the ideology of private enterprise.  That in itself can be quite an honourable pursuit but the manner in which it is presented to us tonight gives great cause for concern.</P>
      <P>There are two Bills before the House for consideration.  One, the Sound Broadcasting Bill, is legislation which has a potential to cut off or kill off public service broadcasting as we know it.  It should be said that RTE have served the country well.  They have given a wonderful service down through the years. They have been the subject of criticism in the past, in some cases justified, but by and large their service to the State cannot be questioned.  They were underfunded, working at a loss.  Their financial position has now somewhat improved. Some of the conditions which the Minister has laid down will ensure the demise of RTE, with particular reference to the reasons he gives for allowing RTE only seven and a half minutes of advertising time per hour whereas he allows the commercial stations ten minutes per hour. Rather than increasing RTE's take, I should like to see him reducing the ten minute take of the commercial stations to a seven and a half minute slot.  I shall get back to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill is a great deal less contentious. Many would say that the Bill is long overdue while some would say it is <Col N="1276" /> not necessary, that all we need to do is update the penalty in the 1926 Act.  The first point I should like to make is that these two Bills should be separated from each other.  As you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle, I attempted on the Order of Business today to bring up this subject but without success.  The Taoiseach and the Minister objected to that.  The Minister has my assurance that he will have the maximum co-operation from me in the passing of this legislation.  I do not see any reason whatsoever why we cannot at this stage separate the two Bills.  By Christmas it should be possible to have the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill enacted.  This will enable us to come to grips with the situation that now prevails regarding pirate stations. There is no doubt great concern as to the damage that these have done and will continue to do unless they are brought into line.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Minister seems reluctant, like previous Ministers, to come to grips with the pirates.  They have now come to a stage where they can intimidate politicians.  There was ample evidence of this in the past.  When we had a &ldquo;rent-a-crowd&rdquo; situation, one previous Minister endeavoured to take the pirates off the air under the existing legislation.  He succumbed to pressure from, shall we say, the younger section of the population who were whipped into line by these pirate radio stations.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed, I must confess, by the attitude of Deputy O'Malley, although there are many things he said with which I would agree.  I was disappointed with what he said with regard to the pirates, that they should be allowed to apply for a licence.  He said that it is not the fault of the pirates that they are violating the law.  That is a rather reckless statement, to say the very least because it could apply to any lawbreaker. If you are going to issue a licence to a practising pirate, shall we say, the only analogy that I can make is that it is akin to giving a licence to an active subversive to run a security firm.  There is a need to get the pirates off the air at the earliest possible date and that could be achieved <Col N="1277" /> by 1 January if the Minister will agree to put forward the Wireless Telegraphy Bill and defer introduction of the Sound Broadcasting Bill for a period of six months.  We could then use the time to clear the airwaves after the passing of the Wireless Telegraphy Bill to conduct a proper and calm debate on the kind of radio we need, a kind of debate that we have never really had in the past.</P>
    <P>One of the most regrettable disappointments of recent years has been the <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude of Irish Governments, including one of which I was a member myself, namely the last Coalition Government, to the way in which pirate stations have consistently and brazenly flouted the law.  They did not break just the telegraph Acts, they were also in many cases guilty of breaches of the planning legislation and, most importantly of all, of the laws protecting the rights of employees.  They have been also a constant source of danger and annoyance, frequently jamming emergency radio frequencies.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I should like to quote a parliamentary question which was put down by the former Deputy, Liam Cosgrave, for answer on 25 May 1983 because it makes very interesting reading and is very relevant to the discussion we are having here tonight.  The question was:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the number of complaints about interference received as a result of the operation of unlicensed radio stations; the dates these complaints were first received; and by whom they were submitted.</P>
    <P>The answer was:</P>
    <P>Equipment was recently seized from three illegal broadcasting stations on foot of court warrants.  The stations in question were operating in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>This was done in 1983.  Three transmitters were confiscated and this could still be done if the will was there.  The reply continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> Private radio stations caused extensive interference to ambulance services in Dublin, Meath and Louth for a period last month.  As a result the ambulance services were unable to send or receive any intelligible messages. This could have had the most serious consequences in any emergency. It was established that this interference was caused in large measure by Radio Nova-Kiss FM.</P>
    <P>Twenty-two separate incidents of interference to radio frequencies at Dublin Airport were recorded during a recent period.  This interference affected frequencies used by aircraft when taxiing and immediately after take-off and frequencies used by airport fire and emergency services and frequencies used by the Defence Forces.  It was not possible to establish the source of the interference in every one of these cases but in any case where it was established it was found to be Radio Sunshine.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy O'Malley suggesting that Radio Sunshine have not put lives at risk?</P>

      <P>The quotation goes on for a further two pages and lists the effects of the interference with the legitimate frequencies used by the emergency services.  This regrettably was allowed to continue and it is going on, by the Minister's own admission, for a period of ten years.  It is a frightful indictment of this House that this matter was not tackled <Col N="1279" /> long before now.  Lives have been put at risk due to the negligence.</P>

      <P>I am showing the Minister the way to do it from 1 January. I am prepared to give him all the assistance he needs to ensure that this Bill is introduced immediately.  The Minister can have the legislation through this House by the close of business on Thursday week if need be as far as the Labour Party are concerned and it would seem that all other Members are also prepared to co-operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister has confirmed my worst fears that he has not got the will to tackle the pirates.  He is afraid of the rent-a-crowd.  We will have Kiss FM, Radio Sunshine and Radio Nova governing the country.  This is an opportunity the Minister should grasp and I do not think any other Minister would be promised legislation in such a short period.  All Stages could be cleared by Christmas and the Bill could be law by the New Year if the Minister had the will to do so.</P>
      <P>While all this has been happening the pirates have made major inroads into the legitimate pool of advertising revenue available not just for RTE but also for the local newspapers.  While I do not hold any brief for local newspapers and while I have never found them to be particularly fair to the Labour Party, with some honourable exceptions, it is a fact nevertheless that they are entitled to fair treatment. Local newspapers in many cases have made outstanding contributions to their communities during the years.  If competition is going to do them damage the least they are entitled to is fair competition but the pirates do not represent fair competition, even the legitimised pirates.  This Bill will not in any way help to control them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases they pay slave wages and are staffed for part of the time by young <Col N="1280" /> people who are so anxious to break into the radio business that they are willing to work for nothing.  In some cases some of the children who act as disc jockeys have to bring their own records.  It has been suggested that in one radio station here in Dublin for the honour of being a disc jockey a person pays the sum of £10 to the radio station.  The wall to wall music they play without paying royalties most of the time costs almost nothing to produce. The news services which they provide are pirated from RTE and sometimes from the morning and evening newspapers right throughout the country, or else they are compiled by trainee journalists who again work for trainee wages.  There is another danger in that some of the sources of the news are not authenticated.  In the past it would have been possible to send out disinformation because the Government were not prepared to tackle the pirates.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this legislation for a number of years and I suppose some people might say I was instrumental in not having it introduced during the term of office of the previous Government. One of the things that I could not understand was the attitude of the National Union of Journalists who were prepared to allow their members to work in pirate radio stations.  They condoned the breaking of the law.  These are people who in the past pointed the accusing finger at the politicians for not doing their job.  Yet they condoned the fact that journalists who were members of their union worked on pirate radio stations.  That is not acceptable to me as a trade unionist and it amounts to double standards.  From time to time these people have lectured politicians and, indeed, the whole community on what should and should not be done.  Nonetheless, they themselves continued to flout the law.  Of course, the consequence of that is that it is possible for an enormous number of pirate stations to exist making money for a small number of people.</P>
    <P>The operators have managed to establish for themselves a veneer of professionalism and even respectability. They have also established such a reputation <Col N="1281" /> that some politicians are now afraid of them.  Their capacity in the past to rent a crowd, which I have already referred to, whenever they were threatened with the law saved them on many occasions.  I hope the Minister will not succumb to such pressure on this occasion and will accept my suggestion about bringing in a wireless Bill as distinct from a sound Bill.</P>
    <P>The history of this whole sorry episode is littered with stories of pirate stations being put off the air by the authorities only to be back on the air again within days and sometimes within hours.  The history of these stations also contains unsavoury episodes of operators absconding leaving behind a pile of unpaid bills, including bills owed to the State.  Indeed, the Minister for Finance may have a bit to add to that because he was often the victim.  It is not enough to say that these people will not get bonus points when the local radio licences are being awarded.  If they are to qualify for any involvement in local radio one of the first requirements should be that they demonstrate for a period of at least six months that they are capable of obeying the law and are operating decent standards of employment and broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Each applicant should be investigated by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that there are no taxes outstanding.  The Performing Rights Society are owed considerable amounts of money.  Although some stations in latter times have paid royalties to the Performing Rights Soceity there are many other stations operating throughout the country who have never paid them.  For all these reasons the arguments for withdrawing the Sound Broadcasting Bill for a period are overwhelming. I can assure the Minister that any changes we have in mind in relation to the Wireless Telegraphy Bill will be aimed only at strengthening the Bill and its powers to deal with pirate radio. Apart from that he will find us co-operative in getting this measure on the Statute Book.  In so far as the Wireless Telegraphy Bill is concerned its main provisions do not differ to any significant extent from those contained in the Bills <Col N="1282" /> which have gone before it other than in the penalties contained in it for the purpose of controlling the airwaves.</P>
    <P>As I said a few moments ago, the Bill could be strengthened in one or two important respects.  One which would be very helpful would be the insertion of a clause specifying that anyone who flouted the law after it was passed would be deemed automatically to be of insufficient character to qualify for a local radio licence.  We will be moving an amendment to that effect.  Apart from that, I do not see any reason why this Bill could not pass without any great degree of contention.  This would be the wisest course by far and it would avoid the confusion which is inevitable when trying to deal with both Bills and their effects at the same time.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of dealing with both Bills together is likely to be that the Minister will be faced at some time in the future with considering applications for licences from pirate stations who are still on the air.  It is most undesirable for the Minister to deal with somebody who was in breach of the law and, to make matters worse, he would know that these people were in breach of the law.  The pirates have been able to cloak themselves with an air of respectability by developing some sort of association with community groups in their area. They probably would be able to whip up local support of the rent-a-crowd variety again.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Minister will find himself dealing with applications for licences from stations already on the air and subjected to a great deal of pressure.  The easiest way out would be to license the pirates.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (Republic of Austria) Order, 1987.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 25th day of November, 1987.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding with the motion for the Austrian agreement I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is a minor printing error in the draft Order.  This is on page six of the draft order where the heading &ldquo;Article IV&rdquo; appears twice.  The second heading should obviously read &ldquo;Article V&rdquo;.  It is only the heading which is incorrect, and I think it will be corrected.</P>
      <P>The existing Double Taxation Convention between Ireland and Austria was signed at Vienna on 24 May 1966.  Consequent on the changes which have taken place in the taxation laws of both countries, and in particular because of the new system of company taxation in Ireland, it was desirable that the Convention be amended to take account of those changes. This is being done by way of a protocol to the existing Convention.</P>
      <P>The Protocol was signed on 19 June 1987.  An order by the Government under section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, will be required to give it the force of Irish law.  Before such an Order is made a draft of it must be laid before and approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The draft order was laid before the Dáil on 25 November 1987 and contains in its schedule the text of the Protocol.  An explanatory memorandum which outlines the effects of the Protocol has also been circulated.  The White Paper containing the text of the Protocol was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 27 November 1987.  I will now briefly outline the main features of the Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article II expands the definition of <Col N="1284" />&ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; contained in the existing Convention to include areas outside the territorial waters of Ireland within which rights to the sea bed and subsoil and their natural resources may be exercised.</P>
    <P>Article III inserts a new Article 2A dealing with the determination of residence status for the purposes of the Convention. This is in the form first adopted in the Ireland-United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention of 1976 and is in accordance with the wording of the relevant Article later included in the 1977 OECD Model Convention.  The starting point in determining residence is the revenue law of each country and in the event of both countries claiming residence there is provision for settling which country is to be regarded as the country of residence for the purposes of the Convention. This eliminates the possibility of double residence arising in any case.</P>
    <P>Article IV amends Article 3 of the Convention, which sets out provisions concerning the determination of a &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; for business activities.  The effect of the additional wording now being included is to secure that the exploration of natural resources by an enterprise of a contracting state in the territory of the other contracting state is to be regarded as constituting a permanent establishment in the state where the activities are being undertaken.</P>
    <P>Article V substitutes a new Article 8 to take the place of the existing Article in the Convention and is necessary in view of the revised treatment of Irish dividend income introduced by the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>Article V secures payment to Austrian portfolio investors of the Irish tax credit, less 15 per cent of the distribution plus the tax credit.  This is in line with other double taxation arrangements concluded by this country since 1976.  There is no provision for payment of the tax credit to Austrian direct investors.  A direct investor is defined as a company controlling directly or indirectly at least 25 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend.  In the case of Austrian dividends flowing to an Irish investor, the rate of Austrian withholding <Col N="1285" /> tax is not to exceed 10 per cent in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Article is that the benefits of the Irish tax incentive reliefs included in the Convention have been retained for Austrian companies. An Austrian company which holds at least 25 per cent of the shares in an Irish company for more than one year will not be subject to tax in Austria in respect of dividends received from that company. This preserves for an Austrian parent company the benefit of any incentive relief which its Irish subsidiary might have obtained.</P>
    <P>Under Article IX the Protocol will be effective in Ireland as respects: (i) income tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April 1976; (ii) income levy for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April 1983; (iii) corporation tax for the financial year 1974 and subsequent financial years; and (iv) capital gains tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April 1974.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>
    <P>I will now move to the New Zealand Convention.</P>
    <P>A Convention between Ireland and New Zealand for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and capital gains was signed on behalf of the respective Governments on 19 September 1986 at Dublin.  This is the first such arrangement between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, an arrangement with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation will have the force of law in Ireland provided the Government make an order accordingly. Before such an order can be made, it must be laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving it must be passed by the House.</P>
    <P>The draft order was laid before the Dáil on 25 November 1987 and contains in its schedule the text of the Convention. An explanatory memorandum which outlines the effects of the Convention has also be circulated.  The White Paper <Col N="1286" /> containing the text of the Convention was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 24 March 1987.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ireland, the Convention will be effective for income tax and capital gains tax for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April following the date on which the Convention enters into force.  For corporation tax purposes, the Convention will have effect for any financial year beginning on or after 1 January following the date on which the Convention enters into force.</P>
    <P>The Convention follows the general principles of the Model Convention published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1977. The provisions are similar to those contained in the treaties which Ireland has concluded with the United Kingdom and Australia in recent years and those which are in course of negotiations with other states.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of eliminating double taxation, the Convention follows the two basic rules established in the OECD Model.  The first is that certain income may be taxed in one country only.  Thus, Government and local authority salaries will normally be taxable only in the country of source while interest and royalties will normally be taxable only in the country of residence of the beneficial recipient. The second basic rule is that where the same income or capital gains may be charged to tax in both countries the country of residence will allow a credit against its own tax in respect of the tax paid in the country of source.  I will now briefly outline the main features of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Article (iv) provides a series of tests to determine the country of residence where, under the separate residence criteria used by each country, there would be a double residence position.</P>
    <P>Article V defines the term &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; as being, in general, a fixed place of business in which the business of an enterprise is carried on.  This definition is particularly important for the taxation of business profits.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Article VI for which <Col N="1287" /> there is no corresponding provision in the OECD Model Convention is to regulate in an international context taxation rights in respect of profits, income or capital gains derived from offshore exploration. An enterprise which carries on offshore activities in connection with the exploration and exploitation of natural resources is deemed to be carrying on business through a permanent establishment. The creation of a permanent establishment position means that the profits attributable to the activities of that permanent establishment are liable to tax in the country in which it is situated.</P>
    <P>Article 9 is concerned with two questions. First, it restates the generally accepted principle of double taxation conventions that an enterprise of one State shall not be taxed in the other State unless it carries on business in that other State through a permanent establishment situated therein.  Secondly, when the enterprise carries on business through a permanent establishment in another State, that State may tax the profits of the enterprise but only so much of them as is attributable to the permanent establishment.</P>
    <P>Article 12 relates to the treatment of dividends flowing from one country to the other.  It provides that, in the case of dividends flowing from Ireland to New Zealand, a New Zealand resident portfolio investor is entitled to the same tax credit as an individual resident in Ireland subject to a charge to Irish tax at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent of the value of the dividend plus the tax credit attached to it.  No tax credit is payable to a New Zealand company which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the Irish company paying the dividend.  In the case of dividends paid by a New Zealand company to an Irish resident, the New Zealand withholding tax charge will be limited, in the normal case, to a rate of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unlike Ireland, New Zealand does not have a separate capital gains tax but certain capital profits are chargeable as income.  Accordingly, the present Article 15 was drafted so that it applies both to <Col N="1288" /> income and to capital gains.  The article has, therefore, been entitled &ldquo;Alienation of Property&rdquo;.  The broad effect of that Article is that income or capital gains derived from the disposal of immovable property and certain related movable property may be taxed in the State in which the property is situated.  The State of residence may also tax such property but is obliged to relieve any double taxation arising by allowing a credit for the tax suffered in the State of source.</P>
    <P>Article 24 deals with the elimination of double taxation where this has not been achieved either by the Convention or under the domestic law of the contracting states.  Broadly speaking, it provides by way of the credit method for the country of residence to allow against its own tax a credit for the tax paid in the other country on the same income or capital gains.</P>
    <P>Dividends derived from Ireland by New Zealand resident companies will remain free from New Zealand tax under New Zealand domestic law.  Where such dividends are relieved from Irish tax under the incentive reliefs the benefits of those reliefs will be preserved for New Zealand resident companies.  If the relevant provisions of New Zealand domestic law relating to the relief mentioned should cease to have effect, Article 24 provides that both states will enter into negotiations to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by New Zealand in relation to its tax on such dividends.</P>
    <P>According to Article 29 the Convention will enter into force when instruments of ratification have been exchanged between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I recommend that Dail Éireann approve the draft order and while we are debating it somebody might get rid of the fog in the Chamber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to welcome the Conventions.  The one with New Zealand is new and it is <Col N="1289" /> only proper that the House should ratify it at the earliest possible date.  The Conventions have already been signed.  It is important that individuals or companies who invest or work in each other's economies should not be taxed twice and that in countries that are friendly and trade with each other circumstances should not arise that result in individuals or companies being subject to double taxation. Obviously, there must also be some arrangement to ensure that individuals or companies are taxed in one country or the other.  The key to this is the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Firstly I should like to deal with the New Zealand Convention.  I understand it follows very much along the lines of the OECD 1977 model convention and that we have similar conventions with the United Kingdom and Australia.  I understand that others are in the course of negotiation and that they all follow much the same line.  In the Convention before us the two basic rules established in the OECD model are followed.  The first is that certain income may be taxed in one country only and thus, as the Minister said, Government and local authority salaries will normally be taxable only in the country of source while interest and royalties will normally be taxable only in the country of residence of the beneficial recipient.  The second basic rule is that where the same income or capital gains may be charged to tax in both countries the country of residence will allow a credit against its own tax in respect of the tax paid in the country of source.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see &mdash; I hope the Minister can confirm this &mdash; the Convention with New Zealand follows the lines of the OECD model in all respects save one.  I understand that it is along the lines of Conventions we have already agreed with other common law countries, namely the UK and Australia.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no objection to that.  It is right that the definition of the country should extend to the offshore area and that activities in that area should be subject to the provisions of the Convention just as if those activities took place on shore.  I welcome the new Convention with New Zealand. There is nothing controversial in it and I should like to congratulate the Minister on having the initiative to bring it into the House because quite frequently noncontroversial work is left aside while more pressing matters are brought forward. It is well worth while formalising the arrangements, as the Minister is doing tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention with Austria is an update of the previous Convention.  I understand that it needed to be updated because of changes in the law in both countries, particularly in the case of Ireland where the Corporation Tax Act was passed in 1976.  The previous Convention with Austria was signed in 1966. The Convention follows what seems to be a pattern now in such agreements coming from the Department of Finance in that it preserves the incentive package applicable to manufacturing industry here and for investment from abroad.  It is important to note that.  We should congratulate the officials who negotiated that agreement. I understand from the Explanatory Memorandum that Article V preserves for an Austrian parent company the benefit of any Irish tax incentive reliefs which its Irish subsidiary might have obtained. Sometimes it is difficult to know where the headquarters of a company are located and which country would be the beneficiary of any tax accruing.  We have companies which originated in Austria but whose corporate headquarters are no longer in that country.  Esoteric double taxation agreements discussed in the House may have a practical application to factory workers in this city.  I welcome that Convention.  I notice that in both <Col N="1291" /> cases the Conventions refer to the country of source or the country of residence and do not get entangled in the concept of domicile at all.  I presume that the country of source would be the nearest equivalent of the country of domicile.  I hope the Minister will be able to cast some light on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the accession of Ireland to those conventions which are part of the growing pattern of international tax co-operation.  I should like to congratulate the Minister's officials for negotiating a 10 per cent rate in relation to the withholding tax that New Zealand has applied because it appears that other countries have been subjected to a 15 per cent rate of withholding tax in relation to interest and royalty payments.  Therefore, the Irish negotiators have done well.</P>
      <P>In relation to Article 24 of the New Zealand agreement, the position regarding the repatriation of profits qualifying for Irish tax incentives to New Zealand is outlined.  Under present New Zealand law dividends received by New Zealand resident companies from other resident companies are generally exempt from company income tax.  This exemption also applies to dividends from non-resident companies except where the distribution is in respect of certain preference shares or the amount received has been the subject of a deduction claimed by the paying company in calculating their own tax.</P>
      <P>In summary, the dividends from Ireland to New Zealand are exempt from New Zealand tax but Article 24.1.(b) provides that if this New Zealand exemption on dividends is removed, then the two contracting states will have to enter into negotiations in order to establish new provisions concerning the taxation of such dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a similar clause exists in the double taxation agreement between Ireland and Australia.  The treaty was negotiated prior to the tax reform provisions which have recently been introduced in Australia.  Prior to <Col N="1292" /> that, dividends received from non-resident companies were effectively exempt from Australian income tax.  After tax reform in Australia last year the rules were changed and this exemption was removed.  The effect of this change is that an Australian company investing in Ireland will pay tax on their dividends at the difference between the Australian rate and the Irish rate applicable.</P>
    <P>I voice concern that the wording of the draft treaty with New Zealand does not guarantee that the favourable position now negotiated will continue in the event of a change in New Zealand domestic tax law.  In the Australian situation there has been some indication that the Australian revenue regard themselves as not bound at all to retain the beneficial arrangements we have and feel open and at liberty to increase the rate of taxation in respect of such dividends.  I suppose that the Irish negotiators did the best they could and that they could not ask for a more binding commitment in relation to future arrangements, but it is unfortunate that this element of uncertainty still persists.</P>
    <P>Going to the Austrian agreement, I mentioned in the case of the Swedish treaty that there was an exemption in respect of corporate investors from the residual Irish income tax liability, but an individual investor will still be subject to the theoretical liability, although I appreciate it is limited to 15 per cent.  I mentioned that to the Minister on the last occasion and I hope something will be done in respect of this theoretical liability. He indicated then that he was of a mind to do something some day about it, but I appreciate it is a thorny issue.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 of Article IV continues the exemption from Austrian tax in respect of dividends paid by an Irish resident company to their Austrian parent. That provision allows tax relieved companies to repatriate profits to Austria free of Austrian tax.  Although the provisions in the Austrian treaty are not quite as generous as in some others &mdash; for instance, it does not allow for foreign branch profits exemptions &mdash; I am advised and I accept that it is nonetheless <Col N="1293" /> adequate.</P>
    <P>Having made those comments, I congratulate the negotiators as Deputy Noonan has done.  They have done a good job and the Minister can rest assured that he is getting good service from those who have done this work for him.</P>

      <P>I thank both Deputies for their generous comments and their support for these two motions and these double taxation agreements.  Not much has been raised. I can say immediately to Deputy McDowell that we will look at the points he raised in relation to these arrangements regarding the difference between ten and 35.  I honour that commitment and confirm it again.</P>
      <P>In relation to the position the Deputy raised about possible changes in New Zealand law, while we are negotiating these we can only look at the law as it is at the time and when the law is changed subsequently or at any change in the law in any country we then request renegotiation of the terms of these arrangements. That will be ongoing.  In fact, we have already begun that process in the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Australia because of changes since the arrangements were concluded there.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I understood Deputy Noonan correctly.  I answered some of the points to and fro but he talked about resources, residence and domicile.  If I read Article 4.1 of the order relating to New Zealand it might explain some of what was on his mind:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Convention, the term &ldquo;resident of a Contracting State&rdquo; means any person who, under the law of that Contracting State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature.</P>
      <P>Domicile is one of the factors taken into account, residence is another and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But this term does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State <Col N="1294" /> in respect only of income from sources in that State.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;resident of Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;resident of Austria&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.  I do not know if that helps the Deputy.  We could go into a long definition of sources and what that means and get the dictionary definition of residence, domicile, nature of business and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the treatment of Martina Shanahan and others in connection with alleged offences against the British Secretary of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Martina Shanahan is aged 22 years, she has no previous convictions and her family are resident in Dublin.  She is at present detained at Risley remand centre in Cheshire.  It is important to place in context exactly where Cheshire is situated on the map of England.  It is in the north between Liverpool and Warrington.  She is on remand, however, to Chippenham Magistrates' Court in the south between Bristol and Swindon.  Each remand appearance takes place not in Chippenham Magistrates' Court but in the recreation room of Chippenham Police Station.  One single lay magistrate presides, not a legally qualified stipendiary magistrate.  The information is that other local magistrates &mdash; normally three lay magistrates sit together &mdash; have expressed their unwillingness to appear for reasons best known to themselves.</P>
      <P>The police station has the appearance of a fortress.  There are marksmen clearly visible on and around the roof.  No members of the public appear to attend. At most, one member of one of the families and members of the press attend this court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the extraordinary setting of the court proceedings and the fact that the room used as a court is lined with police, the three defendants are brought from the cells a few yards away with both hands cuffed together and further handcuffed to police officers.  Directives on handcuffing of prisoners in court, and the leading case on the issue, dictate that there should be no handcuffing unless it can be shown that the individual prisoner has a propensity for violence and/or has shown a reasonable expectation that he or she will attempt to escape.  Otherwise <Col N="1296" /> it is an assault by police.  None of this has been shown in relation to these three prisoners.  When stopped by police they accompanied them willingly and voluntarily to the police station.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about this: they were caught in suspicious circumstances and nobody is denying that.  What we are dealing with this evening is the treatment of the prisoners, and Martina Shanahan in particular.  The single lay magistrate showed herself unable to comprehend the legal issues raised in relation to even this agreement on handcuffs and said it was a matter for the police and that she trusted them.</P>
    <P>By holding hearings in a police station and surrounding them with prejudicial trappings, that is, armed police, helicopters, escorts with sirens, handcuffs, etc., any eventual trial will be affected by prejudicial interpretations.  Certainly any person in Chippenham and in the area to whom Martina Shanahan's solicitor has spoken, refers to them as &ldquo;the terrorists&rdquo;. Clearly the pool of local magistrates has been similarly affected if it is right that only one magistrate is willing to sit on this case.</P>
    <P>By handcuffing the prisoners despite such extraordinary security one is presenting them physically in a degrading and prejudicial way.  In addition, such handcuffing entirely prohibits the possibility of private consultation between lawyer and client without being overheard by the police handcuffed to them during court proceedings &mdash; I understand this happened at least on one appearance when there was a necessity for all three solicitors to speak to all three defendents urgently and in consequence three other police overheard the whole conversation.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the excessive melodrama that appears to surround the court of any suspect who is Irish and is charged with a so-called terrorist offence is not only wrong in principle and affects any eventual trial, but it is exaggerated in this instance.  It is bad practice, and it is unfair that the specially designated court should be in a police station.</P>
    <P>Ms Shanahan is so far from court at Risley that she has to be brought from <Col N="1297" /> Risley some 200 miles on the night before any court appearance and housed at the police station overnight.  She is accompanied by a convoy, is handcuffed in the back of a van &mdash; on the first occasion with black plastic bags over the windows &mdash; with a helicopter, and on one occasion a helicopter and a plane.  She is as far as it is possible to be from the court, from her solicitor, and from her co-defendants. She arrives at court in an understandably upset state.</P>
    <P>Since her arrest Ms Shanahan has spoken to no one at Risley except her family for one hour when they travel from Dublin overnight by ferry to visit her once a week.  They are a family of no means.  They travel because Ms Shanahan does not have conversation with any other human being if they do not.  She is prohibited from any contact with any other prisoner.  When she leaves her cell once a day for &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; all other prisoners are cleared from the exercise yard. When she tried on one occasion to look out of the window of her cell at other prisoners exercising she was told that was forbidden.  The Home Office inform us she is the only category A prisoner (female) in the country and hence she is not permitted to speak to anyone else. She remains in her cell 23 hours a day.</P>
    <P>After serious complaints had been made in relation to her conditions, she was told during one week she could watch television instead of exercise.  She is not allowed to go to Mass with other prisoners but has to have it in her cell, unlike male category &ldquo;A&rdquo; prisoners.  The light in her cell remains on for 24 hours.  It in only dimmed at night, not switched off. For the first four weeks of her custody she suffered from permanent and debilitating headaches.</P>
    <P>These complaints speak for themselves. It is, however, impossible for any Irish prisoner charged with such an offence to have their prison conditions considered on their own merits.  Ms. Shanahan is a well-behaved and very pleasant young woman who is a model prisoner.  She faces the prospect of waiting up to nine months or a year before a trial at which she will almost certainly be <Col N="1298" /> acquitted of the charge brought against her.  In that time we would expect that she will physically and mentally deteriorate. She is suffering already from obvious signs of strain.  Her family are likely to face enormous debts to pay for weekly travel to allow for any human contact.</P>
    <P>Her solicitor is in as much contact as possible but distances are considerable. After each court appearance at present her solicitor requests a joint conference with her co-defendants and their solicitors merely to contrive human contact. Food at Risley is dietetically unsound and, in addition, is always cold.  Exercise is limited to walking round a yard on her own.</P>
    <P>The conclusion is that this prisoner, Ms. Shanahan, is the most severely disadvantaged prisoner in the entire United Kingdom prison system, infinitely worse off than convicted prisoners who are provided with work, exercise and association. She, of course, is innocent in the eyes of the law.  My belief, and the belief of her family, is that she will not do justice to herself or her case if she appears for trial broken or dented in spirit, mind or body.  She faces trial in almost impossible conditions in any event because of prejudicial pre-trial publicity.</P>
    <P>That is the case for the treatment of Ms. Shanahan and it appears to have all the elements of a case that presumes her guilt before she can prove her innocence. I want to strongly protest on behalf of the Shanahan family and her co-defendants about her treatment by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>In the past few days we passed the Extradition Act and her treatment should be considered in that context.  The British authorities have a duty to give her fair treatment but they are not doing that.  I want the Minister to strongly protest to the British authorities, through the Anglo-Irish process or any other process he deems necessary, to give some semblance of justice to this young lady and her co-defendants in advance of a charge of which I and others believe they will be acquitted.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect I should like to mention.  There was some criticism in <Col N="1299" /> the recent past of the Irish Embassy in London and their alleged unwillingness to visit prisoners in British prisons.  I want to put on the record my appreciation of the work being done by the Irish Embassy in London for the Irish community and for Irish prisoners in British prisons and my experience extends over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Ambassador, Mr. Andrew O'Rourke, for his co-operation because he has a very limited number of people on his staff.  My contact was a former official of the embassy, Orla O'Hanrahan, now in the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and her successor in the embassy, Breffni O'Reilly. This man does wonderful work.  I am not talking about a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job, but a Monday to Sunday job.  He has travelled from London to Long Lartin Prison, a two hour return journey, with me and other Members of the Dáil to visit prisoners in that category A establishment. My expression of appreciation reflects the experience I and others have had with the officials of the Irish Embassy in London.  They have been very co-operative and it would be wrong if I were to let stand the criticism made of them in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>On 1 December 1987, Parliamentary Question No. 60 asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ldquo;if he would arrange for a representative from the Irish Embassy in London to visit a person&rdquo;&mdash; obviously Ms. Shanahan &mdash;&ldquo;in Risley remand centre to ascertain the basis for the complaints she is making regarding the amount of exercise time given to her; and if he would make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;  The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>It is intended that an officer of the embassy will visit the person concerned in the near future.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy as soon as the visit takes place.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the visit has taken place but I hope it has and, if not, it should take place.  Maybe the Minister will respond to the reasonable points raised arising out of what appears to be unfair treatment of <Col N="1300" /> Irish people in British prisons before their trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to reply to Deputy Andrews and for the manner in which he raised this very sensitive issue. I fully recognise that there is concern in this House and among the public generally about the treatment of some Irish prisoners in British jails.  We all heard clear expression of this concern during the debate on the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987, especially in relation to Miss Shanahan.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what Deputy Andrews said tonight about Ms. Shanahan's situation.  The Government are acutely conscious of their responsibility to ensure that Irish prisoners in British jails are treated fairly.  Whenever problems arise, we give clear and firm instructions to the Embassy in London to provide the necessary consular assistance and to take whatever other action may be required by the particular circumstances of each case.  On behalf of the Embassy personnel, I should like to thank Deputy Andrews for his praise of the efforts of the Embassy personnel in this and other regards.  Like him, I feel that the criticism made recently was unjust.</P>
      <P>The Embassy's responsibilities in this area include visiting prisoners and actively pursuing any legitimate complaints with the British authorities.  In some cases a prisoner might not wish a consular visit from the Embassy and of course that wish is respected.  Our primary objective is to ensure that Irish citizens are treated fairly and equitably at all times.  I am satisfied in this regard that the Embassy fulfils to the utmost its consular duties in this area within the limits of available resources.  This, of course, is kept under constant review and is, indeed, being actively considered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the specific case of Ms. Shanahan, the Embassy has been actively monitoring the conditions in which she, and the two people who are charged with <Col N="1301" /> her, are being held in remand pending their trial.  As mentioned by Deputy Andrews, Ms. Shanahan is the only female category A remand prisoner in Britain.</P>
    <P>On the instructions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Embassy visited Ms. Shanahan in Risley Remand Centre last week with a view to securing at first hand full details of her remand conditions. They differ from her co-accused in that they are, in effect, conditions of complete isolation.  They have led to considerable concern, which I share.  I particularly note the concern expressed by Ms. Shanahan's legal representative, Dr. Gareth Pierce, on her behalf.  The Embassy, therefore, has been instructed to raise this isolation and other aspects of her condition with the British authorities. Miss Shanahan will be kept fully <Col N="1302" /> informed of developments in the Embassy's efforts to achieve improvements in her conditions and she will be visited again.</P>
    <P>The Government understand and appreciate the concern of Deputies in this and other cases.  On behalf of the Government, I should like to say that we are all particularly conscious and appreciative of the invaluable work of Deputy Andrews in this general area.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a very large number of people from both communities in Cyprus are still missing as a result of events in that country in the 1960s and 1970s.  A special United Nations Committee, consisting of representatives of each community and of the Red Cross, has been trying since 1981 to investigate what happened to those people.  The situation is a very tragic one but the fact that there was agreement to set up such a committee showed some willingness to deal with the matter on a humanitarian basis.  This committee is in the best position to get information about those who are missing.  I strongly support the work of the UN Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus and call on everybody in a position to do so to co-operate fully with it in trying to resolve this tragic problem but I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by a direct approach from me to any of the parties involved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he favours a GNP based, a VAT based or a mixed GNPVAT based system of national contributions to the EC budget; and whether he expects the present controversy over the various options within the EC budget reform package to be settled in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Own Resources of the Community at present consist of three main elements: (i) Agricultural and sugar levies; (ii) Customs duties; (iii) A proportion of the harmonised VAT base of the member States.  At present this proportion stands at 1.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the system of future financing proposed by the Commission in February, the first two elements would remain largely unchanged, the VAT element would be reduced to 1 per cent and there would be a fourth resource consisting of a uniform levy on a new base defined as the difference between GNP and the VAT base.</P>
      <P>In the discussions of the Commission proposal, the debate has centred on the VAT call-up rate and the fourth resource.</P>
      <P>The Conclusion of the European Council in June stated that &ldquo;the financing system should, as proposed by the Commission, take greater account of the proportionality of contributions in accordance with the relative prosperity of member States&rdquo;.  The Conclusions were agreed by 11 member states, including Ireland.</P>
      <P>GNP is the internationally recognised yardstick of a country's relative prosperity. The most appropriate response, from Ireland's point of view, to that Conclusion of the European Council, would be a system of contributions based on shares of Community GNP.  Such a system would maximise the element of proportionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The least satisfactory system for Ireland would be a continuation of the <Col N="1026" /> present VAT based system, which weighs relatively heavily on some of the least prosperous member states, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>A system based entirely on GNP poses difficulties for some member states.  Furthermore, the Government recognises that the system likely to emerge eventually may well be a mixed system, incorporating elements based on VAT and on GNP.  On this basis therefore, and in an effort to be constructive and to promote agreement, Ireland has supported the revenue system proposed by the Commission. The Commission proposal has the advantage that over time and with the growth of the Community budget, the system would become fully proportional to GNP.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will report to the House after Question Time today on the outcome of the European Council in Copenhagen. Final agreement was not reached at the meeting, and the European Council will resume in Brussels on 11-12 February.  I am confident that this item and the other aspects of the Community financing package can be agreed at that stage.</P>

      <P>The present situation in the Persian Gulf is a direct result of the war between Iran and Iraq.  The only certain way to ensure a return to normality in the Gulf is to secure an end to the war. In pursuance of this objective the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted in July of this year a mandatory resolution &mdash; Resolution 598 &mdash; which calls for an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal to internationally recognised boundaries.  This resolution represents the sole basis for a comprehensive, just, honourable and durable settlement.  We fully support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to secure its urgent implementation.  It is for the members of the Security Council to agree on whatever measures may prove necessary in due course to enforce compliance with the terms of this resolution should the mediation efforts of the Secretary General fail to secure its implementation by the belligerents.

      <P>In Washington today President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev signed the agreement on the worldwide elimination of intermediate nuclear forces (INF).  This is an important and historic achievement which we warmly welcome and fully support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government I would like to extend to President Reagan and <Col N="1030" /> General Secretary Gorbachev our appreciation for their commitment and dedication to reaching this agreement which achieves for the first time a genuine reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union.  It represents a longawaited positive and constructive new step in the arms control and disarmament process which we have consistently advocated. It should result in particular in a significant reduction in the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe.  In view of the overwhelming support which this agreement attracts it is our hope that the remaining steps necessary to bring it into force can be quickly taken.</P>
    <P>The signing of the INF agreement opens up the prospects for a new and more constructive era in East-West relations.  We hope also that it will help chart an ambitious course for further reductions in the numbers of nuclear weapons and towards greater disarmament generally.  In particular, we hope that this first step will be the prelude to other steps which will include agreements on strategic nuclear weapons and space systems. In this manner the universal goal of a more secure and stable world can be advanced.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other aspects of the Deputy's question the Government remain committed to the goal of the greatest possible reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their eventual elimination. We support the overall objective of the dialogue between the US and the USSR which is to prevent an arms race in space and terminate it on earth.  It is our belief that a comprehensive test-ban treaty would be a positive and practical measure in inhibiting the further technical development of nuclear weapons and help reduce reliance on these weapons by the nuclear weapons states.  Most recently in my address to the UN General Assembly in September I renewed our call for the conclusion of such a test ban treaty.  The US-Soviet dialogue which has recently begun and which concentrates in the first instance on verification aspects of nuclear testing is a welcome step towards the goal of a nuclear test ban although <Col N="1031" /> we are disappointed that agreement on a complete cessation of such testing has once again been deferred.  In our view there is no practical obstacle to such a ban on testing.</P>
    <P>Next July is the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  As we approach the anniversary of this agreement with which Ireland has such close association we hope that the commitment entered into in that agreement to pursue a path leading to nuclear disarmament will have been further advanced through the INF agreement signed today and further agreements on reductions of nuclear weapons which we hope will flow from this event.</P>
    <P>At the current session of the UN General Assembly a decision was taken to hold a Third Special Session devoted to Disarmament next year from 31 May to 25 June.  The issue of nuclear disarmament will be central to the deliberations of this Special Session at which we hope that a broad commitment to, and framework for, progress in the future can be agreed.  We look forward to actively participating at this Special Session and to helping ensure its success.  We also hope that the successful conclusion of the Special Session will promote and advance the disarmament process at the multilateral level.</P>

      <P>It is the function of our Honorary Consuls to protect the interests of Ireland and Irish citizens within their areas of appointment, principally through the provision of consular services and through assisting in the promotion of trade.

      <P>All candidates for such appointments are thoroughly assessed before their appointment and their ongoing performance is carefully monitored.

      <P>I would, however, remind the Deputy that it is not widely appreciated that these are solely honorary appointments and that apart from a purely nominal stipend, refund of expenses and retention of 50 per cent of their fees, these consular officers are in receipt of no remuneration from the State and have no representational functions.  Despite this, many of them have to shoulder an onerous task, depending on where they are living and I am very satisfied with their overall performance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been monitoring the food situation in Ethiopia since the failure of the crucial summer rains first <Col N="1034" /> gave cause for concern.  It was recognised that the realities of the problem in Ethiopia demanded an early response from donors if food aid and other forms of relief assistance are to reach the threatened populations in time.  With that consideration in mind I have over recent months allocated a total of £355,000 from my Department's disaster relief fund towards famine relief in Ethiopia.  Of that amount £185,000 has been allocated to Irish non-Governmental aid organisations i.e. Concern, Goal and Trócaire. The balance has been allocated to three major international relief organisations i.e. UNICEF, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations disaster relief organisation in respect of their famine relief programmes in Ethiopia.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Food is making arrangements at the moment to ship 3,386 tonnes of wheat to Ethiopia under the Food Aid Convention.  This represents a significant and timely response to the emergency in Ethiopia and one which takes account of the major relief role played by non-Governmental organisations during the course of the 1984-85 famine.  My Department will continue to keep the situation under constant review.</P>

      <P>Our approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict at the United Nations and in other fora is based on two fundamental principles: the right of all states in the region, including Israel to exist within secure frontiers and the right of the Palestinian people to self determination with all that this implies.  Together with our partners in the Twelve we have made clear our commitment to the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and I indicated our readiness to play an active role in assisting this process. In my statement to the General Assembly I urged all the parties concerned to renew and intensify their efforts to overcome those obstacles and differences which still stand in the way of the convening of a conference and I expressed our appreciation and support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General to this End.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our concern is focused on two further areas of conflict in the region which continue to pose a threat to international peace and security, namely, the Iran-Iraq war and the situation in Lebanon.  At the General Assembly I appealed to Iran and Iraq to recognise the futility of continuing this war and to accept the call of the <Col N="1037" /> Security Council for a ceasefire leading to a negotiated settlement.  Together with our partners in the Twelve we have made clear our full support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General in seeking to secure urgent implementation by the belligerents of UN Security Council Resolution 598.  This mandatory resolution adopted unanimously by the Security Council in July of this year represents the sole basis for a comprehensive, just, honourable and durable settlement of the conflict.  We remain deeply concerned about the continuing instability and violence in the Lebanon.  A practical manifestation of our efforts to contribute to stability in the Lebanon is our involvement in UNIFIL.  In addressing events in the Lebanon I emphasised our deep concern about the difficulties facing the force in carrying out its mandate.  We have also spoken out strongly against the practice of hostage taking and kidnapping mindful of the fact that an Irish citizen is among those missing, presumed kidnapped.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a similar question from Deputy Higgins on 16 June last, the accompaniment by the RUC of UDR patrols which come into direct contact with the community is a policy to which I attach a high priority. As the Deputy knows, the principle of RUC accompaniment in such circumstances has already been agreed by the British authorities, so what is involved now is the implementation of that principle.  I have been availing of the framework of the intergovernmental conference to press for the full implementation of this principle with all possible speed.  I have also availed of the conference machinery to raise specific cases of unaccompanied UDR patrols which have been brought to my attention, and am continuing, and will continue, to pursue such cases vigorously in the conference.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks if I am satisfied with the level of accompaniment.  I am satisfied that some progress has been made, but clearly I would wish to see more, and at a more rapid pace; as I indicated in my reply to Deputy Higgins in June, I will be fully satisfied only when all UDR patrols are accompanied by the RUC on all operations involving contact with the community.  This remains my position and this is what I will be pressing for as strongly as possible in the conference framework.</P>

      <P>Total Irish development assistance to Sudan in 1987 will be approximately £1.9 million.</P>
      <P>The Sudan is one of four priority countries for Irish bilateral assistance.  Expenditure on bilateral aid programme projects in 1987 is expected to be in the region of £1.5 million, with assistance being provided in the areas of agriculture, research, education, village water supply, primary health care and forestry. In addition, the Sudan has received assistance under the NGO co-financing scheme, the international fertiliser supply scheme, the followship programme and from the disaster relief fund.</P>

      <P>Camden Council deny that there is any discrimination against Irish people in their provision of emergency accommodation for the homeless, and insist that the criteria being applied to Irish people are no different from those applied to people from Great Britain. The council also claim that tickets to Ireland are provided only to those who have adequate accommodation available to them in Ireland.</P>
      <P>While we do not yet have precise information on the numbers of Irish people involved, our understanding is that, to date, in the region of ten families have been supplied with travel vouchers for return to Ireland.

      <P>The Government are aware that there is concern among sections of the Irish community in Britain that their status might be affected by the British Nationality Act, 1981.  In view of this concern our Embassy in London has placed advertisements in Irish community newspapers in Britain and in other relevant publications outlining in some detail the position of Irish citizens under the Act.</P>
      <P>Embassy staff have met with the British Home Office officials and are fully briefed to deal with questions on the subject. Officials of the Embassy have participated in information meetings on the Act in a number of Irish centres in Britain.  In addition the Embassy are dealing with a large volume of telephone queries on the matter on a daily basis.</P>

We are satisfied that every effort is being made to disseminate information on the implications of the Act for Irish people living in Britain.  It is also worth noting that the process of naturalisation will remain open to those who wish to become British citizens after the expiry of the 31 December deadline for registration under the British Nationality Act.</P>

      <Col N="1053" /> Notes on Table:</P>
    <P>(1)  Relief from income tax was introduced for certain investment in research and development under Chapter III of the Finance Act. 1986.  No claim for relief was allowable before 1 January 1987.</P>
    <P>(2)  This relief was terminated with effect from 6 April 1983.</P>
    <P>(3)  The estimates relate to the cost of exemption from income tax of the interest earned on the securities in question.</P>
    <P>(4)  Relief from income tax and corporation tax was introduced under Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1986, to promote urban renewal and redevelopment in certain areas.</P>
    <P>General Note:</P>
    <P>The estimates given are on the basis that the application of tax:</P>
    <P>(a)  would not have altered activity in the affected areas;</P>
    <P>(b)  in one area would not have affected receipts in other areas, and;</P>
    <P>(c)  would not have resulted in other costs to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>All of these simplifying assumptions are unlikely to be correct.  The figures given cannot, therefore validly be summed and do not give an accurate indication of the amount of tax which might be raised in the future were any of the areas in question to become liable to tax.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Exchequer Bills.  For a period prior to January 1984, the excess of the amount received on redemption of such Bills over the amount paid for them at the time of issue was considered exempt from income tax except where it fell to be taken into account in computing for tax purposes the profits of a trade.  This exemption was removed by section 28 of the Finance Act, 1984, in respect of Exchequer Bills issued after 25 January 1984 except where a tender had been submitted on or before that date.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not maintained in such a manner as would enable them to estimate the cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax forgone of the exemption which existed before January 1984.</P>

The majority of gifts and inheritances are, because of these thresholds, exempt from tax, and where tax is clearly not payable, the Revenue Commissioners do not seek a return of his gift or inheritance from the beneficiary.

    <P>¹Generally speaking, outstanding balances are not a feature of customs and excise duties as duty is either secured or paid before dutiable goods are released from official control.  Exceptionally some small arrears of duty can temporarily arise from time to time in the case of some of the minor excise duties where traders fail to fulfil payment arrangements exactly on time.</P>
    <P>²The system under which stamp duties are operated does not give rise to the development of an arrear.</P>
    <P>The figures in the summary indicate the latest statistics available as regards the information sought by the Deputy. The balances on record do not, however, represent amounts of tax which were due for payment at 31 May 1987.  The bulk of the entries relate to assessments which were still under appeal or in respect of which appeals were, at the time, about to be lodged.  As the appeals are heard <Col N="1063" /> and settled in the normal course of the year's cycle the balances on record as tax will be adjusted downwards in the vast bulk of cases.  The aggregate of tax likely to be collected was arrived at on the basis of work in progress and includes assessed but not due for payment on 31 May 1987. By way of example corporation tax due for payment in the latter half of 1987 is included.  The estimates contained in the aggregate are based on Revenue experience.</P>

      <Col N="1070" /> Note regarding Customs Documentation Processed at various Ports.</P>
    <P>Information regarding the number of Customs entries processed annually at ports is not readily available.  (A Customs entry can include a number of trade transactions.) However, details of the number of trade transactions processed are available. Each tariff code number quoted on an entry represents a trade transaction and while the number of trade transactions on an entry can vary significantly the average number of trade transactions on an import entry is 1.9 while the average number of trade transactions on an export entry is 1.2.</P>
    <P>Knock Airport was approved for freight on 1st July 1987.</P>
    <P>On 1st January 1985, the Revenue Commissioners introduced a statistical threshold of £100 in trade statistics from which the details on the attached tabular statement have been extracted.  This threshold was increased to £200 on 1st January 1987.  Accordingly the 1986 figures do not include details of transactions less than £100 in value and the 1987 figures do not include details of transactions less than £200 in value which, although processed for Customs purposes were excluded from the trade statistics, with the exception of transactions relating to (a) imports on which Customs and/or Excise duty is payable (b) imports into Customs bonded warehouses and (c) exports subject to charges.</P>

    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that where a person in receipt of an assessable social welfare payment is also in receipt of income from employment, it is standard practice to collect any tax attributable to the social welfare payment (which is paid gross) by an appropriate restriction of the tax-free allowances available against the employment income.</P>

      <P>This year for the first time the scheme has been extended to the long term unemployed where they are living alone or with dependants.</P>
      <P>The urban fuel schemes, which are operated by 17 local authorities, provide automatic entitlement to fuel allowances for recipients of widows' pension, old age pension and blind pension resident in the areas concerned.  Prior to the present heating season the urban schemes also covered unemployment assistance recipients with dependants who were resident in those areas.  Unemployment assistance recipients who were homeless were not eligible under the terms of those schemes.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are being made for the rationalisation of the fuel schemes on a phased basis.  Under the first phase of this programme responsibility for providing fuel allowances to unemployment assistance recipients has been removed from the local authorities operating the urban schemes and the national fuel scheme has been extended to cover long term unemployment assistance recipients who are living alone or with dependants.  From the beginning of the next heating season in October 1988 the remaining categories in the urban schemes will be transferred to the national scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons of no fixed abode who are in receipt of an appropriate social welfare or other payment may qualify for fuel allowances provided they satisfy the living alone and other conditions which apply to recipients of those payments generally.  Homeless persons who are living in hostels would not generally be eligible for fuel allowances as they do not fulfil the living alone condition of the scheme.  It is known however that in a particular instance an urban authority <Col N="1080" /> provided fuel allowances to a hostel without regard to the entitlement of individual residents or to the fact that the residents of such hostels would frequently change rather than remain constant.</P>

      <P>An overpayment of £11,915.55 was incurred due to concurrent claiming of unemployment assistance and disability benefit on two separate occasions between 1981 and 1985.  The size of this overpayment requires that realistic deductions be imposed.  The amount overpaid will therefore continue to be recovered by weekly deductions of £15 from current payments.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions <Col N="1084" /> Nos. 134 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>At present, increases in social welfare payments are generally payable in respect of child dependants up to age 18 years.  However special arrangements apply in the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives or unmarried mothers who are receiving social welfare pension or allowance.  In such cases increases are awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years if they are in full time education.  There are no plans at present to extend the age limit for child dependancy beyond 21 years for the above group.  Any such proposal would have significant cost implications.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare examined the question of child dependency allowances, and recommended that these should be rationalised.  They also recommended that a child dependant allowance should be payable to all longterm recipients until the child reaches 21 years, where he/she is in full time education.  These recommendations, together with the Commission's recommendations on the whole area of child income support, will be considered as part of the ongoing evaluation of the commission's report.</P>

      <P>From time to time social welfare increases have been implemented with effect from different dates.  The important factor is, however, the level of increases.  Over the past ten years for instance the level of payments has increased in real terms by over 44 per cent for the long term unemployed, over 50 per cent for other long term payments and by 34 per cent for short term payments. The question as to the appropriate level of increases and the date of implementation of those increases will be determined by the Government in the context of the budget and in the light of their stated commitment.</P>

The pension order book at rate £15.75 was recalled because the wife of the person concerned claimed disability benefit and under the equal treatment regulations she was, therefore, entitled to be paid half-rate benefit in respect of their three qualified child dependants.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to county roads.  Information in the form requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for the maintenance (including surface dressing) of county roads rests with each county council.  It has never been the practice to make State road grants available for the maintenance of such roads.  Expenditure under this heading falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources.  However, I recently allocated grants totalling £15 million for the strengthening of county roads in 1988, compared with £15 million in 1987 and £5 million last year.</P>
      <P>Information relating to county roads which local authorities have supplied is being considered by the Department in the context of the preparation of a blueprint for the development of national, regional and county roads which I intend to publish within a few months.</P>

      <P>The full cost of approved schemes for the provision or improvement of public lighting on limited sections of national routes and on the main traffic routes in built-up areas may be charged against State road grants.  However, it is the established practice for the funding of the annual running costs involved to be met out of the local authorities' own resources.</P>

      <P>I understand that the estimated cost of the proposal is in excess of £6 million.  In view of the high cost involved, a study was undertaken in 1986 on behalf of the council and the report on the study was made available to my Department.  On the basis of the results of that study, the construction of a bridge at this location could not be justified on economic grounds.</P>

      <P>Last July, An Foras Forbartha published a report entitled <i>Water Quality in Ireland; the Current Position</i> which gives an overview of national water quality covering the years 1982-1986 and provides information on the quality status of particular river stretches.  Each local authority has been asked to consider this report in the context of its own area and, within a standardised report and questionnaire format devised by my Department, to assess and comment on the findings and to outline the steps it intends to take in relation to polluted waters. Having regard to the detailed nature of the replies requested, local authorities have been asked that these reports be forwarded by next February.  Until these reports have been received and assessed, <Col N="1100" /> I will not be in a position to comment further.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy's question refers to the control of Exchequer expenditure on drugs, as opposed to legal controls on the sale and prescribing of drugs. The total cost of drugs to the Exchequer is a function both of unit cost and of total volumes prescribed.  There are three main sectors in which these costs arise, namely the GMS scheme, the hospitals sector and the Drugs Refund and Long Term Illness schemes.</P>
      <P>Effective unit price control is maintained by an agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  The agreement controls the prices of drugs and medicines by close reference to the comparable UK prices.  The vast majority of drugs and medicines on the Irish market are imported from the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Participating doctors and pharmacists in the GMS are regularly circulated by the GMS (Payments) Board with detailed information on the relative cost of a standard course of treatment with various alternative versions of the drugs most commonly in use.</P>
    <P>The current GMS negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation have, as one of their primary objectives, the development and promotion within general practice, of a style of medicine which is less reliant upon prescribing.</P>
    <P>Drugs and Therapeutics Committees are well established in most general hospitals.  The committees pursue policies to rationalise drug use and to realise fully the scope for economies.</P>
    <P>As regards the Drugs Refund and LTI schemes, a restructuring of these schemes is under active discussion with the VHI, in the context of the provision by the VHI of a new comprehensive general practitioner and out-patient expenses scheme.</P>

      <P>The Joint Working Party on Dental Services which reported in 1979, recommended that, if an extension of eligibility for public dental services were to be considered, priority should be given to the 12-16 years age group.  However, the working party also recommended that it would be unwise to extend eligibility to any further group until adequate services were available to those already covered.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the system, information is disseminated by the Commission through a series of contact-points throughout the EC about foodstuffs which are on sale in the Community and which may have a <Col N="1112" /> serious risk to public health.  The Department of Health is the contact point in this country and would take whatever measures are appropriate to protect public health in this country arising out of information received through the early warning system.  The Department has available to it comprehensive statutory powers under the Health Acts 1947-70, the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950 and 1971 and the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875-1936, to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>The health boards operate food sampling programmes under which foodstuffs are sampled regularly at the retail outlets and at points of entry to the country. These foodstuffs are analysed to ensure that they are safe for human consumption.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Swiss cheese Vacherin Mont d'Or, the Department, having been informed of the public health risks associated with the products requested environmental health officers to visit relevant retail outlets to ensure that the product was not on sale and, if it was on sale, to arrange for its immediate removal.  Importers and suppliers were also contacted.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>The Public Hospitals Act, 1933, and subsequent amending Acts provided power to enable funds to be raised by means of sweepstakes and drawing of prizes for the benefit of certain health institutions.  The company actually operating the sweepstakes was Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited, a private company. This company went into voluntary liquidation in March 1987.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Labour Court ruling referred to but as Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited is a private company I have no function in the matter and there is no action I can take to secure implementation of the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
      <P>Over the years, for one reason or another, a number of sweepstake prizes were not claimed.  The sweepstakes trustees therefore continue to hold some moneys on behalf of unclaimed prizes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> I am considering the position regarding the disposal of these funds.  Present indications are that amending legislation would be required to secure their disposal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she has any proposals to bring about changes in the present system of school book ordering and purchasing in order that there is much greater encouragement for each successive class to utilise existing textbooks, rather than the present arrangement whereby books are very often changed every year, adding inordinately to the expense which falls on parents in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to alter the existing rules in relation to school textbooks for national schools.</P>
      <P>The rules for national schools assign ultimate authority in the selection of textbooks from a list sanctioned by the Minister for Education to the boards of management of individual schools.  The rules further provide as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  In a separate class or standard in charge of one teacher, the readers and textbooks, when selected, should not be changed, for a period of years, unless in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  In a division consisting of two or more classes or standards combined, in charge of one teacher, the readers and textbooks, when selected, should <Col N="1128" /> be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Schools need to take account of the desirability of periodic updating and improvement of textbooks and to strike a balance in their selection.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to second level schools is that only a small percentge of textbooks is prescribed by the Department and most of these are repeated in rotation, generally in a three to four year cycle.  Publishers have produced anthologies of short stories, poetry, etc. which contain all the material required over a period of years.  Other prescribed texts (i.e. plays, novels) are repeated in the rotation already mentioned and they are notified to the schools two years in advance of the appropriate examination.</P>
    <P>The syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid unnecessary changes of textbooks.  In addition my Department have issued circulars to secondary school authorities reminding them of the desirability of changing non-prescribed textbooks as infrequently as possible in order to save parents undue expenditure.</P>
    <P>Money is made available annually by my Department to second level schools to enable them to pay grants towards the cost of textbooks and accessories for necessitous pupils.  In the 1987 financial year £1,605,000 was provided for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The present financial circumstances do not permit any further changes in the present system.</P>
