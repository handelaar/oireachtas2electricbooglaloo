      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a date been set yet for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish interGovernmental Council?  Will the Taoiseach have come to a conclusion about the 1986 Extradition Act before that meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of more than passing interest to the House and I believe that it has been customary in the past for the Taoiseach to indicate whether a date has been fixed.  I am not asking the Taoiseach what the date is, for obvious reasons.  The Taoiseach has been silent on all these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like the Taoiseach to indicate to the House what the position is in relation to, first, the Homeless Persons Bill.  There are few remaining weeks left in this session.  Can the homeless people look forward to legislation being brought before the House before we adjourn? My second question is in relation to the Foreign Affairs committee, a question which has moved from consideration to deep consideration and which I suspect <Col N="490" /> might be in fermentation at this stage. Will we have a proposal before the House for a joint committee on Foreign Affairs in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still anxious to have the homeless persons legislation this session.  With regard to the other matter I suppose one could say at this stage that it is having concentrated consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I appreciate that I may be stretching it slightly, but could the Taoiseach indicate if he is concerned, as we are, and could he indicate if he will provide an opportunity to the House to disscuss the issues raised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have asked the Taoiseach.  Perhaps I have committed an offence in terms of access. I do not know but my understanding from previous questions about legislation was that there was legislation in progress when this Dáil was dissolved, and in reply to questions in relation to the continuation of that legislation I was informed that a review would take place. Indeed the Minister stated on a number of occasions on the radio that it was hoped to have that review completed by the end of summer.  Naturally, since it does involve legislation, I believe my question is in order.</P>

    <Title>Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) (No. 2) Bill, 1987   [Seanad]:  Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="496" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the 1968 EC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, ratification of which was a condition of our membership of the EC.  The Convention is long and complex and its subject matter could be regarded as rather esoteric.  Indeed the equivalent English legislation to give effect to the Convention was described in Parliament as a &ldquo;mind-boggling myriad of legal complexity.&rdquo; What I propose to do here is to explain the general principles involved in a straightforward manner and leave the detail to the later Stages.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself is relatively short and its main purpose is set out in section 3 which provides that the various Conventions involved, that is, the 1968 Convention, the 1971 Protocol on its interpretation, the 1978 Accession Convention for Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom and the 1982 Accession Convention for Greece shall have the force of law in the State.</P>
      <P>The 1978 Accession Convention made necessary adjustments for the purpose of adapting the 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol to the legal institutions and systems of Denmark, Ireland and the UK. It also made some amendments to rectify defects which had appeared since the Convention entered into force among the original six members.  The 1982 Accession Convention to cater for the accession of Greece contained technical adjustments only.  The consolidated version of the 1968 Convention and of the 1971 Protocol as amended by the two Accession Conventions is contained in the First and Second Schedules to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The 1968 Convention had its origins in Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome by virtue of which the member states agreed to enter into negotiations with each other with a view to securing for the benefit of their nationals the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocol recognition and enforcement of judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will note &mdash; even from the <Col N="497" /> title of the Convention &mdash; that it deals with jurisdictional matters as well as with the recognition and enforcement of judgments.  For reasons that will become apparent during the course of my speech, those who were given the task of drawing up the Convention felt that to be effective the Convention should include provisions to determine which country's courts would have jurisduction to hear cases covered by the Convention in addition to providing, as they were obliged to provide by Article 220, for the recognition and enforcement of judgments.</P>
    <P>Enforcing the judgment of a foreign court is not, of course, a new concept. However, the present regime under which foreign judgments are enforced in Ireland is quite restrictive and the situation is similar as respects the enforcement of Irish judgments abroad.  To enable Deputies to better understand the implications of the Convention I will refer to the existing legal position as I explain the general principles behind the Convention.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Convention is set out in Article 1.  It is concerned with civil or commercial matters.  This phrase automatically excludes criminal matters and that area of the law known as public law, although the term is not generally in use here.  An example of public law would be an action brought by a public authority in exercise of their statutory powers.  What remains within the Convention is the broad band of civil litigation involving private individuals, companies etc. However, Article 1 lists a number of further exceptions, including matters related to status, legal capacity, matrimonial property and succession.  I would like to emphasise that while matters of status, such as divorce, are excluded, judgments relating to the maintenance of spouses and children fall within the scope of the Convention.</P>
    <P>The basic principle behind the Convention is that civil judgments from one member state should be recognised and enforced throughout the Community on a basis that would be practically automatic. The Convention sets out the procedure to be followed in order to achieve <Col N="498" /> this, but includes certain safeguards so as to ensure that the principles of natural justice and fair procedures are adhered to.  The Convention, in effect, extends the concept of the Common Market to legal matters by eliminating barriers to the free movement of judgments with the Community.  A further example of legal co-operation sponsored by the Community is the Convention drawn up in 1980 to provide uniform rules relating to the law to be applied in contractual relations.  I hope in due course to bring further legislation before the House to enable that Convention to be ratified.</P>
    <P>The workings of the Convention are best illustrated by showing, first, what will happen when an Irish plaintiff sues a domiciliary of another contracting state in an Irish court with the intention of having the judgment enforced in that other contracting state &mdash; or indeed in any contracting state where there are assets to satisfy the judgment &mdash; and, secondly, the procedure when a judgment from another EC state comes to Ireland for enforcement.</P>
    <P>Before a court can hear a case it must first be satisfied that it has jurisdiction to do so.  This matter is directly regulated by the Convention.  Under present law unless the defendant voluntarily submits, an Irish court will only have jurisdiction if the defendant has been duly served with the appropriate summons.  If the defendant is within the country the summons may be served without leave of the court.  If the defendant is outside the country the permission of the court is required before service on him can be validly effected and jurisdiction established. Order 11 of the Rules of the Superior Courts lists the circumstances where service out of the jurisdiction may be permitted in a High Court action.  The circumstances relate generally to situations where there is an Irish interest in the matter.  For example, the dispute may relate to land situated in Ireland.  The rule requires the court to decide whether in the particular circumstances of the case it, rather than some foreign court, would be the most convenient forum to hear the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> In contrast, under the Convention, the question of service will not be the key issue in establishing jurisdiction.  The Irish courts will instead apply the jurisdictional rules set out in the Convention. The general rule of the Convention, contained in Article 2, is that a person should be sued in the state where he is &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;. Domicile is used here in its continental sense which approximates to ordinary or habitual residence and is different from its technical common law meaning.  As the common law concept was clearly not suitable for the purposes of the Convention, the United Kingdom and Ireland undertook to define domicile for the purposes of the Convention in a way what would correspond to its continental meaning.  Section 13 and the Fifth Schedule of the Bill contain the relevant provisions.</P>
    <P>The Convention, in Article 5, applies special rules of jurisdiction in matters involving contract, tort, maintenance, etc. and, although there are differences, these special rules coincide broadly with the existing Irish rules for establishing jurisdiction in such cases.  The following are examples of how some of these special jurisdictional rules will apply.  Let us say that a German tourist is responsible for a car accident here and causes injury to an Irish person.  He may be sued in Ireland, i.e. the place where the harmful event occurred, under the special rule in tort cases contained in Article 5 of the Convention, or in Germany, the place of his domicile.  If he sues here the judgment will be recognised and enforced in Germany or, indeed, in any other contracting state.  If the Irish person was at fault he could only be sued in Ireland as this is the place of his domicile and also the place where the harmful event occurred.</P>
    <P>In the case of a claim for maintenance, the maintenance creditor has the choice of sueing the maintenance debtor either in his or her place of domicile or habitual residence or in the place of domicile of the debtor.  On the other hand, if the debtor wishes to sue for variation he may only do so in the creditor's domicile.  This <Col N="500" /> particular provision reflects the Convention's concern for the maintenance creditor as the weaker party.</P>
    <P>There are also special provisions in the Convention, in Articles 7 to 15, in respect of consumer and insurance contracts which recognise the fact that in such contracts the consumer and, generally, the insured are the weaker parties.  They may be sued only in their place of domicile, but they have a choice of where to sue, either in their own courts or where the defendant is domiciled.  Otherwise the Convention is generally pro-defendant in accordance with generally accepted principles.</P>
    <P>The Convention in Article 16 also lays down that in certain cases, the courts of one state will have exclusive jurisdiction. For example, in disputes in relation to land, the courts of the state where the land is situated will have exclusive jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The rules of jurisdiction in the Convention must be applied.  Therefore, an Irish court will no longer have discretion, as it has at present, to refuse jurisdiction merely because the defendant is not present in the State or the case might more conveniently be heard in another state.  In addition, an Irish court will no longer be able to assume jurisdiction over an EC resident merely because he was served with a summons while temporarily present in Ireland.  These present rules will continue to apply, however, regarding persons domiciled in non-contracting states.</P>
    <P>Before we leave the question of jurisdiction I might point out that although the Convention sets out a series of rules regarding jurisdiction there is provision to allow parties to a dispute to enter into an agreement to give jurisdiction to a court of their choice.  The Convention also provides that a person may submit voluntarily to the jurisdiction of a court other than the court which would normally have jurisdiction under the Convention. These provisions do not apply, however, to cases where a court is given exclusive jurisdiction by the Convention.</P>
    <P>Once an Irish court has assumed jurisdiction and given its judgment the <Col N="501" /> judgment will, subject to Articles 27 and 28 of the Convention which I will deal with later, be antomatically enforceable in any one of the other contracting states. At present it is not possible to enforce Irish judgments in some of these states. In others there are very restrictive recognition rules.  The Convention effectively removes all the existing barriers against the enforcement of Irish judgments in the other contracting states and, of course, against the enforcement in Ireland of judgments from those states.</P>
    <P>I might point out also that other contracting states will generally be obliged to enforce Irish judgments against persons domiciled outside the EC, whether or not the Irish court established jurisdiction under the normal rules of the Convention.</P>
    <P>As respects the enforcement in Ireland of judgments from other contracting states the present position is as follows. Judgments of a foreign court are enforceable in Ireland if they have been handed down by a court of competent jurisdiction, are final and and conclusive and are for a fixed sum of money.  The only exception to this has come about as a result of the 1974 agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of maintenance orders.  Foreign maintenance orders for periodic payments, other than United Kingdom orders, are not normally enforceable in Ireland as they are not regarded as being final and conclusive.  The agreement with the United Kingdom was based on relevant provisions of the Brussels Convention and was drawn up in anticipation of our accession to that Convention.</P>
    <P>As I have said, for a foreign judgment to be enforceable here at present our courts must be satisfied that it was given by a court competent to do so.  Under Irish law a foreign court is considered to have competency only if the defendant was present in the foreign country at the time the action commenced or if he voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court.  As a result of the Convention, however, apart from a number of special cases expressly mentioned in <Col N="502" /> Article 28, our courts will not be able to question the jurisdiction of the foreign court.  This is because all countries in ratifying the Convention have accepted common rules of jurisdiction in relation to cases coming within the scope of the Convention and have thus ensured the effectiveness of the Convention in the area of recognition and enforcement.  In addition, judgments for periodic payments and non-monetary judgments will also be enforceable.  The Convention does not, of course, affect the enforcement in Ireland of foreign judgments from countries which are not parties to the Convention.  In those cases the existing common law rules will apply.</P>
    <P>The Convention, in Article 32, provides that applications for recognition and enforcement in Ireland shall be made to the High Court.  In fact, section 5 of the Bill provides that applications for the enforcement of judgments will be made to the Master of the High Court.  The Master already has responsibility for dealing with applications for the enforcement of United Kingdom maintenance orders under the Maintenance Orders Acts, 1974, and for the enforcement of Community judgments under the European Communities (Enforcement of Community Judgments) Regulations, 1972.  It is, therefore, appropriate that the initial application for recognition and enforcement, which will be made <i>ex parte,</i> should be dealt with by him also. Provided the application is in order, recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment is practically automatic. Articles 27 and 28 list the only circumstances in which recognition can be refused.  The two grounds for refusal most likely to arise will be either that recognition is contrary to Irish public policy &mdash; one example would be where the judgment in question was obtained by fraud &mdash; or that the defendant was not served with notice of the institution of the original proceedings in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides that when an enforcement order is made the foreign judgment, except where it is a maintenance order for periodic payments, will <Col N="503" /> become enforceable here as if it were a judgment of the High Court.  Special provision is made in Section 7 of the Bill for the enforcement of foreign maintenance orders for periodic payments. These follow, with some minor changes, the enforcement procedures in the Maintenance Orders Act, 1974, in respect of the enforcement of United Kingdom maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>Since the initial application will be made <i>ex parte</i> the defendant will not be aware of the application unless and until an enforcement order has been made. The reason is to deny a defendant, alerted to the possibility of an enforcement order being made against him, the opportunity to move his assets out of the country so as to frustrate the enforcement of the judgment.  However, as a safeguard against any injustice, Article 39 of the Convention provides that the foreign judgment which has been declared enforceable will not be enforced until the defendant is allowed an opportunity to appeal against the enforcement order. During the period allowed for an appeal, the plaintiff is entitled to obtain temporary protective measures from the court in order to safeguard his interests. The same simplified enforcement procedures, which I have described in their application to Ireland, will apply to applications for enforcement of Irish judgments in other contracting states.</P>
    <P>The original signatories to the Convention considered it of crucial importance that the courts of each contracting state interpret the Convention in a uniform manner.  Different interpretations by national courts would have seriously undermined the whole basis of the Convention. Accordingly, a protocol on uniform interpretation &mdash; the 1971 Protocol &mdash; was drawn up conferring jurisdiction on the court of Justice of the European Communities to interpret the Conventions. Questions of interpretation may be referred to it by appellate courts and rulings of the court made as a result of such references will be binding on the courts of the contracting states.  In <Col N="504" /> addition, references by national authorities may be made in the interests of law in the event of a conflict of interpretation arising from different judgments in different states without, however, affecting those judgments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as an aid to the interpretation of the Conventions, three explanatory reports, one on the 1968 Convention and the 1971 Protocol, and the other two on the Accession Conventions of 1978 and 1982, respectively, were prepared.  Section 4 of the Bill provides that a court may consider the reports on the 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol and on the 1978 Convention when interpreting the Conventions.  The report dealing with the 1982 Convention on the accession of Greece has only recently become available and I will be moving an amendment to section 4 on Committee Stage to provide for its inclusion.</P>
    <P>While ratification of the Convention is, as I have said, one of the obligations of our membership of the European Communities, it is also a very significant development in our private international law.  This will be the first occasion when Ireland has entered into a multilateral international agreement to accept common rules of international jurisdiction and to recognise and enforce foreign judgments.  The 1968 Convention will eventually apply in all 12 member states of the Communities and Deputies may be interested to learn that negotiations involving the Twelve and a number of EFTA states with a view to concluding a parallel convention to the 1968 Convention are in progress at the moment.</P>

    <P>Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation is before the House today. It is in the same form as a Bill presented by the previous Government in December 1986 which we did not have the opportunity to pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas before the Dáil was dissolved in January 1987.  The Bill has now been passed through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that this is a technical Bill.  It is the sort of measure which gives rise to many learned articles by academic lawyers.  It is not the type of Bill which is perceived by the media generally or by people outside this House as being of great relevance to day-to-day life.  Curiously, although it is a technical measure and it has taken many years for legislation of this nature to come before the House, the Bill does have a very particular relevance to the lives of people in this State and will have an increasing relevance as there is greater mobility of people and greater commercial interaction between this State and other member states of the EC.</P>
      <P>Until the past two or three years we have had a somewhat myopic view of our legal relationships.  We tend to assume that if there is an international element in our legal relationships it normally arises between us and the United Kingdom and that there is no great necessity to formalise our laws with the laws in existence in other states, beyond the formalisation imposed on us by directives emanating from Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of this Bill cannot be overstated.  Although its passage through the Seanad and this House will attract very little publicity it has very significant procedural and substantive implications for Irish civil and commercial law.  It will be relevant to Irish companies doing business in Europe who run into legal difficulties and find the need to bring legal proceedings either outside the State or in our own courts and seek to enforce judgments granted by our courts in other <Col N="506" /> member states.  It will confer very basic rights on individuals who might, for example, suffer injury as a result of a road accident or other civil wrong.  For example, the purchase of some consumer product in Europe might lead to an individual suffering damage on return to this country and court proceedings might be necessary to seek compensation for personal injuries resulting.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers and formalises a vast area of Irish law which to date has not been dealt with by any legislative measures passed by this House and which has not been governed by any conventions. In the entire area of private international law this House has since 1922 abdicated its role and has left it to the Judiciary and the courts to develop legal principles based on the common law on a case-by-case basis.  Generally our courts have followed English common law where appropriate and sometimes at a time when English common law has long since been changed in England by the Westminster Parliament enacting its own domestic statutory provisions to give effect to international conventions in circumstances where we have not done so.</P>
    <P>It is curious to note, as the Minister correctly says, that this is the first Bill relating to the private international law area that seeks to implement a multilateral Convention.  It is noteworthy that the first substantive legal measure relating to private international law which passed through this House was the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.  There are occasional sections peppered through our legislation relating to individual areas of private international law such as contained in the Legitimacy Act but, generally speaking, we have not enacted law in this area and have abdicated our role to the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>This Bill is particularly welcome because of the European element contained in it.  I welcome the Minister's comment in regard to EFTA.  It appears there is a possibility of providing an extension of the application of this measure to states with whom we have commercial relationships outside the EC but in respect of whom the provision of this <Col N="507" /> type of legal system is welcome and necessary.  It will become increasingly necessary as the type of trade in which we engage becomes more and more sophisticated in the areas of computer technology and pharmaceuticals.  The lacuna in our law in this area needs to be filled. I see little point in repeating what the Minister said in his speech.  He has set out ably the history of what has given rise to the production of this Bill and in as comprehensible a form as possible the implications of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with matters which arise out of the Bill, one or two of which may require consideration on Committee Stage and with one or two related matters in the context of the way we deal with private international law.  I regard one aspect of the Bill as curious, and it is not the Minister's fault that it is in the Bill. It is part of the Convention that we are part of, and if further amendments are to be made to the Convention, we should look at it again.  The provisions of the Convention in Article 2 as referred to in the Second Schedule to the Bill deal with the references being made by courts of the countries which are parties to the Convention &mdash; our courts and courts of other countries &mdash; to the European Court of Justice where it is necessary to get a preliminary ruling on questions of interpretation of the Convention to ensure uniformity of approach on the part of member states of the EC who are parties to the Convention.</P>
    <P>In the context of other Treaty obligations the High Court currently has powers on other EC matters to refer a matter to the European Court for a preliminary ruling, and in other areas of European law the High Court has made such references.  The Minister might explain the reasoning behind this.  It is not his fault.  I do not know why we can find a reference to a preliminary ruling on questions of interpretation to the Supreme Court.  It would seem logical that such a reference should be capable of being made by either the High Court or the Supreme Court.  In so far as major commercial or civil law cases may arise <Col N="508" /> as a result of the provisions contained in the Convention many of these will arise initially for trial in the High Court and the High Court judge could justifiably take the view that it makes logical sense to refer a matter of interpretation to the Court of Justice as was done, for example, by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Hamilton, in a recent case involving social welfare.  Yet if the High Court judge forms that view, as this Convention stands currently he cannot make such reference.  He will have to deliver his decision possibly when he is unsure of what the legal interpretation should be of particular provisions.  He will make his decision and he can then go to the Supreme Court and a preliminary ruling can be sought by it.  If I am wrong in my interpretation of this I would be happy if the Minister would clarify it.  If I am not wrong, the Minister cannot amend it on Committee Stage, but in the context of discussions that are going on at European level and any further protocols that might be completed we should ourselves consider, as a matter of practical action in the implementation of this measure, changing this Article to extend the power of reference from simply the Supreme Court to the High Court also. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that in his response.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, correctly, that there is a wide variety of other areas of law that the Convention does not deal with.  That is worth dwelling on for a couple of moments.  This is the first multilateral treaty that is being implemented in this State with regard to the enforcement, for example, of judgments delivered by our courts in other countries.  It is the first time that we can be, in a sense, assured of the exact nature of the law that will be applicable in other countries, in this instance in the member states of the EC that are part of the Convention.  It is the first time we can be certain as to how the courts of those countries will deal with judgments granted by our courts.  It is the first time that our courts will have set before them the guidelines by which they are to enforce judgments delivered in the courts of member states of the EC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> There is a need, as there is an increased mobility on the part of Irish people, to implement a large number of other Conventions that currently exist in the area of private international law.  A vast number cover a multiplicity of areas which if implemented would formalise our legal relationships with many other countries in the world in a whole series of areas that to date we have ignored.  This State has been party to many of the discussions and negotiations in the context of the formulation of many of the Hague Conventions on private international law, yet not a single one of those Conventions have we yet implemented within our domestic law by enactment of domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Convention does not include matters relating to status, to legal capacity which would include capacity to marry, matrimonial property and succession.  This legislation does not cover a vast number of areas such as one I mentioned in this House some weeks ago in the debate on the Status of Children Bill in relation to foreign adoption orders.  A vast area of legislation is required here to provide a legal framework and foundation for determining how our courts should deal with recognising actions taken by foreign courts that affect Irish nationals.  I have mentioned in this House previously something I hope the Minister can respond to.  It is becoming increasingly urgent that we provide legislation which sets out the circumstances in which we will recognise adoption orders made by other States, be they states within the EC or countries outside the EC such as some of the South American states like Peru and Chile or India or the Philippines. There has been a drastic reduction in the number of children available for adoption by Irish couples within this State.  Many adoption societies have closed their doors to putting new couples on their books because of the absence of children available for adoption.  An increasing number of couples living in Ireland, resident and domiciled here are looking to other countries outside Europe in order to adopt children.  An <Col N="510" /> increasing number of couples are adopting children in South America and India and I am aware that children will be adopted in the Philippines.  Other countries have confronted this by legislation many years ago.  For example, in the UK and Adoption Act is enforced under which the relevant Minister can designate those countries whose adoption orders would be automatically recognised as valid within the UK as a result of which if a couple resident in the UK adopt in those countries they know their legal position, they know the status of their child and that that child adopted by them in, for example, Peru or Chile, is recognised as being adopted under the domestic law of the UK.  The reason for having a designating system is to ensure that the highest standards are enforced in those foreign countries with regard to the adoption of children to ensure that standards similar to those employed in this country are applied and that where they are applied the adoptions will be recognised.</P>
    <P>Of course, this measure before us does not deal with the issue of adoption.  It does not provide for the recognition of adoption orders made within Europe, never mind outside Europe.  It was not designed to deal with that area.  What I am saying should not be regarded as a criticism either of the Minister or of the previous Government.  It is not intended as such but what I am trying to do is to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there is a vast area of human relationships which are now being affected in the sense of Irish people going abroad, even temporarily or engaging in transactions other than those referred to in this measure, that requires legal regulation here.  We are going to have an increasing number of children adopted outside Ireland who will be in a type of legal limbo; their parents will not know whether their adoptions are recognised in Ireland or not.  We have no legal mechanisms for stipulating the circumstance in which such adoption orders are recognised and this is a matter that the House, as in other areas, is leaving to our courts to work at as best they can.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill, I must express <Col N="511" /> the view that I hope it is the first of a number of pieces of legislation dealing with the broad spectrum of private international law, dealing with the whole area of the circumstances in which our laws recognise legal actions taken in other countries that affect Irish citizens.  The Law Reform Commission produced a very comprehensive report on the legislation required in the area of private international law to deal with the whole area of matrimonial relations.  That report has been in existence for a couple of years.  That requires legislation and it extends into broad areas not just dealing with an issue which the House has dealt with, the recognition of foreign divorces. It deals with the capacity to marry, the recognition by us of decrees of annulment granted by courts outside this State.  If we look at one of The Hague Conventions, and become parties to it, we could set up a system of cross-recognition that would be applicable between this country and other countries who are parties to those Conventions.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to use this Bill as the first of many pieces of legislation to finally set down a body of Irish law with regard to private international law and not to leave our courts in the position of in a sense having to invent law where none exists or, as in many instances, having to copy outdated English common law which has long since been left aside by the English courts in favour of new statutory measures enacted there.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill that the Minister will need to look at with a view to preparing an amendment.  In the Fifth Schedule the Minister provides a new definition of domicile for the purpose of giving effect to our Convention commitments and to the discussions that took place preceding our becoming partners to the Convention.  We are trying to provide a uniform system of application throughout Europe but what we are really doing is giving the name domicile to what is referred to as residents for ordinary residents within the legal systems of the continental European countries. We are providing here a definition <Col N="512" /> of domicile which is quite different from the common law concept of domicile which our courts currently apply and which it is assumed continues to apply by virtue of the provisions of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>Domicile is a common law concept and this is the first occasion, in my view, in legislation in which we provide any definition of domicile.  In the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, we removed the concept of a wife's dependent domicile.  We allowed a wife to have independent domicile but that Act, as far as I can recollect, does not contain a definition of what domicile is. To date we have adopted a common law definition which regards domicile as one of two concepts.  We either have a domicile of origin, which is the domicile a person acquires at the date of birth, or if a person wishes to acquire a new domicile that person has a domicile of choice.  To acquire a domicile of choice a person must not merely leave his or her domicile of origin but must live in another country with the intention of remaining there permantently or, at least, indefinitely.  In other words, to acquire a domicile of choice a person must be at least emigrating rather than moving temporarily to another jurisdiction or simply setting up residence in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In the context of the common law rules of domicile an infant has a domicile dependent on his parents.  There is the other problem where if a person has acquired a domicile of choice, if they move out of the country of their domicile of choice but are not sure where they wish to set up residence thereafter, be it ordinary residence or permanent residence, they can re-acquire a domicile of origin.  All of that sounds very difficult and technical but what I am coming to is the Minister's definition of domicile under Part I.</P>
    <P>We are left, by way of the Fifth Schedule, by way of our legislation, to define what we mean by domicile within the context of the Bill.  It is clear from what has been stated to date that we have to provide what I would describe as a less <Col N="513" /> artificial and a less exacting concept of domicile than the concept of domicile as it exists under the common law.  In the context of raising with the Minister the possible necessity to provide an amendment to this measure I should like to draw two things to his attention.  The first is that Part I of the Fifth Schedule refers to an individual who is domiciled in the State, or in a state other than a contracting state if, but only if, he is ordinarily resident in the State or in that other state.  Effectively, to use non-legal jargon, if a person is ordinarily resident in the State as an individual that is where they are domiciled for the purpose of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We do not define what we mean by an individual.  We define what we do not mean; we do not mean a corporation because a corporation is something else, but what is the position under the legislation of an individual infant?  What is the position of the ten year old or the 13 year old who, for example, can bring civil proceedings as a result of a tort?  Often the proceedings will have to be brought in the name of the parent but the beneficiary of court judgements and the litigant is the infant on whose behalf the parents sue.  Under this Part, we do not deal with the issue that arises normally with regard to domicile.  There is no specific provision which says an infant's domicile is dependent on that of the parent.  Is an infant an individual for the purposes of this?  Does an infant still have a domicile dependent on that of the parent?  If he does, we would need to add something to Part I to refer to the fact that where an individual is under 18 years of age he will be taken to be ordinarily resident where the parent or parents are ordinarily resident.  One could adapt provisions in existence in the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we do not deal with the issue of an infant expressly.  In the absence of doing so it seems to me that there is one of two dangers.  Without dealing with it expressly the courts might take the view that an individual is an infant or somebody who is an adult or <Col N="514" /> the courts could automatically apply the common law rule and give an infant a domicile dependent on a parent, be it father or mother.  The courts probably would have to apply the rules as they exist under the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.  There may be a need to spell out the position of infants under the Fifth Schedule.  It is not a major amendment but the Minister should consider it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>What happens if an individual who is ordinarily resident in a state leaves that state and goes off to live in a number of other states, is moving about and there is no state that one can identify he is ordinarily resident in and yet proceedings are being brought?  There are two ways of dealing with that.  In the context of common law that individual's domicile of origin would be revised but that is an extremely artificial notion, one which I believe should be changed in the context of general domicile law.  It seems to me that there may be a need to say that where an individual cannot be described as ordinarily resident in a particular state at the time a matter has to be determined, he shall be regarded as so resident in the state in which he was last ordinarily resident.  That sounds like legal gobbledegook, nevertheless the problem is that in the context of today's world, particularly in the context of commercial relationships, an individual could be moving from state to state within Europe and is not ordinarily resident in any of them.  There may be a need to look at this part of the Schedule to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>In the context of domicile on a broader note, at the time when the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act came into the House, I proposed a number of amendments to provide a less artificial concept of domicile in our general law than that which applied in the context of common law.  The amendments I tabled were ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle on the basis that the Bill had a narrow intent which was to place women in a position of equality and to deal with recognition of foreign divorces. <Col N="515" /> I will not take issue with the ruling at this stage.  There is a very detailed report from the Law Reform Commission on the need to reform the law of domicile generally and the proposal is that we adopt a concept of habitual residence instead of the concept of domicile.</P>
    <P>Following the passage of this Bill, we will have two different concepts of domicile within our own domestic law, the concept that applies in the context of our legal relationship in a civil and commercial area with member states of the EC and an entirely different concept of domicile applicable to the conduct of our legal relationships in the civil and commercial area with all other states outside the EC.  In the context of our relationships with other states and the EC states, in the general family law matrimonial property area there will be a concept of domicile which is different from this context of domicile.  It would make a awful lot of sense to enact reforming legislation to provide a general concept of domicile which accords with a uniform approach being adopted by our courts in all areas.  I do not take issue with the concept of domicile here, possibly it should be &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; so that there is greater certainty as to what we are talking about, on the lines of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. Perhaps the Minister will indicate if he will bring forward legislation to implement that aspect of the reforms proposed by the Law Reform Commission.  I do not agree with all the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission with regard to the general issues of domicile &mdash; I agree with most of them &mdash; but the difficulty in changing domicile from &ldquo;domicile of origin&rdquo; to &ldquo;domicile of choice&rdquo; is unnecessarily artificial.  The idea of the revival of a domicile of origin is also somewhat nonsensical.  Most of these issues should be dealt with and the passage of this legislation makes it even more urgent to confront them.</P>
    <P>In order to implement this legislation, new rules will have to be provided and <Col N="516" /> I assume that the rules committee will provide them.  It should be emphasised that this legislation not only facilitates the enforcement of civil and commercial judgments in the area of civil damages and commercial contracts and decisions by the courts, it also has a very important implication in the family law area and brings about an important reform that will improve the position of women considerably, particularly the position of deserted wives.  That is why when this Bill was published by the previous Government last December I welcomed it.  Not only does it improve our legal system in the enforcement of civil and commercial judgments, it seeks to ensure that where a husband deserts a wife and goes off to live in one of the member states of the EC maintenance and support orders made by the Irish courts can be enforced in the courts of other European countries.  This will provide an additional protection for deserted and unsupported wives which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is important that the message goes out from this House that this is a new facility which will be made available for the support of wives and for the enforcement of maintenance orders made by our courts in circumstances in which husbands have sought to evade making payments by moving to a country other than the United Kingdom, the only other country with which we currently have a treaty in regard to the enforcement of maintenance orders.  This aspect of legislation is of particular importance.</P>
    <P>When there are different Bills before the House in tandem it is often easy to miss the fact that the enactment of one Bill requires changes to be made in another Bill before the House.  In the area of enforcement of orders, including maintenance orders, this legislation deals with the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930.  The Status of Children Bill is before the House at present, it has almost completed its passage, we only have to debate Report Stage.  That Bill will repeal the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, to all intents and purposes and provides for the making of maintenance orders under the <Col N="517" /> Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, for the support of children born outside marriage.  As this legislation refers to maintenance orders made, it may not be necessary to amend it for the purpose of accommodating the Status of Children Bill.  Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that that measure has particular provisions with regard to making payments relating to children born outside marriage, if we are to have a measure that truly ensures the enforcement of all judgments in these areas with regard to maintenance payments, it may be necessary on Committee Stage to incorporate a reference to the Status of Children Bill.  As matters go through the parliamentary process, we will probably have to complete the passage of the Status of Children Bill before such reference can be included in this measure. As we are about to debate Report Stage of the Status of Children Bill I assume that it would not be difficult to complete the passage of that measure and on Committee and Report Stages of this Bill, where there are references to the Illigitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, to delete them by amendment and to refer to the Status of Children Bill. That is a logical amendment that should be made to ensure that all aspects of the relevant legislation are dealt with in this measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have no doubt that most people outside the House do not regard it as a significant measure but in years to come many people who seek to enforce their legal rights and who seek protection from our courts and those in other European countries will welcome the fact that this measure has been passed to ensure a uniformity of application of laws in the civil, commercial and family law areas in regard to maintenance orders throughtout the European Community.</P>

      <P>This measure is the final chapter, I hope, of what has been a somewhat disgraceful record of neglect by this House in the period since the Convention was signed in October 1978. Almost ten years later, this House is <Col N="518" /> implementing it into Irish law.  Comparatively speaking we have no excuse to offer because we are getting around to the Committee Stage of a debate on a measure which the Parliament at Westminster managed to have enacted completely in 1982 even though, after that, they took time to implement it on a ministerial basis.  It shows a weakness in this House that it does not take seriously its international obligations.  We merrily sign Conventions and then allow eight or ten years to elapse before we do anything about them.</P>
      <P>That is a fraud on the people with whom we agree to sign these Conventions. They are entitled to expect that when Ireland, through its ambassador or Minister puts its signature to any Convention we intend doing something about it with reasonable haste.  In relation to this matter, which is of fundamental importance, the Irish State has, ten years after the substance of the agreement was arrived at, only now put its legislative mind to giving effect to what it undertook to do.  That is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>I do not want to score party political points.  It is all very well for people to welcome this measure, but why did it take the Coalition Government until its death throes were upon it in December 1986 to publish this measure?  What was so complex about it that it could not have been published beforehand?  Was it that the drafting process was slow; and, if it is that slow, why is it that it is so unbelievably slow compared to that of Westminster?  Why is it that in this country second best will always do?  Why do we accept a slovenly mess in terms of the legislative process and why do we have to be dragged screaming to confront our responsibilities to our fellow members of the Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as if we have just floated along merrily without adverse effects.  A number of significant things have happened in the period during which we have been doing nothing.  Forty decisions have been handed down by the European courts as to the interpretation that should be put on this Convention.  Those <Col N="519" /> decisions affect Irish law and this Convention is to become part of Irish law. The interpretative forum for that Convention is the European Court of Justice. It is an irony that ten years after the law began to be amended and interpreted we are still getting around to implementing it.  Is it not ridiculous that those 40 decisions, which will effectively change the substance of the law of this land if we adopt this measure, have been made without any real attention being paid to them by the Irish Legislature.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that when this Bill comes into effect it will change dramatically certain of our rules and procedure in the courts.  It is sad that it was so delayed.  The rules of the superior courts were extensively revised and amended recently and were republished when this measure was outstanding.  We will waste a lot of public money now when we have to go back and again revise the rules of the superior courts and amend them again, and presumably republish them, because there was slovenliness on the part of the legislative machine.  I know that political masters are sometimes derelict in their responsibility; but it strikes me that those in the Department of Justice who had the carriage of the drafting of this measure, and the duty to supervise it during the early stages, should have got on with the job far more quickly and should have beseeched Ministers to get on with the business so that now when other codes have been revised and other moneys spent they will not have to be changed again in order to accommodate this measure.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Law Times</i> for February 1987 there is reference to a number of decisions in the Irish courts which could have been decided differently had this Convention been brought into operation after a reasonable interval following our signature of the Convention.  We had internationally agreed on the law but we decided to ignore our obligations and this has had practical effects on litigants before the Irish courts.  It is not good enough to say ten years later that it is welcome.  It is welcome and it is better <Col N="520" /> late than never, I suppose; but this is a very tawdry approach to our responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, like Fine Gael, Finna Fáil and most of the parties in this House, will support the purpose of this Bill.  It is an obligation which we undertook when we agreed to join the European Community.  Article 3 of our Act of Accession put an obligation on us to become party to this Convention.  That has one practical consequence in that, at least in relation to this Convention, it cannot be argued on the basis of the Crotty decision that it is somehow repugnant to the Constitution in that it seeks to take away from the Irish courts their jurisdiction or to interfere with our sovereignty on the judicial front.  It is quite clear that this is a necessary obligation for the purposes of the Constitution and therefore it is immune from constitutional challenge on that ground.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points in relation to the substance of the Bill about which I am deeply unhappy.  I know that the Minister has been called away on urgent business, but I would ask the junior Minister to convey my reservations and my intention to move amendments on Committee Stage.  This Bill gives life to a Convention and the Convention is one which allows this State to apply its own law of domicile in determining who is and who is not amenable to the domestic courts on the basis of domicile.  Our law on domicile is about to become, if this Bill goes through as it stands, an even more idiotic and more irrational patchwork than it is now.</P>
    <P>We have a very strange law of domicile. We have, as Deputy Shatter pointed out, made a small amendment in the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, which was at least to get rid of the notion of dependent domicile for spouses.  Deputy Shatter wondered whether that Act substituted any new definition of domicile.  It did not; it just left the question of domicile to be decided in accordance with Common Law rules.  If the Minister succeeds in getting this Bill through as it stands we will have a two-tier system of domicile. <Col N="521" /> When we are dealing with a Convention country one is domiciled in Ireland if one is ordinarily resident here; but if we are dealing with the enforcement of, for instance, an American judgment, Common Law rules will apply.  That is simply unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is crazy that a Legislature would seriously sit down and say we will have one set of domicile rules for Europe and another for the rest of the world.  That is absured.  There must be, even in the most hard-hearted bureaucratic person, a nagging suspicion that to provide a two-tiered domicile system is fundamentally wrong and that this country should not seek to alter its concept of domicile on a unilateral basis to deal only with the Convention countries and maintain its existing irrational law of domicile in relation to other matters.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, as Deputy Shatter said, has come forward with a proposal to reform radically and codify our law of domicile.  Whether or not we agree with all the details of their proposals, it is simply wrong to say we will put that out of our minds for the moment and introduce a notion of ordinary residence which will satisfy our obligations under this Convention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter apparently experienced difficulties in the context of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, when he sought to widen the purpose of the Bill to codify the law of domicile.  Apparently the Ceann Comhairle told him that he was straying outside the narrow confines of a narrow piece of legislation.  This Bill is to ratify a Convention and it obliges us to state, for the purposes of our adherence to the Convention, our law of domicile.  In the Fifth Schedule to the Bill we propose to set out special rules of domicile which will apply in relation to this Convention. Section 13 of the Bill does not give a general scope of application.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill it is now time to state what the law of this land is in relation to domicile in general.  The Fifth Schedule should not be confined, as it is by the proposed text of section 13, to stating what the law of domicile will be <Col N="522" /> in relation to the application of the Convention. It should state clearly once and for all what the law of domicile of this State is in respect of everybody who comes to an Irish court.  An American businessman should be able to get the same answer from an Irish judge as a French businessman if he tries to enforce an American judgment against an Irishman <i>vis-á-vis</i> what a French man can do.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely clear that that is what rationality requires of us.  If the procedures of this House have any rationality about them, then this is the occasion on which we should state the law of domicile clearly for everyone.  Section 13 of this Bill should not be permitted to become the law.  It will make us a laughing stock. Imagine what a foreigner would think if he came to this country and discovered that an American would get one answer and a Frenchman would get a different answer.  How could that be explained to a student of law in a university?  How could it be explained to a foreign lawyer who might ask why his kind were being discriminated against?  One would have to say that on the day this Bill came before the Dáil the Minister was unwilling to introduce a uniform law of domicile and dream up a special law of domicile for a particular Convention.  We should decide here in this Chamber that that will not happen on this occasion, that we are going to do a good job on this Bill and get a good law as a result and not an irrational stupid patchwork kind of law which is what the Bill at present aims to bring about.</P>
    <P>The question of how this Convention is to operate leaves me with one or two queries and I ask the Minister, when he deals with the points I have raised, to deal with these queries as well.  If, to use the example the Minister gave in his speech, a German domiciliary &mdash; someone who ordinarily lives in Germany &mdash; comes to Ireland and is involved in a crash here, he can be sued either in Ireland or in Germany.  As I understand it, if he is sued in Ireland, Irish laws of liability will apply.  If he is sued in Germany, German laws of liability will apply and Irish law will not be the deciding factor as to <Col N="523" /> whether he is liable for the road accident in question.  Irish law of negligence will apply if he is sued in Ireland and German law or whatever is the equivalent of negligence under the German civil code will apply to him there.  Irish standards of care will apply to the Irish litigation to be decided by an Irish judge and German legal duties and obligations will apply to a resolution in Germany.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for the first time a plaintiff in Ireland is going to have something he did not have before.  He is going to be able to choose, based on the liability issue and by weighing up in his own mind, which forum would suit him better in terms of pinning down his defendant and maximising presumably the damages he seeks to recover.  The same will not apply in relation to contracts because I presume the proper law of the contract will be applied whether the case is heard in Ireland or Germany.  As I undersand it, it will apply in civil liability cases other than contract law and if a person is sued in Germany the domestic law of the German tribunal will apply.  I have reservations about this.  I wonder if we should have another protocol to this Convention to deal with that issue because we are giving potential litigants a choice which in some respects may be undesirable.</P>
    <P>I have some misgivings about the provision in the agreement in relation to courts where there are concurrent proceedings in relation to the same matter. It seems that the court which is first seized of the issue gets a form of precedence and any other court in which the same matter arises is obliged to decline jurisdiction, or if the case has got underway, to stay its proceedings in relation to the same issue.  If I know I can be sued in one of many jurisdictions and I decide that tactically I will commence proceedings on the issue in question in the slowest of those jurisdictions and I will have carriage of the proceedings as plaintiff in them and I will dictate the speed at which they are heard and use time-delaying tactics, which is not unknown to lawyers, what will happen if I can exclude <Col N="524" /> another jurisdiction which could deal with the case much more speedily and rapidly and would do so by the tactical device of getting in the first writ or document to initiate the proceedings in one jurisdiction rather than another?  There does not seem to be any provision in the Convention as it now stands which would permit a domestic court to say to the plaintiff: &ldquo;This is not a bona fide action you have commenced in the other court&rdquo;. In my view it would require the person who was aggrieved by this state of affairs to go to the foreign jurisdiction to try to put the matter right.  He might find that procedurally he was up against it or that the cost of doing so was very substantial.</P>
    <P>In the context of a protocol or an amendment to the Convention, is it not desirable that we should think in terms of some form of residual discretion to the domestic tribunal to ignore foreign proceedings in cases where it is believed in fairness to one of the parties that justice requires that they should take jurisdiction from the other court?  That is an issue of some consequence and it should be taken on board by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another issue I want to raise and I would appreciate the Minister's view on this.  We are now putting into place, according to the Fifth Schedule to the Bill, a test for domicile which is based on ordinary residence.  The European Court of Justice in the case of Klomps v. Michele, Case 166, 1980, defined the idea of domicile as on the basis of habitual residence.  Why should we not write into our law, with the benefit of that judgment, a definition of domicile which is consistent with the interpretation of the European Court of Justice of the domicile provision?  We should do so on the basis of habitual residence which would be, as Deputy Shatter pointed out earlier, more consistent with the notions laid down by the Law Reform Commission for reform.  The Minister should take that on board and come back to us on it.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say in relation to the substance of this Bill is that I am worried about its retrospective effect. <Col N="525" /> How many judgments will become enforceable in Ireland by virtue of the passage of this Bill and how old can those judgments be?  It may be that somewhere lost in the minutiae of this Bill there is some provision in relation to that but I have not found it if there is one.  It strikes me that there should be some explicit limitation procedure that judgments should have a limited lifespan or that the retrospective effect of this Bill should be capable of being decided in its extent at least.  Is the Minister satisfied that the Convention obliges us to recognise all judgments retrospectively or is the effect of this Bill to deal only with judgments obtained after its passage?  I am subject to correction but I do not think it is.  This House would be well advised to address its mind to this issue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to procedures of this House.  The Committee Stage of this Bill is very complex.  I can see no reason why this House on plenary session should spend its time debating this Bill line by line and debating the amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister used the phrase to describe the English equivalent of this Bill as &ldquo;mind boggling myriad of legal complexity&rdquo;.  It is absured for three or four people who have points to make on Committee Stage to take up the time of this House which already has a backlog of legislation.  While the Committee Stage is very complex and will have certain ramifications it will be of limited interest and will have a low participation rate.  I appeal to the Minister to entrust the Committee Stage of this Bill to a committee of the House, whose members could reflect the relative strength of the parties.  The Bill could be discussed in a more rational way in an informal and more constructive atmospher than can be done in this House.  Less time would be wasted.  Other Deputies who have serious preoccupations could use that time to discuss the Second Stage of other Bills in this House.  It is quite absured that a complex and technical matter such as this should go on and on when the House has other important matters to discuss.</P>
    <P>I have spoken long enough.  We will <Col N="526" /> have a lot of amendments to put down to the Bill.  However, I ask the Minister to take on board the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  Deputy McDowell has expressed his disgust at the delay in bringing forward the Bill which he says, proposes mind boggling changes in the legislation.  Much work has been done on the Bill not only by the Minister and the civil servants but also by persons outside Government.  I understand that a number of people advised on the very complex matters in the drafting of the Bill, and how it would affect, and merge with, other areas of legislation and common law.  While one must regret some element of delay, one was culpable, and it should go on the record of the House that we are all the better for the delay, because we have seen the development of a corpus of decisions on the legislation in Europe and, indeed, since 1982 in Britain.  This should be helpful to us on Second Stage and on Committee Stage when the detailed provisions come to be debated in full.  I compliment the Minister on the very clear manner in which he elucidated the provisions of the Bill which are expressed in common sense terms. The Minister has done a service not only to this House but to the legal practitioners and law students who require an introduction to the legislation without going through an enormous body of legal tomes which are often couched in the most academic language which assumes a knowledge of conflict law on the part of the reader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to establish the free movement of the European Communities court judgments, reflecting the increased mobility of goods and services within the Communities.  I believe the measures are fundamental to the practical harmonisation of Community trading and will effectively open up European markets to nationals of each member state.  The fact that the legislation should have come about many years ago is perhaps a factor to be taken into account when reflecting on lost opportunities but it should also indicate the possible effects <Col N="527" /> of the legislation in the future.  The difficulties presented by the harmonisation of two quite different systems of law merging into the one European system have obviously delayed the implementation of the law both here and in Britain. We should remember that it took the British four years after the ratification of the final Convention to bring in their legislation.  I refer to the harmonisation of the civil law system of mainland Europe and the common law system which prevails both here and in Britain. Much of the legislation, especially the provisions relating to domicile arise out of the necessity to harmonise these two great systems of law so as to ensure some business like working of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I trust that the delay has been well worth while.  The work on the Bill will ensure that the legislation will be put to practical use when it comes into force of law.  The erudite, detailed and at times esoteric debate which this measure evokes sometimes tends to contradict the basic aims of the legislation.  I think the fact that so much of the debate comes from academic lawyers detracts from the necessary public attention which the legislation requires.  The fact that the legislation does not get the level of press attention it deserves is very often the result of detailed and academic discussion. I feel that one should try to ensure in debating this measure that the effectiveness of the legislation would be increased by ensuring that when enacted it would not be subject to any technical flaws, procedural delays, or complications which leave it little better than the existing hit or miss system of recognising foreign judgements and the existing equally hit or miss system of proceedings in Irish courts where plaintiffs claim to seek a remedy against foreign defendants or defendants of a mixed forign and domestic combination.</P>
    <P>It struck me very forcibly that section 5 provides that an application for enforcement of a judgement shall be made to the Master of the High Court.  It is provided further that the application shall be determined by the Master of the High Court <Col N="528" /> in accordance with the 1968 Convention, as amended.  Article 32 of the Convention provides that the application should be made to the High Court, without specifying or defining the High Court any further. Having regard to the fact that the High Court in the Constitution of Ireland is comprised of judges and that in the decision of the High Court in the Mellowhide Products Ltd. <i>v.</i> Barry Agencies, 1983 <i>Irish Law Reports</i> monthly, page 152, it was held that the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo; did not include the Master of the High Court, it can be argued that in view of this decision there is a danger that section 5 of the Bill and any other sections placing jurisdiction of the High Court on the Master of the High Court is <i>ultra vires</i> the Convention and the Irish courts will allow a defence that the Master has no jurisdiction in any of the applications.  I hope that my worries are unwarranted. The fact that an appeal is provided for in the Convention from the High Court in the High Court could possibly be interpreted as meaning that the High Court in the first instance of an <i>ex parte</i> application for recognition could in fact be the Master of the High Court.  The position is not helped when the Convention in nearly all cases except Ireland and Britain provides for a full-scale appeal in another court.  For instance, in the case of Germany an application may be made <i>ex parte</i> for recognition in the first instance to the Landgericht and, if refused, the appeal may be brought to the Oberlandesgericht, which is another court and indeed a higher court.  The current position in Britain is that the application may be brought in the first instance to the Master of the Queen's Bench, which is in many ways the equivalent of the Master of the High Court.  One cannot draw too many parallels with the British system in view of the definition in the Irish Constitution of the High Court and in view of the Mellowhide decision.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the jurisdiction of the High Court is unusual if not mystifying. It concerns the right to apply to the High Court proper for recognition of authentic instruments and court settlements. The explanatory memorandum <Col N="529" /> with the Bill states that these documents are unknown to the Irish legal system and that it is intended that an application for their enforcement would be made <i>ex parte</i> not to the Master of the High Court but to a judge of the High Court.  Thus, the distinction suggested to the Mellowhide case is brought seriously into play.  However, a possibly more substantial concern arises from the fact that Article 40 of the 1968 Convention provides that if an applicant is refused recognition or an enforcement order of an authentic instrument the applicant may appeal to the High Court in Ireland.  This to my mind is not the usual practice. When a person applies to the High Court in the usual way on an <i>ex parte</i> application for, say, an interim injunction or a conditional order for <i>certiorari,</i> or as it is now called, for judicial review and one is refused, one then goes on to appeal to the Supreme Court.  In some instances one finds that the inexperienced or perhaps the lawyer of great initiative and ingenuity will go back to another judge of the High Court and omit to inform the judge that a previous applications was refused.  In such instances the court takes a very serious view of the matter in so far as the applicant did not reveal to the judge to whom the second application is being made that a first application had been refused by a colleague.</P>
    <P>I would like this matter of an appeal from the High Court to the High Court to be clarified, especially in view of the fact that the Constitution defines the High Court as a type of corporate entity of jurisdication which cannot have an appellant function in relation to its own decisions.  It seems the Constitution does not compel an appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court.  Other courts may intervene between the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Under the Constitution there may be scope for a court of appeal, and this has been mentioned also.  The proposals in the Bill may be an absurdity regardless of the fact that the Bill and the Convention may be constitutional and that the thrust of the Bill and the Convention may be constitutional. Nevertheless, in relation to <Col N="530" /> definitional matters and the practical working out of the Bill, going to courts and getting effective orders, there will be difficulties.  I trust that the Minister can clarify these matters and, if they remain in the Bill, that the ingenuity of the courts can deal with them.  Certainly, they are of grave concern to me.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to find reference in the Bill to the source of jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to the enforcement of authentic instruments.  Section 5 confers jurisdiction on the Master of the High Court in relation to enforcement of ordinary judgments.  One would expect that, together with that section, one would find a clear statement that in relation to authentic instruments the Master did not have any jurisdiction and that it was given to a judge of the High Court proper.  Instead, one has to look to the definition section, section 2, where an enforcement order is defined; and an enforcement order in the case of an authentic instrument is defined as that which can be got from an application to a judge of the High Court.  There is a further hint in section 6 of the Bill in relation to the special meaning of a judgment which includes, for the purposes of section 6 only, an authentic instrument.  There is a further reference in section 11 to the jurisdiction of the court in relation to authentic instruments for the purpose of taking protective measures and getting orders for protective measures.  Were it not for the fact that the Explanatory Memorandum states clearly that the High Court proper is to have jurisdiction in relation to these matters it would be quite a feat indeed to glean from a fairly detailed reading of the Bill that the jurisdiction rested there.  In relation to the presentation and drafting of measures such as this, they are mind boggling enough without adopting a spot-the-ball type of draftsmanship on the matter. Even legal practitioners should not be expected to spend enormous amounts of time piecing the bits together so as to eventually interpret the Bill by stealth and sheer crosswordlike skill.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the rules committee of the superior courts will have a very <Col N="531" /> important job to provide rules of court to give full effect to the legislation so that the proofs for an application for enforcement or recognition of a judgment can be as simple as possible.  There is a necessity to minimise the use of affidavits of foreign law by foreign lawyers to explain the effect of judgments and so as to simplify the authentification procedure in relation to documents and translations.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a helpful section which relates to proof and admissibility in relation to judgments.</P>
    <P>With reference to the Minister's undertaking to bring forward legislation ratifying the 1980 Convention on the choice of law in relation to contractual and other matters, there is in place, to the best of my knowledge, a further Convention emananating from the Conference on Conflict of Laws in The Hague on the admissibility of evidence and the presentation of evidence throughout the Convention areas in cases involving foreign elements.  It has been said by speakers from the Opposition that it is all very well to sign and to ratify Conventions but that it is another matter to do something about it and I concur with that view.  The House should not merely confine itself to the technical passing of this Bill and the satisfaction that the Bill is a consistent body of law when it is enacted.  The House should be concerned about delivering the effect of this Bill to the consumer through the courts of this land.  To do that one would need to look at the laws of evidence to ensure that the very often intricate formalities in relation to the proof of happenings abroad, the proof of foreign law and foreign instruments, and the securing of the attendance of foreign witnesses in many cases, are all sorted out so that the smooth running of these cases can be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to have the remedies on the Statute Book but it is another matter altogether to go to court and find that the remedies can be applied in a practical manner.  This applies to all Conventions, whether of a civil or family law or even a criminal kind.  This House can <Col N="532" /> very often get carried away on the principles but can be very short in relation to the working out in practice of the remedy.  It would be a bad thing for this House and this country to pass legislation and to subscribe to Conventions so that our partners in Europe would have the expectation we could deliver the goods in the courts of this country and yet when foreigners and nationals of contracting states in the EC come here to get legal redress they find they are caught on very many procedural obstacles arising from our inability and unwillingness to subscribe to whatever bodies of common rules exist under Conventions on the procedural end.</P>
    <P>The straight forward rules of court in relation to the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders between Ireland and Britain are a pointer to what may be required in the rules which will emanate from the rules committee of the superior courts when this legislation is enacted. However, the ultimate rules which will emerge can be expected to be more complex. If we can have in place rules of court which will give practical effect to the legislation upon its enactment then it may be desirable to have a look at the rules and procedures governing the implementation of the Convention in other jurisdictions so as to ensure that there will be no procedural barriers defeating the overall application of the convention in practice right across the European Community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts as affected by the Bill, there are big changes arising there and I echo the sentiments expressed by Deputy McDowell in this respect.  There will be big changes in the Irish courts as a result of the change from the so-called exorbitant juridiction of the Irish courts in which they deal with claims with a foreign element by giving leave to serve a writ outside the jurisdiction, very often in respect of the accident which occurred in Germany as instanced by the Minister and Deputy McDowell and where the jurisdiction of the court depends on the voluntary submission to that jurisdiction by the German defendant.  No longer will <Col N="533" /> the Irish plaintiff have the option of taking that course in the Irish courts in many instances.  Of course, in the case of a car accident he will because there are special provisions in the Bill and in the Convention in relation to that but one will find that Irish plaintiffs will, more and more be forced out into other jurisdictions to assert their rights and not only will an Irish plaintiff face different choices of law possibly by going into court in Germany, as distinct from Ireland, but also the Irish plaintiff will be affected by encormous differences in the level of damages for pain and suffering existing between the two countries.</P>
    <P>We can expect this difference as between Ireland and the mainland countries to continue for some time notwithstanding any changes that may occur in the jury system.  It seems we have a tradition here of high damages and the continental countries, and Britain to a lesser extent, have a tradition of lower damages.  In fact, the phenomenon of low damages in Germany in particular has to be experienced to be believed and it will shock many Irish litigants to find that they are now in that positions.  This is possibly one of the disadvantages of this Bill but I believe that Irish people will have to learn to live with the consequences of the Bill because its overall beneficial effects are vastly greater its than any of these difficulties on an individual basis.  Nevertheless, we should be conscious that these dangers are there.</P>
    <P>People have said that the lawyers should acquaint themselves with the contents of the Bill.  I would go further and say that business people especially should acquaint themselves with the procedures and the consequences of the Bill because many business decisions will be affected from the outset by the fact that disputes in relation to contracts could end up in a different jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The occurrence of such divergences in relation to the choice of law applicable to the same case in two different jurisdictions and the actual practice and psychology of the two different courts in two different countries gives rise to the need to press for further harmonisation in that <Col N="534" /> area.  Already we have seen the onset of the European code of absolute liability in respect of products manufactured in the Community on the consumer side of legislation.  I respectfully suggest that the area of commercial contracts, or at least of some aspects of commercial contracts, is eminently suitable for further harmonisation. I think the convention which the Minister has in mind, that of 1980, would deal with the choice of law aspects in relation to civil and commercial contracts and other civil matters.  There is a further aspect of harmonisation and that relates to the law itself which may be applicable to contracts.  It is a dangerous area in which to advocate too much harmonisation.</P>
    <P>So far in the Common Market we have had harmonisation of legislation, much of it in relation to standards &mdash; standards of milk, standards of beef, standards of pollution of the atmosphere.  The harmonisation largely relates to the &ldquo;do nots&rdquo; of the law in the various areas but do not relate to the mechanism by which disputes can be resolved and I would instance the contrast between, let us say, the German system and the Irish system in relation to time limits in contracts.  In the Irish system we generally regard time limits with a grain of salt.  The courts will not apply a strict time limit in most cases and will decide whether time was of the essence of the contract.  In most cases the courts will say that time was not of the essence of the contract in spite of the fact that a strict time limit was laid down. They will say it is up to the party making a claim in the contract to have made time of the essence by writing a stern letter and generally banging the table to have the contract completed on time within a reasonable time after the time limit.  In some cases our courts in Ireland, and indeed the courts in Britain, have said that even where persons purported to make time of the essence the courts would not allow them to make time of the essence unless it was reasonable for them to do so.</P>
    <P>The law in Germany contrasts absolutely with this position.  Generally they strictly apply a time limit as stated in the <Col N="535" /> contract and I suppose this goes a long way to reflect the German methods of business and may, in fact, influence German methods of business.  The harmonisation of the treatment by courts of these aspects of contracts would go a long way towards leaving the Irish businessman in the same position as the German businessman, able to anticipate how the German courts would deal with the contract and generally in a position to predict how their commercial transactions would go ahead in the countries they were dealing with.  Nevertheless in studying European comparative law one finds that many aspects of the concepts of contract law end up with the same results in the end and one should be quite prepared to look into this aspect of harmonisation with a view to having more developments and with a view to ensuring that the business community in Ireland, and indeed the citizens of Ireland, can deal with this jurisdiction with a greater sense of awareness of the results that might ensure in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>As regards the further pursuit of the harmonisation of provisions in relation to conflict of law, the Irish Government could take a leading part and the benefits to a further extension of Irish trade as a result are obvious.  Provisions of Article 27 of the 1968 Convention which disentitled the applicant to recognition of the judgment may pose a threat to the smooth working of the system.  These are the provisions which allow a defendant to object to the enforcement of judgment on the grounds that enforcement would be contrary to public policy.  One wonders if the grounds of public policy may be more numerous in the defence of nationals of some member states than of others.  The statement of the position experienced in English courts in 1967 is described in Dicey &amp; Morris &ldquo;Conflict of Laws, eleventh edition&rdquo;.  This feeling of insecurity in relation to how Irish nationals might be treated in the foreign courts spring to mind when the editor of that edition refers to the use of the summary procedure used in English courts on page 968, as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> The speed and simplicity of this procedure, coupled with the tendency of English judges narrowly to circumscribe the defences that may be pleaded to an action on a foreign judgment, mean that foreign judgments are in practice enforceable at common law much more easily than they are in many Continental countries, where enforcement is easy in theory but difficult in practice because of the tendency of the Courts to enlarge the scope of the defence that enforcement would be contrary to order public or public policy.</P>
    <P>Also paragraph 4 of Article 27 of the 1968 Convention relating to the defence of lack of capacity on a recognition application could be a minefield of difficulty for the unwary litigant.  Obviously, when the Convention and this legislation are in place on the Statute Book, the Irish Government should press to ensure that the categories of defences available in other European countries under this heading do not get out of hand, relative to the few that can be availed of in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives implicit recognition to the Mareva Injunction.  This is the injunction which enables Irish litigants to ensure that assets can be preserved in this country in the event of a defendant threatening to remove them out of the jurisdiction of this country and removing the security which a plaintiff might have. These injunctions have been developed in Britain and they have been given with a great, and possibly an increasing, degree of frequency in the Irish courts in the last number of years.  The injunction has been the scourge of many a fly-by-night who had wished in recent years to avoid his debts in this country by taking his assets away.  The Bill allows Mareva Injunctions to be obtained even where Irish courts will have no jurisdiction under the legislation.  Irish judges may not now be as willing to grant Marevas as heretofore in the event of this legislation being passed.  The sheer availability of recognition of foreign judgments right across the European Community might, <Col N="537" /> in the court's view in certain cases, diminish the urgency and need for such orders in the future.  Only time and the practice of the courts here in Ireland will tell how the law and the development of the decisions in our courts will react to the new situation as presented by the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Convention allowing consumers to sue in the jurisdiction of the plaintiff regardless of the domicle of the defendant in consumer contract situations would be a great boon to Irish consumers faced with defendants as far away as Greece and Sicily. However, the consequences for small manufacturers faced with consumer claims in Greece or Sicily might not be so happy.  As I stated before, the new jurisdiction incurred by the courts right across Europe in relation to Irish defendants can remove litigation right away from this country and could remove it, as I said, as far away as Greece and Sicily, to the great disadvantage of Irish litigants. When one considers the practical consequences of being a defendant in either or any of the Common Market countries, one finds that perhaps in cases where a contract is made by an Irish defendant with a German plaintiff the German plaintiff will have the option of suing the Irish defendant in Ireland or of availing of a stricter German system to sue in Germany, especially where the contract was to be substantially performed in Germany and where that fact of performance gives jurisdiction to the German court.</P>
    <P>An Irish defendant in that type of litigation will have very substantialy expenses imposed on him or her in relation to getting withnesses across to the German court, in relation to getting German law-years to represent him or her, in relation to dealing with the situation where Irish witnesses cannot be summoned to the German court, in relation to the possibility that the German court would require evidence to be taken in Ireland on commission where the witnesses will not travel from Ireland to the German court.  Such expense would be threatened against an Irish defendant in such situations, and I would say that the same <Col N="538" /> would apply to a German defendant if the German defendant were to be sued out of his own stoping ground or out of his own country.</P>
    <P>It could well be that actions would be compromised, not by reason of the threat of any demerits against the defendant but by reason of the threat of an enormous amount of costs having to be laid out by the defendant in order even to appear in the action.  I would be somewhat concerned that enterprising lawyers might tend, in their over-enthusiasm to act in the interests of their client, to being actions on this alternative jurisdiction away from a defendant so that the action and the running of it could be made as difficult as possible for a defendant in order to put extra pressure &mdash; and extra legal pressure &mdash; on a defendant to compromise.  This would be a danger, especially in vexatious types of actions, actions where a plaintiff might use for the purpose of getting a nuisance settlement, a settlement which would be geared, not in relation to the merits of the action but in relation to the possible costs on the side of the defendant with regard to mounting an appearance and a successful defence.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Irish courts and the European courts can develop a policy of ensuring that this type of &ldquo;one-upmanship&rdquo; in relation to running actions can be controlled so that litigants are not unduly penalised by a sort of swinging across the Continent of actions merely to increase the nuisance value of such actions.  The Irish courts at the present time would view such activity in certain situations as an abuse of the process of court and I am sure that that type of plea might well be available in the European context.  It might well be accepted as a good ground of public policy for upsetting any application for recognition of a judgment.  There is a very hazy area between the absolute abuse of process and the type of &ldquo;one-upmanship&rdquo; which I have in mind.  There is a vast amount of legitimate activity which could be oppressive to litigants and we will have to watch this litigation to see how in practice it develops.  As I said, the abuse <Col N="539" /> of the new procedures would not be confined to foreign lawyers.  They could also be abused by Irish lawyers in proceedings against nationals of other EC countries. It would not be in the interests of this country or the EC if that type of slick activity developed or was condoned by the courts.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill and the Conventions it adopts would help greatly our trade and relationship with the EC.  It would abolish many of the barriers which EC based firms see militating against them if they were to decide to establish in this country.  It would boost significantly our chances of attracting many European based firms to establish in the planned financial services sector.  The attractiveness of the planned financial services centre in Dublin would be helped greatly by a very enthusiastic and energetic commitment from the Minister and from this House to have in place as many of the Conventions as are necessary to ensure the absolute mobility of judgments within the Community, the maximum ease for people based in other EC countries to sue defendants resident in this country and the lack of procedural or evidential constraints in our courts.</P>
    <P>It is important for the financial services centre to be in a position to ensure that mainland based firms can sue firms based in the financial services sector with the same ease as they might sue them if they were based in any other country.  If a contracting party which is based in a different country finds it difficult to sue a firm which establishes in the financial services centre that will be as much of a disadvantage to the financial services centre as a bad telephone line or worse. While we should be concerned to ensure the smooth working of the physical infrastructure of the financial services centre we should be just as much concerned about ensuring that the legislative, administrative and procedural aspects of resolving disputes between the companies which will hopefully establish in the financial services centre and those on the mainland countries of Europe can be effected in an absolutely efficient manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> The importance of this legislation is further underlined when we consider the position of a firm from a country outside the EC setting up in the financial services centre.  Firms from countries such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and the Arab states would benefit greatly from setting up subsidiaries in the EC and EC countries would benefit from the fact that they could have trust in the legal system in which those firms would operate.  One of the main factors blocking trade between Ireland and other EC countries and firms in the Arab states and many Third World countries is the fact that the legal position in relation to any disputes which may arise is anything but clear.  If these firms were to establish in Ireland they would lose that disadvantage because of the system which will be put in place as a result of this legislation.  The advantages from their setting up in Ireland are clear. It is important for Ireland to attract as many foreign firms as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter expressed concern about the referral of disputes to the European Court as was set out in Article 2 of the Protocol of the 1971 Convention.  I must say that I was also concerned about this matter on examination of the Convention and the Bill.  I ask the Minister to have regard to the fact that while section 2 of that Article provides for a request to the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on the question of interpretation, this may also be made by the courts of the contracting states when they are sitting in an appellate capacity and this would include the High Court sitting in an appellate capacity.</P>
    <P>I share also the concerns expressed by Deputy McDowell in relation to the absence of limitation periods on the effectiveness of judgments.  The limitation periods on judgments obtained in the Irish courts are not often referred to. There are limitation periods in respect of execution.  Applications must be made to the court after a comparatively short time to extend the period for execution of a judgment against a defendant.  As Deputy McDowell said, unless the provisions relating to the duration of judgments is contained in the dungeons of <Col N="541" /> the Bill and of the Conventions, some attention would need to be given to this matter otherwise disputes between citizens of the EC and citizens of this country would continue and never reach an end. It is important in all litigation proceedings that a conclusion is reached either through a resolution of the dispute or through the passage of time.  I trust that that matter will be resolved.</P>
    <P>The question which was raised in relation to dual domicile is an important one.  A report on domicile was published in Britain in September of this year.  The high powered committee of inquiry who drew up that report accepted the separate definition of domicile for the purposes of these Conventions and the 1982 equivalent legislation in Britain.  That was accepted because the contracting parties to these Conventions accepted that that definition of domicile is the one that should be applied in both Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the appearance of two types of domicile would lead to confusion, the Minister should consider that domicile has never been in our jurisdiction to date a very great factor in determining contractual and civil matters.  Very often the jurisdiction and the choice of law would be based not on domicile but on the place of contract or the <i>lex loci contractus.</i> Similarly, in the area of tort, the choice of law and, indeed, the jurisdiction were founded on the area and location in which the tort was committed.  Therefore, the existing situation has a certain duality in that the issue of domicile remains one which substantially relates to the status of persons, family law matters and matrimonial type litigation.</P>
    <P>The legislation should go ahead, not only on the basis that this country has made a commitment to the other contracting states and that the other contracting states have been operating this legislation for a considerable time but also on the basis that it would not prejudice any examination of domicile by this House, by the Law Reform Commission or by the Government in relation to other areas of domicile not affected by the Bill. <Col N="542" /> I hope the Bill will continue at fast pace through this House and will be enacted and that ultimately this country will benefit greatly therefrom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers Party welcome the Bill that is currently before the House but do so in what must be regarded as a limited way.  Our qualified welcome of it reflects the fact that the Bill itself is the reflection of the order of things within the EC.  It reflects the fact that that organisation was developes as an institution of capital to assist its development and concentration in the hands of the rich and to enable the increased exploitation of labour and workers throughout Europe.  For that reason the Bill is remarkably narrow in its conception, and the Convention of 1968 is remarkably narrow.  It has an inbuilt class bias and will develop and reflect in our law that class bias.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Convention and, for that matter the Bill, is remarkably narrow.  It is excluded specifically from dealing with matters of revenue, customs or administration and is extended specifically not to include matters such as social security, arbitration and bankruptcy. Here are a Bill and a Convention designed to assist in the development of civil and business matters in the Community, but for some unexplained reason the parties to the Convention of 1968 excluded bankruptcy and proceedings relating to the winding up of insolvent companies and other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and analagous proceedings.  Therefore, while we are legislating for the better order of the development of company law and litigation, we are not prepared to extend the legislation or the Convention to pursue across Europe in the various contracting countries those persons whose companies fold up for whatever reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience has shown in recent months in this country that greed is a great motivator in these matters.  Let me stress that, while this Bill seems to cover all aspects of company and commercial law, it has been excluded from dealing with that.  The message goes out quite <Col N="543" /> clearly from the captains of the EC that the bank rupts and other miscreant company managers and directors will continue to enjoy the same privileges and protections as Irish law has in the past provided for them.</P>
    <P>Some of the previous speakers have talked about the incredible complexity of the drafting of the document.  I have to make a very strong reservation on the way in which the draftsmen have gone on trying in effect to bring into Irish law the provisions of the 1968 Convention by a very simple and, I have to say to some degree lazy procedure of using a large definition clause simply referring each item to the Convention and its provisions, with the result that we, as legislators in this House who are now being given the opportunity of drawing into our law the provisions of the 1968 Convention, have little or no scope or function.  We cannot put down amendments to the Convention as is incorporated as an appendix to the Bill.  For example, we cannot say we are unhappy with the restrictions of the provisions or with definitions with regard to domicile.  Domicile is definded within the provisions of the Treaty and if we are asked to try to slip in amendments in the sections in the definition part or otherwise that will increase the slipshodness of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Convention is explicit.  It is a document that was concluded in 1968 and it is not open to this House or to any Deputy here to seek to alter its provisions.  At the time the legislator of the day, being made aware by the Minister or Ministers concerned, should have pushed the government of the day to ensure that forms of derogation or reservation or declarations of that sort would be loged with our letters of ratification.  I do not believe that anything like that has been done. For that reason we have the Convention lock, stock and barrel simply introduced into a law by the vehicle of the 1987 Bill. It is going to be exceptionally difficult for any of us to sit down now and make a more up-to-date, relevant meaning of the provisions as intended.</P>
    <P>Very useful and good developments <Col N="544" /> are enshrined in the Bill in its entirety.  It is welcome that jurisdiction of litigation in future will be based on domicile and not on the previous narrow grounds of the opportunity to serve writs in or out of the jurisdiction.  The fact that the matrimonial creditor is considered to be the weaker and given preference in proceedings or, more particularly, in the choice of jurisdictions for the institution of proceedings must be welcomed.  The clarification of the location of jurisdiction in land matters based on the location of the land itself again is a clarification of the law in this regard and is welcome. The fact that our courts no longer have a discretion to refuse to entertain litigation in cases once they come within the precise, clear terms of the Bill is welcome but has implications for the administration of justice in this land that must be addressed by this Government if they are to give meaning to this Bill at all.</P>
    <P>The availability of the <i>ex parte</i> side-bar application to the Master of the High Court helps in the speedy and more effective enforcement of the orders of our courts.  It is a welcome development but if has major implications in regard to the workings of the single Master's Court of the High Court.  Another Deputy raised some question about the constitutionality of some provisions of this Bill with regard to the Master's Court and the functions of the Master.  The Government should consider the establishment of two or more Master's Courts to deal with the massive increase in workload.</P>
    <P>I welcome the notion that a company incorporated in limited or other liability will be accountable on the basis of its seat rather than on the basis of its place of incorporation.  Will regulations be introduced to require companies to indicate on their headed notepaper the place of their seat?  Currently there are very neat references on headed notepaper, by reason of a ministerial requirement that all limited liability companies must state the fact of their incorporation and their incorporated number in the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>We are again beginning to attack the <Col N="545" /> outmoded common law notion of domicile which has bedevilled Irish law, particularly in the area of land and matrimonial matters.  It is incredible that we as legislators have been so reluctant to deal with the problem of domicile.  Part of the problem was addressed in the 1986 Act to which other speakers have referred. Now in a very small way we are beginning to throw out the tyranny of the common law in this regard.  The great Irish American civil lawyer, Sampson, spoke at length on the tyranny of the common law. Domicile is one of the most indelible features of that tyranny and it is clearly reflected in our utter reluctance to begin to address it.  It would make an ass of Irish domiciliary law if it is not the same for all sectors.</P>
    <P>This is a significant first in the whole area of private international law in this country.  The administration of Irish law and Irish law itself will be brought into very sharp relief in the European context. The whole emphasis of the Bill is concentrated around the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The implications for those courts in terms of the increased workload must be addressed by the Minister. There seems to be an anomaly between sections 6 and 7 in so far as enforcement orders in regard to matrimonial matters can be taken under section 7 before the Master of the High Court but all other enforcement orders must be taken before the High Court proper.  This distinction requires some explanation.  The issue of the jurisdictional range of orders to be pursued in the High Court must be considered. The Bill provides that matrimonial orders can be pursued at the corresponding level in the District Court and the Circuit Court but no similar provision seems to exist with regard to other orders relating to contract or civil tort law.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the delay in introducing this Bill.  I note that the Convention was not available for practical implementation until 1 November 1986 when the six original contracting parties ratified it.  For that reason, I am not too concerned.  There is also the fact that the earlier introduction <Col N="546" /> of this legislation would have placed an enormously increased workload on our courts.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has been calling over a long period for the introduction of divisional courts of the Supreme Court.  That issue must be seriously addressed in the light of the implications of this Bill.  There is a very peculiar provision in Article 2 of the 1971 Protocol that the Supreme Court is the primary court of reference to the Court of Justice.  The High Court has no original jurisdiction in this regard.  It was an amazing oversight on the part of our Government not to have included the High Court in preference to the Supremen Court as the court of reference to the Court of Justice.  We cannot address this matter because it is contained in the Convention, not in the Bill.  We cannot seek to amend it.  It casts on to the Supreme Court a very heavy onus in terms of work.  This area of work would be very suitably dealt with at divisional level within the Supreme Court as opposed to the court proper.  For too long the Supreme Court has been overworked in its listings.  It takes a long time for matters to come up on appeal.  Many of these matters, such as the whole issue of liability in tort matters and the quantum of damages, should properly be dealt with by divisional courts, leaving the Supreme Court proper to get on with the job of interpreting the law, statutory and otherwise, and developing our Constitution.</P>
    <P>What intentions has the Minister with regard to increasing the facilities available in the High Court?  I refer, for example, to the computerisation of the records of our courts.  Our system will be thrown into sharp relief when litigants and lawyers from other jurisdictions have to stand in a queue at the Stamping Office to lick stamps on to court instruments and queue for the filling of documentation.  It is an outmoded and unbelievably anachronistic administrative scheme.  An attempts was made to address these questions but not in terms of computerisation and the development of facilities in the central office.</P>
    <P>The second last paragraph of the <Col N="547" /> Explanatory Memorandum, under the heading, Financial Implications, states:</P>
    <P>Article 44 of the 1968 Convention provides that an applicant for the enforcement of a judgment, who has been granted legal aid in the state of origin, shall, in relation to the initial enforcement proceedings, provided for in Articles 32 to 35 (i.e. up to and including the decision authorising or refusing enforcement), be entitled to the most favourable legal aid available in the State addressed.  Since the initial proceedings will be <i>ex parte</i> the cost to the Exchequer of providing legal aid for these purposes is likely to be insignificant.</P>
    <P>The final and unbelievable line of that paragraph is: &ldquo;The Bill has no staffing implications&rdquo;.  The first thing that has been promised is that the litigant coming here who would in the normal course of events be entitled to legal aid in their home country will be entitled to the most favourable legal aid available in this State.  However, the fact is that there is virtually no legal aid available in this State.  In particular there is no legal aid available for persons who would litigate under the civil remedies of tort and otherwise. What is happening here is that many of the law centres in Dublin city, and around the country, are closed to new clients because they are so overworked and inundated with inquiries.  When a client who is poor and unable to meet the requirements of the private profession gets inside the door of a law centre for interview and explains that his or her case relates to anything other than a matrimonial problem, he or she is invariably deflected out the door and down to sympathetic lawyers in private practice.  The workload that those centres carry is monumental.  To suggest that the are open to deal with the litigants of other contracting parties to this Convention coming here is to sell a great lie.  To suggest that favourable or other legal aid provisions will be available to them is something we should not allow go unchallenged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> Clearly, the Minister has no intention of addressing the current problems let alone those that will arise when the provisions in the Bill come into force because he has said that there are no staffing implications involved.  That is a very sad state of affairs.  One of the great areas that the Bill addresses is that dealing with matrimonial orders enforcement.  We will have the wives of separated, divorced or alienated husbands who have made their way to this jurisdiction to work, or for whatever reason, seeking through our legal aid system to pursue them for proper maintenance.  The Minister suggests that those people can be accommodated comfortably within our existing scheme.  There is the other side of that coin of the poor person who has to go to our law centres in an effort to go beyond our jurisdiction to pursue a defaulting spouse.  How will our law centres be able to help such a litigant to make contact with those operating under legal aid schemes in other countries so as to coordinate correspondence and transmit legal documents?  All those problems are passed off by the Minister in the final sentence of the Explanatory Memorandum to the effect that the Bill has no staffing implications.  The legislation should be given teeth so that it can be implemented to the full, particularly in regard to those who cannot afford litigation, people for whom the Minister has a particular responsibility.  The poorer sections of our community should be able to avail of its provisions and not just captains of high finance.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise an interesting point in regard to deserted wives.  When those people present themselves at the Department of Social Welfare they are facilitated if they can establish to the satisfaction of officials that a defaulting spouse is living in another country, is impossible to locate or impossible to pursue for the enforcement of a maintenance order.  What will happen now if the spouse can be located or is living in any of the countries that are party to this Convention?  Will legal aid be readily available to that person?  Will the deserted wife be told that she has a duty <Col N="549" /> to pursue her defaulting spouse in those countries?  Will her entitlement to a deserted wife's allowance be curtailed in the same way that many unemployment benefits are taken from married women? The Minister should address that problem which concerns The Workers' Party. We are concerned about the class-orientated bias in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another feature I should like to question the Minister on is the question of retrospection.  What is the position in regard to proceedings for contempt of court or for sequestration of assets?  What are the implications for the Government in relation to them?  I note that the Minister stated that judgment for periodic payments and non-monetary judgments will also be enforceable.  I should like to know if in the definition of non-monetary judgments contempt of court is included for enforcement here.  We are all aware that two members of Greenpeace were sentenced to prison for three months for contempt in relation to their efforts to protect our environment by blocking the pipe at Sellafield, Hans Guyt and Wilhellm Beekman.  Those men had the presence of mind not to attend the court hearing and are now living in their respective countries.  However, I understand that the warrant for their committal has been issued and I have no doubt that the British authorities will seek to enforce it. Had those men who took strong action on our behalf, informally I concede &mdash; it is worth nothing that they received a warm ovation from people passing to work on the Monday morning they returned to the Irish port where they were given safe haven from the British proceedings &mdash; decided to stay here would the Government, and our courts, be obliged to enforce the committal order?  Will the Minister say if the warrant for committal for contempt or non-payment of a debt under contract or otherwise will be carried out and given effect in our penal system?  Will we repatriate the defaulting offender, the person in contempt or creditor to the requesting jurisdiction? What are the implications for our prisons which are grossly overcrowded?  I have not been able to find any answer to those <Col N="550" /> questions in the Bill or the Explanatory Memorandum.  It appears that such orders will be presented before Irish courts for enforcement against non-nationals found within our jurisdiction and that will have profound implications for us.  If my reading of this is correct the Dáil does not have any power to amend or deal with such orders.  It appears that if we introduce amendments we will be told that we are outside the scope, as was the experience in regard to other proceedings, of the agreement.</P>
    <P>In regard to the sequestration of funds we all remember that in the wake of the great Thatcher campaign against the National Union of Miners in Britain a lot of the funds of that body were transferred to this jurisdiction, and elsewhere in Europe, to protect them from the courts in Britain.  What will be the position of Irish courts in regard to such funds in future?  Will they be asked to enforce the iron hand of Maggie Thatcher in this jurisdiction in her efforts to crush unions and other organisations who stand up against the inhuman policies of her Government?  How do this Government propose to deal with those matters?  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this in his reply to this Stage or, later on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly raise two other matters and I hope the Minister will have something to say on them.  I am concerned about the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and I want to know, in the context of enforcement orders in regard to matrimonial proceedings being sought to be enforced in this jurisdiction, if the provisions of that Act will survive the passing into law of this Bill.  Will, for example, the matrimonial home be protected as before against orders that might be transferred from another jurisdiction which would not have the same protections for the matrimonial home as we have?  If, for example, an order is made in another jurisdiction for the enforced sale under the law of that jurisdiction of a matrimonial home, what is the position if it is sought to be enforced within our jurisdiction?</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is the function <Col N="551" /> of our law and its administration and to bring us into uniformity with other countries in Europe with regard to the enforcement and pursuit of court orders. One of the matters that concerns me &mdash; I am interested to see that the original document was drafted in the Irish language &mdash; is that there is an obligation on the legal profession, the Law Society in particular for solicitors, to insist that all members of that profession must pass an Irish examination.  He or she must have proficiency in Irish to enable him or her to carry on proceedings in our courts, under the Constitution, in that language. The development of the Irish legal system and profession, in terms of the European partners, is being hindered simply and solely because of this language requirement. We are not afforded the same reciprocal arrangements with the other European partners of the EC as we should be entitled to, simply because non-Irish persons seeking to join the legal profession here must be able to pass and be proficient in Irish, which is an impediment to their practising here.  In the contest of trying to develop uniformity in the administration of justice, will the Minister advise us whether, in the Solicitors' Acts (Amendment) Bill which he proposes to introduce early in the new year, he will address this point so that we will have proper and full reciprocal arrangements and so that at least we will be brought into uniformity with the other arm of the legal profession here &mdash; the barristers &mdash; who do not have to contend with this restrictive requirement.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wish to raise in relation to the Bill, I welcome it in the guarded and limited way in which The Workers' Party must welcome most things which develop within the European Community.  Nonetheless, it is a useful development in some regards and we hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this technical but nevertheless important Bill.  Before I <Col N="552" /> respond to the specific points made by Deputies I would like to make some general comments on the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill, while it deals with what are primarily legal matters, has economic implications which should not be overlooked. We are all aware of the importance of international trade to the Irish economy.  In 1986 the combined value of our imports and exports amounted to approximately £18 billion, a sizeable sum.  By definition, such trade involves transactions between Irish and foreign based firms.  The sheer size of our international trade inevitably gives rise to quite a number of disputes and litigation.</P>
      <P>The prospect of litigation involving an international element is, understandably, a daunting one.  At present, however, there is an additional complication for an Irish firm which undertakes an action against a foreign company in an Irish court; that is, it may be a potentially fruitless exercise because it may not be able to have the resultant judgment enforced abroad.  Any uncertainty in this area is obviously undesirable since it has the potential to affect the growth of our international trade.  This Bill by enabling Ireland to ratify the 1968 Convention will remove this difficulty and will also introduce greater certainty into the general legal framework governing contractual relationships between Irish and other EC countries.  Since around two thirds of our trade is with EC countries the importance of this development is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the coming into effect of the Convention, the position is that once the Bill is enacted, the necessary arrangements will be made for the deposit of the instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General of the Council of the European Communities.  The Convention will come into force between Ireland and the original six member states plus Denmark and the United Kingdom on the first day of the third month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification, in accordance with the provisions of Article 39 of the 1978 Accession Convention.  The Convention has been in force between those eight <Col N="553" /> countries since 1 January last.  The Convention will not be extended to Greece until such time as the Federal Republic of Germany and Greece ratify the 1982 Accession Convention.  Spain and Portugal are also obliged by their membership of the Community to accede to the Convention.  This may take some time as negotiations to provide for their Accession have not yet commenced.  I understand, however, that these will start early in 1988.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which will arise following our ratification of the 1968 Convention, notably the necessity to ratify a 1952 Maritime Convention on the Arrest of Seagoing Ships. Ratification of this Convention is required in order to protect our existing admiralty jurisdiction.  Article 36 of the 1978 Accession Convention provides for special jurisdictional rules in admiralty matters, which are based on the 1952 Arrest Convention, and which will apply to Ireland for a period of three years to allow us time to ratify the Arrest Convention. Work on the preparation of a Bill to enable us to ratify this Convention has already commenced in my Department and I hope to be in a position to introduce the Bill during 1988.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, in referring to Article 2 of the 1971 Protocol on Interpretation, felt it was a pity that references for ruling and interpretation were confined to the Supreme Court.  I refer him to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 2 of the Protocol. Paragraph 2 provides that in addition to the courts mentioned in paragraph 1, the courts of a country when they are sitting in an appellate capacity may request a preliminary ruling.  Paragraph 3 provides that the courts mentioned in Article 37, in the case of Ireland, the High Court, may also request a preliminary ruling on the cases covered by that Article.  The purpose of the provisions in Article 2 of the protocol was to reduce as far as possible the number of references to the Court of Justice so as to cut down on the work load of the court and to ensure that the domestic appeals system was used before going for a decision and an interpretation to the European Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> Deputy Shatter and other Deputies raised the question of domicile in the case of infants and in the case where a person is not ordinarily resident here and cannot be said to be ordinarily resident in any other country.  Schedule 5 should be read in conjunction with Article 52 of the Convention. The definition of domicile of an individual is, for the purposes of paragraph 1 of article 52, that if a person is not ordinarily resident in Ireland an Irish court will apply paragraph 2 of Article 52, and in order to determine whether the person is domiciled in any other contracting state, it will apply the law of that other State and not the law of this State as set out in this Bill.  With respect to children the purpose of the definition of domicile in part 1 of the Fifth Schedule is to provide a definition of domicile for the purposes of all aspects of the Convention. Therefore, for the purposes of the words &ldquo;national law&rdquo; in paragraph 3 of Article 52 which deals with dependant domicile it is the definition of domicile of an individual in part 1 of the Fifth Schedule and not the common law definition of domicile that will apply.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter, Abbot and McDowell referred to the definition of domicile in the Bill.  The definition in the Bill is proposed for the purposes of this Convention only.  It was accepted during our negotiations with the original six member states that the common law definition in Irish law and in English law which is geared towards issues of status was not suitable for the purposes of the Convention.  Both countries undertook to provide a definition of domicile approximating to the Continential definition for purposes of the convention. This we have done as have the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised as to why we use &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; and not, for example &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; as a definition for domicile for the purposes of the convention.  First, &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; is a concept already well known in our law. Of particular relevance is the fact that the ordinary residence of the defendant in the State is one of the grounds in order 11 of the rules of the superior courts to <Col N="555" /> allow the service of a summons outside of the jurisdiction.  It is also used in the venue provisions in our law courts.  There is one very cogent reason for not using &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; as a definition of domicile for the purposes of the Convention. The Convention itself distinguishes between domicile and habitual residence.  As the Deputies have mentioned the Law Reform Commission recommended that the concept of domicile in our general law should be replaced by habitual residence.  The Commission have proposed a definition for &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; which would require a high degree of social integration between the person and the State.  Such a definition would be completely unsuitable for the purposes of founding jurisdiction in the case of the Judgments Convention which deals mainly with commercial legal relationships.  If the Government were to accept the Commission's proposals, if &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; had already been chosen as a connecting factor for the Judgments Convention, it would be necessary to have a variety of definitions for &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; to take account of the different circumstances in which it would be used as a connecting factor, such as in matters relating to personal status, and commerical transactions and this would lead to unnecessary complications.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell said that Klomps <i>v.</i> Michele in the European Court interpreted domicile as being &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo;. This appears in an English translation of the court's judgment.  It is accepted as being a mistake in translation. The Convention itself distinguishes in Article 5.2 of the convention between &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the delay in the preparation of the Bill. Members know that the original convention was signed in 1968 but it did not come into effect until 1973.  The Convention which dealt with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom was signed in 1978.  Work on the preparation of the Bill commenced <Col N="556" /> shortly after the signing of the Convention but was subsequently postponed because it became clear that other states would be delayed in ratifying the Convention and that there would be other matters which required more urgent attention.  The 1978 Convention could not come into force until the original Six and one new member state ratified the Convention.  As it transpires the Convention did not come into effect until November 1986 because of delays in ratification by the original member states.  A Bill was introduced by the previous Government in December 1986, which was, as soon as it could be done, to give effect to the Convention.  That of course lapsed with the dissolution of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell queries whether the Convention would have retrospective effect in respect of judgments already handed down.  This question is dealt with in article 34 of the 1978 Convention of Accession.  I would refer Deputies to the Third Schedule of the Bill which contains the relevant provisions.  Deputy McDowell referring to the <i>Irish Law Times</i> said that decisions given before the coming into effect of the Convention might have been different if the legislation was in place.  I presume he is referring to a particular court case, the Supreme Court decision in Grehan <i>v.</i> the Medical Incorporated and is comparing it with the European Court decision in Bier <i>v.</i> Mines de Potasse.  The Supreme Court was aware of the decision and mentioned it in their decision in the Grehan case.  While the decisions may conflict in their details, both favour a pragmatic approach and in general are in harmony.</P>
    <P>Deputy Abbott mentioned the Mellowhide case which dealt with the interpretation of section 22 of the Courts Act 1981 which provides that where any court orders any payment by a person of a sum of money, the judge concerned may if he thinks fit also order the payment of interest on the whole or part of that sum. The High Court found in 1982 that this discretion was confined by section 22 of the 1981 Act to the trial judge and is not vested in the Master.  However, the High <Col N="557" /> Court judgment noted that there appeared to be no logical reason why the Master of the High Court should not exercise the discretion contained in the section.  This Bill gives specific jurisdiction to the Master so the difficulty that arose in the context of the Courts Act will not arise in this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Abbott referred to the more general question of conferring jurisdiction on the Master to deal with the initial application for enforcement.  The Master has already had conferred on him a similar jurisdiction in the case of maintenance orders from the United Kingdom and Community judgments made under the relevant regulations.  It must be remembered that the application will be <i>ex parte</i> and this is in line with the general jurisdiction that is at present exercised by the Master of the High Court.  The intention behind the Convention is that recognition will be more or less automatic and it seems eminently proper that the initial <i>ex parte</i> application be made to the Master.  The only reason why authentic instruments are to go to a judge of the High Court rather than to the Master is because we have no previous experience of the type of instruments involved. Indeed, it is quite likely that applications in respect of such instruments will be very rare, if they ever arise.  In the light of experience it is to be considered whether such applications may not also go to the Master.  We will have a further chance to consider the operation of the Convention in Ireland when the legislation to give effect to the accession of Spain and Portugal comes before the House.  Negotiations on their accession are due to commence shortly.  In any event I do not see any major problem arising where there is an appeal against the enforcement of an authentic instrument.  The initial action will be <i>ex parte</i> to a judge of the High Court.  The appeal will be <i>inter pares</i> also to a judge of the High Court and the defendant will then have an opportunity to pursue his case fully. This type of situation already arises in cases of interim and interlocutory injunctions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> Deputy Abbott raised the problems that may arise under this Bill with respect to evidence.  He referred to the ratification of the Hague Convention which is relevant to this matter.  I will pay close attention to this matter once the Bill comes into being.  Deputy Abbott also raised the question of limiting the duration to which a judgment is valid.  This is a matter to be determined by national law.  For example, if one seeks to enforce an Irish judgment in another EC country, the enforcing court will undoubtedly take into account any plea by the defendant that under Irish law the judgment is no longer enforcible in the judgment-granting state.</P>
    <P>Deputy Abbott and Deputy McDowell raised the problem of applicable law, particularly in the area of tort.  Some work has been undertaken within the EC to draw up a Convention on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. A Convention has already been drawn up in relation to contractual obligations and we propose to bring in legislation in due course to ratify this Convention.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan objected to the method of implementing the Convention. I want to make two points in this respect.  First, as with any international convention, once the text of the convention has been agreed an individual state does not have any right to amend it unilaterally.  It is not open to us, therefore, to amend the text of the Convention. We must accede to or reject the Convention in its entirety.  Secondly, this method of implementation was favoured by our EC partners so as to ensure that the Convention is implemented uniformly throughout the EC and also to aid interpretation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the contempt of court and committal.  These are quasi-criminal matters and are not covered by the Convention in so far as it relates to the enforcement of foreign law on contempt or committal.  As I said in my opening address, non-monetary judgments relate mainly to orders such as injunctions.  Deputy McCartan also <Col N="559" /> referred to the family home, matrimonial property, etc.  I believe that these matters are outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the absence of bankruptcy matters from the Convention to which the Bill will give effect.  The reason for this is that negotiations for the purpose of drawing up an EC bankruptcy Convention have been under way separately in the Community.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy referred to the workload which the Convention may bring to our courts.  Of course, this remains to be seen.  However, because of other developments, for example, the abolition of juries in personal injury cases in the High Court, the future position with respect to the workload of the Supreme Court cannot be precisely determined at this time.  Deputy McCartan spoke about the final paragraph of the Explanatory Memorandum which refers to Article 44 of the Convention.  Article 44 relates to foreign maintenance creditors, in particular, who wish to have foreign maintenance orders enforced here.  The Convention imposes an obligation on us to give legal aid to such parties at the <i>ex parte</i> stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: <Col N="560" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is twofold. Firstly, it increases from £500 million to £1,000 million the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow to fund house purchase loans.  Secondly, it empowers the Minister for the Environment to contribute towards the costs of the agency.  Before discussing in detail the reasons for these amendments, I would like to speak briefly about the contribution made by the Housing Finance Agency in the area of housing finance.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency was established in 1981 to raise funds by way of index-linked bonds and to lend these funds to borrowers on modest incomes who would repay them on an income-related basis.  Initially, the agency used the local authorities as agents to process loan applications including the collection of repayments, etc.  Since 1 July 1986 this arrangement has been changed and now the agency block lends funds to the local authorities who, on their own responsibility, lend to the individual borrowers.</P>
      <P>The income related loan scheme and the more recently introduced convertible loan scheme have made a significant contribution to the ability of people to acquire their own homes.  These schemes provide a source of loan finance to those on modest incomes and, due to the income related and low deposit features, have enabled thousands of people to purchase their own homes who would not otherwise have been able to do so.  The schemes, together with the traditional annuity loan scheme which local authorities operate, provide a comprehensive range of mortgage facilities for people on modest incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationalisation which took place in July 1986 has left the agency free to devote more time to raising funds.  This has allowed the remit of the agency in this area to be considerably widened to include the funding of annuity loans as well as income related and convertible loans.  The agency will this year lend to local authorities about twice the amount being provided from the local loans fund. <Col N="561" /> As a result of my recent announcement &mdash; to which I shall return later &mdash; about the future funding of loans for persons on modest incomes, the agency will be effectively providing all the funds which local authorities will be borrowing for their various house purchase loan schemes next year.  The present borrowing limit is £500 million and it is anticipated that this will be reached by the agency during 1988.  The new limit of £1,000 million should enable the agency to fulfil their role as the principal source of finance for publicly funded house purchase loans for the next four to five years.</P>
    <P>Of course, the agency's borrowing requirement in 1988 would have been greater but for the recently announced arrangements whereby the building societies and banks have agreed to increase their lending to persons who would normally be seeking local authority loans.  Under these arrangements the institutions will increase their funding of house purchase loans for persons under the £10,000 income limit by up to £70 million in 1988.  They will not apply prior deposit requirements to applicants in this category.  To ensure that loans of up to 90 per cent of the house value are available, a limited guarantee will be given by the local authorities in respect of these loans.  Under the guarantee, the lending agency will be able to recover from the local authority half of any losses suffered on repossession and sale of a house, subject to a maximum of half the amount by which the loan exceeds 75 per cent of the house value at the time the loan was approved.  Any payments by a local authority under the guarantee arrangements will be recouped from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>While the commercial agencies will not apply prior deposit requirements to applicants in this category they will apply their normal criteria in making decisions on loan applications to them.  In this context, I should emphasise that house purchasers will still be able to apply to their local authority for a loan where they have failed to obtain one from the commercial agencies.  The participation of banks and <Col N="562" /> building societies in this area of the mortgage market is very welcome and will enable the public capital programme provision for house purchase loans to be reduced from £155 million to £100 million with a consequent saving in the Exchequer borrowing requirement of £45 million and a saving in the Housing Finance Agency's borrowing requirement of £10 million.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with these arrangements it has been decided that a variable interest rate should apply to annuity and convertible loans with effect from 1 December.  The interest rate will drop to 9.75 per cent plus the cost of mortgage protection.  This represents a saving of 0.75 per cent to borrowers.  Fixed rate loans are not advantageous to the borrower at a time of falling interest rates. It is the Government's intention that this variable rate will be kept at a rate that does not exceed the normal building society rate.  The Government's policies, particularly the commitment to reduce borrowing and to cut public expenditure, have had and will continue to have a very beneficial effect on interest rates.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of publicly funded loans, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I have increased the maximum secured house improvement loan which may be advanced by local authorities from £6,500 to £8,000.  This increase will enable more people of modest means to carry out improvements to their homes and will apply to works commenced on or after 11 November 1987.  This funding, too, is provided by the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>I would now like to move on to section 3 of the Bill which deals with the making by the Minister for the Environment of contributions towards the costs of the agency.  The need for these contributions arose because of the agency's inability to raise index-linked funds in the market in recent years.  The changed conditions prevailing in the markets &mdash; low inflation, high real interest rates etc. &mdash; meant that index-linked stock had become unattractive to the financial institutions and <Col N="563" /> the agency had, therefore, to rely disproportionately on costly short term borrowing to fund its operations.  Naturally, this had adverse effects on its financial position since its operations were geared to index-linked borrowings.</P>
    <P>Following a review of its operations in 1986, a special capital injection of up to £7 million was made available to the agency in order to place it on a firm financial footing.  It was also decided to allow the agency to borrow long term funds on a conventional basis and, if appropriate, to avail of foreign currency loans.  It was recognised, of course, that this change in the financing arrangements would have ongoing implications for the finances of the agency as it would not in the short term be able to match the cost of funds raised by it with the income derived from income-related loan payments.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the difference between the cost of conventional borrowing and what would be the cost of raising the same money by issuing index-linked bonds at a real interest rate of 4 per cent is paid by the Exchequer to the agency by way of an &ldquo;interest swop&rdquo; arrangement.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the interest swop arrangement is the same as if the State were to borrow money in the normal way and invest it in HFA index-linked bonds. Of course, such bonds would, as well as paying the 4 per cent interest, be increasing in value so that, on maturity, the real value would be maintained.  A similar arrangement will apply to the interest swop arrangement with the result that the increase in the value will ultimately accrue to the State at the end of the loan period.  The provision for the payment of the contribution to the agency on foot of the interest swop arrangement in 1987 is £9 million.  The provision in 1988 will be £11 million but it is expected that, on the basis of current interest and exchange rate trends and the increasing capacity of the agency to fund loans from their capital repayments, the size of the contribution will decrease gradually over the years.  Section 3 of the Bill validates contributions already made under the <Col N="564" /> interest swop arrangement and future contributions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the amendments proposed in the Bill are designed to provide for an increase in the statutory borrowing limit of the agency and to validate and provide for future contributions to the agency.  Without these changes, the agency could not continue its valuable contribution to the financing of house purchase loans for those on modest incomes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill essentially seeks to give statutory effect to the package of announcements which I made in May of last year on the future operation and funding of the Housing Finance Agency.  I announced then that the Government had made a number of decisions to enable the agency to continue to expand its house purchase funding activities.  They were that the agency should be permitted to raise long term funds by conventional borrowing in addition to index-linked borrowing, that foreign borrowing might also be used and that an interest swop arrangement which has been referred to by the Minister would be introduced to match the cost of funds raised by conventional borrowing with a return from income-related payments to borrowers.  It was our objective that the agency would, as a matter of urgency, move to put together a package to refinance their existing short term borrowing. The Government agreed to give a special grant of up to £7 million, in the event it was £6.9 million, to the agency to meet their accumulated losses on the short term borrowing and on bad debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period up to 1986, the local authorities took on a greater direct responsibility for the administration of the scheme.  It was our intention that the SDA loans, the direct council loans, and the HFA schemes would be more closely aligned and that the HFA would begin to provide funds for the local authorities to replace the draw from the local loans fund for SDA purposes, with the ultimate <Col N="565" /> objective of taking over all of that funding. The conclusion was that the agency should become a specialist agency for the funding, through the local authorities of all loans for persons of modest means.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not take the opportunity of outlining to the House to what extent that package has been put in place.  It was hailed at the time by the financial markets and the financial press as being a very important and fundamental restructuring of the HFA, a recognition of the contribution which they had made in the provision of funds for people of modest means to engage in house purchase.  Because of the relatively unattractive nature to the financial markets of the type of borrowing which the HFA could engage in, it was necessary to allow the agency to engage in conventional borrowing in a range of instruments, both domestic and foreign, so as to replace the short term borrowing which the agency had to engage in at that time.  As a recognition of that, the interest swop arrangement with the Government was to be put in place and the agency were to progressively reduce their exposure to short term borrowing and to replace it by conventional borrowing. My recollection at the time was that that would involve the replacement of £150 million or £160 million in short term borrowing funds.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister has not outlined to the House the extent to which the agency have been successful in replacing the short term borrowing with the longer term conventional borrowing and, most importantly, that he has not outlined whether the agency have been able to replace an amount of that short-term borrowing through more conventional instruments and in foreign currencies which was crucial to the decision of the Government at the time.  It was realised that there was available &mdash; it still is available &mdash; a substantial amount of foreign funding at far more attractive interest rates to institutions such as the HFA which would allow them to restructure their loan exposure and, over a period of time, to be able to offer loans through the local authorities to people at even <Col N="566" /> more attractive rates than was then possible. The Minister made no reference to the extent to which the agency have managed to engage in that task which was entrusted to them by the Government at the time, and specifically the extent to which the agency have been allowed or empowered to borrow in foreign currencies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the arrangement which the Minister of State has adverted to and which was announced by the Minister for the Environment on 27 October, I find it quite extraordinary that an announcement of a replacement of public capital allocation such as that could be made approximately a fortnight after the public capital programme estimate for 1988 had been published and without any reference to that arrangement being made in the public capital programme.  It has to be suggested that it was unfair to the House and to others to publish the public capital programme showing a figure of £155 million and a fortnight later to produce an entirely different picture.  The House deserves to be told whether the subsequent and fuller Books of Estimates for 1988, to be published early in the New Year, will contain the true position.</P>
    <P>Following the Minister's announcement, he was quoted in <i>The Irish Press</i> 28 October 1987 as saying the Housing Finance Agency scheme is not working. That constrasts very sharply with the admission by the Minister of State of the success of the agency and of the many thousands of people who have succeeded in housing themselves through the operation of the agency in the short number of years of its existence.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at some of the successes of the agency set up in 1982. Between 1982 and 1986, the agency had provided funds for 14,000 loans to enable people to house themselves and their families, at a total cost of £280 million. By the middle of 1986, at the time I announced the restructuring package, the agency had advanced moneys to allow <i>in toto</i> 16,000 families to borrow loans to house themselves at a total cost of £320 <Col N="567" /> million.  In that context, I fail to understand why the Minister for the Environment should have gratuitously and falsely suggested in a daily newspaper the day after his announcement that the agency was not working.</P>
    <P>I detect a regrettable trend on the part of the Minister for the Environment, whom I regret is not here to hear this criticism, to take every opportunity to denigrate, criticise and belittle anything that was put in place by a Government of which he was not a supporter.  His criticism of the agency in the daily newspapers, a criticism which could be regarded as very damaging to an agency which is obliged to go into the financial markets to seek funding to carry on their worth-while activities, was ill-founded and does not accord with the facts.  Perhaps what the Minister has in mind is the extraordinary fall-off in demand for local authority and other loans by people of modest means.  Perhaps he might have given more attention to the reasons for this fall-off in demand.</P>
    <P>In the annual report of the Housing Finance Agency for 1986 the chairman, in referring to the extent of the agency's loan activity, stated that a factor in the increased demand for loans in this period was the success of the £5,000 grant scheme for tenants and tenant purchasers who surrender their local authority dwellings to build or purchase houses for their own occupation.  It is significant that a scheme to stimulate housing demand and to release local authority housing for reallocation should have had, in the view of the agency, such an impact that the chairman felt he should advert to that as one of the main reasons for the success in the operation of the agency.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, when the Minister for the Environment decided to cast his gratuitous insult on the Housing Finance Agency, he might have been better employed considering the sharp fall-off of belief in the ability of people of modest means to fund the purchase of their own houses by the abolition by the same Minister of that £5,000 surrender grant at the same time as he abolished the £2,250 <Col N="568" /> grant for new houses, which was also available to people in a similar category, and at the same time as he abolished house improvement grants, which were available to people of all incomes for the purpose of improving and refurbishing and lifting the housing stock of the country. Perhaps he might also have had a somewhat guilty conscience about abolishing the time honoured, well-tested and successful method of providing SDA council and corporation loans at a fixed interest rate, which has always been one of the greatest attractions for people of modest means because they knew specifically the extent of their commitment from day one since the amount they borrowed was at a specific interest rate so they knew over the period of the loan exactly, to the penny, the amount of money that would be required to repay every month.  Perhaps the Minister was guilty about glossing over in his announcement the fact, as becomes apparent in the circular which he issued to the local authority, that this Government have scrapped all that, a system which has endured since before the state was founded.  SDA loans were being made available to people of modest income at set interest rates.  This has now been scrapped by this Government.  Those people are in future to be invited to realise, if they are lucky enough to get one of the loans from the drastically reduced fund for SDA loans now available, that they are going to have to suffer the worries of variable interest rates as do the people who have got house purchase loans from the building societies or other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>It is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that this move at this time will result in an apparent reduction of 3/4 per cent for people in that category.  That is far from the truth.  It is well known that interest rates generally oscillate, sometimes quite alarmingly.  There have occasionally been times when the SDA loan interest rates have been higher, just as at present they are higher than building society rates. But those times, fortunately from the point of view of the SDA borrower, have been in the minority.  It has much more <Col N="569" /> often been the case that the SDA loan, at set interest rates, is at a much more attractive rate than the building society rate.  The fact that the SDA interest rate has been temporarily higher than the building society rate has not deterred potential borrowers because of the certainty that the loan borrowed at that rate resulted in a fixed repayment over the lifetime of the loan, and there was confidence on the part of the borrower that during the majority of the time of borrowing that interest rate would be cheaper, often substantially cheaper, than the rate being charged by building societies and other institutions to people who had borrowed at the same time and are on variable rates.</P>
    <P>That certainty is a very important attraction for people on modest or restricted incomes.  But this has been scrapped in one sentence by the Government. Forcing that type of borrower into the variable interest rate system, scrapping the £5,000 grant and scrapping the £2,250 grant for new houses will result in an extraordinary downturn in the number of people in this category who will be prepared in the future to build and buy their own homes.  The inevitable consequence, not just in the long term but in the medium and short term, will be an increase once again in the numbers on the waiting lists for local authority houses.  The SDA loans and the Housing Finance Agency, the former introduced before the foundation of the State and the latter in the last five years, were to cater for those in the category between people who clearly were unable from their own resources to house themselves and had to turn to a public authority for public authority houses and those who were able to procure funding from the financial institutions to purchase their own housing.  Those at the lowest end of the margin of that group oscillate between being able to find public funding to fulfil their aspiration to buy their own house, in the certainty of their ability to repay that funding, and casting aside that aspiration and entering on to the local authority housing lists.  At the other end of that margin are the people who just <Col N="570" /> about qualify to borrow from public funding for house purchase and those who are successful in obtaining funding from an institution.  There is quite an amount of movement at this end of the margin between the financial institutions and the public money available.</P>
    <P>But at the lower end are the people who have to make the choice between putting themselves to the pin of their collar, scrimping and scraping to get local authority funding to meet the aspiration which is widely held, weighing up all the factors &mdash; the grant aid available, the exactitude of their payments and, in present times, relative job insecurity &mdash; or not entering into those commitments, not attempting to seek deposits, not entering upon the commitment of purchasing their own house but instead applying for local authority housing to be provided at 100 per cent cost to the taxpayer.  The people who have had to make that decision in the past will in the future feel that they have no option but to apply for a council or corporation house rather than risk taking on an SDA loan at variable interest rates.  In that context those same people who will be forced back on to the waiting lists for houses will find themselves with little prospect of being housed by the local authority because the list will grow inexorably longer and the provision of money for the building of local authority housing next year has been reduced by £37 million. What that means is that there is virtually no new money provided to allow new starts of council houses during 1988.</P>

      <P>The reduction of £37 million as between one year and the next in a local authority housing programme means that the £50 million will merely meet what is called &mdash; and the chairman will be familiar with the phrase &mdash; contractual commitments, existing housing contracts currently being carried out and which will not finish during 1987 but will spill over into 1988.  That will burn up all or 99 per cent of the allocation for council housing in 1988.  In any year, any capital provision for an ongoing programme such as this normally will allow something between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the total provision to be allocated to new starts.  The remainder of the allocation will be taken up in meeting commitments on contracts which were started during the previous year but which run on into the following financial year.  Consequently, to reduce a programme of £87 million by £37 million means that there will be just no new money for new council houses next year.  There will be, on the other hand, many new entrants on to the waiting list of people applying for council housing because of the disastrous policy of the Government in removing the grant incentives and in transferring the SDA loans on to variable interest rates and, indeed, something else that we shall move on to in a moment, applicants for those council loans will first be put through the hoop of trotting around to financial institutions to receive the requisite number of refusals before they will be given even the dignity of being considered for SDA loan purposes.</P>

      <P>The consequence of this &mdash; and I think that we can see it quite clearly in the trend running right through the Government's attitude towards housing, both private and public &mdash; is that the Government are trying to opt out of housing, of providing incentives or aids for people to build or buy their own houses, or building houses for those who are unable from within their own resources to house themselves.  Anybody who reads the circular which was issued to the local authorities on the day after the Minister's announcement dated 28 October, circular H10 87, will see clearly that the local authorities are told, for example, that &ldquo;the capital available to individual housing authorities for publicly funded house purchase loans in 1988 will be at a level not exceeding 60 per cent of the amount of the allocation now standing notified for the current year&rdquo;. That does not sit very lightly or easily with the oft professed commitment of the Minister or the Minister of State to support the publicly funded housing programme of the Government.  The circular goes on to say &mdash; and this, indeed, is the real kernel of the arrangement announced by the Minister &mdash; that where apparently the banks and building societies have taken on to provide funding for a number of people who would otherwise qualify for SDA or HSA loans, the indignity that these people are to be put <Col N="573" /> through is that anyone who in future applies to a local authority, to Wicklow or Dublin County Council or Offaly or Monaghan County Council for an SDA loan is not going to be allowed even to fill out an application form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are to be told &mdash; they are to be requested, which is a nicer way of saying that they are to be told &mdash; that they are to go first to a building society and/or to a bank and only if the person is refused a loan by both the building society and the bank may he then apply to the local authority for a loan. This is according to paragraph 2 of the circular.  It would be necessary for applicants who have been refused a loan by both the building society and the bank to produce documented evidence to this effect.</P>
      <P>The circular goes on to say that provided the authority are satisfied that the applicant has genuinely sought and been refused a loan suitable to his needs from a building society or bank, the local authority may then consider the application in the normal way.  That is proof positive of what I have been saying.  Those of us who through all our political life have understood that people under a certain income level, whom we would all regard as being of modest means, whom we would all admire when we see them seeking to raise the necessary funding to buy and provide houses for themselves and their families, now realise that those people are no longer to find that the support of the public system is available to them, or that there are available to them, provided they satisfy the income criteria, loans to enable them to buy their own houses which will be repayable at a standard set interest rate over the lifetime of the annuity.  Instead they are to be told that they are to visit the banks and building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the self-same people who, especially in relation to the category I have referred to at the upper end of the margins, have traditionally found themselves unable to get funding from the <Col N="574" /> banks or building societies precisely because of their modest incomes.  Indeed, I venture to suggest that in so far as the arrangement is successful in the State's shedding its responsibility to these people, in so far as it is successful in persuading banks or building societies to take on people from the categories that would previously have been entitled to SDA loans, what will be left to the State, as the future successful applicants for SDA loans, indeed at variable interest rates, will be the higher and potentially greater bad risks.  The portfolio of SDA loans in the future will have a much higher bad risk element within it.  It seems that those people will only get the availability of those SDA loans having been put through the extraordinary humiliation of having to go to institutions from whom they, and the institutions, know from the outset they have no prospect of receiving anything.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I have to conclude that the Government, looking at their attitude towards housing, their abolition of the grants, their demolition of the well tried SDA system, their reduction of the amount of money available for local authority housing in 1988, just have no comprehension of how to introduce or implement an integrated, multifaceted approach to housing.  All the things which have been put carefully in place over the last number of years, which resulted in this country having the shortest local authority housing waiting list for many years, which resulted in the Twenty-six Counties having a shorter total waiting list for council houses than the single London borough of Battersea, all that has been demolished, set aside and wrecked since March of this year.  The grant structure is gone, the SDA loans structure is gone, the £5,000 surrender scheme is gone.  All that is happening is a gradual and progressive withdrawal of the Government from the housing market, from the incentives, from the grant aid, from the loan funding and, indeed, on the other side, from providing incentives <Col N="575" /> to the private housing construction industry to provide private housing for sale to whatever market is left.</P>

      <P>The amalgamation of An Foras Taluntáis and ACOT was decided by the Government in the context of their overall plans to restore order to the public finances through rationalising State services, controlling Exchequer spending to the essential limits of cost-effectiveness and in particular ensuring co-ordination of the research, advisory and education services in agriculture.  The broad lines of the amalgamation will be contained in legislation which I will be introducing in the House during the present session.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied, given the staff reductions which can be achieved through the Government's redundancy scheme, or if necessary through redeployment, that an efficient and effective service can be provided on the basis of Exchequer funding provided in the Estimates.  The terms of the Government's voluntary redundancy scheme are currently being offered to all the staff of both bodies and, until that process has been completed, it is not appropriate to speculate on alternative provisions. <Col N="578" /> However, as I indicated to staff representatives when the Minister for Labour and I met them recently, it is not the Government's intention to implement compulsory redundancies in the matter.</P>

      <P>In view of the Government's statement that training for young farmers, product development and food research would be their priorities, how does the Minister propose to meet the figures outlined in the Book of Estimates which show a reduction of 1,000 jobs in that area?  Would the Minister agree that it will be impossible to meet that objective? I wish to refer to a statement which the Minister made which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> last week in which he seemed to have changed his previous position.  Can the Minister tell us the number of redundancies that will be required in AFT and ACOT under the Government's redundancy package, and can he also tell us his proposals for effecting other savings within that area? The Minister, his Department, the unions and staff seem to accept that the number of redundancies will not and <Col N="579" /> cannot exceed the figure of 350.  Does the Minister also agree that it is economic lunacy to remove staff who are productively engaged at present on behalf of the agricultural sector?</P>

      <P>Let me reply to most of the points made by the Deputy in what amounted more to a statement than to a question.  The Estimates do not make any reference to a figure of 1,000.  It is very important that that be put on the record of the House.  I did not make any statement of that kind and the Estimates did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I do not know, those who speculate on the figure do not know either.  Secondly, the Deputy does not seem to be prepared to take into account the possibility of redeployment. Until such time as we have obtained a response from those within ACOT, AFT and for that matter within the Department of Agriculture and Food to the voluntary redundancy provisions, it will not be possible to make an estimate of what the total numbers will be.  Thirdly, the Deputy is not taking into account that the authority will have a different role, will be self-financing and will give a very satisfactory service to the industry concerned. Let me instance the food industry. My colleague the Minister of State will have specific responsibility to deal with this industry.  The ability to raise revenue to provide those services is not being taken into account in the slide rule approach which has been referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that there is a risk involved in this but I can assure the Deputy that my colleagues and I will, if there is such a risk, try to minimise it. I want to make it quite clear, as I indicated to the representatives of the union when I met them with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, that there will be no compulsory redundancies.  We will have to await the response to the voluntary redundancy scheme.  After 1 January <Col N="580" /> each member of the staff of the authority, which will be established following the passage of legislation which will be introduced shortly in this House, will have security of employment.  Contrary to what was said in this House and elsewhere ACOT fully realised the amount which it was estimated they would raise through charges.  I have no doubt that the new authority will also be able to raise revenue in a balanced, modulated and fair way.</P>

      <P>A number of issues are raised in my Priority Question, No. 67, on which I asked the Minister to focus.  He has not done so in his broad reply.  What kind of planning has been done in relation to this merger?  I am aware that these organisations were asked in June of this year to prepare budgets for 1988 on the basis of a 10 per cent reduction.  Will the Minister give detailed responses to the questions I have raised in Priority Question No. 67, on the background by way of preparation, when it was done, if it is done yet and what are his plans?  In relation to that the question of numbers is highly relevant.  Can the Minister even at this stage project how many people be envisages either will be gone from AFT-ACOT or &mdash; take it the other way &mdash; will be required in AFT-ACOT after 1 January to deliver what he says will be an effective service to this country?  It is time there was some certainty on this.  If the Minister has put any thought into this issue he must have some idea as to what kind of numbers will be <Col N="582" /> required to implement a reasonable plan in this regard.</P>

That kind of speculation perhaps has given rise to apprehension. I am very anxious to reassure all concerned, directors and board at local and other levels that I understand the apprehension that occurs at a transitional stage but again I ask the House not to try to aggravate feelings by suggesting figures that were never suggested by me or anyone else.</P>

      <P>This affects not just the agricultural community but the whole community.  The two Ministers here recognise that this is a major area of job creation and development.  First, it seems that this was a decision imposed on the Minister by the Minister for Finance. How does the Minister intend to provide the excellent service he talks about with a reduction from £35 million to £20 million in the allocation?  Is it not correct that that reduction indicates that the job losses must be of the order of 1,000 because the Estimate is only £20 million? The facts speak for themselves as the Minister says.  Could he indicate how he can allow a 40 per cent reduction for staff in this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As far as the 1,000 are concerned I want to reassure him that that figure was not the focus at any time of a Government decision, as I have conveyed to the staff representatives, and it will not be the focus of a Government decision.  In relation to the priorities of the authority, which will be before this House for full <Col N="585" /> discussion shortly, within the overall objective of providing cost effective service, they are geared to meet the future demands of the industry.  The following priorities are indentified by the Government for the new authority &mdash; perhaps this is what Deputy O'Keeffe is referring to: training for young farmers, particularly new entrants to agriculture to enhance the knowledge base of those available.</P>

In relation to the questions which have just been addressed to me by Deputy Naughten, I would point out that while the level of R and D investment in this country generally is lower than anywhere in Europe, within the overall level of R and D investment Ireland is unique in spending the highest proportion of Government R and D expenditure on agricultural research and development. It amounts to 30.2 per cent.  I am anxious to ensure that this figure is maintained.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Mac Giolla's question, I was in the course of replying when I was interrupted.  The priorities of the new authority which the board will be asked to implement, bringing a programme back here within three months, are training for young farmers, particularly new entrants to agriculture and enhancing the knowledge base in agriculture to which the advisory service will be applied.  Everyone will agree that this is important.  There is also to be concentration on the post-farm stages of food production, food technology and food marketing; development of an integrated agri-food programme through a research centre combining the relevant scientific staff of the new authority and the IIRS to service the food industry particularly and securing greater involvement and participation, including financial, from commercial agriculture <Col N="591" /> and food sectors.  The House will recognise that we should approach these things in a measured way.  I am quite satisfied that, while everybody agrees that there is a need for a new co-ordinated authority with one central dynamic, we are approaching this in the correct way.  I am sure the new authority will do that.</P>

The Deputy asked what I propose to do with those who have to leave ACOT and AFT, as the Deputy put it, and I should like to make it clear to him, and the House, that nobody will have to leave. It is important that that is made clear. Deputy Stagg asked me how many redundancies will be achieved and I should like to tell him, and the House, that the answer to that question will not be known for at least ten days because the period of response from both authorities will not have expired until ten days time.  Until I know the number of officials opting for voluntary retirement I will not speculate as to what is likely to happen.  When I have the information I will use it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to lead the Minister to answer my question.  Will the Minister indicate what he has in mind, given all the planning he said he has done, to raise non-Exchequer resources for the new AFT-ACOT amalgamation next year?  The Minister must have a figure in mind because he cannot plan for the new body unless he has.  Will the Minister say if the new body which I take it, on the Minister's word, will be in place on 1 January next, will continue to be funded as is the normal practice on the basis of one-twelfth of their Estimates per month, the normal way of funding in the public and Civil Service?  If that is the case and we only get the 300 or 400 redundancies, which realistically is the number we are expecting in AFT, will the Minister accept that by 20 January AFT will be bankrupt because there will be no more money to pay the bills?  How does the Minister propose to proceed from there? If they get one-twelfth of their funding in January and 300 to 400 redundancies they cannot proceed beyond 20 January.  May I assume from the Minister's replies that he has now accepted the principle of <Col N="594" /> transferring money between the different subheads within the overall Estimate for Agriculture?  May I assume that with the extension of the voluntary redundancy scheme to all sections of the Civil Service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In order to reassure the Deputy I should like to tell her that I have had consultations with the directors of the outgoing authorities and that these are proving to be very fruitful.  I should like to express my appreciation to those people.  It will be their function, when the authority is put in place after the House passes the relevant legislation, to decide the programmes they wish to implement.  It will be their function to decide how and from what sources they will raise revenue. Surely the Deputy is not asking me to speculate on that.  The House will have an opportunity of reviewing this matter later.

I am satisfied &mdash; I hope the experience of Deputies will also demonstrate it &mdash; that that is exactly what ACOT have done.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, provides for the control of coursing by the Irish Coursing Club which operate under the general control and direction of Bord na gCon.  I am satisfied that both bodies make every effort to ensure that coursing meetings are, nowadays, conducted in such a way as to avoid abuses. I have no proposals at present to restrict coursing though I will keep the matter under regular review in consultation with Bord na gCon to ensure that the board and the club maintain proper supervision of coursing meetings and that they take steps to see that those who are responsible for the organisation and conduct of meetings comply fully with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that live coursing is a cruel and barbarous activity which the majority of people <Col N="600" /> would like to see stopped?  Will he consider introducing amending legislation to, at the very minimum, ban enclosed hare coursing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a personal level, I have apprehensions as to the nature of some activities in coursing.  However, I am satisfied, as my predecessor said to the Deputy four years ago, that Bord na gCon and the coursing clubs operate under licence and within the law to ensure that any unnecessary abuse or cruelty is avoided.  I will keep the matter under review but I know the Deputy is aware that my predecessor spoke on the subject in March 1987 and I should be allowed a few months to consider the matter considering my predecessor's position for four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that Bord na gCon supervise what goes on, will the Minister agree and accept that at every coursing meeting hares are torn to pieces by greyhounds?  It is a most cruel, unpleasant and barbaric activity and should be the subject of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already the subject of legislation in this House.  It is governed by specific legislation, some under the Wildlife Act for which the Minister for the Marine has responsibility. It is also covered under the Protection of Animals Act, 1965, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice. I am satisfied that these regulations are carefully monitored and implemented, even to the extent of licences being revoked where appropriate and that the House is discharging its responsibility in this matter.  If in the course of a further review it appears to me that it is necessary to introduce further legislation I will not be reluctant to introduce it.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter in the other House in 1974 and the answers do not change.  Will the Minister tell me the number of countries in Europe at the present time who have continued to allow enclosed park coursing?  Might I further <Col N="601" /> ask the Minister in relation to the close monitoring of the situation that is going on as to how this is accomplished if access to coursing meetings has been denied very often to the press and to those who wished to see coursing taking place and where photographers have been abused and asked to leave?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is, how adequate is the monitoring procedure where access is so totally inhibited?  I have a further question in relation to the different amendment Acts required. Does the Minister not agree that the only licences that have been revoked have been, in cases prepared under enormously difficult conditions, for people who have coursed hares again and again and that that ignores the point of the question, that the act of tearing a hare to pieces by greyhounds, witnessed by spectators including children and clergymen is in itself a despicable practice?</P>

I freely acknowledge that I have not addressed this question up to this time for a variety of reasons.  I invite the House and anyone interested in coursing and greyhound racing to make their views known to me by way of submissions.  When I am more fully aware of all the issues involved I will consider how best to regulate it.</P>

I hope that the approach here will be evenhanded and that those people seeking access to what many people regard as a legitimate recreational event in rural Ireland will seek access in a way which does not disrupt the right of others to engage in what they see as normal, social recreational activities.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that discussions had taken place in recent weeks.  I want to put it to the Minister that last June he indicated that he was opening discussions with the various <Col N="607" /> bodies and he hoped to announce a scheme when those discussions were completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  One of the things that was very obvious to me when I assumed ministerial responsibility in March was that something like this should have been done five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, two years ago or even last year.  It was not done during the past four or five years and there was no attempt to put such a scheme in place.  Therefore, I am not going to be blamed for the failure of the previous administration.</P>
      <P>From the beginning I sought to bring in an imaginative scheme which would be acceptable to the European Community &mdash; and hence the fact that there cannot be national aids &mdash; which would involve, by agreement, those who would benefit directly from such a scheme &mdash; the banks, the meat industry, the co-ops, the marts and the farmers.  Because, by definition, it involves agreement make a voluntary concerned, one cannot make a voluntary scheme compulsory.  I would have preferred if the agreement of the parties who will benefit from the farmers' activities had been available before this.  I want to repeat that this is long overdue.  I am satisfied that as a result of our consultations I have managed to convince, perhaps all of them at this point, of the merits of the scheme, but I cannot say when they will formally notify their agreement.  The Government, my colleagues and I have given priority to this scheme and it will be put in place.</P>
      <P>It will be evident from our actions in this area that the expansion of the beef cow herd will be promoted under this administration in a way it was not before. The numbers in the beef cow herd fell over the past four years in a dramatic and drastic way.  Something should have been done then.  I am doing it now and I am not going to accept criticism from the Opposition for doing what they failed to do.</P>

      <P>I want to give the <Col N="608" /> Minister some words of encouragement. I regard this problem as the national agricultural priority and I want to see a proper scheme put in place and not press announcements at three monthly intervals with nothing happening.</P>
      <P>I want to get some specific information from the Minister.  First, the Minister in one of the announcements said that there would be an Exchequer contribution of £1 million.  No such provision has been made in the 1988 Estimates.  I want the Minister to tell me about the Exchequer contribution.  Secondly, in relation to the banks, the Minister said that the thought he had now managed to convince all the parties &mdash; and I presume that means the banks.  Is he now saying that the banks have agreed to the proposal for the 2 per cent reduction in interest rates?  Thirdly, is the Minister saying that the co-ops have agreed to the proposal and is it not a fact that the proposal was put to the co-ops only in the last week or two?  Can the Minister say how far he has gone with the scheme and will he confirm that when he next announces the scheme, for the fourth time, that all negotiations will have been completed.  Can I take it <i>seriatim</i> through the various people and sources of revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should allow me a certain degree of intelligence. I find it difficult to remember all of the elements of each statement which has been made in this House today when I want to reply to them.  Regarding the Exchequer involvement, the Deputy on reflection, will consider that it would not be in the interests of anybody if I gave formal indications here and elsewhere as to the extent of that.  I am going to leave it at that and if the Deputy does not understand that I do not think that he understands the nature of this scheme.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances my Department's veterinary officers are in a position to respond within a few days to requests from heardowners for the results of <i>post mortem </i> examinations of TB reactors.

      <P>I assume that the Minister is aware that there are regular delays of two to four weeks involved and I ask him to investigate the matter further and to instruct the veterinary officers to give a verbal report to the farmers concerned. It is a very anxious time for farmers and they are in the position where they cannot sell or move their cattle.  Farmers are obliged to pay aprivate vet to take the report from the veterinary officer and hand it to the farmer.  This takes between two to four weeks and it is a regular practice.  I regard it as restrictive and a closed-shop type of practice and I ask the Minister to investigate it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the particular problem the Deputy has brought to my attention.  All animals slaughtered in meat export factories, including TB reactors, are subject to <i>post <Col N="611" /> mortem</i> examination by the Department's veterinary inspectors.  Any herd owner may request and be given, through his local district veterinary office, the results of the <i>post mortem</i> examination on his animals.  The <i>post mortem</i> results for reactors are normally notified to the district veterinary officers on return of the slaughter permits to the factory, normally within ten days.  The information also can be given by telephone on the day of slaughter, if special circumstances apply.  However in cases of doubt about the presence of TB in the carcase or where samples from clear animals have to be subject to detailed laboratory analysis, involving culture specimens and microscopic examination etc., the results may not be available until some time later.  I will take note of what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael policy document of October 1987 on bovine TB corresponds in large part to the approach that I outlined on 25 September to the bodies representing farmers, farming cooperatives and veterinary surgeons.  My proposals provide for a greater role in the schemes for representatives of farmers and veterinary surgeons by way of membership of a new management structure and for greater flexibility of decision-making by the establishment of an executive office and the appointment of a national manager.  This approach seems to me to offer the best prospect of farmers, veterinary practitioners and officials working constructively in a combined effort to accelerate the eradication of the disease.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in my speech on my Department's Estimates on 22 October public expenditure cuts were necessary this year to restore order to the public finances so that the economy could be put on the road to expansion and development.  The spending cuts in the Agriculture and Food Estimate were made by the Cabinet after detailed examination of all available options.  No sector was immune from the cuts but no sector stands to gain more than the farming community from the Government's policy to reduce overall public expenditure.</P>
      <P>The position is that there will be a 5 per cent cut only in gross terms in the Agriculture and Food Vote in 1988 with total spending on agriculture being £100 million up in 1988 that is £1,600 million against £1,500 million in 1987.</P>

I am glad to see he <Col N="614" /> has changed his tack a little on the redundancy package offered to people within his own Department and that he has been made to see the reality of what he was proposing to do a month ago.  The Minister has spoken about reductions in the region of 800 staff since 1982 in his own Department <i>vis-á-vis</i> the ACOT-AFT proposed cuts.  How many of these were redundancies or were they actual transfers to other areas within the Civil Service? I think it is untrue to say they were redundancies in themselves.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment we had been reviewing the extent of the Government's failure to support both private and public housing in the period since March last.  I hope we have established the fact of the abolition of the £5,000 surrender grant in conjuction with the abolition of the £2,250 new house grant, the house improvement grants and the drastic reduction in the proposed allocation for local authority capital housing finance for next year, together with the measures outlined in the Minister's speech today in introducing this Bill.  The Minister has explained that for the first time ever since before the State was founded the local authorities are going to be forced to withdraw from giving loans to people of modest income at a guaranteed interest rate, which provided a set standard identifiable repayment over the lifetime of the annuity.  Instead those people will be forced to seek funding from the financial institutions and only in the event of failure to gain approval will they be able to turn back to the local authority funding system.  However, even at that they will have to pay a variable interest rate on the loan.  I believe that the combination of those measures, compounded by the establishment of a variable interest rate for SDA loans will mean a sharp decline in the number of people of modest income who will feel it within their ability to take on the very onerous task of endeavouring to purchase their own house.  I should have said, before Question Time intervened, that this year we have witnessed a reduction of 10 per cent <Col N="649" /> in mortgage interest relief granted to people who have obtained loans for the purpose of building or buying their own house.  A real fear has been expressed by the financial institutions, the local authorities, the building industry, <i>et al,</i> that there is every likelihood that the mortgage interest relief will be reduced furthere and even abolished in the course of future budgets.  I cannot believe that the combination of all those measures can do otherwise than to force those who are uncertain as to their future employment prospects and who are on modest income to shy away from taking on the very definite burden of repaying house purchase loans over 20 years or more.  The combination of the measures which have been announced already and which the Minister is compounding today will have the effect of frightening off many people who would otherwise raise the necessary finance through these traditional methods or through the HFA loans.</P>
      <P>As I have mentioned in this House on several occasions, Ireland holds a record which we do not often speak about, of having the highest percentage of home ownership in the world &mdash; 84 per cent of Irish people either own or are in the process of buying their own houses.  The nearest country to us in those terms is one which has many other similarities to ours and that is New Zealand.  They are so proud of their percentage of home ownership, 3 per cent or 4 per cent below our figure, that they took the trouble to send their relevant Government Minister to Ireland in the past few years to see why we have been more successful than they were.  At that time we were able to outline to them the range of measures to which I have referred, all of which had gone a long way towards helping people to achieve the very definite and established desire of the Irish people to buy their own homes.  That is a desire that probably has been established through the evolution of our history and is one of the strongest desires of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government had recognised that desire and put in place a range of measures to ensure that anyone who aspired to that ideal would be facilitated, <Col N="650" /> aided and encouraged by the Government. Those measures have been rapidly and steadily dismantled since March of this year.  One of the more regrettable records of malperformance on the part of this Government has been in the area of housing, in direct house building, the funding of the housing agencies and encouragement for the private house building sector.</P>
    <P>Previous attempts have been made to gain commitments from the financial institutions and the banks to provide funding for people in these income categories. An arrangement was made with those institutions ten or 12 years ago when they promised to provide such funds but their delivery fell far short of their promise of commitment.  I would be interested to see to what extent the institutions, and especially the banks, will participate in the manner which has been outlined.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify another matter.  When his senior Minister announced this proposal he was reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 28 October 1987 as saying, in regard to the moneys which are now to be replaced through the involvement of the institutions and societies and which would be released from the public capital programme &mdash; £50 million to £55 million &mdash; that he wanted savings made to release capital to fund other projects. In the press release that was issued on the previous day the Minister said that these arrangements would enable the Government to reduce the public capital provision for local authority loans in 1988 while, at the same time, maintaining the availability of mortgage funds for house purchasers of modest means.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier to the apparent duplicity of the Government in publishing Estimates of the public capital programme just a fortnight before this announcement and showing the level of funding for house purchase loans as £155 million.  Quite an amount of confusion has been caused by the Minister informing <i>The Irish Press</i> that the moneys which would be replaced would be released to fund other capital projects.  That seems to be directly in contradiction to the press <Col N="651" /> release which seemed to suggest that it represents a further reduction in the public capital programme.  I would like the Minister to refer to this when he is replying and let us know whether the moneys are to be diverted or whether the result will be an overall further reduction in the public capital programme.  If the moneys are to be diverted, the Minister should clarify whether they will be diverted in the area of voted or non-voted public capital.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by the fact that the Minister of State today and the press release indicate that the <i>quid pro quo,</i> the consideration given by the institutions for becoming involved in this arrangement with the Department of the Environment, is that there is a form of limited guarantee given to the societies in the event of bad debts.  Such a guarantee implicitly carried a certain element of cost.  Societies do not look for a guarantee unless they expect they may be at the loss of money and the person giving the guarantee has to make some assumption that there will be some call on the guarantee. In the context of a range of loans and borrowers it is not only quite likely but it is 100 per cent certain that there will be an amount of default.  <i>The Irish Press</i> of 28 October stated that Deputy Flynn maintained that the new scheme would cost the Exchequer nothing.  How can a guarantee given to cover the cost of bad debts cost the Exchequer nothing? The Minister might explain when replying how the State can guarantee 50 per cent of bad debts at no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The income-related loans advanced by the Housing Finance Agency since their inception in 1982 are indicative of the level of fall-off in demand by people of modest income for funding for house purchase this year.  In 1982 they advanced £15 million; in 1983, £55 million; in 1984, £71 million; in 1985, £91 million and in 1986, £78 million, covering something in the order of 17,000 loans by the end of 1986.  Yet, in the first six months of 1987 the Housing Finance Agency had advanced £3.5 million only.  Is there any <Col N="652" /> greater indication of the failure of the Government's policy to provide income and incentives for people of modest means to purchase their own houses than that dramatic evaporation of demand in the course of six months?</P>
    <P>In fairness, there is obviously a higher takeup in the SDA loans.  For the first time this year, in accordance with the package I mentioned we put in place last year, the Housing Finance Agency have begun to provide some of the funding for SDA loans.  In 1985 £71 million was advanced and in 1986, £85 million. This year, for the first time the HFA began to provide some of the funding and in the first half of the year they provided £65 million.  But even if one combines the £65 million with the paltry £3.5 million and extends that sum to what presumably ought apply, for the remainder of 1987 it is quite clear that that comes to about £137 million advanced between the HFA and SDA annuity loans this year and based on the figures for the first six months as opposed to £163 million advanced through the same vehicles last year.  Remember that the demand for annuity loans is now likely to be substantially less because of the introduction from this month or next month onwards of variable interest rates.</P>
    <P>None of these items was adverted to by the Minister and there are five or six specific questions I would like him to answer.  First, to what extent has the loan switching arrangement been achieved from short term borrowing to conventional borrowing in a range of financial instruments which I mentioned, borrowing which the agency were empowered to undertake in the summer of 1986 so as to reduce the extent of their short term indebtedness from the £150 million or so which they had been exposed to?  Secondly, to what extent has that been achieved by utilising foreign funding at a more attractive interest rate than borrowing in domestic punts would result in?  Thirdly, if that has not been achieved to any substantial degree, why? Is there some prohibition or bar on the use of those foreign funds?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Fourthly, if the suggested reduction by the Minister of about £50 million in the public capital programme through the arrangement of utilising the other financial institutions comes in place, is that money to be switched to other capital projects and other capital Votes or is it to represent a further reduction in the public capital programme?  If it is to go to other capital Votes in fairness to the House and in view of the fact that the Estimates have been published for some weeks, the House ought to be informed as to where that additional funding is to go.  Fifthly, in relation to the guarantees being given by the Minister to the financial institutions, how can he say that these guarantees cost nothing and, lastly, in relation to the drastic and radical reduction in the provision of capital for local authority housing in 1987 of £37 million off a base of £87 million, would the Minister be in a position now to inform the House as to how many new local authority houses will be started next year?</P>
    <P>It is, all in all, a pretty sorry picture to see, in the space of eight months, the dismantling of a comprehensive housing policy which had achieved the lowest levels of applicants for local authority housing for a substantial length of time, which had put in place a range of loans attractive to a variety of people of modest means in different ways depending on their circumstances, which has put in place a range of grant-aided incentives to people of modest means to buy, build or improve their own houses and which had also put in place a singularly successful scheme to encourage people living in rented local authority dwellings or purchased local authority dwellings to surrender their dwellings in return for a special incentive grant to enable them to purchase a private sector house and release the local authority dwelling for reallocation to someone on the local authority housing list.  The combination of all those things had achieved the happy housing position we were in, in March of this year.  I invite the House to consider what these statistics will be and what the inevitable trend will be in March of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency was established six years ago to facilitate people who were above the income limit for an SDA loan and who found it difficult to get finance from a bank or a building society.  The original idea was to issue inflation linked mortgages to help people to buy homes in times of high inflation.  An inflation linked mortgage would have a low rate of interest but the amount of the loan outstanding would rise each year with inflation so that the repayments would also rise at this rate, leading to the repayments being a more stable percentage of income throughout the period of the mortgage.  The structure of the loan made it impossible for borrowers to benefit from the reduced interest rates in recent years.  This has lead to people paying sizeable amounts more than the conventional borrower had to pay.  This scheme was designed to work in times of high inflation but has proved itself unsuitable for today's economic climate.  This unsuitability has also been reflected in the difficulties experienced on a grand scale by the agency.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that if the Housing Finance Agency was to continue and if the idea of providing mortgages for low income borrowers was to survive, major changes would have to be made in the financing of the agency.  In this context the proposals contained in the Bill are to be welcomed.  Reservations must be expressed however about the section that empowers the Minister to contribute towards the cost of the agency.  Last year the agency was given a grant of £7 million, this year a grant of £9 million and for next year there is an estimated grant of £11 million.  It was always the aim that this agency should be self financing.  I would like to ask the Minister when he foresees this coming about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to welcome this new scheme in so far as it reduces substantially the public capital programme but I share a lot of the reservations expressed already about fluctuating interest rates of banks and building societies.  My own experience is that people in this position would <Col N="655" /> prefer to go to a local authority with a fixed rate of interest rather than to a bank or a building society at fluctuating rates.</P>
    <P>I would also like to share Deputy Boland's concern about the new scheme which involves a State guarantee and to ask the Minister to provide some indication of the predicted cost of this guarantee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister of State has been obliged to come in to do what really is the dirty work of his senior Minister in relation to this area because I know from his contributions in this House in the past that he has a genuine concern for the housing needs of people in our society.  Ministers of State have often been described as the mudguards of Ministers when it comes to the dirty work that has to be done, and there is a lot of dirty work being done by this Government.  This Minister, whom I know on a personal basis, has been sent in on a very distasteful task, no matter what way he read out the script and no matter how well it might have been written for him so many comments I wish to make are in no way personally directed towards him because, frankly, I do not hold him accountable for what is now being put before the House and I certainly do not hold him accountable for the housing circular which has been circulated to every local authority.  What it effectively means, from this new right, born again, fundamenta list Fianna Fáil Party which has discovered fiscal rectitude with a vengeance, is the dismantling of that elaborate and successful package of house financing measures to which Deputy Boland referred in his extensive contribution, and its replacement with a poor law-mentality means-tested system in the most humiliating way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Government party, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, is a member, are now asking people to prove not once but twice that they cannot get a loan, not just in a verbal sense in front of some young person across the counter in the local building society office <Col N="656" /> in a town or city around the country, but in writing, somebody else typing it out and the manager of the building society confirming it.</P>
    <P>I thought that the party of the people which Fianna Fáil so frequently hold themselves to be had moved a little away from that kind of Victorian, extraordinarily regressive attitude.  I am not surprised the Progressive Democrats have, in essence, welcomed this.  It falls into line with their philosophy that unless people are manifestly poor and on the side of the ditch they are not entitled to State support, that is, unless they want to get voluntary health cover to go to Blackrock Clinic; that is a different thing altogether.  In this instance, I am appalled that a Fianna Fáil Party which once upon a time in the thirties had a good record on housing, should be systematically putting, nail by nail, bolt by bolt, the lid firmly on the coffin of what was the most successful housing policy in the world, that is, measured by comparison with its achievements relative to other countries. As Deputy Boland has already stated, we ranked four or five points higher than our nearest competitor and that was the emerging state of New Zealand where there were not the historical housing pressures we had.  Yet, we rated higher than they did.  We had an extraordinarily high rate of 84 per cent of people owning their own homes.</P>
    <P>This House will have all the time it needs to unravel this, but we are being asked systematically to dismantle a major support of the Irish building industry which, in turn, provides substantial employment.  We are being asked to do that on the basis of a non-stated, non-explicit policy because the words contained in the Minister's speech do not reveal what is implied behind them.  To begin, the Housing Finance Agency with which this measure is concerned, but the housing market in general with which that agency was set up to deal, has to address the question of housing demand and to respond to demands for accommodation from those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to pay the full market value of a mortgage but who <Col N="657" /> are capable, provided they get some assistance with contributions from the State, of housing themselves.  If they do not have that assistance, they are obliged to fall back on the local authority for housing.</P>
    <P>On 14 October of this year, at the beginning of this session.  I put down two written questions to the Department of the Environment for reply.  The first question was to ask the Minister for the Environment regarding each local authority housing authority the present number of applicants on (a) the housing list, (b) the transfer list and (c) the senior citizens' housing list and if he would make a statement on the matter.  I got a comprehensive reply, for which I thank the Minister, covering every local authority by county and even going into every urban district council.  The total was 20,637 people who were not tenants of the local authority and who were looking for houses and a further 10,027 people were tenants but were looking for a transfer, presumably on grounds of need of extra accommodation or dissatisfaction with what they had.  Of those 20,637,25 per cent, or 4,511 to be precise, were senior citizens, so there was a special need for housing for the elderly, which has certain physical characteristics.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister and his officials for going to the trouble of providing these details.  They were so comprehensive, down to a place like Kinsale where they could tell me that 18 people were on the application list; nobody was looking for a transfer and eight of those 18 people were elderly.  I commend the Minister's efficiency and his Department's co-operation in relation to providing these statistics.</P>
    <P>I asked another question on the same day with the same degree of notice, which was as follows: to ask the Minister for the Environment if he would outline for each housing authority (a) the number of dwellings units to be completed in 1988, (b) the number of new starts to be commenced in 1988 and (c) the number of people expected to be employed in the achievement of (a) and (b) and if he would make a statement on the matter. <Col N="658" /> From the same Department that could tell me the number of elderly people in Kinsale and in every other little town who wanted a house, from this marvellous apparatus of efficiency down in the Custom House, what reply did I get to the second question?  The Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy G. Connolly said: &ldquo;The information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department at this stage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay this House and the Minister will have another day in which to reply but that reply to that question, in my knowledge of the Department, was at worst a lie and at best misleading.  That information was available and remains available in the Custom House.</P>

My record will show that I give good news and bad news.  I am not afraid to give bad news, but I resent the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; because it implies, as far as the officials of the Department of the Environment are concerned, something which I cannot accept.</P>

      <P>Let me say that at no stage did I imply the officials did not answer the question.  It is quite clear it is the Minister of State or the Minister who is responsible for parliamentary questions. I well know that.  I find it extraordinary that a Minister who has the resources of an extremely competent and well staffed Department could, on the one hand, go to the extraordinary detail of telling us <Col N="660" /> who was looking for houses which was information he could have got only from a local authority while on the other hand, when asked to give the other side of the equation, information which he could have got from the same local authority, all he could say was that the information requested was not available in his Department at that stage.  Both questions were answered on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>At that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware of the conventions which suggest that that answer could have gone on to be completed in a variety of ways.  It could have indicated that when the information became available it would be communicated or it could have suggested to the Deputy to put down a question at a later date.  The reply gave no such undertaking nor made no such suggestion.  Let me give the reason why.</P>
      <P>During the term of office of the previous Administration the local authorities constructed between 6,500 and 7,000 new dwelling units each year.  Therefore, with a waiting list of over 20,000, there is a three year demand for housing. Allowing for certain distortions in the figures, if we were to get it down to a two year demand it would amount to a very welcome reduction especially when we consider the housing crises of the sixties and early seventies.  That is the background against which any changes in the operation of the Housing Finance Agency have to be measured.</P>
      <P>I introduce that item at the outset of my contribution to this Second Stage debate because we cannot measure fully the intentions of what is proposed in this Bill until we look at the overall demand for housing.  It is correct to say that the nature of the demand for housing is changing, that in some respects it has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That refers only to new house starts.  It does not refer in any way to the management of the housing stock for which the Minister and the Department have overall responsibility.  There is possibly a three year demand for local authority <Col N="661" /> dwellings and 25 per cent of those who are looking for new houses are elderly people who possibly are physically incapacitated or disabled in some way and who cannot enjoy the comforts of the homes they presently occupy.  Despite that fact the Government have decided to reduce the capital provision from a figure of £87 million in 1987 to a figure of £50 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the reason I got a non-answer to my second question of 14 October was because the Minister is aware that there will be no new housing starts in any local authority area in 1988. He received this information from the local authorities.  It has been available for a long time to those in the Custom House. The Department of Finance sent a diktat to them, outlining the position.  Therefore, there will be no new house starts in 1988 and allowing for a construction period of 18 months which is perhaps being optimistic, there will be a massive fall-off in house completions in 1989. Therefore the present three year waiting list will be lengthened to a waiting period of perhaps four or four and a half years and in some local authority areas, five years.  Here, I am talking about national averages.  The figure will be higher in some areas than in others.</P>
    <P>It is against that background the Government are now coldly, systematically and knowingly embarking on a manufactured, engineered housing crisis despite what the Minister said in the reply which was that the information which was requested by me was not available in his Department at that stage. What we are witnessing now is a relaunching of the housing crisis by the Government.  This will hit the decks in one to two years' time and it will affect most those people who are not able to buy a house of their own.</P>
    <P>At present there are 250,000 unemployed and we are talking about an average of new house completions in the order of 6,500.  Those on low incomes cannot raise the money which would enable them to buy a house.  That is the base line from which we should start.  This rather innocuous Bill does not propose to <Col N="662" /> do very much.  It is in Victorian English which emanated from the former centre of colonial administration in this country. I have often wondered whether some of the ethos of that period has embedded itself deeply into the walls of the Customs House and whether at times, perhaps during the times of the occupation of the Ministerial office by certain people, it resurfaces again like dry-rot recurring to infect the minds, attitudes and hearts of those who are there.  Mind you, since most of those in the housing section are located in O'Connell Bridge House that analogy may not apply but perhaps it even transfers itself across the river.</P>
    <P>When the information is made available to me I will have to tell some of those who are on the waiting list of 20,000 and who are depending on a local authority house that that list is going to become longer as no new house starts are planned for 1988, that they will have to wait for at least one more year before they will be given a house and that their only alternative will be to try to buy houses of their own.  According to this circular they will have to prove positive to the satisfaction of the Minister, the finance office and the relevant local authority that not only are they not capable of obtaining a loan from a building society but that they are also unable to obtain a loan from a bank.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not trust the building societies, does he not accept their word? In a letter from a building society saying that Brian O'Brien or Mary Murphy, having regard to their level of incomes, are not eligible to qualify for a loan, not good enough?  Is the Irish Permanent Building Society distrusted by the officials in the Customs House and has a letter from one of their branch managers got to be corroborated by a letter from the bank manager of one of the AIB branches?  What kind of thinking produced this?  What kind of doubting Thomases exist in the Department or in the Department of Finance?  Why do two letters have to be obtained from financial institutions before, as Deputy Boland has said, a person can even fill out an application for a loan?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> The Minister is not exactly encouraging people to try to house themselves with the aid of a local authority loan.  No one likes being refused in respect of an application for a loan or for anything else. We are all human.  A person in need of housing needs as much encouragement and support as he or she can get.  The purchase of a house is the most important and largest financial transaction that most people will ever embark upon and this category particularly will be doing it for the first time.  Many of us who have been over the tracks in advising constituents or dealing with people professionally can handle all the uncertainties and all the doubts quite readily.  That is part of our in-course training so to speak, but a young or not so young couple who have never previously been down this road, by contrast with what their brothers and sisters may have experienced in the past two to three years, now realise suddenly that all support systems, the vast majority if not all of the measures, have been eroded, reduced, denied or cancelled. Not only is the support system significantly reduced and denied to them but in its place have been put two new round hoops through which they must jump and if they do not land on the other side with a letter from a building society and a bank they will not be eligible even to have their application entertained.</P>
    <P>Suppose a person comes to the Minister with a letter from a building society to the effect that, &ldquo;This person, Brian O Briain&rdquo;&mdash; for example &mdash;&ldquo;qualifies for a loan but, having regard to his income we can give him a loan of only £10,000 or £12,000&rdquo;, where is he then?  He has a letter which says that he qualifies for a loan, but what can one buy with £12,000 in a new house market?  Is he then eligible for a balancing loan from the SDA fund through the Housing Finance Agency or the local authority?  Suppose the manager of a building society refuses, saying he is too busy and tells the person to come back next week?  There is no provision for that in housing circular H10/87.  There is no guidance or direction to a young housing officer in a local authority as to <Col N="664" /> what might happen to somebody in the town of Birr who is told by the building society or a bank that he or she might qualify for a kind of loan, a full loan, £12,000 or thereabouts, but not a loan, sufficient to enable him to buy a house or to bring him within reach of closing the gap between the purchase price and the loan by way of either family support or a short term loan from the credit bank by way of an extended deposit.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is designed to give effect to this housing circular.  The housing circular is administrative gobbledygook at its worst.  All the major building societies are listed as well as the three banks who are eligible to certify that a person does not qualify for a loan. Nowhere is it indicated, justified or argued that one such letter will suffice. Two are needed.  This Government who promised us a better way in so many other ways are now telling people who are going to be driven into the private housing market by the systematic reduction in an engineered housing crisis because of the reduction on the local authority side, that instead of being eased off the present waiting list they will have to jump through two hoops.  There are enormous numbers of questions to which at least five housing officers in five local authorities to whom I have spoken have not been able to get answers from the Department of the Environment.  The circular has gone out in the name of Mr. Dolan.  The press release which accompanied it went out in the name of Mr. Macken.  Mr. Dolan is an assistant principal officer in the housing administration section.  Many of the answers that have been sought for clarification are simply not available because they are being referred to what is in the circular. This Bill, now at Second Stage, is designed to give effect to this circular. These questions need to be answered and the Minister will have ample time in which to answer them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a sleight-of-hand measure in that finances are being laundered to present the figures to the financial institutions in a manner that puts the best side <Col N="665" /> forward.  It is extraordinary how conscious this Government are of their own image in making things look as good as possible when they are talking to somebody else and how disastrous they are making matters for applicants for a loan when they are talking to potential recipients. On the one hand the beneficiaries of this con job, the people who are to get a loan, must humiliate themselves publicly with two letters stating that they do not qualify for a loan.  On the other hand the Government are trying to launder the figures and create the impression that by some extraordinary feat of fiscal management they have been able to reduce demand for public capital loans by an enormous amount.  They have done that by shifting it into the building societies and the banks.</P>
    <P>The banks benefit already from two types of securities in relation to a house loan.  They benefit from the fact that they hold the title deeds of the property.  No lending institution gives more than 90 per cent of a loan, and that is 90 per cent of their valuation of the property not necessarily of the purchase price.  Therefore, the bank as security No. 1 have the title deeds of the property as security against the loan they offer and there is a minimum margin of 10 per cent cash cover between what they lend out and what they hope to receive.  In some cases if they are uneasy that minimum is even higher in order to cover themselves against a fall-off in the purchase or retail price.  On top of that they limit the amount of money they will lend to anybody so as not to overstretch the capacity of an individual to repay, and it varies depending on the size of the income from two to 2.5 or three times the annual income of the person.  That annual income is not what the person says he is earning; it is what his P45 and P60 state he earned in the last year.  That is the security the banks and building societies already have.  In order to assist in the repayment of that mortgage the taxpayer, the PAYE worker who does not own property, through the taxation system gives an indirect subsidy called mortgage interest relief to a maximum <Col N="666" /> of around £3,800.  These securities are already in place.</P>
    <P>On top of that, this Government want to subsidise further and reduce the risk to building societies to 50 per cent of any loss they might experience by way of bad debt.  I do not have any fundamental objection to that approach.  In many respects it has a degree of efficiency which I welcome.  We should, however, recognise that the building societies and the banks are doing nobody any favours in relation to this measure.  In so far as risk exists at all, it is being taken out of the system by virtue of the guarantee. They will then take the cream of the applicants who have been driven off the local authority housing list because of the engineered housing crisis over which Fianna Fáil are presiding.  They will further reduce the risk so that at worst they will have a minimum amount of default, 50 per cent of which will be covered by us, the taxpayers and, at best, they will have no default at all.  We, the taxpayers &mdash; the banks do not rush to join us in that category &mdash; will then have to carry in the total portfolio of house loans under the local authority umbrella, the majority of bad risks, the majority of vulnerable people whose income, either because of its stability or because of its quantum size, is such that they will always be a risk in relation to defaulting on a mortgage. Why are we doing that?  What has happened in the housing market which has forced us to do it?</P>
    <P>I predict that in a year or two the Minister of State, if he is still an officeholder in that Department, will come into this House and say that the State cannot manage housing loans.  He will be supported by the Progressive Democrats, with all the fervour of the born-again New Right Adam Smith economists. Some genius will say that local authority house mortgagees have a higher percentage of default and failure than people who borrow from building societies; therefore, the State is inefficient and the private sector is efficient.  Some lunatic will make that argument within the next 18 months, on the basis of figures produced here in reply to questions which <Col N="667" /> will be fully answered.  There will be a further attack on local authority loans on the grounds that they are inefficient and basically do not work or that the housing officials in local authorities do not know how to run their affairs.  It will follow from that that somebody in O'Connell Bridge House will say the reason is that local authorities are not smart enough to run the system and that they should run it themselves.  That is the path we are following.</P>
    <P>The timescale in the housing market is of necessity slower and of a longer duration than in most other areas because of the time it takes to put together a response to a housing demand by the acquisition of land and the delivery of the finished object, the house.  I am not using words wildly.  Within the licence of parliamentary debate I am saying to the Minister of State and the Department of the Environment, who have an exemplary record in the area of housing, that they are now writing the first chapter of an engineered housing crisis, the harvest of which we will see in a year to two in varying degrees in different parts of the country.  Why?  It is designed to launder the figures.  There is no other reason.  It is in order to shift columns of money and accountability from one channel to another.  If ever people were entitled to say that the gnomes of Zurich, to use Harold Wilson's famous phrase, and those people responsible for high finance were manipulating people's lives in order to present a good set of fiscal figures, this is the occasion on which it could be said. This is not merely an amending Bill.  The Housing Finance Agency was opposed by Fianna Fáil in the first instance.  This is something fundamental which will have a very damaging effect on the morale and ability of local authority officials to run their affairs in the housing area.</P>
    <P>The way we have succeeded in housing our people has undoubtedly been one of the success stories of our society in recent times, especially in regard to the quality of houses we have provided.  Some would say we have overdone it, that we have <Col N="668" /> been profligate with local authority housing, that perhaps it is almost too good and that people do not deserve such good houses.  The last Minister to use that kind of argument was Deputy Robert Molloy, now born again in the Progressive Democrats. He brought in the ingenious idea of low-cost housing.  The Minister of State is no doubt familiar with the efficiency of low-cost housing.  It is so efficient that we now have to knock it down.  The repairs to it are more expensive than the original erection cost.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with low-cost housing in his own constituency in South Finglas.  It is so efficient that the end gable houses in parts of the Tolka valley have one door and no fireplace.  The were cheap because the Minister's party regard the people who live in them as being cheap as well. This Bill is cheap and this approach is cheap because the Government are looking for a con trick to satisfy people in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>That is not in accord with what were once the housing traditions of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am saddened that during the term of office of a Fianna Fáil Minister in O'Connell Bridge House they have retreated before the onslaught of the Department of Finance.  Everybody knows the banks are flush with cash.  This is designed to entice the banks into a secure market where there is adequate cover in terms of the title deeds to the property in question, in terms of the ratio of income to the gross lending and the percentage of the acquisition cost.  If there was not adequate cover as far as the banks or the Department of the Environment were concerned why not have let them step in and bridge that gap? That has not been the case and instead the Department are underwriting to the tune of 50 per cent of any losses they might suffer.  They are distorting the portfolio of loan applications in such a way that we will get the argument in a couple of years time, if not sooner, that local authorities are incapable of managing a loan portfolio because of the higher percentage of defaulters on local authority loans than on loans taken out with building societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The housing circular 10/87 was issued on 28 October.  I understand that there are approximately 32 major local housing authorities and it would not take a lot to rewrite that circular and issue it to them. There are many very good graduates in English and economics in the Custom House who could do that.  In the interests of the efficiency of the economy the Department should draft a set of criteria for applicants for local authority loans. Officials in local authorities on reading those guidelines on eligibility could assess whether a person was eligible for a local authority loan.  It would not be necessary then for an applicant to go down the street and knock up the agent of the Irish Permanent Building Society or approach a bank manager in whose branch they may not have an account.  The official in the local authority, having regard to the guidelines produced by the Department &mdash; I presume officials in the Department are capable of producing a set of guidelines and figures &mdash; could apply them in principle with decency and humanity to a housing applicant who has given up the ghost about getting a house from a local authority because of the cancellation of new starts in 1988.  If that person was told by an official of a local authority that he or she did not qualify they would have to take the only other course of action open to them, to hold out for a long time for a house.</P>
    <P>Is there some ideological objection to such an approach?  Is it that the Minister does not trust local authority officials to apply the guidelines?  If that is the case the Minister's colleague in the Department of Health has shown gay abandon in trusting the officials of health boards to apply a similar process in relation to medical cards.  Why is it that we do not apply the same logic to applicants for medical card.  Why is it that we do not get such applicants, before they fill up their forms, to go down the main street of Birr, Portlaoise or some other town to get a certificate from a bank manager or a building society to state that they are or they are not eligible for a loan?  A medical card holder arguably could cost the State more over a period of time than <Col N="670" /> might a local authority tenant or a local authority home loan.  The fiscal risk to the bureau in Merrion Street is not any different.  In terms of high finance the risk to the State is no greater.</P>
    <P>Is it the position that officials of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health do not talk to each other?  Once upon a time the Department of Health was located in the same building as the Department of the Environment, the Custom House.  How is it possible that some officials going in and out of the same hall door daily can trust local authority members and officials of health boards to apply criteria in relation to medical cards when across the corridor, or on another floor, other officials do not trust such people?  Why is it that those officials do not consider local authority members or officials capable of applying those criteria and that they must prove positive that a person is ineligible for a loan?  Why is it that they insist on getting a certificate from a building society?  In fact they do not trust building societies because they are also seeking a written certificate from a bank.  This is a patent nonsense and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>If &ldquo;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&rdquo; were to run this it would be humorous and TAM ratings might improve but the Department are making jokes of the lives of some people.  They are turning their hardship and horror into a type of perverse humour or, alternatively, the officials who drafted the circular I referred to have been so terrorised by the Department of Finance that they will agree to anything.  What has happened in the Department of the Environment that suddenly has put them in the position that they know something about the banks or the building societies that we do not?  Is there a crisis or are those institutions not run properly?</P>
    <P>In each local authority a person could produce a tax certificate as proof when applying for a loan but now applicants must produce two further pieces of paper.  There will have to be somebody to confirm that the additional pieces of paper have been submitted.  When the <Col N="671" /> auditors from the Department of the Environment carry out their annual checks they will have to ensure that not only were the loans properly given out but that the applicants were properly qualified.  They will have to check that all pieces of paper were submitted.  This will result in more demands on local authority staff.  We must remember that local authorities will be part of the 15,000 redundancies, which for the time being are voluntary, being sought by the Government.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government are reducing the number of personnel in local authorities the Department are giving them extra unnecessary work.  There is no justification for that.  It is clear that there is some other reason involved in the Department making it as difficult as possible for people to get loans.  If obstacles are put in the way of a race we are doing one of two things, trying to slow the person down or trying to see how high that person can jump.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, does not want to see how high the homeless can jump and I would not for one moment impute that motive to him but the circular will discourage, slow down, prevent and dishearten people who might otherwise apply for a loan from a local authority.  When we strip away the verbiage, when we strip away the con job of moving the figures from one column to the other, and the laundering of the public capital borrowing programme we will find that that is the motivation behind the circular.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the circular was not drafted by a person who attended an organisation and management course.  It was not cleared by the consultants on efficiency within the public service and it certainly was not drawn up by a systems analyst.  Such officials did exist in the Department of the Environment and it was normal in the past to consult with such professionals on these matters. Local authorities should have been consulted to ensure that difficult jobs were not made more difficult.</P>
    <P>There was no reference to this matter <Col N="672" /> in the Minister's speech.  It seems that not only have the Department of the Environment reneged on the local authority waiting list which consists of 20,000 people, reneged on the 10,000 people on the transfer waiting list and on the 4,000 people of the 20,000 who are elderly and need special housing.  I wonder why the Department have decided to introduce a measure which will make it more difficult for people to get local authority loans at a time when they have reduced the supply of local authority houses to one category of people.  They are forcing people to traipse up and down a town to get a letter from a bank or a building society &mdash; in some cases both letters.  I wonder why it is necessary to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me an opportunity of raising this very important matter which has affected many people since early November as it is the first month in which it applies.  I do not intend to raise the matter in a party political way as I am sure the Minister is equally concerned about it.</P>
      <P>A number of people have received renewal notices for driving licences and, in the case of Dublin Corporation &mdash; and which I am sure applies throughout the country &mdash; a list has been sent out to applicants giving details of those who are disqualified from holding a driving licence.  There is a second list of people who can be qualified provided they submit a certificate of fitness by their doctor.  The latter list includes people suffering from cardio-vascular disease who may be granted a licence provided they submit a certificate of fitness from their doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of people on the first list who can no longer qualify for a driving licence, no matter how long they have held one previously.  At the top of that list are people suffering from <Col N="673" /> epilepsy.  Chronic alcoholics have also been disqualified from holding a licence even if they have been dry for a considerable period.  The list also includes people who are dependent on certain drugs and those who are suffering from severe renal deficiency.  I can understand the difficulty in relation to people suffering from severe renal deficiency and tests should have been introduced in this area long ago.  However, I cannot understand why a chronic alcoholic who has been dry for a considerable period &mdash; maybe ten years &mdash; should be disqualified from driving as he may never touch a drink again.</P>
    <P>I have more than a passing interest in epilepsy but I will not go into it here. Some people are epileptics but they suffer from it in their sleep.  It does not affect them when they are awake.  There is another group who never suffered from epilepsy throughout their life but, for some unknown reason, it manifests itself in later life.  Once it is diagnosed and treated the person may never have an epileptic turn again.  It can be controlled by drugs and many people have not had an epileptic fit for more than two years.  The form sent out by Dublin Corporation does not say that they can submit a certificate of fitness from their doctor and thereby qualify for a driving licence.  I understand that the Minister and his Department are considering changes in this regard and the primary change should be in relation to epileptics who can submit a letter from a neurologist to say that he or she has been treating the person who is now free of attacks and is a fit person to hold a driving licence.  The same applies in the case of a chronic alcoholic who is able to supply a letter from a specialist to the effect that he has been dry for so many years.</P>
    <P>Many married women suffer from epilepsy but they take the necessary medication which does not cause any side effects.  The epilepsy may never manifest itself and they are able to drive their children to and from school and do the shopping quite safely.  An insurance company will give cover without any problem <Col N="674" /> because it is not a serious illness and does not give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>This restriction does not just apply to those applying for driving licence but to those who have held them for a number of years.  I ask the Minister to change the regulations and I expect a favourable hearing because I understand the Department are reviewing the matter.  As I said, I raise the matter in a non-controversial and non-political way and I ask for a reasonable response as it affects many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations were made on 25 October 1986 giving effect to an EC Directive on driver licensing.  The directive imposes minimum requirements of physical and mental fitness to be complied with before driving licences may be granted.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise at the outset that, before the regulations were introduced, they were fully vetted by the EC Commission and endorsed by them as meeting these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet the Directive's requirements as to the absolute prohibition on granting of licences in certain cases, the regulations specify diseases and disabilities which disqualify the sufferer from holding a driving licence.  An exemption from this absolute prohibition, as permitted under the Directive, applies to persons who held a licence in the five year period to 1 January 1983 &mdash; the operative date of the Directive.  The disqualifying diseases and disabilities specified are diplopia, defective binocular vision, epilepsy, chronic alcoholism, dependence on psycho-active drugs and severe renal deficiency.  The total prohibition applies only where a person is currently suffering <Col N="675" /> from the specified disease or disability. In the case of any applicant for a driving licence who has suffered in the past from epilepsy or chronic alcoholism, a certificate of fitness, which is based on a medical report, must be obtained before the licence can be granted.</P>
    <P>In cases of epilepsy, fitness to drive cannot be certified if the application relates to a licence for the larger vehicles &mdash; lorries and buses.  Where the application relates to smaller vehicles &mdash; cars and light vans, agricultural tractors and motor cycles &mdash; fitness to drive may be certified&mdash; (a) where the applicant has not suffered an epileptic attack for at least two years and (b) for a limited period so as to ensure that he remains under medical supervision.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person who has suffered in the past from chronic alcoholism, fitness to drive may only be certified for a limited period so as to ensure that the person remains under medical supervision.</P>
    <P>The regulations generally do not give rise to difficulty for the vast majority of licence applicants.  I recognise, however, that interpretation of both the legal and procedural aspects has caused some difficulties in a relatively small number of cases.  So far as epilepsy is concerned, officers of my Department, in conjunction with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health, have met representatives of the Irish Epilepsy Association.  At this meeting questions as to when a person might be regarded as suffering from, or having suffered from epilepsy were discussed at some length, along with other relevant matters, including the position of persons whose condition is controlled by medication. As a result of this meeting, the association submitted to my Department for consideration a draft of an advisory leaflet on the practical effects of the regulations which they propose to issue to their members.  The Department hopes to respond to the association fairly soon.</P>
    <P>In relation to severe renal deficiency, my Department have already had similar discussions with representatives of the <Col N="676" /> Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Medical Organisation.  The principal matters at issue were what should be regarded as severe renal deficiency and the position of persons with a controlled renal condition.  Officers of my Department had a further meeting with those representatives yesterday.  At this meeting, in the light of a formal submission submitted on behalf of both organisations, my Department have agreed that severe renal deficiency can be interpreted as a deficiency so severe that the driving of a vehicle by the person concerned would be a source of danger to himself and other road users.  That is very fair.</P>
    <P>Before being granted a driving licence, a person suffering from a disease of the genito-urinary system is obliged to obtain from my Department a certificate of fitness which is granted on foot of a medical report.  The Department have agreed that it is open to the doctor concerned to certify a person suffering from renal deficiency as being fit to drive provided that person's condition is being controlled or corrected by appropriate means, including dialysis, and is such that in the doctor's opinion the driving of a vehicle by the person would not be a source of danger to himself or other road users.  The representative of both organisations have undertaken that they will take appropriate steps to bring the agreed position to the notice of kidney patients and their medical advisers.</P>
    <P>The operation of the EC directive concerned has been under review by the Commission, in consultation with member states.  My Department will have further consultations with interested bodies in Ireland in the event of any proposals being made by the Commission for amendments to the directive.  I can assure the House that as sympathetic approach as possible is being adopted by my Department, subject to the constraints imposed by the requirements of the directive. It has probably been spelled out in a reasonable way for Deputy Mitchell and some of the fears expressed by him can be set aside.  If the Deputy requires <Col N="677" /> any further information I and my Department will be delighted to accommodate him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner in which the Minister has dealt with this.  Will the Minister ensure that the information is communicated to Dublin Corporation and to other licensing authorities?  Am I to understand that a person who has epilepsy but who can get a certificate from his or her doctor that he or she has not suffered an attack <Col N="678" /> for two years can have a driving licence? Will the Minister agree that perhaps the word &ldquo;suffer&rdquo; is the word which needs a bit more analysis and definition for other applicants?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal to reclassify all existing less severely handicapped and mountain sheep areas to more severely handicapped status was made to the EC Commission on 4 February last.  No proposal was made to extend the boundaries of the existing disadvantaged areas.  The Commission indicated that the proposed across the board change did not meet the requirement in the basic EC Directive that the level of compensatory allowances (headage payments) should be <Col N="621" /> fixed in accordance with the degree of severity of the permanent natural handicaps. This ruled out the payment of uniform rates of headage grants throughout all our disadvantaged areas and so the proposal was not acceptable to the Commission.</P>
    <P>In the light of the reply from the Commission, the Government has approved a modification of the February proposal to provide for a restructuring of the disadvantaged areas scheme in a manner that should meet the objections raised by the Commission.  The new proposal was lodged with the Commission on 4 November. It includes a case for improved FEOGA financing of the disadvantaged areas scheme as operated here and in addition deals with the question of extending the boundaries.  The improved financing arrangement sought would enable the proposed revisions to the schemes to be financed without imposing any additional burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The situation in the various areas mentioned by Deputies will be taken fully into account in discussions with the Commission on this matter.  It is not possible to be more specific in regard to individual areas at this stage but I can assure the Deputies that the case made for each area will be carefully examined before final decisions are taken.</P>

      <P>Ireland has already taken the necessary measures to comply with the EC hormones ban.  While some transitional measures may be needed to allow for trade in animals and the meat of animals legally implanted before 1 January 1988, it is envisaged that the ban on the use of these substances will remain in place.</P>
      <P>The EC decision to ban the use of hormones was taken in response to consumer concern.  Its adoption here clearly enhances our image as producers of good quality, residue free food and has also ensured our continued access to all Community markets.</P>

      <P>There is no particular delay in cattle headage inspections in west Cavan and, indeed, at this stage some 86 per cent of those inspections have been completed as compared with only 75 per cent at the same time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>District electoral divisions are <Col N="629" /> inspected in rotation each year so that every area is dealt with fairly over a number of years.  As it happens, the turn of Belturbet electoral division to be inspected in 1987 came up only recently but I understand that inspections in that electoral division will be completed before the end of next week.</P>
    <P>Factory dockets are not being accepted in Cavan or any other county this year for heifers sent for slaughter before inspection.  This concession was given in 1985 and 1986 because of the extremely poor weather which persisted during both of those years but cannot be justified in 1987 because the weather this year has been generally good.</P>

      <P>The estimated value of the schemes is difficult to assess because they operated in conjuction with industry funded schemes and returns are dispersed over all users and over an extended period of time.

      <P>In the comprehensive Commission proposals put before GATT in regard to the agricultural negotiations in the Uruguay Round, it is indicated that, in the longer term, measures to get production into line with what markets can absorb could be backed up by aid to farmers to offset any loss of earnings from market support.  Given the present oversupply of many products on world markets and the inevitability of some stabilising and market balancing measures, it was prudent for the Commission in its proposals to GATT to include a provision <Col N="634" /> regarding the safeguarding of producers' incomes.</P>
      <P>A proposal on direct income aids to producers is, of course, before the Council of Ministers.  It will be my endeavour to ensure that any decision adopted by the Council in the matter will be in the long term interests of Irish agriculture, and that, taken together with future Community decisions on such matters as set aside and rural development generally, it will provide adequate support and a range of options to farmers in this country.</P>

The EC contribution of 136p per gallon will continue to be paid.  Given the marginal nature of the subsidy reduction, it is not expected that the withdrawal of the Exchequer contribution will lead to a drop in consumption under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The vocational preparation and training programmes are supported on a year to year basis by the European Social Fund.  The number of schools that will be permitted to offer vocational preparation and training courses from September 1988 will depend on the level of support available from the European Social Fund, sanction for which will not be received until May-June 1988. Development of the vocational preparation and training programmes will focus on devising special measures to attract priority one pupils to courses.</P>

      <P>In circular letter M57-87 which issued in August 1987, the authorities of post primary schools were advised that pupils who have sat the leaving certificate examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils to repeat the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1987-88 subject to the payment of a repeat course fee of £100 per pupil <Col N="647" /> and a repeat examination fee of £100. Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card will be exempted from the payment of the course fee and will only be required to pay the standard examination entry fee of £33 on production of the medical card for noting by the school authorities.  The arrangements for the 1988-89 school year are due to be finalised shortly and to be notified to the school authorities by circular letter, a copy of which will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The children in question do not qualify for free school transport because they live less than two miles from Ballingar national school.  Under the terms of the school transport scheme, they may be allowed concessionary fare paying facilities to that school provided that there is spare accommodation available on the service and that no extra State cost is incurred in facilitating them.  Fare-paying tickets are issued by the local CIE office on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis each term.  All spare seats had been allocated when this family's application was received for the current school term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pupil referred to by the Deputy lives within three miles of Oldcastle post-primary school and is, therefore, ineligible for school transport, under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme.  Concessionary <Col N="648" /> fare-paying transport is the most which may be offered in this case.  However, no application for a term ticket has been received in the local CIE office from the pupil in question.  The medical card concession does not apply in the case of ineligible pupils.</P>
