      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the steps, if any, he has taken to ensure that the proposed development at the Port and Docks site in Dublin 1 will include a centre devoted to culture and the arts; if he will make provision to have incorporated in that centre a gallery of modern art and a museum to display the National Folk collection now stored in Daingean, County Offaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A feasibility study has now been completed on the possibility of developing an Exhibition Centre, at the Custom House Docks site, which would house a National Folk Museum, a Gallery of Modern Art as well as a Science and Technology Museum.  The study is being examined by my Department, in consultation with the Custom House Docks Development Authority and other appropriate agencies.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the present budgetary situation this examination will have to have particular regard to the financial implications of any such development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the idea is very much favoured by the Custom House Docks Authority because of the added attraction for commercial developments?  Is the Taoiseach personally in favour of such a development and will he be seeking progress on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would certainly favour any development which would add to the artistic and cultural environment of our capital city, but the Deputy will be aware of the budgetary constraints which apply and any project of this nature would have to be seriously regarded in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach considering the possibility of having this incorporated in whatever commercial development takes place there?  It might possibly be done at no cost to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The modern phrase is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I would very much like to have various cultural facilities added to our capital city if this could be done at no cost to the Exchequer, but that is not always possible or feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuing the idea of a cheap lunch, will the Taoiseach be seeking to involve whatever commercial developments locate there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could have these facilities provided by some generous commercial enterprise that would be very welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate the time-table for the unveiling of the development plans for the Custom House Docks site and when they will be available to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under pressure from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, the time-scale has been shortened very considerably and I do not think it will be very long before positive action will be unveiled for the benefit <Col N="1437" /> of all those interested and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the provision of 35 per cent of the net proceeds of the national lottery, given that the lottery is proving to be more successful than expected, would provide the necessary resources to finance the kind of development referred to in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possible source of funding for various artistic and cultural developments, but I would remind the Deputy and many others who are voicing opinions about what should be done with the lottery funds that it is not a little pot of gold at the bottom of the garden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that far from voicing opinions about what might be done, I am referring to the Government decision to allocate 35 per cent of the net proceeds to culture and the arts and the Irish language?  Does he not accept that this decision &mdash; which I take it he does not propose to rescind &mdash; will provide the necessary resources?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the budget allocation to the Council for the Status of Women this year; when such moneys will be paid; and, if a new headquarters has, or will be, given to the council by next September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The council's allocation for 1987 has been fixed at £88,000. In addition the council will employ three people under the social employment scheme at a cost to the Exchequer of almost £11,000.  This compares with a total grant last year of £88,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> The council have already received £33,762 of their total allocation this year. Future payments will, as usual, be made on the basis of expenditure submissions from the council.</P>
    <P>Inquiries have established that there is no suitable, vacant, State-owned accommodation available for the council.  As there are no funds available in current financial circumstances for other accommodation, the likelihood is that the council will continue in their existing accommodation for the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased the council were finally told last Friday evening and again this morning what their financial future will be.  Why were the Office of Public Works showing the council various public buildings during the past three weeks if it was not intended to make a public headquarters available for them, given that they will be homeless from September when their lease runs out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Government are asking the Council for the Status of Women to house the documentation, library resources and records from the now abolished Department of Women's Affairs but their present premises presents such a fire hazard that delegates from over 50 women's organisations can no longer meet there.  I put it to the Taoiseach it is an absolute disgrace that such a situation should be allowed in respect of a group who represent over 50 women's organisations, many of whom work in a voluntary capacity and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach expect the Council for the Status of Women not only to survive but to expand as their programme warrants?  Is the <Col N="1439" /> Taoiseach aware that we are talking about over 50 per cent of the population?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that the council will receive £88,000 this year and in addition will be entitled to employ three people under the social employment scheme.  That is an indication of the Government's approval of the work undertaken by the council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  The following Ministers are members of local authorities and/or health boards:</P>
      <P>Minister for the Environment, Mr. Padraig Flynn; Minister for Labour, Mr. Bertie Ahern; Minister for Defence, Mr. Michael J. Noonan; Minister for Education, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>All members of the Government concerned have made arrangements to resign from the relevant local bodies in the near future.</P>

    <P>In response to a question on 7 April last I said that it has been a general principle for many years that Ministers and Ministers of State should, as soon as conveniently possible after appointment, resign from membership of any local authority or subordinate body to which they belong, unless only a short time remains of their term of office or other special considerations apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would cover a variety of circumstances, as Deputy Barrett knows from his period of office as Chief Whip of the out-going Government. Many of the members of his and the other party in that Government never resigned their seats on local authorities at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that Government Ministers and Ministers of State would at the earliest possible moment, subject to special circumstances prevailing and to the convenience of the affairs of the local authorities, resign their positions on local authorities but, as the Deputy knows and probably nobody knows better than he, many circumstances are involved in this situation. The general position is that Ministers of Government and Ministers of State will resign as soon as this can be done conveniently having regard to all the circumstances involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 31 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 September last the then Government issued a statement containing guidelines in relation to pay for 1987 for both the private and public sectors.  These guidelines continue to have force.  They do not in any way conflict with the decisions in relation to public service pay which the Minister for Finance announced in the budget speech.  The implications of those decisions for existing negotiating machinery have been the subject of discussions between the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and the Public Services Committee of Congress.  At that meeting it was decided to await the outcome of the meeting which the Taoiseach and other members of the Government were to have with the Executive Council of Congress.  Subsequently the Taoiseach and other members of the Government met the executive council on 15 April and 29 April to discuss the Congress plan for <Col N="1444" /> growth and economic recovery that would cover jobs, tax reform, public finance, pay and social services.</P>
    <P>The Joint Government/ICTU press statement issued after the meeting on 29 April gave details of the agreement that was reached on a format for future discussions as follows:</P>
    <P>A Ministerial/ICTU group will meet monthly to review progress and make decisions on issues where necessary.</P>
    <P>Three joint Government/ICTU working parties will be established to deal with</P>
    <P>(1)  Employment and Development Measures.</P>
    <P>(2)  Taxation.</P>
    <P>(3)  Social Policy.</P>
    <P>Pay and other income matters will be dealt with by the Ministerial/ICTU group.</P>
    <P>The working parties will be chaired and serviced by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The membership on the Government side will be at Secretary level.  The membership on ICTU's side will be Executive Council members and Congress staff.</P>
    <P>The working parties would meet at least weekly and report to the monthly meetings of the Ministerial/ICTU group.  It is envisaged that the discussions would be completed by end-September.</P>
    <P>The Government attach considerable importance to the success of these discussions and of the similar meetings which are being arranged with the other social partners.  Deputies will appreciate that in view of the very delicate nature of these discussions it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If one takes the pay guidelines together <Col N="1445" /> with the allowance of free electricity units as negotiated in the ESB agreement, the pay award is between 6.5 and 7 per cent in real terms.  In view of that, could the Minister state the Government's position on the guidelines being topped up by benefit in kind awards like free telephones, free lottery tickets, no requirement to pay service charges for local authority workers?  What is the Government's position on the guidelines being topped up to the tune of 3 per cent or 3.5 per cent by benefit in kind across the public sector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 22, 40 and Priority Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The amount of VAT tax remitted or passed as irrecoverable in the year ended 31 December 1985, the latest year for which information is available, was £378,692.  The corresponding figures for the two earlier years was £222,257 in 1984 and £453,806 in 1983.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to newspaper reports concerning the alleged write-off of VAT arrears.  I appreciate that this may have caused disquiet particularly among the general body of VAT taxpayers who submit their VAT returns and account for their liabilities according to the strict requirements of the law.  I should like to assure the House and the general body of compliant taxpayers that there has been no writing-off of VAT arrears by the Revenue Commissioners except where the tax is formally remitted or deemed to be irrecoverable.</P>
      <P>An internal office circular of the Revenue Commissioners has been quoted in support of the contention that there has been large-scale VAT write-offs. However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the circular in question which was addressed to VAT inspectors is concerned with the system of periodic visiting of VAT taxpayers for the purpose of checking that they have correctly accounted for tax and kept proper records.  The circular is aimed at securing the most efficient operation of that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general scheme of visiting aims at ensuring that the bulk of taxpayers are visited on average once every three years. The circular reflects this in putting forward <Col N="1452" /> as a general guideline the point that the period covered by the review of past compliance by a trader should not extend further back than the current and two previous years.  Since the circular provides, as it says, a general guideline inspectors may, and do if the circumstances warrant it in particular cases, extend their inquiries back beyond the two previous years and, if necessary raise estimated assessments.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the circular referred to has no bearing on the VAT tax collection operations of the Collector-General who is the officer concerned with the formal remission or writing-off, subject to the approval of the Revenue Commissioners, and under the surveillance of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee, of tax deemed to be irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>The circular in question was issued by the Revenue Commissioners in exercise of their responsibilities for the care and management of VAT which is entrusted to them under the VAT Acts.  It was not received in or considered by the Department of Finance and there was no obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to consult that Department on what was purely an administrative matter.</P>
    <P>The latest information in relation to the amount of VAT outstanding is contained in pages XIX to XXI of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 1985 Appropriation Accounts, a copy of which is in the Library.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing arrears of VAT with a view to collection.  In this connection the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the recent appointment of twelve new revenue sheriffs will make an important contribution towards achieving the objective of collecting such arrears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying the Minister referred to a circular issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Can he indicate when that circular was issued and whether the VAT inspectors operated the guidelines outlined in that circular on <Col N="1453" /> a verbal basis prior to its formal issuance? Might I ask also if, in that circular, it was indicated to tax officials or VAT inspectors that if they felt amounts of VAT were not recoverable they should not be entered as an estimate?  Could he indicate to what extent that practice was pursued, in other words, to what extent VAT was written off before being listed as arrears?</P>

      <P>There was a previous circular issued in February 1985.  Briefly what is contained in the circular is a reiteration of what is, in effect, Revenue policy in regard to collection.  I might point out to the Deputy that the actual figures passed as irrecoverable are very low in the overall context of VAT receipts.  Over the past few years we are talking of figures that have not shown much change and have averaged approximately £350,000.  There is nothing extraordinary about it.  It is in the exercise of the Revenue Commissioners' discretion &mdash; with a view to collecting the maximum tax that they see as being collectable &mdash; that matters of this kind arise and decisions are taken by them.  There is nothing extraordinary about it.  There has been no change or distortion in the overall collection figures or in the amounts remitted.  As I said earlier, responsibility lies entirely with the Revenue Commissioners, as a legal statutory body separate from the Department of Finance and from political control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the fact that sums that were deemed to be realistically irrecoverable are not being entered as estimates not mean that the system the Dáil has for vetting the write-off of tax arrears, namely the submission to the Comptroller and Auditor General of such amounts for vetting, is being by-passed?  Does it not equally mean that the operation of the guidelines contained in this circular leads to the Dáil's control over this issue not being properly executed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically or legalistically the Deputy could have a point. But on the ground the Revenue Commissioners are faced with the practical reality of collecting revenue as expeditiously as possible so as to provide a cash flow for the State.  When one considers the matter in that business-like manner one sees that the amount involved is very small compared with the total revenue collection from VAT which has not varied.  One must give the Revenue Commissioners a business-like, sensible or pragmatic &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; discretion in the day-to-day exercise of their functions to deem certain outstanding accounts irrecoverable if, in the process of so doing, they are able to collect some percentage of the moneys in some practical way.  That is the way the system operates.  I think everybody in the House is aware of that.  It has operated like that since the foundation of the State and, indeed, operates in every State in that manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that the Revenue Commissioners must be given discretion, would the Minister agree that they operate under provisions of Acts passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas?  Therefore, surely it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to see to it that the administration of the provisions of these Acts is done in a <Col N="1455" /> manner that is seen to be fair to everybody? Generally the complaints one hears are that, as a result of practices by the Revenue Commissioners, a certain portion of the community is hounded for taxes and checked on regularly, people who are in fact up-to-date in payment of taxes.  It appears to be suggested that, in order to comply with circulars issued, inspectors are doing their job by making a certain number of calls whereas other taxpayers get away scot free.  Therefore, it is not good enough to say that it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, because through him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that value added tax is a European institution which was never known in this country until we joined the European Communities in 1973, does the Minister not think it right that either his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and his Department or the Revenue Commissioners or, better still, both would have sets of comparative figures which would enable us to form some idea in our minds as to whether that degree of uncollected tax is normal by European standards or by standards of other countries which are also in recession or whether it is abnormal and, if so, how abnormal is it?  I appreciate the Minister may not have that information in a file in front of him but will he take an early opportunity to make public comparative figures from other European countries so that we can see whether we are, as usual, at the bottom of the pile or whether we can, as I do not believe is the <Col N="1460" /> case, look the other member states in the eye and say that our revenue collection system is no worse than theirs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The State does not normally accept responsibility for the legal expenses of civil servants in respect of proceedings initiated in their private capacity and on their own behalf. However, where a civil servant initiates a legal action relating to the performance of his official duties, e.g. for libel, consideration may be given to the question of undertaking to provide financial support from official funds in respect of his legal expenses.  Such support would only be afforded after careful consideration of the relevant circumstances and in accordance with the advice of the State's legal advisers.  The provision of support would be dependent on the officer having acted responsibly in the execution of his duties and on it being in the interest of the State that the action be taken.  Any payments made under these arrangements, which would be limited to amounts not otherwise recoverable, would be from the Vote for the officer's Department.</P>

      <P>It is important that I get this information.  May I ask on what basis were these undertakings given?  Will the civil servants involved repay to the State all the award, if any, granted?  Would he agree that if somebody has the resources of the State at his disposal he will not be interested in settling the case and that this will put the parties in such a dispute in a position of inequality?</P>

      <P>There is a clear distinction between a civil servant initiating civil proceedings in his private capacity and in his public capacity.  This does not arise where he initiates proceedings in his private capacity.  He may feel it incumbent on him, and he should have the backing of the State if, in the performance of his official duties, he is put in a position where he must take legal proceedings.  In such a limited sense, over the past five years, eight public servants have been supported by the State, and the civil servant referred to by the Deputy is one of those eight.  That is the position, and it is perfectly above board.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is in the interest of the freedom of the press that the performance of Government, and the advice given to Government by public servants, should be capable of being criticised and that this will be put in jeopardy if public servants have available to them, in the normal course of events, the resources of the State to bring legal actions against such publications?  Will the Minister tell me whether any award made to such civil servants will be paid in full to the State since the civil servant will have nothing to lose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a perfectly valid position and I have never heard it challenged before.  If a public servant, in the execution of his public duty, is put in a position where he must take legal proceedings for carrying out public policy, it is proper that he should be supported when defending his position, which is basically the position of the State, the Government, and the Oireachtas.</P>

May I take it from what the Minister is saying that it is Government policy, where a departmental official is libelled or abused in a newspaper or magazine, that they should be indemnified by the State if they want to defend their character, as is the position in the case mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will agree that it is very unusual when one party to litigation has nothing to lose no matter how far they go with it, whereas the other party find themselves paying tax, and having their taxes used to subsidise a case against themselves.  If a person has all their tax costs indemnified by an agreement in advance, they have nothing to lose by continuing the action while the other side have everything to lose.  Would the Minister also agree that his answer to Deputy Harney is inadequate in one respect because somebody has to decide in advance of the court decision whether a person has been libelled.  Are we to take it that it is a decision of the Cabinet?  Is it the Attorney General's opinion?  Who makes the decision?  The House is entitled to know these facts since taxpayers' money is being used.</P>

      <P>While I do not disagree with a great deal of what the Minister has said, I would like him to reply more specifically to a point Deputy Harney made, namely the fact that in these conditions a plaintiff does not have the normal inducement to settle which ordinary plaintiffs have. That being so, can he assure the House that the supervision which the State's law officers, I presume, exercise over the progress of the State is continued?  In other words, may the House take it that while the State, in my view being within its rights, supports the initiating of an action by a plaintiff who feels he is being libelled because of carrying out his public duties, the legal advice at the State's disposal will also monitor the progress of the action so as not to involve the State needlessly in expense along the lines mentioned in Deputy Harney's supplementary question?</P>

      <P>Yes, where it is warranted. The matter is fully investigated by the Chief State Solicitor's office, the <Col N="1467" /> Attorney General's office and advice is available from internal legal services.  If in the opinion of counsel and if, as in the case quoted by Deputy Harney, independent legal counsel give their opinion that there is a sustainable case where the State is being damaged as well as the individual, then it is perfectly legitimate that the State back the individual concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total amount of moneys for travelling and incidental expenses provided for in the Revised Estimates for Public Services for 1987; the percentage increase in these items over the 1986 outturn; and the reasons for the real increase in the level of these items over the rate of inflation in the light of reduced airfares and lower petrol prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount provided for travelling and incidental expenses in the 1987 Revised Estimates Volume is £55.922 million compared with £53.427 million in 1986, an increase of 4.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within this overall allocation, the amount provided for travelling and subsistence expenses is £37.497 million, compared with £37.163 million in 1986, an increase of 0.89 per cent.  There has, therefore, been no real increase allowed in the level of travel expenditure.  Incidental expenses have increased by 13.3 per cent, or 10 per cent in real terms, from £16.264 million in 1986 to £18.425 million in 1987.  This category covers a <Col N="1469" /> variety of expenses such as staff training and development, tuition fees, uniforms, laundry, cleaning services, newspapers, periodicals, official entertainment and other miscellaneous items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that a 10 per cent increase in real terms in items which are subject to the ordinary comsumer price index is not warranted in a year in which the CPI is anticipated to rise by about 3.5 per cent? The information now given by the Minister of State shows that for matters including tuition fees, entertainment by State Departments and so on, the real cost is going up, in a year of cutbacks, by 10 per cent.  As the gross figure is 13.3 per cent, there is grave cause for disquiet when a real increase of 10 per cent in these categories of expenditure is undertaken by the Government without an explanation to the House or any indication as to why such expenditure should increase in a year of cutbacks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy says but the expenditure covers a large volume of services and includes staff training and development.  The State must ensure that ample opportunities are provided for the public service to update information and to be aware of developments in modern technology so that it can operate as efficiently as possible to give a proper service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is it this year that gives rise to the increase of 10 per cent in real terms over last year's figure which, presumably, increased on the figure for the year before?  How much of that amount is made up of State expenditure in relation to State entertainment?  What if any, reduction was there in travelling expenses to take into account cheaper air fares and petrol which, undoubtedly, have occurred over the past 12 months?</P>

They already have this information but the Deputy will agree that he did not ask for specific information in his question.  If he had done so he would have got such information.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been in the course of preparation for a number of years and its sole objective is to ensure that adequate safety arrangements exist in respect of installations involved in the exploration <Col N="1584" /> and exploitation of hydrocarbons.  The work involved is by its very nature hazardous and I would expect that the contents of this Bill will meet with broad support across the House.  There may be differences on points of detail but I am satisfied that the overall thrust of the Bill is correct.  I have examined the provisions in the Bill in detail and while I will have a few amendments to suggest at Committee Stage I think there should be no further delay in moving this Bill forward.</P>
    <P>Two main factors have influenced the evolution of this Bill.  One is the necessity for strong and detailed provisions relating to the safety, health and welfare of persons engaged in offshore operations.  The other factor is the need for adequate advance planning to deal with the situation which may be created should substantial petroleum finds be made.</P>
    <P>Exploration off our coasts began in 1971.  Up to the end of 1986, the total number of wells drilled was 95.  This year it is expected that at least four wells will be drilled.  Last year over 250 Irish personnel were engaged for offshore work. So far this year just over 100 personnel have been recruited.  As this Government intends to actively encourage offshore development I am hopeful that there will be increased opportunities for the many experienced Irish offshore workers.</P>
    <P>Exploitation is confined at present to natural gas off Kinsale which came on stream in 1978 and is carried out by two production platforms.  We would all hope that the exploitation of natural gas will be matched by development of native oil resources off our shores in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a comprehensive framework within which the efforts of all concerned with the safety, health and welfare of persons employed on offshore operations must henceforth be directed. To set these new provisions in perspective, it is necessary to deal briefly with the legal basis for existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>While general responsibility for ensuring the safety, health and welfare of workers employed on offshore installations rests with my Department, none <Col N="1585" /> of the safety protection statutes administered by the Department applies to such installations.  As the law stands, the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum development and production operations are based on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, and on offshore licensing terms administered by the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act prohibits searching for or recovering any petroleum found, save under the licence from the Minister for Energy.  The safety of workers employed on an offshore installation is at present controlled by a condition in this licence.  This condition requires the licensee to comply with all regulations and directions of my Department for securing the safety, health and welfare of persons employed in or about the licensed area.  The current requirements are those set out in the Safety Instructions for Offshore Petroleum Operations issued in February 1983 in place of previous instructions issued in 1975.  While this arrangement has worked reasonably well until now, I think the House will agree that it is far from being an ideal one.</P>
    <P>The incidence of fatal accidents on offshore installations in the North Sea has been alarmingly high.  For instance, over 110 deaths from accidents in or near offshore installations were officially recorded in the first 17 years of drilling for oil in the North Sea.  Nearly 650 accidents involving serious injury were recorded in the same period.  In the case of operations in Irish waters, however, the only penalty available at present for not observing directions about the safety of workers employed on or about these installatins is withdrawal of the licence.  A penalty which would involve ending all exploration or production under a particular licence is obviously not a satisfactory means of guaranteeing the effectiveness of day-to-day safety management on production installations.</P>
    <P>There is no place for any complacency about safety concerns in the hazardous environment of an offshore platform.  I do not set any great store on bureaucratic <Col N="1586" /> means of ensuring that safety standards are met.  No system introduced by Government or overseen by my Department's inspectors will ever achieve safety offshore.  Put simply, all offshore employers and each and every individual employee must understand that responsibility for an effective safety system lies in their own hands.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive approach which trade union and employer interests in the petroleum industry have shown in promoting a safety conscious working environment.  Both sides have recognised the importance of training in the drive towards safer operations.  Under a recruitment agreement made in 1985 all employees recruited for offshore work are required to register with the National Manpower Service and to have completed a fire-fighting and survival course. This will ensure that all offshore personnel have basic training for what is a very dangerous job.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is important that workers should be involved in decisions about their working environment. Having regard to the nature and intensity of the hazards encountered, I am convinced of the need for a mechanism to enable workers on offshore installations to become involved in decisions on safety and health matters.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill are broadly in keeping with the recommendations of the Barrington Commission.  They should serve to press home to offshore employers and to their workers the need for effective safety policies, the importance of safety training and the value of having carefully drafted and well-observed procedures.  No amount of attention devoted to recording accidents is going to be of any use after all if the main emphasis is not on avoiding the possibility of accident or damage in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into six parts under which are grouped sections dealing with preliminary and general matters, offshore installations, safety regulations and representations, accidents, offences and penalties and the powers and functions <Col N="1587" /> of inspectors, with subsidiary provisions.</P>
    <P>Part I is concerned with preliminary and general matters and contains a number of standard sections dealing with commencement, definitions, application, and regulations.  An enabling section for the provision of regulations will allow specific aspects of offshore operations to be subjected to detailed regulations. While the Bill contains substantive provisions for safety matters, I have decided for practical reasons that the legislation will be backed up by detailed regulations. Section 5 (1) makes consultation with the Minister for Energy obligatory before any regulations are made.  I have also included a provision for consultation as necessary with other Ministers.</P>
    <P>The main feature of Part 2 of the Bill is the establishment of the position of installation manager.  Section 11 requires that every offshore installation shall be under the charge of a competent installation manager appointed by the installation owner.  The manager will, under section 13, have responsibility for safety, health and welfare and also for order and discipline.  As Minister for Labour, I have taken power to specify by regulation the installation manager's duties in relation to the safety, health and welfare of installation workers.  Section 10 places an obligation on the manager to see that the installation is not used unless the rig and its fittings and equipment are suitable.</P>
    <P>All equipment must be of sound construction and adequate strength and it must be properly maintained and comply with regulations which will provide for a certification procedure in relation to these requirements.  Section 10 also casts a qualified duty on the installation manager to ensure that all working places on or about the installation are safe.  There is a duty on different employers operating at the same installation to co-operate in protecting their workers from danger. Section 12 provides that no offshore installation may in future function except under the daily personal supervision of the installation manager, or of a qualified substitute during his absence or incapacity. In section 16 a duty is placed <Col N="1588" /> on the installation manager to keep a logbook and a record of all persons on board the installation.  Section 14 prohibits the employment on offshore installations of persons under 18 years of age, unless exempted by regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 places an obligation on employees of the installation to look to the safety of themselves and their co-workers and to co-operate with employers in complying with the Bill or regulations.  In section 18 the installation owner is obliged to see that suitable clothing, equipment and facilities are provided for the protection of workers.  Other sections in Part 2 oblige him to ensure that a sufficient system is provided for the detection of gas, for the safe storage and identification of dangerous substances and preparations and for dealing with the hazards of naked lights and smoking.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with safety on the installation itself.  Section 22 specifies matters which may be the subject of safety regulations.  These include the operation of support vessels, aircraft, work processes, pipeline works and matters listed in the Schedule to the Bill, for example, medical and training requirements and emergency procedures. Before regulations are made, notice of intention to make them will, in most instances, have to be published at least 21 days in advance.  This procedure will give interested parties an opportunity to make representations about their content.</P>
    <P>Other sections of Part 3 deal with safety representation and may be brought into force by regulation.  Section 23 allows for selection by the workers of a safety representative and deputy safety representative to represent them at consultations with the installation manager on safety, health and welfare.  Section 24 outlines a procedure for the selection by the workers, if they so wish, of a safety committee to assist the owner and the installation manager in securing comliance with all safety provisions and regulations. The committee may appoint a safety delegate and deputy safety delegate. There is provision in section 25 for <Col N="1589" /> appointment by the installation manager of a safety representative or safety committee in default of any initiative in that regard by the workers.</P>
    <P>Under section 26 the owner of an installation will be required to draw up a statement of policy specifying the manner in which the safety, health and welfare of the employees will be secured.  The installation manager must make a copy of the statement available to any safety representatives or safety committee or, if neither exists, to any employee on the installation who requests a copy.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, these provisions on safety representation reflect my concern to highlight the importance of worker involvement in safety matters.  I recognise that ultimately a framework for involvement can only succeed in its purpose if it is suited to its environment. Following the publication of the Barrington Report on Safety at Work, my Department have been working in liaison with the Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health on the drafting of legislation to give effect to its recommendations. In this context, it may be necessary to review the present provisions in this Bill in due course.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill lays down the procedures to be followed in case of accident, injury or death and in the event of the occurrence of disease on an installation. In sections 27 and 28 I am proposing the establishment of procedures to be followed where death occurs as a result of accidents on or around an installation.  Written notice must be given immediately to both myself and the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>There is also a prohibition on interference with the scene of an accident for a specified period unless an industrial inspector of my Department has visited the installation and agreed to any proposed changes.  Section 29 lays down procedures to be followed where a person on an installation is found to be suffering from a prescribed disease.  I have taken power to order, where I consider it appropriate, a formal investigation into any accident, disease or other occurrence <Col N="1590" /> notified to me under the legislation.  In the discharge of my functions under the Bill I will have the benefit of professional advice from an industrial medical adviser, who may be vested with the powers of an industrial inspector.</P>
    <P>Parts 5 and 6 which conclude the Bill deal with offences and set out the penalties for breach of provisions of the Bill, and with the powers of the industrial inspectors of my Department.  The inspectors are given the right of access to offshore installations and to make examinations, inquiries and tests necessary to ascertain whether the Bill and the regulations are being complied with.  They are also empowered to serve notice imposing prohibitions, restrictions or other requirements in cases of immediate or apprehended danger.  Provision has been included for an appeal against any such notice.</P>
    <P>The Bill will undoubtedly benefit from the detailed scrutiny of this House.  I will, of course, be prepared to consider any constructive suggestions to improve the Bill's provisions.  I am satisfied, however, that in its general principles it will provide an effective framework to harness the efforts of all concerned with the safety, health and welfare of persons employed on offshore installations.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many areas which one would not expect to be the subject of party political controversy and certainly the area of health and safety at work is one of those.  It is an area which should be addressed in a non-partisan fashion and taken seriously on all sides. The benefits from addressing that area in an effective manner will be felt throughout the community.  There is the immediate benefit in terms of the pain and suffering of individuals which could be avoided and the wider economic benefit to the community if accidents can be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally when the question of health and safety has come before the House there has been a willingness to approach it in an open-minded and non-partisan manner.  I recall that when the <Col N="1591" /> Safety in Industry Bill was before the House there were no less than 150 amendments tabled on Committee Stage, many of them from the Government side of the House.  I am pleased to hear the Minister for Labour say he will be open-minded in regard to amendments and that he himself will put forward some amendments for our consideration. Despite our open-mindedness our collective record in the area of health and safety is less than entirely satisfactory. Our safety code, taken all together, is quite inadequate.  It is in no sense comprehensive. At least as many workers find themselves outside its provisions as within it and some of those are engaged in activities which one immediately would think of as being hazardous in nature. There are people employed in the agricultural area, laboratory work and so on who find themselves outside the scope of that legislation.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that our legislation has traditionally placed an emphasis on legal injunctions &mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo;, we tell the employer, by and large. To a somewhat lesser extent we tell employees &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo;.  That emphasis on legal injunctions has been largely at the expense of a programme of education bringing home to all involved &mdash; the suppliers of plant, employers, employees and trade unions &mdash; their particular responsibilities at the workplace.</P>
    <P>While we have been very well served over the years by a dedicated inspectorate, there has been a difficulty in targeting the work of the inspectorate sufficiently at those areas which are most hazardous.  Given the number of enterprises which are already the subject of legislation, we have to recognise that it probably will not be possible to have all of them inspected on a regular basis.  If we accept it as common cause around the House that there is a need to move to a much more comprehensive situation where the number of enterprises affected will be vastly increased, clearly it will not be possible to have a universal inspection. There is a need for more effective targeting of those areas that are particularly likely to give rise to difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> We have had in the past a patchwork approach to health and safety.  That is reflected in the whole range of Acts which impinge on this.  If one wants to find out what is regarded as acceptable practice one is likely to find oneself hiding behind a wall of statutes.  One will be taking down the Factories Act, the Office Premises Act, the Boilers (Explosion) Act, the Mines and Quarries Act, the Shops Act, to say nothing of various Acts dealing with dangerous substances and particular areas such as the nuclear area.  It is unsatisfactory that we should have that patchwork because inevitably it gives rise to loopholes and areas being excluded.</P>
    <P>One area which up to now has been excluded is offshore installations.  That is a cause of concern since it is one which all of us would immediately regard as being inherently dangerous.  To date it has operated on the basis of little more than a gentleman's agreement.  People coming in looking for a licence are told they will have to comply with recognised standards.  It has long been recognised that this is not a very satisfactory approach and that it is proper that the matter should be put on a statutory basis. I have been racking my brains to remember just how long this has been recognised because very few measures have come before this House after such a lengthy gestation period as this Bill.  I was going to refer to it as &ldquo;elephantine&rdquo; but I think the poor elephant would have been producing families of offspring while successive Attorneys General and their advisers have laboured over this measure. My recollection of the file is that people who laboured on the complexities of this matter have gone on to well-merited retirement after long service in this State and in Europe.  With some sense of relief I saw the measure published during the lifetime of the previous Government and I welcome the Minister for Labour's decision to bring it back into the House and advance it.  If there are to be differences of emphasis on Committee Stage, we can deal with that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps understandably, given the general legislative background against which this will have to stand, the recipe it contains is very much the same old <Col N="1593" /> recipe.  There is again an emphasis on legal injunctions.  There is a whole series of offences prescribing what employers can do and what employees cannot do. As a sign of the times, there is a nod in the direction of education and information, the role of the installation manager, the provision for safety committees and so on.  I wonder to what extent there has been an attempt to influence this measure with the spirit of Barrington.  I wonder, for example, whether the interim board operating as a response to the Barrington Commission have been invited to give their views on the details of this matter and, if so, to what extent their views have been brought within the scope of the Bill or will come before us in the form of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is obviously an area of immense importance to both the trade unions involved and to the employers.  My recollection of life as Minister of State at the Department of Labour was of having a series of meetings with the employers, and I think also with the trade unions, as we teased out their particular concerns. Perhaps the Minister when replying will indicate the present thinking of the employer and employee organisations in relation to this measure.  To what extent have their concerns been met at this stage and to what extent are there issues outstanding?</P>
    <P>I mentioned that this legislation has occupied the attention &mdash; or perhaps occasionally not occupied the attention &mdash; of a whole series of Attorneys General in a whole series of administrations.  Their particular concern has focused on the question of jurisdiction, to what areas the legislation applies and how it can be made operative where drilling is actually taking place.  Reading the Bill and the explanatory memorandum one cannot be altogether clear about the conclusion.  I am not certain that anybody wondering into the Government Publications Office and buying a copy of the Bill and memorandum would be in a position to say what is or is not covered.</P>
    <P>We know, for example that this legislation <Col N="1594" /> will apply within our territorial waters and I think most of us could make a stab at where they are.  We know it covers waters to the landward side of our territorial waters, and if we have sailors in the House they can have a go at indicating where they are.  We know it applies to part of the Continental Shelf but when it comes to that a number of us would find ourselves in difficulty.  My understanding of it is that the extent of our entitlement under the Continental Shelf legislation will remain a matter of dispute with the British Government, that the limitations of those rights are to be submitted to arbitration, and that until that arbitration is finalised those doubts will continue.  I wonder if the Minister could ascertain from his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, just where that stands at this moment and when we can expect finality to a dispute which is now almost as long lasting as the gestation period for this Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Given the fact that this measure in the course of its preparation caused such concern to such a series of legal experts, there has to be some constitutional doubt hanging over it.  What is proposed is to legislate in great detail not only for what happens within our national territory but for what happens outside it.  We recall that our national territory is defined by the Constitution in Article 3 as consisting of the island of Ireland and its territorial seas and waters but it is clear that this measure proposes to legislate in scope away beyond our territorial seas and waters.  There must be some constitutional question mark about that.  I wonder what the Minister for Labour thinks of it.  If there is a question mark about it a proper way to respond would be to invite the President to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution and have the Supreme Court rule at that stage on its validity in a way that would put the matter beyond doubt once and for all.  There have been occasions when Acts of this House have had effect beyond the national territory. At common law there were always a number of offences that were part of our criminal law wherever committed.  In <Col N="1595" /> recent times in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 this House acted to make criminal under the laws of this State a good deal of what I might refer to loosely as subversive activity in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This goes a great deal further than that and we are proposing to prescribe in quite extraordinary detail what people, many of whom will not be citizens, are to do when they find themselves on installations outside our territorial seas and waters.  I am not sure that it is within the competence of this House to do so.  At the very least there is a doubt, and if there is a doubt it is desirable that it be cleared up now.  We could envisage, although we hope that this will never happen, in the event of a major disaster and of an inquiry such as those that followed disasters such as the Stardust tragedy, that at that stage it might become very much in the interest of one or other of the parties involved to seek to challenge the constitutionality of this legislation.  It is better to face it now and to put the matter beyond doubt.  I suggest that we do that by inviting the President to use his powers under Article 26 of the Constitution.  I do not even say that the doubt I am raising is a probability.  I do not think that it is but it exists and given the difficulties that the House has found itself in in recent times with other decisions of the Supreme Court and given that the doubt is there it is best to dispel it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The other thing I ask the Minister in terms of fleshing out what is involved is whether he can place in the Library of the Oireachtas a map showing exactly where he believes this Bill applies, which would show us where our territorial seas and waters are.  Most of us know that, but it would show us where those seas landward of our territorial seas are to be found and what claims as to jurisdiction are being made to the Continental Shelf. On that map could he show also where there are existing installations to which the legislation will apply?</P>
    <P>Another item of information he could provide for us during the break between <Col N="1596" /> now and Committee Stage would be whatever statistics are available to him on the incidence of accidents, fatal and non-fatal, on offshore installations. During his Second Stage speech the Minister gave figures for activities in the North Sea to justify fully his statement about the dangerous nature of the activity that is taking place.  I do not know whether statistics are available to him, but surely they must be, relating to the installations to which this measure will apply.  It would be helpful to all of us if we had them.</P>
    <P>When this measure is passed its effectiveness will in part depend on the way in which it is capable of being enforced by the inspectorate attached to the Department of Labour.  They are a very skilled inspectorate, but to what extent does their professional expertise equip them for what is a very specialised area of work?  Does the Minister anticipate that extra resources will be required?  Will extra inspectors need to be employed on a fulltime basis or does he see himself resorting to the use of experts on a contract basis?  In either event has he the funds for that within his budget?  Again when there has been a great deal of talk about the need to curtail travel budgets, to what extent will it be open to the inspectorate of the Department of Labour to inspect rigorously and enforce the standards prescribed by this Bill?</P>
    <P>Without at this stage going section by section through the Bill &mdash; we can do that on Committee Stage &mdash; I want to say that I am glad the Minister has decided to bring the measure back in.  That is a gesture of good faith with all those who for so many years have laboured on the area. He should see it as very much a first step towards the comprehensive framework for health and safety to which we all aspire.  I ask him to see to it that in the rest of this measure's legislative life it will be influenced by the spirit of Barrington. I ask him, too, to ensure that when the measure passes, its enforcement and operation will similarly be imbused with the spirit of the Barrington Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill <Col N="1597" /> and recognise that it is important in that there should be a coherent set of safety regulations for offshore installations.  As Deputy Birmingham said, this legislation is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Exploration has been going on in Irish waters for about 14 years and it has taken a considerably longer time to deal with the safety aspects of those operations.  I am glad that this Bill has been introduced. Up to now legislation for the health and safety of people on board rigs has been dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis through various regulations introduced by successive Ministers for Energy.  This whole are needs to be tidied up and this is the objective of the Bill.  Offshore installations are a unique workplace and specific legislation dealing with the safety, health and welfare of the operatives on board the installations is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The exploration and exploitation activity in Irish territorial waters has never reached the levels we had hoped. Over the last year, whatever activity there was, decreased further.  Last year only seven wells were drilled and only four wells are scheduled for drilling this year.  This lack of activity in Irish territorial waters is due in part to a fall in world prices for oil and also to the fact that the terms on offer by the State to those in the oil exploration business have been unattractive.  It is essential that these terms be made more attractive to those operators.  Our oil industry is vital to our economy and it is very important that this aspect is seriously dealt with by the Government.  There must be incentives to ensure that commercially viable discoveries are fully exploited so that oil will be brought ashore in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last September the then Minister, Deputy Spring, amended the licensing terms when credits were granted to exploration companies for expenditure incurred in the cost of drilling exploratory and appraisal wells.  These credits can be set off against royalty liabilities.  Also a system of profit-based participation was proposed and the Government no longer reserved the right to take a 50 per cent <Col N="1598" /> stake but instead were prepared to operate a two tiered profit system.  These changes were welcomed by the industry as a step in the right direction but they have also been criticised as being too little, too late.  I would urge the Government and the Minister to ensure that the terms of licence agreements are flexible and are designed to maximise participation of oil companies both in the area of exploration and of developing any oil finds.  Indeed the present Minister in an address last October to the Irish Offshore Services Association stated that the first priority of Fianna Fáil on return to office would be to establish Ireland as an oil producing province.  I trust the Government will follow through.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this subject is a matter for debate on another day but all parties are agreed that the discovery and the development of commercially viable oil finds would have a major beneficial effect on our economy and must be considered a top priority by the Government.  The Progressive Democrats will give their full support to any measures designed to expedite delivery of oil on shore.</P>
    <P>In relation to the safety aspects of oil exploration and exploitation, while oil prices are low in international markets exploration costs have not decreased. Consequently some unscrupulous operators might be tempted to operate on the cheap and some installations might be operating under conditions which do not comply with the provisions of this Bill. Therefore, it is important that this legislation should be enacted at an early date.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with exemptions from compliance with the provisions of the Bill.  This section is too vague and flexible.  The section suggests that just because the installation has, for instance, a small number of employees or because it will only be working for a short period, it would be unreasonable to ask the owners to take adequate safety precautions. I am sure that is not the intention of that section.  What operational circumstances would arise to justify exemption on the grounds either that there were not enough workers on a rig or that it would be only working for a <Col N="1599" /> couple of days at a time rather than for a protracted period?</P>
    <P>The Bill deals primarily with the safety, health and welfare of the operatives.  We need to look more closely at the health of the structures.  This area has not been adequately covered.  If a rig is inherently unsafe, the people working on it are at risk.  This aspect of safety is dealt with in sections 10 and 32.  Section 10 places an obligation on the installation manager to ensure that the installation is not used unless it, its fittings and equipment are sound and properly maintained and comply with regulations under the section.  These regulations may provide for certification of the installation and its fittings.  This aspect of safety of operatives is very important and the regulations must ensure that there is adequate and satisfactory certification of all plant and equipment.  Such certificates should be renewed on a regular basis and after at least annual surveys.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for rigorous testing of the structures after an accident. Apparently the Minister under that section can order these checks to be carried out where he considers they have been a contributory factor in an accident. Surely it would be more appropriate to have a preventative maintenance approach to safety measures through a certification system which would highlight in advance any structural defects or weaknesses that might exist on the platform or installation and consequently eliminate potential accidents and avoid serious injury or loss of life.</P>
    <P>The most important appointment provided for in the Bill is that of the installation manager.  This is a highly responsible position and a very high degree of responsibility and authority is vested in the installation manager.  The authority vested in him is equivalent to that of a captain of a ship at sea.  This is as it should be because offshore installations and subsidiary installations in the immediate vicinity are complex and potentially hazardous installations.  It is very important that, apart from having responsibility for their safe operation, the <Col N="1600" /> installation manager should have adequate powers to deal with any problems that arise in the course of the day-to-day operations of the platform and installations.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 set out the main functions and duties of the installation manager and the authority he has in certain circumstances.  All of these provisions are necessary.  I would submit that the authority of the installation manager be extended in some areas.  For instance, section 13 seems to exclude the installation manager from exercising authority in certain cases.  Section 13 (1) (a) states that the installation manager is vested with authority over all persons on, in or in the neighbourhood of the installation. He is given specific powers to enable him discharge that responsibility.  Subsection (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not be construed as extending to any matters for which another person is responsible as master, captain or person in charge of any vessel, helicopter or other aircraft, hovercraft or lighthouse.</P>
    <P>There could be some confusion in the interpretation of that subsection.  I would suggest that the Minister examine this section more closely.  It is possible for a conflict to arise if, say, a ship is berthed or tied up to one of these offshore installations, if a helicopter has landed or is on an approach to landing.  If the installation manager considers that to be a potential hazard should he not be the supreme authority in such circumstances?  But the question may well arise as to who has authority in such circumstances.  That matter should be clarified.  Otherwise, a conflict or confusion could arise.</P>
    <P>It is said in section 5 that with regard to regulations generally the Minister may &mdash; after consultation with various other Ministers, including the Minister for Energy, Minister for Health, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Environment &mdash; make regulations for giving effect to this Act.  I might suggest that the Minister consider consulting the industry before making regulations so that he <Col N="1601" /> would know their point of view on matters relating to the health, safety and welfare of operatives involved.  It should be remembered that the people operating within the industry are in the front line and that their input would be of practical benefit on a whole range of issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be afforded an opportunity of examining the various sections in more detail on Committee Stage. Some sections deal with specific procedures, for instance, such matters as naked lights, gas detection, worker safety committees and so on while other sections are of a more general nature. One such generality that strikes me is the definition of an offshore installation. That definition needs to be more precise. Offshore installations can vary enormously and cover a whole range of different types of installations, from conventional ships involved in exploration, to floatels &mdash; floating hotels to accommodate workers &mdash; to permanent and temporary rigs, indeed to unmanned rigs.  The regulations to be made under the provisions of this Bill may very well be appropriate to some such installations but entirely inappropriate to others.  That distinction needs to be drawn and the relevant regulations tailored to each type of installation.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal also with the question of penalties and fines to be imposed for breaches of regulations dealt with in section 39.  Given that a breach of regulations, in certain circumstances, could lead to serious injury or loss of life it is important to ensure that such penalties act as a serious deterrent to unscrupulous operators who might put people's safety at risk.  In money terms the fines appear to be quite small, the maximum being, I think, £2,000.  Though there are provisions for continuing daily fines of lesser amounts on a persistent offender but possibly even a jail sentence in some cases, we should ensure that they act as a sufficient deterrent to sharp and unsafe practices.  Bearing in mind the hazardous conditions likely to prevail in a working environment such as that obtaining on an oil production platform every effort should be made to ensure the health, <Col N="1602" /> safety and welfare of the people on board and that fines and penalties are sufficient to ensure that people are not put at risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might compliment the Minister on having introduced this Bill so early in the life of this Government. Its provisions are of tremendous importance.  We have been involved in oil exploration since 1971.  Like Deputy Birmingham I would have to comment on the fact that its introduction took so long, that it took four years, but I realise that there were real difficulties which had to be overcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that there is no great difference of opinion on the main thrust of the Bill but some specific points will need to be examined further and teased out on Committee Stage.  It is fair to say that the Minister has the support of all parties. However, there are some aspects on which I would have to comment and on which I should like some information from the Minister.  For instance, I would have some reservations about the provisions of section 4 giving the Minister power to grant exemptions.  My fear would be that the granting of such exemptions <Col N="1603" /> could undermine the whole rationable of the Bill, cancelling out any good work done by the Minister on this occasion.  I would fear a drop in safety and other standards if exemptions were granted.  There is a need to be more specific on this point.  For example, we are told at present that some fields are not profitable.  When there is a sufficient supply of oil available the day may come when it may be profitable to exploit these fields and that could well lead to a drop in standards.</P>
      <P>With regard to compliance with certain requirements it is said that the Minister may consult with the Ministers for Health, Energy, Communications and the Environment.  Does the Minister see a role for the Department of the Marine in this respect?  The involvement of four or five different Ministeries could lead to confusion and may not be conductive to the efficient operation of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is reference to safety talks between employees and employers.  I was a member of a consultative council in Cork for many years, similar to that envisaged in the provisions of this Bill.  Even though we sat down and discussed in detail the problems which confronted us, the one drawback we had was that we had no muscle.  In this instance we could be faced with a similar situation.  We can discuss the matter but we cannot compel the employer to implement some of the measures necessary to ensure the safety of the people working on board these rigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this field of activity targets have to be met.  It is a very expensive operation. People are expected to drill at high speed; at times they meet rock which means they may drill only one, two or three metres a day.  They may also go through a period of good luck when they go through sand and as a result there is an increase in productivity.  When there is a choice between safety and productivity somebody should be charged with responsibility. It has been suggested that the installation manager should be the one <Col N="1604" /> to supervise safety measures but can we expect the manager of the installation who is responsible for productivity to also be responsible for safety?  It is a classic case of serving God and mammon.  That is what concerns me.  The installation manager may in haste, if he sees fit, ignore some of the safety measures that are desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham mentioned something which struck me rather forcefully &mdash; as a lawyer he is better equipped than I am to deal with this matter &mdash; that is drilling on the continental shelf.  While it is possible within our jurisdiction to implement these regulations, it may not be possible once we go beyond Irish territorial waters.  I would like to know the effect on non-nationals who are employed on rigs and who have responsibility for these matters.  Irish workers on board these rigs are usually employed only up to a certain grade and the supervisory positions are usually held by non-nationals. There is a reluctance on the part of some of the oil companies to involve the native workforce and to give them responsibility.  We may be introducing a measure which it may not be possible to implement simply because the people who will be responsible for implementing them are not answerable to the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham also said we got some statistics regarding the safety record in the North Sea.  While I accept there are only 100 people employed on offshore rigs in Irish territorial waters, it is obvious there is a high incidence of accidents on board these rigs.  It will not be possible for us to legislate properly until we can quantify the extent of the problem.  If the Minister could provide this information it would help in no small way.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for saying in his speech that he is open to suggestions. He referred to the Barrington report and said he will be prepared to listen to any proposals which we have in this regard.  It will be necessary to make some proposals on Committee Stage and I hope he will be receptive.  In his speech the Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Both sides have recognised the importance of training in the drive towards safer operations.  Under a recruitment agreement made in 1985 all employees recruited for offshore work are required to register with the National Manpower Service and to have completed a fire-fighting and survival course.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister &mdash; in fairness to him I must say, I got a very encouraging response from him &mdash; about those who were employed pre-1985 and who do not come under this heading. There are approximately 27 people who do not hold certificates.  For a nominal fee they could be trained in safety and survival procedures which are absolutely essential.  Other countries have introduced their own system: Norway and Britain have set a certain standard. AnCO have done good work in training the bulk of the personnel but some of our more experienced people do not have certification.  They did not avail of the opportunity to get certificates when it was presented to them, on the basis that some of them felt they were experienced as they had survived for 14 years on the rigs without a certificate.  They now find they could very easily be discriminated against and may not be offered employment on the rigs.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to have a rig certified as being seaworthy, similar to a sea-going vessel which must have a certain rating from Lloyds.  This area should be examined.  It serves no purpose to certify a rig after an accident happens.  This could lead to abuse because in an area which is difficult to supervise there is no guarantee that repairs could not be carried out in the interim.  I am not suggesting that this has happened but it is a possibility and is something we should try to guard against.  There are also other considerations.  On some of these rigs conditions leave quite a lot to be desired. The standards in regard to ventilation, lighting and matters of that nature are the same as those applied to factories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> The conditions of work on the rigs should be explored.</P>
    <P>In recent times a major problem has been created by abandoned rigs in the North Sea and this has created a hazard for shipping.  Now that we have the opportunity, we should guard against this eventuality.  The lives of seamen who service rigs in our territorial waters will be endangered if we do not take positive steps in the matter.  We must ensure there is not a fatal accident as a result of negligence on the part of an operator who might abandon a rig simply because it is cheaper to do so.</P>
    <P>I am more than happy to welcome this Bill.  I hope that on Committee Stage we can go into the detail that will be necessary to strengthen the position of employees of the oil companies and to ensure a safer working environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I compliment the Minister and welcome the introduction of the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Bill, 1986.  I welcome in particular the Minister's opening statement that there are two main factors involved in the introduction of the Bill.  The first factor relates to the welfare of persons working on offshore installations &mdash; to put it quite simply, the workers involved.  Any Bill that caters for the safety and welfare of workers in any industry is to be welcomed by all the Members of this House.  The other factor is the planning for substantial oil and other finds off our coasts.  There is not a Deputy from any coastal county in Ireland &mdash; I represent the coastal county of Waterford &mdash; who will not welcome the provisions of a Bill which will cater for workers and their safety.  In Waterford &mdash; I know other Deputies feel the same about their areas &mdash; we hope there will be oil and gas finds off our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said earlier today that the Bill is overdue in the sense that there are offshore installations operating in the Irish Sea for some years past.  Against that, it is nice to be able to stand up here and welcome a Bill which, in broad measure, is anticipatory in its effects.  I <Col N="1607" /> hope the forward-looking Minister and Government who introduced such a Bill, catering for what is about to happen rather than what has happened, will receive the plaudits of the general public for their farsightedness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises who introduced that Bill?  We did not get many plaudits for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be passed under a Fianna Fáil Administration. Having said I welcome the Bill in a broad way, like other speakers I have reservations about some of its provisions.  I would have welcomed a statement in the Bill that, subject to specific provisions, the ordinary rule of common law regarding negligence and so on would apply to offshore installations.  I share Deputy O'Malley's concern about section 4.  I do not fully understand what it means.  No one could accuse this section of being specific.  That would have been all right if the Explanatory Memorandum had given us any clues as to the precise situations the section was intended to cover, but it does not.  This section merits some attention by the Minister before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 5, and some other sections, where other Departments and Ministers must be consulted about certain matters.  I recall an occasion, totally unrelated to this, in Waterford some years ago when I was trying to make progress on a certain issue.  I was shunted from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health, to the Department of Education and back again.  Any time an official was queried he said it was the responsibility of one of the other two Departments.  Eventually we had a meeting with the officials from the three Departments and at that meeting each told the other it was their responsibility. So far as it relates to offshore installations this Bill gets over all those difficulties. The Minister for Labour has the power and the duties in this area but in certain instances he is obliged to consult with the <Col N="1608" /> Minister for Communications, the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education. This measure is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As regards section 5, there is one point I do not understand, that is, where it says that in regard to regulations concerning the health of people, the Minister must consult with the Minister for Health and then make regulations; in regard to fire safety measures, he must consult with the Minister for the Environment and then make regulations; but in regard to provisions dealing with aircraft, vessels, radio facilities and so on, he must consult with the Minister for Communications, and regulations can only be made with the concurrence of the Minister for Communications. I do not know about other Deputies, but I do not understand the necessity for this distinction.  I presume matters relating to aircraft and so on are governed by statute, and maybe that has something to do with it, but, if that is the case as regards fire safety measures, there is the Fire Safety Act.  If there is an explanation for this distinction, I would welcome hearing it in due course, but if there is an unnecessary distinction it should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Sections 31 and 32 relate to investigative powers.  This measure is to be welcomed.  I hope these investigative powers will have teeth and that the powers will be widely used by the Minister. I do not say that in a draconian sense in relation to the managers or owners of offshore installations, but there is no point in having investigative powers unless they are used.  Here again we come up against a situation similar to that which arose under the clinical trials legislation. We are in an era of cutbacks &mdash; and everybody acknowledges the need for such cutbacks &mdash; but if this Bill provides investigative powers, we will need investigators and proper staffing so that those powers can be used as they were intended.  That covers the official side.</P>
    <P>In the case of an accident, a worker may find it necessary to consult his legal adviser, engineers or other professional staff to assist him in processing a claim or investigating the accident, but these people would not have ready access to <Col N="1609" /> such offshore installations.  If a worker has an accident his advisers find it very difficult to get into a factory or shop premises without a lot of to-ing and froing, and very often by the time the arrangements for access are made, the scene of the accident has changed to such an extent that the investigators cannot make a proper investigation.  In other words, the <i>locus in quo</i> is not as it was at the time of the accident.  The Minister should bear that in mind when he considers making amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome his statement that he is open to suggestions but the broad emphasis of the Bill is to protect and guard against danger and accidents to workers.  While the provisions in the Bill giving powers to the departmental officials are to be welcomed, the Minister will concede that in many instances what we are regulating here is the right of the worker to have an injury processed legally and a claim made in court.  If that process is to be facilitated, the worker's private advisers, be they legal, engineering or medical, should have right of access to offshore installations which in many cases are extremely difficult to get at.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with defences if there are proceedings under the Act.  I agree with the content of subsections (1) and (2) but I am a little worried about subsection (3) which states that it shall be a defence to prove that the doing of the act was necessary for securing the safety of the offshore installation concerned or persons thereon.  That could pose a conundrum if a worker is injured and the Minister through his Department wishes to deal with an overall problem or the worker wishes to deal with a specific problem in that the management of the offshore installation can simply say in his defence that he was dealing with the safety of the installation.  I do not think that position is satisfactory and the subsection needs to be amended, if not removed, because there will be difficulty in interpretation.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers in many instances to management although owners are also referred to.  However, in many instances where there is a positive duty on someone <Col N="1610" /> to perform an act it is almost always referred to as &ldquo;the offshore installation manager.&rdquo;  In view of the kind of industry with which we are dealing, the companies should be directly responsible in such instances and, if there is any wrongdoing, the Minister or a private individual might, in certain instances, have power to seek redress from the directors, expecially in view of the fact that many of these companies are situated outside the State.</P>
    <P>In many cases of offshore installations large multinational companies with a high degree of finance available to them are involved.  The fines of £2,000, £1,000, £600 and £200 in section 39 are ridiculously low bearing in mind the Minister's statement that the Bill is intended to cover incidents in the future.  Some of these penalties are not as great as those provided for under the Road Traffic Act where a private individual driving without tax or insurance is liable for a much more severe penalty.  These reservations are on the periphery of the Bill but it might be necessary to consider them and, therefore, there should be provision in the Bill to look at the question of the licence as there may be instances in which it may have to be revoked. However, I broadly welcome the Bill and the Minister has done a great service in introducing it after such a short time in office.  I compliment him on doing so and if any of my suggestions can be met by way of explanation or as amendments on Committee Stage I would welcome them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said that four wells were being drilled this year.  The quality of the result of drilling is important, not the number of wells involved.  The Minister, Deputy Burke, seems quite confident that the prospects are good.  The question of more rapid exploration was also mentioned and on 8 April he stated that there was a need to push the pace of exploration along more rapidly than heretofore.  He said that a special study had taken place on five unallocated blocks and that they were available as part of a package for purchase. He said that the closing date for licence applications would be 1 July 1987.  It <Col N="1611" /> appears that the pace of exploration has been accelerated.</P>
      <P>The fact that 95 exploration wells were drilled offshore up to the end of 1986 is testimony to the need to provide for the safety, health and welfare of persons employed on offshore installations.  The Bill is timely and deals with the protection of such workers.  It is an excellent effort at laying down standards for offshore installations.  The need for adequate safety and training procedures cannot be overstressed and I am delighted that the Minister is willing to consider any constructive suggestions on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with the specifics within the Bill.  The term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; needs to be properly defined.  The meaning of that term should include the charterer or the disponant owner because, very often, the rigs are owned by conglomerates and they are leased or chartered.  Therefore, it is essential that the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; should be as all-embracing as possible to avoid the pitfalls in the marine sector.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (c) of the Bill deals with the removal of offshore installations.  When granting permission to remove an installation, it should be incumbent that the granting of such permission would entail pollution control and the dumping of materials over the side.  I am referring to the dumping of oil and the protection applying to ships should be mandatory in this case.  A proper log of such dumping should be kept.  The Bill should also specify in detail the appropriate statutory instruments to ensure that there is adequate provision of safety equipment, fire fighting and lifesaving appliances on the installation.</P>
      <P>The question of the person in charge for the purpose of abandonment of the installation is critical because such a person should be truly competent and he should have overall control and responsibility during abandonment.  That means we must ensure that lines of demarcation are clearly drawn.  I refer in particular to the experience of the sea gem.  That rig capsized, following the loss of a leg in the North Sea, with a consequent loss of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> On that occasion there was no person on the rig with the expertise to evacuate such a structure safely.  Therefore, the Bill must in this instance clearly distinguish between an operation explorations manager <i>vis-à-vis</i> a fully qualified master mariner as we have on a vessel.  I suggest to the Minister that he should give careful consideration to this distinction in competence to abandon.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister that he should satisfy himself that the arrangements on the <i>Alpha</i> or the <i>Bravo</i> off Kinsale at present are adequate for abandonment. I also question the provision of adequately sized support vessels which should be able to go to the assistance of installations and their personnel in all weather conditions.  There is a natural tendency to have a small vessel on standby and, generally speaking, this would meet the requirements of the Bill but we must inquire if such a vessel would be sufficient in all types of weather.  Could it, for instance, go to the assistance of the installation in the severest storm conditions? Why is there nothing in the Bill to specify the distance a standby vessel can be from the installation itself?  Again, I point to the experience of the <i>Betelgeuse.</i> At the time of the disaster the tugs were around the back of the island almost half a mile away.  I suggest that it is absolutely essential that we specify exactly what we mean by having a vessel on station.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with training.  I contend that training creates a meritocracy in itself and that surely this must be the key to an orderly development of the industry when we are fortunate enough to have further finds of oil and gas off our coasts. I see training as being partly funded by private industry which has a vested interest in its proper development and partly by the State by using marginal costs of the existing resources which are available to us such as those at the Regional Technical College in Cork where to date 500 offshore workmen have been given essential safety training.</P>
    <P>Finally, mention has been made of jurisdiction in section 4.  This is an area <Col N="1613" /> which needs clarification.  I ask the Minister to consider his authority on an offshore floating exploration vessel in international waters, especially where it is proposed for a garda to visit the installation. I find no mention of such an eventuality in the proposed Bill and I am not certain if, in fact, the right exists.  I suggest therefore that such a provision in the Bill should be a condition for the issuing of a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill again.  It would be fair to say that there was no onus on the Minister to bring the Bill before the House.  He could have attempted to have his own Bill passed.  This Bill, which I am sure is supported by all sides of the House, seeks to increase considerably offshore exploration in the interests of developing the economy.  It is right, therefore, that we should have adequate safety measures and procedures installed to protect the workers on these installations. This Bill goes a long way towards addressing the need to introduce a wide range of safety measures to protect the workers and perhaps it is surprising that this Bill has been so long in coming to the House.  There has been considerable activity off our coasts for many years and yet we have not had the benefit of such a Bill to protect those involved in offshore exploration.  It is not that this activity is new to us.  We have the example off the UK mainland around the coast of Scotland where this activity has been going on for up to 20 years.  As far as safety is concerned they have had their own experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that this Bill has been brought before this House and, regardless of what amendments are put down by the Minister or Deputies, I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through the House.  It is in the interests of all those involved in offshore exploration that the position in terms of safety and where responsibility lies for the various aspects of safety and welfare and so on on installations should be clearly spelled out.  I am very pleased to see the reference to the installation <Col N="1614" /> manager in section 10.  That is one of the crucial areas in the legislation we are now considering.  It is all very well to have various measures relating to safety passed in this House but if there is no person or persons clearly designated with responsibility to ensure that the legislation is implemented on the ground, there is a specific weakness in the legislation. It is for that reason that the work of the installation manager is of crucial importance.  It is important that his role should be clearly spelled out so that there is no doubt as to where the onus of responsibility lies in deciding on whether an installation is to be used and put into operation, in deciding on how a rig is to be properly disposed of when its useful life has passed and ensuring during the life of the installation that all fittings, equipment and fixtures are in good working order.</P>
    <P>On the passing of this legislation the Minister is to acquire substantial new powers and I welcome this.  He will have to consult with some of his colleagues particularly in relation to fire safety.  That is important because that aspect has not always been properly addressed.  I will be looking at the Bill very critically to see the specific references to fire safety.  If a fire occurs we could have several hundred people working on an installation far removed from the fire services and they would have to depend largely on their own facilities.  Therefore, it is very important that adequate fire safety facilities are provided on an installation and fire boats should be available should a fire occur. When fire disasters have occurred in other parts of the world the need for adequate fire fighting equipment and fire evacuation procedures was apparent.  I hope the Minister will be very conscious of this aspect when he discusses the Bill with the Minister for the Environment. As exploration increases off our coasts this Bill will play an important role in ensuring the safety of those involved in exploration and it is only right that the other areas of responsibility should be highlighted, as they are, in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, the duties of the installation manager in relation to safety equipment <Col N="1615" /> and other safety procedures cannot be overstated.  If his responsibilities are not clearly outlined there is a weakness in the Bill.  The other aspects relating to welfare of workers on the installation are also very important.  It has often been the case in the past that new industries have not been adequately prepared to protect their workers and to ensure their welfare. Particularly in the chemical industry, it was only after the establishment of new industries that it was realised that specific safety procedures were required.  The same applies to offshore installations where workers have to wear a certain type of clothing and have to carry safety equipment.  All these issues have to be addressed and are being addressed in the Bill and it may be that the Minister and other Deputies may wish to add further to the provisions covering these issues.  It would be a pity if shortcomings were still evident in the Bill following its passage through this House.  Our purpose is to try to ensure that that situation does not arise.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and I hope following its passage it will take immediate effect for the benefit of workers on the installations.  I hope it will clarify this country's position on exploration by foreign companies in our international waters and on the protection of workers.  I understand that in the region of 100 workers have already been recruited.  I hope the legislation will protect our people and those who work in our waters.  I should like to compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank those who contributed to the debate, Deputies Birmingham, O'Malley, O'Sullivan and Swift and tell them that any amendments put forward for Committee Stage will be examined by those involved in this work. The reason we were keen to bring forward the legislation was that it has been a long time in preparation.  Officials in <Col N="1616" /> the Department worked on it for a considerable length of time and it is our duty to ensure that the Bill, when passed, will last for a long time.  Deputy Birmingham asked about the FUE and the ICTU and I should like to tell him that they have been kept fully informed.  They do not have any objections to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I understand that the FUE have certain reservations and are discussing them with my officials.  Those reservations may be reflected in amendments on Committee Stage, if we accept the wisdom of the points they make.  What Deputy O'Malley said about those in the front line is correct.  I should like to tell the House that the interim board will be engaged full time in the new framework under the Bill I hope to introduce in the new year. The Barrington Commission and the industrial inspectorate who are advising me on this legislation are working with the interim board.  There is liaison between them.  The provisions of the Bill before us are broadly in line with the spirit of Barrington.</P>
      <P>Deputy Birmingham asked about the qualifications of the inspectorate and I should like to tell him that over the years those officials inspected most of the exploration rigs.  They are concerned with marine work and other disciplines and I do not think there is any need for concern about their qualifications.  The inspectorate have also attended many courses at home and abroad.  Offshore installation managers tend to have qualifications in offshore work and the Department do not have any problem in regard to having experts in this area.  We have well qualified people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised about the constitutionality of the jurisdiction.  I am sure Deputy Birmingham, a former Minister of State at the Department of Labour, is aware that that was the reason for considerable delay in the preparation of the legislation.  The definitions in section 2 (1) which deals with &ldquo;the territorial seas of the State&rdquo; and the designated areas, together with section 3 (2) covering the applications, describe the activities which will come within the jurisdiction of the Act.  The provisions of the Act will apply <Col N="1617" /> to installations and waters including the territorial seas of the State, broadly the sea between the three mile limit set down by section 3 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, and the sea areas to which the internal or inland waters are extended under section 5 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959.  They also include the waters in the area designated under the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.  The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea prescribes a 12 mile limit instead of three miles but Ireland has not yet ratified that convention.</P>
    <P>The question of arbitration with Britain is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and I understand that it is under review by them.  I should like to tell Deputy O'Malley that section 5 (7) provides that notice of proposed regulations must be published and that interested parties have 21 days within which to make any representations in regard to them.  Interested parties will have that length of time to consider any change in the regulations before the Minister will put them into force.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised a question about exemptions and wondered about the vagueness of them.  Before issuing an exemption which must be in writing and which must refer to a particular time span the Minister must be of the opinion that to insist on compliance would not be reasonable.  The guiding norm to determine what is or is not reasonable are (1) the amount of work involved; (2) the number of employees actual or expected; (3) the duration of the work or any other circumstances.  This power of exemption will enable common sense flexibility to be exercised.  It is important to ensure that operations are not hindered and I am sure the Deputy will agree with that. The Minister would be able to avail of the advice of the industrial inspectors when considering any exemption.</P>
    <P>On the point made by the Deputy regarding attractive licensing, we agree that there might have been a difficulty in the past which we hope to avoid in future; that is a matter for the Minister for Energy.  He answered questions recently in the House, but also said that with <Col N="1618" /> regard to our licensing terms in general they are competitive with those prevailing in western Europe.  The Minister said that the review is being carried out in the Department of Energy and when that has been completed he would take whatever additional steps were necessary to accelerate exploration activity in our designated offshore areas.  He said he hoped to carry out that review in the short term rather than in a drawn-out period.  The Bill provides for the certification of rigs.  Most of these entering Irish waters would carry the certificate of one of the internationally recognised authorities such as Lloyds, which worked through the agency of the IIRS.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of the responsibility of the instruction managers <i>vis-à-vis</i> captains of the supply boats.  Instruction managers will have overall responsibility for safety and can direct captains on what to do in relation to safety, while the captain is responsible for the management of the ship.  The OIM has general responsibility for matters of health, safety or welfare on the installation.  He has also general responsibility for maintenance of order and discipline connected with safety, health or welfare.  For the purpose of discharging these general responsibilities the manager is invested with authority over all persons on or about the installation.  The authority of the manager, however, does not extend to matters which are the responsibility of other persons, such as the master, captain or person in charge of the vessel, helicopter or other aircraft, hovercraft or lighthouse.  It is on safety matters that the manager holds responsibility.</P>
    <P>A point was raised about the non-use of the Irish workforce at senior level. AnCO has been mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan as having done a good job in being actively involved in recent years in training for offshore workers.  Much of this training is done in Cork Regional Technical College.  The benefits of this training would show in the future.  The question of training as a pre-condition of employment was also raised by Deputy O'Sullivan with regard to 27 workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> The existence of agreements since 1985 between the FUE and the ITGWU require all offshore employees to have completed fire fighting and survival courses.  That is a positive development in terms of safety awareness.  Over 570 persons have completed the AnCO courses held at Cork RTC.  There were some recent incidents of workers falsifying documentation to show that they had completed such courses.  That matter is under review.  I have given an undertaking to Deputy O'Sullivan to see, as far as I can, what I can do.  I have already given that assurance on Question Time but will follow it through to see what can be done about 27 workers mentioned who did not take up the option and avail of these courses.  The Deputy will appreciate the difficulties.  A point was raised about existing protection for offshore workings at present in operation.  These are to comply with safety instructions for offshore petroleum operations issued in February 1983.  The standards, if complied with, are high.</P>
    <P>Deputy Swift welcomed the Bill and spoke about exemptions.  The main thing about the exemptions is to allow flexibility between different installations, as between exploration and exploitation. This matter will be discussed on Committee Stage.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about fire-fighting techniques.  A programme for these has been prepared by the Health Safety Commission in Britain. That is being examined here.  This programme is available to inspectors here and I gather that it is recommended to industry in matters of offshore exploration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe spoke about pollution.  That, again, is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  The Deputy also asked about life safety appliances to be employed.  He asked of the <i>Alpha</i> and the <i>Brava</i> as to whether they had suitable and adequate life saving facilities.  This depends on conditions, visability and traffic in the area of the rigs. Deputy O'Keeffe also mentioned the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  The Bill defines the owner <Col N="1620" /> as being the person having the management of the installation.  The Bill sets that out very clearly and there should be no grounds for misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Swift made a point about regulations, particularly about concurrence rather than merely consultation with the Minister for Energy.  Section 5 (1) (b) provides for regulations relating to hovercraft, helicopters, other aircraft vessels, radio facilities or services or rescue facilities being made only after consultation with the Minister and with the concurrence of the Minister for Communications. It is not just a question of notifying people; it is a matter of going into agreements.</P>
    <P>This Bill is technical enough.  I was anxious to bring it forward because of the general responsibility which rests with the Department of ensuring the safety, health and welfare of the workers involved in offshore installations.  This is an area which is being promoted and is growing and I am glad of the words of support from the Deputies.  The Government will be able now to make progress. None of the safety protection statutes applies to such installations.  It is the old limboland.  As the law stands, the rules of the sea for offshore petroleum development production operations are based on the Petroleum and other Minerals Act.  The only power in that Act is the revoking of a licence, but that is not desirable.</P>
    <P>I am trying to get proper procedures as regards the safety of workers.  We have not all that we want, but after Barrington we will have all that we want onshore.  At least there is substantial legislation now in that regard from the old Factories Act, the Office Premises Acts and others which Deputy Birmingham in particular mentioned.  In the most dangerous and hazardous area where members of the community work at great risk offshore they are not protected by that legislation which covers people in far safer employment. The figures I read out earlier about the experience of offshore employment in the North Sea shows exactly how hazardous and difficult this job is.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support from all parties <Col N="1621" /> in the House for the speedy passage of this Bill.  With the agreement of the Whips, I hope Committee Stage can be taken at a very early date.  We are now into the season for this employment. There are over 100 people employed at present and I hope more will be taken on in the coming weeks.  It is an obligation on us that after a long number of years this legislation be passed by the House. I thank the Members who spoke for their positive contributions and I look forward to their co-operation in bringing this Bill through Committee Stage at an early date.</P>

      <P>Is é cuspóir an Bhille seo ná an uasteorainn £50 milliún atá leagtha síos in alt a 23 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, do na hairleacain as an bPríomh-Chiste chuig Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhéadú go dtí £60 milliún.  Sroiseadh an uasteorainn £50 milliún i mí na Nollag seo caite agus tá sé riachtanach í a ardú anois le go bhféadfar tuilleadh airleacan a chur ar fáil don Údarás.  Is cruthú é an Bhille seo &mdash; má bhí gá lena leithéid &mdash; go bhfuil an Rialtas i ndáiríre maidir le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus maidir le soláthar airgid a chur ar fáil don Údarás chun brú ar aghaidh leis an obair thábhachtach atá ar siúl acu chun na críche sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuirtear soláthar caipitil ar fáil don Údarás ar dhá bhealach: deontas-i-gcabhair <Col N="1622" /> trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta: caipiteal vótáilte a ghlaotar ar sin; agus airleacain inaisíoctha ón bPríomh-Chiste: caipiteal neamhvótáilte a ghlaotar air sin.  Úsáidtear caipiteal vótáilte chun deontais a íoc mar chabhair chun tionscail nó scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bhunú, a fhorbairt nó a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Caitear airleacain ar mhonarchana a thógáil, scaireanna a cheannach i bhfochuideachtaí agus i gcomhchuideachtaí agus chun maoin a cheannach.  Sa bhliain reatha tá suimeanna caipitil mar seo a leanas údaraithe ag an Rialtas don Údarás: caipiteal vótailte £8.52 mhilliún agus airleacain £5 mhilliún.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach foilsíodh tuarascáil thábhachtach Chomhchoiste an Oireachtais um Chomhlachtaí Stát-tionscanta Tráchtála ar an Údarás anuraidh. Tá na moltaí sa tuarascáil chuimsitheach sin á scrúdu go fóill.</P>
    <P>Is den riachtanas é ar aon nós go mbeadh sochar maith le fáil as an airgead Stáit a chuirtear ar fáil don Údarás mar airleacain &mdash; agus go deimhin mar dheon-tais-i-gcabhair freisin &mdash; agus chuige sin tá iarrtha ar an Údarás scrúdú iomlán a dhéanamh ar a chuid sócmhainní le cinn-tiú go mbeidh an sochar is fearr is féidir le gnóthú astu agus trí chritéir dhaingne a leagan síos go mbeidh luach a chuid airgid le fáil ag an Stát as caiteachas as airleacain.</P>
    <P>Is d'fhonn fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta a théann an tÚdarás faoi chaiteachas caipitil &mdash; idir airleacain agus deontais.  Léirítear i dTuarascáil agus Cuntais na heagraíochta don bhliain 1985 atá leagtha faoi bhráid na Dála go raibh 4,659 nduine ag obair go lánaimseartha ar 31 Nollaig 1985 sna tionscail uile a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra/ón Údarás.  Is cúis sásaimh é gur éirigh leis an Údarás an fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoina scáth a mhéadú don cheathrú bliain as a chéile i 1985 agus, lena chois sin, infheistíocht thábhachtach bhreise a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht trí fhiontair nua.  Ag deireadh na bliana 1985 bhí méadú 254 ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail faoi choimirce an Údaráis i gcomparáid <Col N="1623" /> leis an líon a bhí fostaithe i dtús na bliana sin.  Is ionann é sin agus méadú 5.7 faoin gcéad ar an bhfostaíocht lánaimseartha. Ní beag an dul chun cinn é sin ag féachaint don tionchar atá ag an gcúlú eacnam-aíochta ar fhostaíocht a chruthú agus a chaomhnú sa tír.  Níl figiúirí cruinne ar fáil go fóill faoin bhfostaíocht ag deireadh 1986 ach tuigim ón Údarás go meastar go raibh líon beag daoine sa bhreis ag obair go lánaimseartha sna tionscail faoina scáth ar 31 Nollaig 1986 i gcomparáid leis an dáta céanna sa bhliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Táim sásta mar sin go bhfuil dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh ag an Údarás d'fhonn fostaíocht shocrach a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  I dtaca leis sin tá béim ar leith á cur ar fhorbairt acmhainní nádúrtha sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Maidir le feirmeoireacht éisc, tá an tÚdarás sásta go bhfuil fás mór i ndán don tionscal sin sa Ghaeltacht, áit a bhfuil suíomhanna oiriúnacha ar fáil, go háirithe ar chósta an iarthair.  Faoi láthair tá breis is 100 duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha agus timpeall 40 duine go páirt-aimseartha ar fud na Gaeltachta sa tionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc agus meastar go bhféadfar suas le 500 post lánaimseartha a chruthú sa tionscal sin sa Ghaeltacht thar tréimhse 10-15 bliana.</P>
    <P>Bhí an tÚdarás mar cheannródaí sa tír seo i bhforbairt fheirmeoireacht éisc le deich mbliana anuas.  Mar léiriú ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta is i gcomhlachtaí a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás a tháirgítear suas le 70 faoin gcéad de na bradáin a thagann ó fheirmeacha éisc sa tír seo faoi láthair. Tá mé dóchasach go mbeifear in ann cur leis an bhforbairt sin le deiseanna fostaíochta breise a sholáthar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is mar chabhair chun poist bhreise a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht atáim ag iarraidh ar an Dáil glacadh leis an mBille gairid seo.</P>

      <P>Seo é an chéad uair a raibh seans agam labhairt ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta anseo sa Dáil agus ba mhaith liom ar dtús comhgháirdeas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as mo chontae féin a bhí ina iar-Aire Ghaeltachta, agus gabhaim mo chomh-gháirdeas leis as ucht an cheapacháin <Col N="1624" /> atá aige.

      <P>Tugann an Bille seo seans dúinn labhairt, ní amháin faoin Údarás ach go deimhin freisin faoi na Gaeltachtaí, faoi staid na Gaeilge agus nithe mar sin, go coitianta, a bhfuil baint acu leis an Údarás agus cumhachtaí an Údaráis.  Bhí brón orm toisc nár cheap an Taoiseach Aire iomlán mar Aire don Ghaeltacht, agus cé go bhfuil an tAire Stáit as mo chontae féin, tá sé faoi bhráid Roinn an Taoisigh, agus seo athrú mar le blianta anuas bhí Aire Gaeltachta go hiomlán ann do na Gaeltachtaí.

Mar sin, bhí díomá orm toisc nár ghlac sé leis an gceapachán a bheith mar Aire iomlán.</P>
      <P>Ag an am céanna is dócha leis an ngearradh siar atá ar siul taobh istigh de gach uile Roinn faoi láthair gur chóir go mbeadh beagáinín sástachta orainn gurb é an t-aon Mheastachán amháin nár lagh-daíodh nuair a tháinig an Rialtas i gcumhacht. Is dócha gur meon é sin ón Rialtas go bhfuil siad sásta go bhfuil dóthain airgid ann chun rudaí a chur chun cinn i mbliana.  Is féidir dhá thaobh a bheith leis an scéal sin, ach ar chor ar bith gur seo an t-aon Mheastachán amháin nár laghd-aíodh ó tháinig an Rialtas i gcumhacht. Tá súil agam freisin go nglacfaidh an tAire Stáit leis an obair a bhí á déanamh ag iar-Aire na Gaeltachta, is é sin Pádraig Ó Tuathail, nach bhfuil, faraor, linn faoi láthair, duine as mo chontae féin a rinne an-obair leis an Údarás le cúpla bliain anuas ó thaobh tacaíocht agus airgead a thabhairt dó chun go mbeadh an tÚdarás in ann jobanna agus postanna a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dócha gur rud sásúil a fheiceáil sa tuarascáil go bhfuil an líon daoine atá fostaithe go hiomlán sna Gaeltachtaí ag dul i méid le cúpla bliain anuas.  Agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an tAire Stáit brú ar an Taoiseach, nuair ba chóir, chun an tacaíocht sin a bheith ann an t-am ar fad i dtreo is go mbeimis in ann tuilleadh fostaíocht agus tuilleadh postanna a chur <Col N="1625" /> ar fáil taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí, go mór mhór do mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin.</P>
    <P>Aontaím le cuspóir an Bhille an uasteorainn a ardú go £60 milliún, ach níl mé cinnte an mbeidh dóthain airgid anseo: is dócha go gcaithfidh an tAire Stáit teacht ar ais chuig an Teach chun an uasteorainn a ardú arís as seo amach nuair a bheidh an t-ardú seo caite ag an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla pointí go ginearálta a lua.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ag an Aire Stáit faoi na deontais i leith seirbhísí a chur ar fáil a bhíodh ann cúpla bliain ó sin ó thaobh turasóireachta de agus ó thaobh ghnáthshaol na ndaoine taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí.  Bhí sé seo an-thábhachtach. Sa Teach seo leis na blianta anuas bhíodh raic ar siúl faoi na deontais chéanna, agus tá a fhios agam go maith gurb é mo pháirtí féin i Rialtas a chuir stop leis na deontais a bhí ann ag an uair sin.  Dá mbeadh post amháin nó níos mó curtha ar bun ó thaobh na seirbh-íse de, agus dá dtabharfadh an tÚdarás cabhair do chomharchumann nó pé duine a chuirfeadh seirbhís éigin agus post nó dhó nó níos mó ar fáil a thógfadh duine nó beirt ón &ldquo;dole&rdquo;, sílim go mbeadh sé sin tábhachtach.  Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an scéim sin.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh turasóireachta de, deirtear linn go bhfuil sé seo ar an tionscal is mó atá ag fás ar fud an domhain.  Agus go deimhin, os rud é go bhfuil an chuid is mó de na Gaeltachtaí ar chósta na hÉireann sílim go bhfuil an-scóip ansin fás níos mó a chur ar bun, agus sílim ó thaobh tacaíocht deontais le seirbhísí a chur ar fáil go bhfuil an-spéis sa turasóireacht, agus ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé sin faoi bhráid an Aire.  Freisin, aont-aím leis an méid atá i ráiteas an Aire faoi chúrsaí iascaireachta agus fheirmeoireacht éisc.  Bhí mé ag féachaint le déanaí ar chlár teilifíse faoi seo.  Níor baineadh an úsáid cheart riamh as an fharraige atá thart timpeall orainn.  Is le cúpla bliain anuas atá an tsuim á hardú agus an t-airgead á chaitheamh isteach ann.  Sílim go bhfuil neart fostaíochta agus neart jabanna le fáil ag an bpróiseáil éisc.  Tá a <Col N="1626" /> fhios ag an Aire féin é seo go maith.  Agus aontaím leis sa mhéid atá ráite aige anseo faoin treoir, mar a déarfá, atá tugtha ag an Údarás le cúpla bliain anuas óna thaobh sin de.  Os rud é go bhfuil Roinn na Mara curtha ar bun anois níor mhaith liomsa go mbeadh an Roinn sin ag maíomh as an obair atá déanta le cúpla bliain anuas, ach go mbeadh comhoibriú agus tacaíocht á dtabhairt idir an dá Roinn, idir an Údarás agus Roinn na Mara, leis an phróiseáil éisc agus an fheirmeoireacht éisc a chur ar bun.  Ón taobh sin de freisin, ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire Stáit an brú ó thaobh chúrsaí dlí de.  Sílm, ón gclár teilifíse sin a chonaic mé, go bhfuil deacrachtaí go fóill leis na ceadúnais a thabhairt do na daoine ar mhian leo dul isteach i gcúrsaí iascaireachta, agus níl rud ar bith a chuireann as do dhuine níos mó ná a bheith ag fanacht gan rud ar bith ag tarlú.  Más féidir rud a dhéanamh ansin go luath ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire Stáit cibé brú is féidir leis a dhéanamh ó thaobh iascaireachta de.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin go mbeadh níos mó béime ar chúrsaí tionscail a mhealladh isteach ná mar atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair ach go mbeadh díospóireachtaí roimhré idir na comharchumainn agus muintir na háite, an chomhairle chontae, ó thaobh pleanála de, agus go mbeadh gach eolas ag gach uile dhuine sula rachadh tionscal mar sin isteach in áit ar bith. Mar tá a fhios againn go léir, bíonn raic á hardú agus trioblóid ar siúl nuair a thagann tionscal isteach in áit ar bith agus ní bhíonn an t-eolas ar fad faoi ag muintir na háite.  Agus má dhéantar sin go luath is féidir linn a rá go mbeidh fostaíocht agus níos mó jabanna ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go mór mhór.  Agus, mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit ar an raidió ar maidin beidh níos mó jabanna curtha ar fáil do fhir na nGaeltachtaí.  Tá an iascaireacht an-oiriúnach do na Gaeltachtaí os rud é go bhfuil an chuid is mó díobh ar chósta na hÉireann, agus tá sé an-oiriúnach an sórt tionscail seo a chur ar bun.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire Stáit a dhícheall é sin a dhéanamh lena Roinn féin agus leis an Údarás.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> Sílim freisin go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh oifigigh an Údaráis amuigh i measc na ndaoine níos mó.  Sílim go bhfuil sórt meoin ag daoine go bhfuil na hoifigigh seo an t-am ar fad thuas i gContae na Gaillimhe.  Ba cheart dóibh dul amach i measc mhuintir na Gaeltach-taí níos minice agus an t-eolas faoi céard go díreach atá le fáil ón Údarás agus ó na Ranna Stáit eile a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Tá scileanna áirithe ar fud na nGaeltachtaí &mdash; is féidir le duine ar bith sin a rá &mdash; ach ba mhaith liom go mbeadh cúrsaí curtha ar bun chun ní amháin eolas a thabhairt do mhuintir na háite faoi cibé atá ar fáil dóibh ach freisin na scileanna seo a fhorbairt ionas go mbeidh siad in ann fostaíocht a bhaint amach dóibh féin nuair a chuirfear na tionscail ar bun sna Gaeltachtaí áirithe.</P>
    <P>Ón taobh sin de, tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go maith go bhfuil oifigí ar fud na tíre ag an Údarás.  Tá ceann, mar is eol dó, i mBéal an Mhuirthead inár nDáil-cheantar féin, fiú amháin, agus níl sé seo ar oscailt ach dhá lá sa tseachtain.  Sílim freisin nach bhfuil oifigeach ag freastal uirthi, mar nár líon an tÚdarás an áit nuair ba chóir dóibh.  Toisc an choisc &mdash; embargo &mdash; atá curtha ar bun ag an Rialtas faoi láthair ní féidir é a líonadh ach i gcásanna speisialta.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéarfadh an tAire Stáit leis an Taoiseach go mba chóir an post a líonadh go luath ionas go mbeidh oifigeach ó Chontae na Gaillimhe ag freastal ar Bhéal an Mhuirthead agus na trí Gaeltachtaí atá againne, is iad sin Tuar Mhic Éadaigh, Acaill agus Béal an Mhuirthead, agus an jab a dhéanamh i gceart.  An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta go bhfuil siad siúd atá ag fáil deontas agus tacaíocht agus cabhair ón Údarás, ag déanamh a ndóthain don teanga agus don chultúr Gaelach go ginearálta? Sílim go bhfuil caighdeán sách ard Gaeilge taobh istigh den Údarás féin ach go bhfuil dearcadh taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí nach mbíonn seans mar ba chóir ag muintir na nGaeltachtaí na postanna a bhaint amach a thagann ar bord taobh istigh den Údarás.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé seo fíor nó nach bhfuil, <Col N="1628" /> ach de réir dealraimh tá an dearcadh sin ann ar fud na tíre agus b'fhéidir go ndéarfaidh an tAire rud éigin faoi.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil rud ar bith le rá ag an Aire Stáit faoi staid na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.  Sílim go bhfuil sí beo bríomhar i gcuid de na Gaeltachtaí.  Bhí mé ag féachaint le déanaí ar an méid faoin gcéad de na deontais £10 atá siad á bhfáil i nGaeltachtaí áirithe agus téann sé ó cúig faoin gcéad suas go dtí 60 nó 65 faoin gcéad i nGaeltachtaí áirithe.  Ón taobh sin de agus ón tamall beag a chaith mé féin san Roinn Oideachais tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh meon ceart faoin teanga Ghaeilge ag muinteoirí ar fud na nGaeltachtaí. Tá sé sin fíorthábhachtach, freisin, ó thaobh cúrsaí samhraidh, sna bunscoileanna go háirithe Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go maith go bhfuil cuid acu ar siúl i bhfoirgintí fíordhona.  Tá ceann acu thíos i gCeathrú Thaidhg i gContae Mhaigh Eo agus níl a fhios agam an bhfuil cead ag an Údarás nó ag an Roinn féin iad seo a dheisiú ionas go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éasca ag na múinteoirí agus fiú ag na daltaí a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh in áiteacha níos deise ná mar atá acu faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag eisteacht freisin leis an gCairdinéal Ó Fiaich le déanaí agus dúirt seisean gurb é Tuaisceart na hÉireann an ceannaire, mar a déarfá, ó thaobh cultúir de agus ó thaobh fhorbairt na teanga faoi láthair.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé sin fíor &mdash; cuireann sé an brú orainn thíos anseo &mdash; agus ba chóir go mbeadh freagra ar tuairim an Chairdinéil agus a bhfuil thús ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus uathu siúd a bhfuil spéis acu sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghaeilge thíos anseo.</P>
    <P>Is dócha go bhfuil amhras ar chuid de na daoine faoi chursaí tógála taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí agus sílim go bhfuil sé tagtha chun barr go mbíonn i bhfad níos mó caiteachais ag dul amach ar fhoirgnimh agus ar na monarchana ná mar a theastaigh ar dtús.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta leis na torthaí a thagann as an méid airgid a chaitear as tógáil na monarchana seo.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh iniúchadh an-ghéar aige ar an bpointe sin i dtreo is go mbeidh sé <Col N="1629" /> sásta is go mbeimid go léir sásta go bhfuil toradh maith á fháil againn ar an méid airgid atá á chaitheamh ar thógáil monarchana agus mar sin agus go mbeidh sé in ann a chruthú go cinnte dearfa go bhfuil an t-airgead seo á chaitheamh go maith.</P>
    <P>Rud eile, faoin gcabhair agus tacaíocht airgid a thugann an tÚdarás do na féilte agus na comórtais ar fud na tíre, sílim go bhfuil cuid mhaith acu seo i gContae na Gaillimhe arís.  Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta, sin comortas an-mhór, rud tábhachtach go sóisialta agus do chúrsaí eacnamaíochta i rith an tsamraidh do na Gaeltachtaí.  Níl ach £300 a thabhairt don chomórtas sin agus sílim go bhfuil níos mó ná míle go leith á thabhairt do Fhéile na gCurachaí.  Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh liosta tugtha dúinn faoi na suimeanna áirithe atá an tÚdarás ag tabhairt do na féilte atá thart ar fud na tíre.  Agus ón taobh sin de, sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh oifigigh an Údaráis i measc mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí níos minice ionas go mbeadh siad in ann an t-eolas seo a thabhairt doibh agus do na foirne atá ag iarraidh cabhrach agus tac-aíochta.</P>
    <P>Bhí an tAire Stáit ag caint ar maidin, faoi theilifís don Ghaeltacht, agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé ag feitheamh ar thuarascáil a bheidh ag teacht amach faoi seo go luath, agus mar a dúirt sé tá ansuim ag an Taoiseach féin i gcúrsaí teilifíse don Ghaeltacht.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil costas curtha ar bun faoi cé mhéad ba chóir a chaitheamh air seo.  Bheadh sé an-tábhachtach ceart go leor, ach fanfaidh mé tamall beag go bhfeicfidh mé céard a thiocfas as suim an Taoisigh i leith theilifís don Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios agam freisin go mbeidh airgead ag teacht ón National Lottery don teanga Ghaeilge agus níl a fhios agam an bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire Stáit féin go fóill cé mhéad airgid a thiocfas as sin nó an bhfuil plean leagtha amach aige leis an airgead a chaitheamh, an teanga a fhorbairt agus an cultúr a chaomhnú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh. B'fhéidir go ndearfadh sé rud éigin faoi.</P>
    <P>Freisin bhí mé ag léamh ar an pháipéar le déanaí faoin aighneas seo a bhí ar siúl cúpla bliain ó shin faoi Chairpéadaí G.T. Teo.  Is dócha gur léigh an tAire Stáit féin <Col N="1630" /> é seo.  Ní mian liomsa raic a chur ar bun arís sa Teach ach b'fhéidir, má tá freagra aige faoi adúirt an breitheamh agus faoin bhfadhb seo, go ndéarfaidh sé rud éigin faoi freisin.  Tá plean leagtha amach ag an Údarás sa chlár a théann ó 1984 go 1988 agus déarfaidh mé leis anois go mbeidh mé ag cur ceisteanna air faoin bplean seo agus cúrsaí go ginearálta taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht as seo amach.  Ach ar an ráiteas atá tugtha isteach ar an Aire Stáit sa Teach seo aon-taímid leis agus níl mé cinnte ag an bpointe seo an bhfuil a dhóthain airgid curtha isteach aige ag an uasteorainn sin agus sílim má dhéanann sé a chuid oibre go maith &mdash; agus tabharfaidh mise chuile thacaíocht dó sin a dhéanamh &mdash; go gcaithfear teacht ar ais arís anseo agus breis airgead a lorg ón Stát roimh dheireadh na bliana.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Chomhairle, ar son an Pháirtí Dhaonlathaigh ba mhaith liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo. Níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil gá leis.  Sé an t-aon mholadh atá ann an uasteorainn £50 million atá leagtha síos san Acht ar ar bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhéadú go dtí £60 milliún, agus ar ndóigh, mura ndéanfaimís sin anois b'ionann sin agus stop a chor le hobair Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus tá mo Pháirtí ag tabhairt tacaíocht do phríomhaidhm an Údaráis. Beidh sé i gceist againn gach cabhair mar pháirtí polaitiúil sa Teach seo a thabhairt don Aire chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear a dhóthain airgid ar fáil agus go mbeidh an tÚdarás in ann leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair dheacair atá aige, sé sin mar phríomhaidhm tionscail a mhealladh isteach sna ceantracha Gaeltachta ionas go mbeidh obair ar fáil sna ceantracha sin ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge bheo á labhairt ag na daoine fós.  Ba mhaith liom, ós é seo an chéad uair gur labhair mé anseo sa Dáil nua seo, comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire, an Teachta Gallagher, atá air ais arís i gceannas ar Roinn na Gaeltachta mar Aire Stáit.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh ré chiúin fáis agus forbartha arís ag an Údarás faoi stiúir an Aire seo.  Tá súil agam, agus táim cinnte nach dtar-lóidh sé go rachaimid ar ais chuig ré na <Col N="1631" /> conspóide agus na raice a bhí ann le roinnt blianta anuas faoin iar-Aire.  Cé go ngoilleann sé ormsa go gcaillfeadh éinne a shuíochán sa Teach seo, mar sin féin, caithfidh mé a admháil nach raibh mé róshásta le linn na mblianta sin, an chaoi a raibh an t-iar-Aire ag feidhmiú ó thaobh an Údaráis agus rudaí eile a bhain leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom chomh maith comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht an méid airgid a d'éirigh leis a fháil ón Rialtas le haghaidh a Roinne agus go háirithe an méid airgid atá curtha ar fáil aige don Mheastachán don bhliain 1987 do Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé tábhachtach go gcuirfimís in iúl don Dáil cad iad na figiúirí.  Má chaithimid súil siar chuig an mbliain 1986, níor cuireadh ar fáil ach £4.1 mhilliún do chaiteachas caipitil Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá an tAire ag cur £8.5 mhilliún ar fáil i mbliana.  Glacaim gur méadaíodh an figiúr sin le linn na bliana sin, ach b'shin an méid a cuireadh ar fáil &mdash; bhí méadú beag suas go £5.1 mhilliún ach bhí an-deacracht ag Údarás na Gaeltachta de bharr an ghearradh siar a rinneadh ar airgead chaipitil don Údarás ag an gComhrialtas a bhí ann roimhe seo.  Cé go seasann mó Pháirtí go laidir i gcoinne aon mhéadú ar chaiteachas Stáit go ginearálta glacaimid leis ó thaobh an Údaráis go bhfuil siad ag deileáil le ceantracha iargúlta, an t-aon áit ina bhfuil an teanga beo fós, nach raibh ann ach feirmeacha beaga, portaigh agus, in áiteanna, tionscail bheaga iascaireachta agus gan chabhair ó Ranna Stáit speisialta.  Ní bheadh an 4,500 post ann faoi láthair atá ann agus monarchana nua aimseartha bunaithe ann ach amháin de bharr go raibh údarás faoi leith ar fáil go raibh cúram na gceantracha sin orthu chun monarchana agus chun forbairt a mhealladh isteach iontu.  Tá, obair fhíor-thábhachtach don Stát ar bun ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  An drochrud, nach raibh meas ag an sean-Rialtas ar an nGaeilge agus ar na ceantracha sin, mar dá mbeadh an meas sin acu bheadh sé cinnte go gcuirfeadh siad i bhfad níos mó airgid ar fáil ná mar a cuireadh.</P>

      <P>Beidh seans ag an Teachta seo.  Tá mise ag breathnú ar na figiúirí atá foilsithe agus tá an tAire é féin tar éis iad a lua sa mhéid adúirt sé.  Thar aon ní eile tá caomhnú na Gaeilge ag brath go mór ar shlánú agus ar fhorbairt na nGaeltachtaí agus ar chaomhnú agus forbairt na Gaeilge laistigh de na Gaeltachtaí féin.  Dá gcaillfí an Ghaeilge bheo mar a labhartar sa Ghaeltacht í bheadh sé thar a bheith deacair an Ghaeilge a athbheochan toisc nach mbeadh aon deis ag aon foghlama na teanga í a chleachtadh go nádúrtha i measc chainteoirí dúchais.  Ní hí an Ghaeilge amháin atá an Páirtí seo agamsa ag iarraidh a chaomhnú, áfach, ach na pobail Ghaeltachta féin agus go dtarlaíonn sé gurb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáth-theanga chomh maith le chuile ghné dá gcultúr agus dá bhféin-iúlácht. Creideann an Páirtí Daonlathach gurb é an bealach is fearr le leas na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh ná deiseanna a chur ar fáil le spiorad na fiontraíochta agus na forbartha a chur chun cinn i measc mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin.</P>
      <P>Tacaíonn an Páirtí seo leis an obair ríthábhachtach atá Udarás na Gaeltachta agus Roinn na Gaeltachta ag déanamh ar mhaithe leis an bhforbairt sin.  Ach creidimid go gcaithfear cur le ról an Údaráis le cúram a dhéanamh freisin de fhorbairt shóisialta agus chultúrtha agus go mba chóir na sóirt cumhachtaí atá ag an Údarás faoi láthair a leathnú amach. Déanfaidh mé trácht beag air sin amach anseo.  Creidimise gur cheart gach deis a thapú le tionscal nua, idir thionscail bhaile agus thionscail idirnáisiúnta a mhealladh chuig na Gaeltachtaí agus a bhunú ann.  Braithimid nach bhfuil ag éirí leis an Údarás an oiread tionsclaíochta agus a d'fhéadfaí a mhealladh chun na nGaeltachtaí, agus go dtí seo ar aon nós go raibh tionscail áirithe á gcailliúint de bharr cheal airgid.  Tá súil agam anois de bharr an mhéadú ar an deontas caipitil agus ar an deontas reatha don Údarás i mbliana nach mbeidh na sóirt deacrachtaí sin acu &mdash; deacrachtaí a bhí acu go holc an bhliain seo caite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> Luann an tAire go raibh fás mór ag teacht ar thionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc, agus creidim go bhfuil a lán oibre déanta ag an Údarás ó thaobh taighde de a chruthaigh ar dtús go bhféadfaí feirmeoireacht éisc a bhunú sa tír seo a bheadh in ann brabach maith a dhéanamh.  Le roinnt blianta anuas bhí deacrachtaí ann agus ní raibh mórán brabaigh á dhéanamh, ach anois tá sórt briseadh tríd tar éis a tharlú de bharr an taighde agus an obair a rinneadh faoi chúram Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Rinne siad seo cé nach raibh aon airgead speisialta á fháil acu ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, ach d'éirigh leo mar sin féin an taighde sin a chur chun cinn agus tháinig tairbhe ón obair sin agus tá fás mór ag teacht anois ar fheirmeoireacht éisc, go háirithe na bradáin.  An cruthúnas go bhfuil an briseadh tríd sin déanta, go bhfuil comhlachtaí príobháideacha anois sásta teacht agus airgead a chur isteach sna tógraí nua seo a bhfuil cloiste againn fúthu agus cuid acu tosaithe cheana féin. Tá súil agam go gcoinneoidh an Rialtas súil ghéar ar an dul chun cinn a bheas ag teacht ar an tionscal seo amach anseo ionas go gcinnteófar go mbeidh áit ann i gcónaí do ghnáth-mhuintir na háite &mdash; gurb iad siúd a bheas fostaithe sa tionscal seo agus nach ligfidh an Rialtas do thionscal mór teacht isteach agus an brabach a bhaint amach gan aon airgead a thabhairt chun fostaíocht a choinneáil san cheantar.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire an rud a thárla san Noruaidh: cuireadh srian ar an méid tonnaí bradáin a bhfeadfar a thairgeadh i bhfeirmeoireacht éisc annsin ionnas go gcoinneofar éisc ann agus go mbeadh baint mhór ag muintir na háite leis an obair.  Molaim don Aire staidéar a dhéanamh ar an rud a tharla san tír sin agus, más féidir, an rud céanna a dhéanamh anseo.  Dhéanfadh sé an-mhaitheas do na daoine in áiteanna iargúlta.  Bímid i gcónaí ag moladh infheistíocht a dhéanamh sna hacmhainí nádúrtha, agus ó tharla an seans go mbeadh méadú mór ar an tionscal seo tá sé tábhachtach gurb iad muintir na háite a bhainfeadh an tairbhe is mó as.</P>
    <P>Is é an trua nach bhfuil aon airgead leagtha amach go speisialta ón méid <Col N="1634" /> deontas atá an tÚdarás ag fáil ón Roinn le haghaidh mariculture.  Molaim don Aire staidéar a dhéanamh ar an rud seo ionnas nach gcuirfidh sé constaic sa bhealach ar fhorbairt an tionscail nua seo.  Deir an tAire go gceapann sé go bhféadfaidh 500 postanna a chur ar fáil san tionscal seo gach bliain ar feadh deich mbliana.  Níl fhios agam cén fáth nach féidir i bhfad níos mó ná sin a dhéanamh san treimhse sin.  Creidim go bhféadfaí 1,000 postanna breise a chur ar fáil gach bliain sna Gaeltachtaí san tionscal éisc.  Tá a lán oibre os comhair an Aire.  Molaim an méid atá déanta ag an Aire cheana féin agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh tairbhe ón obair atá le déanamh aige.</P>
    <P>Tá stáisiún i gCarna i gContae na Gaillimhe a bhíonn ag plé le héisc agus le stoicéisc.  Baineann sé le hOllscoil na Gaillimhe, ach gan chabhair ón Stát, seans nach mbeidh an ollscoil in ann é a choinneáil ar siúl.  Tá tairbhe maith ón méid oibre atá déanta ag an stáisiún sin go dtí seo.  Molaim don Aire staidéar a dhéanamh air sin chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, tá tionscal na hiascaireachta sean-bhunaithe sna Gaeltachtaí os rud é go bhfuil siad ar fad suite ar an gcósta, ach níor tháinig an dul chun cinn ceart ar an tionscal sin nuair a thugaimid áireamh ar an domhain-iascaireacht a dhéanann náisiúin eile amach ón gcósta agus an brabach mór a bhaineann siad as.  Caithimid, mar sin, an tionscal seo a fhorbairt de réir a chéile.  Tá na céadta fear agus mná óga ar fud na nGaeltachtaí fostaithe sa tionscal seo.  Sa ghearr-thré-imhse, feicim gurb é an tionscal phróiseáil éisc atá níos mó aitheantais ann ó thaobh forbartha.  Tá 7,800 fostaithe ann faoí láthair, ach creidim gur féidir 1,000 postanna breise a chothú ann i gceann deich mbliana nó mar sin.  Chun tús a chur leis an fhorbairt sin, molaim gur ceart ionad speisialta bainistíochta a bhunú laistigh de Údarás na Gaeltachta chun chuile bhrainse de thionscal na hiascaireachta a chomhordú.  Creidim chomh maith gur cóir go mbéadh cúram ag Údarás na Gaeltachta an tionscal turasóirerachta a fhorbairt sna Gaeltachtaí.  Faoi láthair níl aon chead acu cabhair airgid a chur ar fáil chun turasóireacht a mhealladh agus <Col N="1635" /> a mhéadú.  Creidim, agus creideann baill Bhord an Údaráis nach bhfuil an cead sin fáighte acu go speisialta ón Aire.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil aon athrú á dhéanamh, nó ag teastáil chun é sin a dhéanamh; ní dóigh liom go bhfuil, ach amháin treoir a fháil ón Aire gur cóir dóibh pola-saí turasóireachta don cheantar sin a leagan amach.  Tá roint staidéir déanta ag an Údarás cheana féin ar an tionscal seo, ceann de na príomh fhoinsí ioncaim do phobal na nGaeltachtaí.  Chuideodh sé go mór dáa mbeadh ionad speisialta turasóireachta bunaithe laistigh de na Gaeltachtaí. Ba cheart an fhreagracht faoi ollfhorbairt agus chomhordú na turasóireachta laistigh de na Gaeltachtaí a fhágáil faoi stiúir an ionaid seo.</P>
    <P>Is féidir a rá go bhfuil dhá chineál turasóireachta cheana féin ó thaobh na nGaeltachtaí de: (1) an gnáth mhargadh don turasóireacht &mdash; turasóirí, each-trannaí, a thagann go dtí cósta iarthar na hÉireann mar gheall ar áilneacht na dúiche.  Ar an dtaobh eile, tá gnáth mhuintir na hÉireann idir daoine fásta agus gasúir a thagann go dtí na Gaeltachtaí, chun an Ghaeilge a fhóghlaim nó a n-eolas a fheabhsú.  D'fhéadfaí na daoine breise seo a mhealladh trína chinntiú go mbíonn caighdeán na cóiríochta agus na háiseanna saoire inchurtha lena mbíonn ar fáil in áiteanna eile, is é sin, sa bhaile agus i gcéin, agus níos fearr ná iad.  Aithním gur mór an tairbhe agus an tábhacht iad na coláistí samhraidh Gaeilge mar leas na ndaltaí a bhíonn ag freastal agus mar fhoinse ioncaim i ngeilleagar na nGaeltachtaí.  Tacaíonn muid go fonnmhar le forbairt leanúnach na gcoláistí seo sna blianta atá romhainn. Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, tá stair chasta ag an Údarás, agus go deimhin bhí stair chasta ag Gaeltarra Eireann sular bunaí-odh an tÚdarás.  Cuireadh a lán constaicí i mbealach Údarás na Gaeltachta le linn tréimhse an iar-Aire Pádraig Ó Tuathail. Tharraing sé sin a lán droch-phoiblíochta don Údarás agus thug sé drochmhisneach do fhoireann an Údaráis.  Is dócha, leis an fhíreann a rá, gur thosaigh an sórt deacrachtaí ag brú anuas ar an Údarás le linn tréimhse an Teachta O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> Is cuimhin liom go maith, le linn na tréimhse sin go raibh sé mar shórt príomh-aidhme ag Aire na Gaeltachta ag an am, an Teachta O'Donnell, poiblíocht phearsanta a bhaint amach dó féin.  Is cuimhin liom gur chuir sé an-bhrú ar Ghaeltarra, a bhí ann ag an am, glacadh le tograí &mdash; agus tá sé éasca nuair a bhíonn tú ag breathnú siar ach ag an am labhair mé go minic sa Teach go raibh an-imní orm faoin rud a bhí á dhéanamh aige. Tá an cruthúnas ann anois agus muid ag breathnú siar, an rud a tharla, gur bunaíodh a lán lán monarchana agus gur glacach le tograí agus nach raibh mórán stuaime ag baint leis an sórt polasaí a bhí i gceist aige.  Mar ní raibh siad seasmhach, níor lean siad, dúnadh síos iad, agus cailleadh na milliúin punt airgid dá bharr. Tharraing an rud ar fad an drochmheas anuas ar obair an Údaráis agus dá bharr sin anuas ar na Gaeltachtaí agus ar na daoine a bhí ina gcónaí iontu.  Sa tuarascáil a chuir an Comhchoiste ar Chomhlach-taí Stáit Tionscanta amach &mdash; bhí mé féin i mo bhall den chomchoiste Stáit seo &mdash; tá ráiteas ansin ar leathanach 8 ag tacú leis an méid atá á rá agam, agus b'fhéidir nach ndéanfadh sé dochar, a Cheann Comhairle, rudaí mar seo a chur ar an &ldquo;record&rdquo; mar a deir siad i mBéarla.  Mar amach anseo, na daoine a léann na díos-póireachtaí seo tá sé tábhachtach má tá an t-eolas againn go gcuirfimís in iúl don Dáil é.  Rinne an comhchoiste seo anstaidéar ar obair Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus seo ceann do na rudaí a shocraigh an coiste sin a chur isteach sa Tuarascáil, agus bhí daoine as gach páirtí ar an gComhchoiste:</P>
    <P>... Gaeltarra assumed a majority or sole shareholding in twelve associate companies in the period 1975-1977.</P>
    <P>Sin é an tréimhse ina raibh an Teachta Ó Domhnaill mar Aire.</P>
    <P>During this period it was also involved in the establishment of eleven new subsidiary companies and a further four companies became subsidiaries by way of rescue/restructuring operations. This was a period of very rapid expansion of Gaeltarra's equity investment <Col N="1637" /> in both subsidiary and associate companies.  Ultimately, it created considerable problems for Gaeltarra as evidenced by the fact that between 1976 and 1979 ten subsidiary companies and seven associate companies were closed.</P>
    <P>Sin an méid a bhí le rá ag an gcomhchoiste. Ar leathanach a 167 luaitear &ldquo;investment write-offs&rdquo; agus ainmnítear 29 gcomhlachtaí, agus ina measc bhí a lán lán de na comhlachthaí a raibh an tAire ag an am ag fáil a lán poiblíochta dó féin uathu ag oscailt na monarchana.  Ach, ar ndóigh, ní raibh aon phoiblíocht nuair a bhí siad á ndúnadh síos.  Tá sé curtha in iúl anseo, na hainmneacha go léir de na monarchana sin.  Bhí a lán poiblíochta, a lán le rá sna páipéir, ar an teilifís agus fiú amháin sna ráitis a chuir an tAire os comhair na Dála ag an am.  Ach mo thrua, níor éirigh lena lán lán acu agus dúnadh síos iad tar éis chúpla bliain.  Mar sin, tharraing sé sin a lán trioblóide don Údarás, go raibh an brú orthu glacadh le na tograí nua seo agus go raibh fás ro-thapa gan an iomarca staidéir agus gan na margaí a bheith socraithe acu agus gur theip ar na monarchana sin.  Is stair anois é, ach tá sé tabhachtach go mbainfimís tairbhe ón stair agus nach dtarlódh an sórt deacrachtaí sin arís.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, ba mhaith liomsa anocht comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le bord Údarás na Gaeltachta de bharr seasamh leis an obair thábhachtach a bhí á déanamh acu cé go raibh an-drochmheas á chaitheamh anuas ag a lán daoine orthu, agus gur éirigh leo sa deireadh thiar thall brabach a bhaint amach, agus tá sé sin le feiceáil anois le dhá bhliain anuas.  Níl na figiúirí don bhliain seo caite agam, ach sa bhliain 1985 creidim gur éirigh le Gaeltarra agus na comhlachtaí a bhí faoina gcúram brabach a bheith ann.  B'shin athrú mór ó na cailliúintí uafásacha, na milliúin punt airgid, a cailleadh sna blianta roimhe sin de bharr drochpholasaí, polasaí gan aon stuaim.  Mar sin, tá mé cinnte nach dtarlóidh na deacrachtaí céanna, nach ndéanfaidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Gallagher, na botúin chéanna a rinne na hAirí sin, agus go n-oibreoidh sé go ciúin is go ciallmhar is go stuama, <Col N="1638" /> agus go ligfidh sé don bhord agus don fhoireann dul ar aghaidh leis an obair agus nach mbeidh sé féin ag cur a ladair isteach gach seachtain agus ráitis ag dul amach ar an raidió agus ar an teilifís agus ag cur isteach ar an obair a bhíonn an tÚdarás ag iarraidh a dhéanamh.  Ach coinneoidh sé súil ghéar ar chaiteachas airgid ar son na Dála.  Agus tá muinín agam as go ndéanfaidh sé sin.</P>
    <P>Mar sin sa tuarascáil seo, chuireamar a lán moltaí os comhair na Dála agus, cosúil lena lán de na tuarascálacha seo, cé gur chaith an coiste seo bliain nó b'fhéidir beagáinín níos mó, ó thosaigh siad go chríochnaigh siad, cé nach raibh siad ag plé leis an rud an t-am ar fad &mdash; bhí siad ag plé le rudaí eile; ní raibh cruinnithe ann ach abair gach seachtain nó gach dara seachtain &mdash; chaith an coiste cuid mhaith ama ag plé le hobair Údarás na Gaeltachta agus cuireadh moltaí faoi bhráid na Dála.  Níor shocraigh an Rialtas fós díospóireacht faoin tuarascáil seo.  Mar sin, ní raibh aon díospóireacht sa Dáil faoi na moltaí seo.  Ba mhaith liomsa, mar sin, ar an ócáid seo, iarraidh ar an Aire cad é a thuairim faoi na sóirt mholtaí a rinneadh agus a cuireadh amach sa tuarascáil. Tá siad liostaithe ar leathanach 7.  Níor mhaith liom mórán ama de chuid an Tí a thógáil suas faoi, ach mar sin féin b'shin é toradh na dTeachtaí ó gach taobh den Teach seo ar na moltaí a bhí acu ó thaobh an Údaráis.  Tá an tuarascáil seo ag an Aire agus beidh seans aige freagra a thabhairt dúinn nuair a bheas an díospóireacht seo thart.</P>
    <P>Déanaimse comhghairdeas leis an Aire, go dtí seo ar aon nós, as ucht gur éirigh leis a thaispeáint go bhfuil an Rialtas dáiríre ar a laghad ó thaobh na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta de.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh aon athrú air sin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ganntanas airgid ann.  Tá a fhios agam go raibh deacrachtaí ag na hAirí agus ag an Rialtas nuair a bhí siad ag socrú na Meastachán.  Bheadh sé éasca an rud a dhéanamh a rinne an Comhrialtas a bhí ann roimhe seo, is é sin, gan dóthain airgid a thabhairt don Údarás.  Ach ní dhearna Fianna Fáil é sin.  Tá buíochas <Col N="1639" /> ag dul dóibh as ucht sin.  Tá sé tábhachtach go gcoinneoimís na ceantracha Gaeltachta láidir.  Níl aon bhealach leis sin a dhéanamh mura mhíonn obair ar fáil sna ceantracha sin do na daoine.  Ní theast-aíonn uainn go mbeadh iachall orthu imeacht go Meiriceá, Sasana nó an Astráil agus na tíortha eile.</P>
    <P>Is é an trua go bhfuil an méid sin daoine ag imeacht an t-am ar fad.  Is dócha nár stop sé riamh agus go bhfuil sé go dona arís le roinnt blianta anuas.  Níl mé á rá de bharr chúpla milliún punt airgid breise atá curtha ar fáil i Meastacháin na bliana go gcuirfear stop air sin.  Ach ar a laghad, má tá seans ag Údarás na Gaeltachta tograí cearta láidre a mhealladh isteach sna Gaeltachtaí nó cabhrú le fear sa Ghaeltacht tionscal nua a bhunú níor chóir go gcuirfí aon chonstaic sa bhealach ó thaobh airgid de.  Tá rudaí eile atá an-tábhachtach ó thaobh postanna a chruthú, is é sin an córas cánach, agus tá sé sin ag cur isteach ar fhostaíocht sa tír seo agus tá sé ag cur isteach ar fhás eacnam-aíoch na tíre de bharr an mhéid cánach pearsanta agus cáin ar chomhlachtaí atá i bhfeidhm faoi láthair.  Chomh maith leis sin tá an chabhair ó dheontais tábhachtach agus beidh le haghaidh tréimhse fada eile.  Tá sí fíorthábhachtach sna ceantracha seo a bhfuil a gcúram ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, is é sin na ceantracha iar-gúlta. Tá monarchana nua-aimseartha bunaithe ag an Udarás.  Tá an chreidiúin ag dul dóibh agus is deas an rud a fheic-eáil, go mórmhór i gcásanna na monarchana, gurb iad muintir na Gaeltachta féin atá ag obair iontu agus atá i gceannas iontu, is é sin atá sa bhainistíocht agus nach bhfuil siad ag brath ar dhaoine ón taobh amuigh ach amháin i gcorrchás.</P>
    <P>Arís, fáiltím roimh an mBille seo agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh fás agus forbairt ar an obair atá Údarás na Gaeltachta á déanamh.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar ath-ló.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Adoption Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="1640" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I was indicating to the House the depth of the support which the Progressive Democrats give to the Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter as a Private Members' Bill.  This Bill is a much needed and timely reform of the law relating to adoption. The present situation which prevents abandoned children of married couples, or abandoned children whose parents may be married but cannot be traced, from becoming members of a family secure in the love, care and confidence that can only come from full membership of a family, is in our view a grave defect in our law.  It is, moreover, a defect the remedy for which lies in our hands as legislators.  We owe it to children now in institutions, now suffering because of the present law, now having their lives blighted, to introduce this reform and to do so now.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution on the last occasion to the debate was unconvincing, unresearched, unreasoned and unfortunate for the children who will continue to suffer if he has his way in delaying reform in this area.  His arguments fall into three parts.</P>
      <P>First, he said this was an important measure which should be carefully drafted and should come from Government. That is an appallingly shallow argument. The Bill is carefully drafted.  It did come from Government.  The fact that it bears Deputy Shatter's name is completely irrelevant to its merits and to the judgment of this House on its terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister says there are some possible amendments he would like to consider.  Why does he not bring forward any such amendments on Committee Stage and let the House judge their merits?  They will not be any better or worse because they are made on Committee Stage rather than at a preliminary drafting stage before another Bill is introduced. I would add that this Bill is preeminently a case for allowing non-party, unwhipped voting.  There is no such thing as a Fianna Fáil foundling, a Fianna Fáil orphan, a Fine Gael orphan, a Progressive Democrat orphan, a Labour <Col N="1641" /> Party orphan, a Workers' Party orphan, or a Democratic Socialist Party orphan. All these children have rights which do not fall to be considered in the light of party political interest.  I am asking the Minister, even at this stage, to reconsider the folly and the selfishness of the position the Government are adopting on this issue, and to look at this Bill on its merits and with regard to the interests of the people it purports to protect, namely, the children who are adversely discriminated against by our present laws.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the two miserable examples of possible changes which the Minister gave us last week showed what is, in my view, a desperate attempt to conjure up reservations for their own sake.  The suggestion that the applications for adoption orders should be made only by health boards is one of the most silly proposals for the reform of family law I have ever heard from a serious source.  The effect of such a proposal would be to give health boards an effective veto over the operation of the Act in relation to any child of would-be adopters.  Why not leave the matter to the courts to decide and, if you must, give the health boards a right of audience as notice-parties to the application.</P>
    <P>I notice in the text of the Bill that provision is made for the court making other persons parties to the Bill, presumably including health boards.  Therefore, there is no question of excluding them from the judicial determination of the child's interests.  However, what the Minister is proposing is to give them a monopoly of decision-making power because, as I said on the last occasion, if the health boards, the chief executive officer or whoever decides this anonymously within the deepest recesses of the health board, comes to the conclusion that a particular application is without merit then the parents' and the child's interest can never get to the court.  That would be a scandalous deformation of our law against the people whose interests this Bill is designed to protect and would be without any legal rationale or constitutional merit whatsoever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> Whether we continue to have health boards at all is very much open to doubt, but the Minister's suggestion that the health boards be the only possible applicants is, in my opinion, nothing short of draft.  If there were a free vote in this House on that proposal, it would only have the support of a handful of Deputies, if it even got that much support.</P>
    <P>The Minister's views on the possible adoption of married people under the age of 18 seem to be entirely theoretical, and to come from the mind of somebody who, with respect, could never have had practical experience in the implementation of family law or the consequences of adoption. When one marries one becomes part of a new family of which the married couple are heads as far as the Constitution are concerned because they are potential parents in their own right. There is no point becoming the head of one family and, at the same time, aspiring to become a juvenile member of another family.  I cannot see who would want to be adopted in those circumstances or why the effects of such adoption order, if it were made, would not be achieved by some other testamentary arrangement or deed of family arrangement.  I cannot see the circumstances in which that exception could have any validity.  This drives me to the conclusion that that objection was put up as a stumbling block or a trip wire to try to make respectable what is fundamentally a selfish attempted denial of passage to Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown proposed that the marriage age should be raised to 18 years.  Therefore, why we are proposing to go in the other direction and start making absurdly complex arrangements for people between the ages of 16 and 18 years who may or may not happen to be married, is beyond comprehension.  I wonder how many marriages the Minister thinks takes place each year between people in the 16 to 18 age group.  There are only a very small number, and the number who would be illegitimate and even remotely interested in being adopted must be infinitesimal.  Could the Minister's suggestion benefit more than one person <Col N="1643" /> in a decade or even in 30 years?  I think it is an artificial point, without merit and without practical importance and I believe it is not presented as a real objection to the text of Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <P>This attitude of the Minister is very disappointing.  It evidences and uncaring, selfish and politically opportunistic approach to this issue.  The people who will suffer most as a result of this attitude cannot vote, cannot lobby their Deputies and do not even know who to blame for their misery.  In seeking to delay reform in this area, I ask the Minister if he wants to shoulder responsibility for their misery because that is what he will be doing in political terms.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is voted down the Government will be saying to the Opposition that they do not want them to be constructive, innovative or positive and that they should confine themselves to futile, negative point scoring in the House.  The Minister for Health, in particular, should know better because, as Opposition spokesman on Health, he spent four years indulging in point-scoring and irresponsible spendthrift rhetoric.  Faced with reality, many words he said about health care during that period must now stick in his throat.  However, his answer to the responsible attitude of the various parties on this side of the House is to treat the Bill with offhand disdain larded with a few perfunctory compliments to Deputy Shatter for his innovation in bringing it in.  That simply is not good enough and fools nobody.  It amounts to a contemptuous rebuff &mdash; not for the supporters of the Bill &mdash; but for the children whose lives are, in one sense, at stake.  I use that phrase guardedly because I do not like abusing language but the lives of the children who will be affected by the passage of the Bill are at stake.  It ill behoves the Minister at any stage to say that he will delay reform until he can have carriage of the Bill or until he can decide whether minor, theoretical amendments which he has in mind should be introduced.</P>
    <P>The history of adoption law in Ireland is marked by inexcusable delay and conservatism <Col N="1644" /> often based on extraneous motives.  Initially, the Catholic Church were afraid of adoption and some extreme Catholic activists oppose this Bill as a threat to the family.  If the Constitution gives pride of place to the family which it recognises as having inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent to positive law and if, as has been held, it must be based on marriage, is it not curious that the Catholic Church are prepared to remarry people who are still married in the eyes of the State and whose marriage the State is bound to regard as indissoluble and possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights?  It is noteworthy in this context that, in limited circumstances, the Catholic Church can grant dissolution of marriage &mdash; such as the Pauline privilege &mdash; when the State cannot.  There is also the problem of Church nullity decrees.  What is claimed in the Constitution to be imprescriptible and antecedent to positive law is, in some cases, prescriptible by virtue of canon law &mdash; at least in the eyes of the Church &mdash; whose teaching is said to inform the wording of these articles.</P>
    <P>If the family is such an important institution, it can be equally argued that a child has a very strong moral right to belong to an effective, loving and caring family, whatever the circumstances of his birth.  You cannot say that the family is of huge importance and then say that it is irrelevant to foundlings, and children left in orphanages although they are not orphans, when they are deprived of their right to become members of a family.  If it is all that important in theory it is equally important in practice.  The present law prevents membership of a family being granted to certain classes of children and, therefore, it is wrong-minded to put preservation of the family as a reason for delaying the passage of this measure which is designed to accord all the privileges and natural advantages of membership of a family to those who are unjustly denied them at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be debated now, not in a year's time which, as Deputy Desmond in his contribution on the second last occasion proved, would be the logical <Col N="1645" /> outcome of the Minister's attitude.  It will be a year at least before any legislation which is not contained in Deputy Shatter's Bill can be introduced in the House. If this Bill is delayed for a year, will the Minister or anybody else be able to make up for the additional suffering, unhappiness and anxiety of the affected children? I suggest the answer to that is &ldquo;of course not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of features which are debatable and the purpose of Committee Stage is to decide whether what is in it is right in the collective wisdom of the membership of the House.  The great majority of the substance of the Bill is unexceptional and represents the vast consensus of the Members of the House, and therefore, should be passed.  I have some doubts about section 9 in so far as it relates to costs and the same objective could be reached by different phraseology and concepts.  However, that does not stop me from supporting the Bill and it does not relieve the Minister of his responsibility to support it and to bring forward amendments if he has any doubts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) of the Bill deals with the question of health boards and agencies. The treatment of health boards and agencies, as framed by Deputy Shatter, is far superior to the strange and recondite reasoning given by the Minister on the last occasion as an excuse for not supporting it.  There is a provision in section 2 (1) which is unduly restrictive.  I know Deputy Shatter's attitudes are liberal by disposition and that in so far as that section is restrictive, it is so because of an abundance of caution on his part to ensure that the matter will pass the Supreme Court without being challenged.</P>
    <P>However, it is an unduly heavy onus to put on applicants who wish to have an adoption order made in their favour in respect of a legitimate child, proof of the fact that the parents of the child would not be in a position to resume their responsibilities as parents at any time before the child reaches the age of 18 years.  The court should make the order, unless it considers it probable that the <Col N="1646" /> parents will be likely to resume their responsibilities, and the onus of proof could, with profit, be reversed in relation to that section.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have not presented this Bill; Deputy Shatter has presented it in Fine Gael time.  However, it is not a Bill based on party considerations. In this House it has received the support of Deputy Desmond of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Party and the support of the Progressive Democrats.  I presume it will also receive the support of The Workers' Party.  These groups represent a very substantial variety of social outlooks and they are not joined in a pernicious plan to embarrass the State. Quite the reverse.  They see themselves, when confronted by this proposed legislation, as morally and constitutionally bound to support it because not to do so is indefensible.  When the arithmetic of the House finally shakes out in the way it often does, I wonder if this measure will be carried.  Will Deputy Blaney or Deputy Gregory fail to turn up to support it?  Will every Fianna Fáil Deputy dutifully respect the party whip and vote down the Bill.  If there is a confrontation based on party lines, I appeal to the Minister, even at this late hour, not to have such a confrontation.  I sincerely hope that the Minister is beaten and that the attitude exhibited by his contribution, in reply to Deputy Shatter's opening speech, is confronted by this House and rebuffed for what it is &mdash; posturing without substance.</P>
    <P>This is not the time for ministerial effrontery, social small mindedness or political pettiness.  For the sake of the children concerned, let us be generous. If we cannot be generous to each other in the House, let us at least be generous to those this Bill is introduced to protect, the children who, at present, are excluded from adoption.  I reiterate the unequivocal support of the Progressive Democrats for the passage of this Bill on Second Stage and my heartfelt appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to abandon their posturing at present and to be sufficiently open and generous to <Col N="1647" /> accept this Bill in the spirit in which it is proposed and supported by a diverse group of Deputies.  They should stop the nonsense of saying that nothing good can come from the Opposition.  This is the time to set a new tone for a new Dáil.  If not, we will not become the petty, narrow-minded Opposition which that kind of behaviour might drive others to become; we will continue to be constructive but we will not let the Minister forget the inhumane, unChristian and ruthless consequences of this kind of political chicanery.  I appeal to the Taoiseach over the Minister's head to change his attitude on this matter, to show a bit of common sense and to support this Bill.  We emphatically support Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute at this stage of the discussion on the Adoption Bill before the House.  Let me say at the outset that it should be welcomed wholeheartedly by this House. While Deputy McDowell may have been very wide of the mark at the weekend in regard to his observations on the class politics of The Workers' Party, nonetheless he has got it right in respect of our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Adoption Bill. We will be unreservedly supporting the Bill.  We argue it should be given the opportunity of moving to Committee Stage where, as has been pointed out, there are matters which could and would be addressed by amendments.  However, we cannot understand how anyone could, in conscience or on any other basis, seek to block the progress of this Bill.  We say it is timely, if not long overdue, that a basic inhumanity towards innocent children of this State, children who are discriminated against because of their status, should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable to emphasise, in contrast to the debates on various referenda, that on this occasion the discrimination is based on the status of legitimacy.  It is remarkable that at this stage of our civilisation and development there is not <Col N="1648" /> available within the State the opportunity for legitimate children or children presumed to be legitimate who are left in the hands of our health authorities to be available for adoption where no other substitude of parental and home love is available.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be welcomed even more so when one considers the inordinate delay in regard to law reform relating to children generally.  I think I am correct in recalling that in the momentous International Year of the Child which ran from 1979 to 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government of the day promised not just a Bill dealing with any one aspect of children's rights but a veritable charter to deal with the upgrading and modernisation of the law. It was to be the gesture of the Government of the day as their contribution to the advancement of the interests of children and young persons in that important international year that a charter upgrading the law relating to children would be put before the House and put into operation.  An important point was that the legislation dated from 1908 and that fact was to be corrected.  However, since that year no innovative or reformative legislation in that area has been introduced into the House.</P>
    <P>In some degree this Adoption Bill is a product of the fragmentation of the charter idea which was canvassed at that time.  The legislators in time found that one aspect of the proposal was being delayed because of varying difficulties and, as a result, it was developed in a number of ways.  As we now know, in the life of the last Dáil in response to review committees and the work of other agencies, the Government of the day introduced what is in effect the Bill now before us in the name of Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>One of the major reservations expressed about the Adoption Bill is that it may have constitutional difficulties.  At this stage I have to emphasise that this Bill is so carefully drafted &mdash;&ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; is not a word I want to use at this stage &mdash; that there could not possibly be one iota of constitutional reservation raised about it.  This Bill is drafted so as to fit hand and glove within Article 42.5 of <Col N="1649" /> the Constitution.  So as to remind the Minister of what the Constitution allows in this area, it is worth quoting Article 42.5:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>For that reason The Workers' Party support this Bill in principle.  We say it is an effort to take Ireland out of the exclusive internation club of three in which we find outselves at present.  We rank with Iran and Iraq as being the only countries which do not currently allow for the adoption of legitimate children or foundlings. That, in itself, speaks myriads for the rather backward position we find ourselves in, regrettably a position which the Government appear to wish to prolong for an indeterminate period of time.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in the Minister's response no indication was given as to when the Government will put the matter right.  They say it needs further consideration but it must be remembered they promised this legislation in 1979. They were put on notice on 25 November last year that legislation in this area was in the offing when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond moved the Second Stage.  For someone on the Government side to say that they are somewhat taken by surprise is a little less than credible and should not be allowed go unremarked on.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill seeks to deal with the needs of children who at present are not given the due regard, care, love and affection set down in our Constitution. The Bill also seeks to deal with the needs of couples who for very different reasons cannot have children of their own by giving them the opportunity to adopt. At this time there are upwards of 2,000 children who could benefit through the passing of this Bill.  We also know there are long lists of couples who are on the <Col N="1650" /> waiting lists of the adoption societies looking earnestly for children to adopt but who cannot be facilitated because of the lack of children.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the way the Government are dealing with the health authorities surely the attraction of the proposals in this Bill must commend them to a Government who are so earnestly looking to cut expenditure at health board level.  It will be a great saving on a cost basis alone for health boards to be able to hand into the loving care of doting parents children for whom, at the moment, they must provide in institutions that are no doubt costing the tax-payer and the Government highly.</P>
    <P>The Bill has very important implications, not just on the narrow singular level but with regard to many aspects which this Government, if they are genuine in the programme of budgetary sense they have been proposing during the past couple of months will pursue.  I have already adverted to the Constitution and the particular provision included therein to allow for the exceptional type of legislation being put before the House at this stage.  Deputy Shatter in his explanatory memorandum and then in his contribution to this House has explained at length the particular importance of each of the sections in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has advanced reasons for the House not giving support to further consideration of the Bill at this time. These have been set out clearly by Deputy McDowell but one aspect must be answered at this point yet again.  It is suggested that what needs to be put before the House will be something more carefully drafted, something that will have more safeguards, for some reason, in the context of the Constitution, if it comes from the Government side.  It is only fair that one pay tribute to the promoter of this Bill.  The Government should have due regard to the fact that he is perhaps the foremost proponent and exponent of family law and its provisions and operation in this State.  I have no doubt that each and every one of the provisions in the Bill is based on the long number of years of experience of Deputy <Col N="1651" /> Shatter in the whole area of family and adoptive law.  I have no doubt, equally, that the Government should be mindful of the fact that he is a foremost textbook writer in the area of family law.  It is not to pass unremarked that any Minister should suggest that legislation drafted and promoted by somebody of this standard of expertise might not be so carefully drafted and might require further consideration.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, there may well be aspects and points for clarification, of a minor nature or otherwise, in the sections.  Deputy McDowell has referred to one or two about which he would have reservations.  I believe that the Minister made some passing remarks on aspects of the Bill.  These matters can clearly be addressed and put right on Committee Stage when all of us would have an opportunity to contribute.  The same experts are available to the Minister as were available to the previous Minister when he moved Second Stage of his Bill on 25 November last.  For somebody to suggest that the expertise is not there, and was not there when the Bill was drafted originally, again deserves criticism.  It can lead only to the conclusion, as has been suggested, that there is an element of seeking to avoid some kind of one-up-man-ship, seeking to ensure that the Government are not seen in any way to be tardy or wrongfooted by some initiative on the Opposition side.  I do not see that that is so.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that there was much useful legislation introduced by the previous Government that had gone a certain distance.  The Government have already taken up a number of these Bills which were left in the stocks and not passed through all stages of the legislative process.  The Government have sought for these to be promoted, such as the ACOT Bill, the Defence (Amendment) Bill at present under consideration and a number of others.  I cannot understand why the Government are seeking now to put a stop to this Bill and to obstruct its passing further along the legislative process.  It would be too easy to suggest, <Col N="1652" /> as has been suggested, that it is because those who are to be affected are so vulnerable as not to be a voice to be heard and so young as not to be able to raise their cause.</P>
    <P>I earnestly suggest that whatever reservations the Government have about the contents of the Bill, these can be easily and very carefully dealt with on the next Stage.  I invite the Government to consider allowing the Bill to pass to Committee Stage.  In this way they would be seen to be responding in a caring and active way to what is a major social problem, an oversight and perhaps an indictment of all parties because it has not been addressed earlier.</P>
    <P>One hopes that all Deputies on the Opposition side will be available here tomorrow night and that if I can be heard in Limerick and Dublin North Central and wherever else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of addressing the House on this Bill.  At the outset, this is not a matter of extreme urgency as far as the present legislative process is concerned.  There are many matters before us requiring the urgent attention of Members on all sides of the House.  I urge the Government, and in particular the Minister for Health, to have a rethink on the lines of the 1987 Adoption Bill.  In this regard I would refer to the reply of the Minister in response to a question tabled by one of my party colleagues on 30 April concerning a research programme on our existing adoption services.  The Minister stated that he would consider such matters. Now he indicates his intention to draft his own Government legislation on this matter.  I suggest that the Minister and the Government are needlessly playing <Col N="1653" /> for time on an issue of fundamental importance to a section of our community who cannot, by their very nature, rely on heavily financed pressure groups to fight their corner.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he has a number of reservations from a constitutional point of view on certain aspects of the Bill.  I would ask him, or somebody from the other side of the House, to state these reservations clearly and distinctly, if not this week, certainly on Committee Stage, when I hope we will all have an opportunity of discussing them.  At one stage here the Minister said he felt unhappy with the Bill as at present drafted, that it concerned only the adoption of single children.  The Minister is concerned at the absence of a provision to cater for married people.  I ask the Minister to think seriously on this comment.  If he checks the statistics, he will see that the number of people between the ages of 16 and 18 who are lawfully married is very small.  If he goes further and checks the number of married people between the ages of 16 and 18 who would wish to benefit from the adoption services he would see that his statement is bordering on the ludicrous.</P>
      <P>I would readily concede that the law on adoption and childrens' legislation in general is highly complex.  It is an area that should be changed, broadened or amended only following full and detailed discussion and debate among all the parties concerned.  However, many people fear &mdash; perhaps rightly &mdash; for one reason or another, any form of change in the family code.  We in this House must always bear in mind the protection that our Constitution affords on these matters. Over the years Fianna Fáil appear to have been afraid to deal adequately with social legislation and it appears that their attitude has not changed in the last three months.  I urge the Minister to have a rethink on this issue and allow us to proceed to Committee Stage when the fears of the Government, and other parties, can be voiced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution specifically state that parents are <Col N="1654" /> accorded inalienable rights as far as children are concerned.  However, all must agree and accept that there are instances, which are on the increase, where parents for a variety of reasons fail in their duty towards their children.  Legally married parents may fail in their duty to their children for physical reasons, illness or incapacity, or, in some cases, there may be clear negligence by parents in their duty.  Unfortunately, the latter is proving more prevalent in our society.  In such circumstances there exists a clear duty on the part of the State to permit adoption by parents where lawful parents fail in their duty towards their children for mental or physical reasons.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the provisions of the Bill before us one realises that there is a need to reform our existing laws relating to adoption.  Adoption is best described as a generic love of children that is in no way dependent upon consanguinity. Children have a right to grow up in their family of origin in so far as that is feasible and the State has a clear responsibility to facilitate this by preserving the integrity and wellbeing of the natural family.  We must face up to the fact that in some unpalatable cases it is not possible to keep a family together in spite of the availability of some support services which are of the highest standard. While I accept that the Minister for Health has to deal with the problem of the general funding of the health services he should, as far as the provision of services for families in need are concerned, ensure that they are not curtailed in any way.</P>
    <P>In some cases parents may decide that it is not fair to keep a child and that a child may have a better life with another family.  In other cases the child's security and wellbeing may be at risk.  I should like to stress the importance of having available a range of State supports for families in difficulty so that parents are not obliged to place a child due to economic difficulties which, sadly, is very prevalent in Ireland in the eighties.</P>
    <P>The present law permits the adoption <Col N="1655" /> of orphans, illegitimate children and children legitimised by the subsequent marriage of his or her parents but whose births have not been registered in accordance with the 1931 Legitimacy Act.  A child's capacity to be adopted should not be determined on the basis of the marital status of the parents.  The present law excludes from adoption many children who may be in urgent need of the benefits which adoption can offer.  As many speakers have said we are the only country in Europe that does not permit adoption of legitimate children.</P>
    <P>The 1984 report of the review committee on adoption services quite rightly explained the trauma of adoption.  It stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are few areas in the field of human relationships that involve the same degree of heartsearching and anguish and ultimately happiness as the adoption of a child.  It affects those who are party to it in different but deeply felt ways.  For some it means parting with a child, for others gaining a child. Difficult and agonising decisions have to be taken since the consequences are lasting and, in the final analysis, the life that will be most affected by those decisions will be the child himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the committee it is highly unlikely that amending the law as the Bill proposes so as to provide for the adoption of legitimate children would result in parents negating their parental duties and responsibilities in relation to their children.  The committee have found no evidence to suggest that this has been the case in other countries where the adoption of legitimate children is permitted and long established.  It is a natural instinct of parents to care and provide for their offspring until they are in a position to fend for themselves. I agree with the committee that adoption should be one of the options available to provide care for our children &mdash; whether such children be born in or out of wedlock &mdash; who cannot grow up in natural families.  All children, irrespective of the marital status of their <Col N="1656" /> parents, should be eligible for adoption in certain clearly defined circumstances. We should remember that there will only be certain exceptional circumstances where the Constitution will permit adoption as envisaged in the Bill.  Enactment of this legislation will enable the adoption of legitimate children whose parents have failed in their constitutional duty towards their children and in circumstances where there is an abandonment of parental consituational rights.  The Bill also proposes to permit the adoption of an illegitimate child whose natural mother has abandoned her constitutional rights to such child, in circumstances in which such a child cannot be adopted under the law as it now stands.  Such adoption will only be allowed where parents, or parent, for a long period, clearly failed in their duty towards such child and further that it is deemed likely that such failure will continue on an ongoing basis until that child reaches the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>The failure or otherwise, of the duty and care will be decided by the High Court, bearing in mind the circumstances of each case.  The court must at all times be satisfied that, having due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child, it would be in the best interest of the child to make an order authorising the Adoption Board to make an adoption order in relation to the child in favour of the applicants.  Before the court may make such an order due consideration must be given to the child's wishes having regard to his age and understanding.</P>
    <P>Further stringent requirements are contained in sections 2 and 4 of the Bill where it is outlined that applicants must have custody of the child in their own home for at least one year prior to having the application processed.  In cases where a child is under the care of a health board that board must at all times consent to the application and as far as the applicants are concerned the Bill provides that two separate applications must be made, first to the Adoption Board and thereafter to the High Court to authorise the Adoption Board to make the order.  The High Court will at all times examine each and every case and must satisfy itself that <Col N="1657" /> the parents have failed in their duty and that such failure is likely to continue before any order is made.  Under the Bill it is envisaged, and quite rightly so, that the court will be obliged to hear the evidence of the natural parents as long as their identity is known and provided that the natural parents wish to avail of the opportunity of giving evidence.  The ultimate effect of the adoption order would be to terminate on a permanent basis the rights and duties of the natural parents with regard to that child.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill and I urge the Government to support its provisions. We must take a serious look at the hundreds of children presently in long term care on a residential basis and while I feel that such institutions are providing an excellent service, they are not a proper substitute for family life available to a child in the home and environment of adoptive parents which the Bill if enacted will allow.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government, in the strongest possible terms, at least to allow this Bill to be discussed on Committee Stage when we will be able to hear the reservations the Minister and the Minister of State have but on which they do not seem to be clear.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I hope it will be enacted in 1987.  It is now May, the House will rise in July and will not resume until October.  So far as the Government are concerned the likelihood of legislation of this nature coming before the House before Christmas must be somewhat slight.  I very much regret that that is the position.  Until such time as the Minister clarifies the position, I feel we will all be in the House until sometime in 1988, not having passed adoption legislation because the Government will not have had an opportunity &mdash; because of the life of the Twenty Fifth Dáil &mdash; of producing their own Bill.  Committee Stage affords Members the opportunity of expressing their reservations and of putting down amendments and having them discussed. This Bill is a firm basis on which to urgently reform our law so that the hundreds of people who are in difficult situations may have their plight alleviated.</P>

      <P>When one reads last week's debates on this Bill it is clear that time is required by the Government to consider the various points that have been raised and to bring forward their own Bill in the light of the various discussions that have taken place in the Dáil since the publication of the Adoption Bill in 1986 by the former Minister, Deputy Barry Desmond.  From reading the speeches which were made last week it is clear that certain issues raised by various Deputies give food for thought.</P>
      <P>I bow to the expertise of Deputy Shatter in this area but there are a few matters which have to be cleared up.  When the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown produced their report an all-party consensus was arrived at.  Unfortunately, we did not proceed on that all-party basis for the purpose of implementing the various agreed proposals in that report. Instead we went for a divorce referendum which did not prove successful.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is an unusual step in parliamentary procedures for a Government to require time to consider issues coming before them and to decide on what way they will proceed and order business.  As has been recognised by previous speakers, there are various priorities which a Government set themselves. This is not in any way to demean the importance of an adoption Bill which will allow us, constitutionally and in legislation which will be in compliance with the Constitution, to permit the adoption of legitimate children whose parents have abandoned their constitutional rights under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution and as decided on by the High Court in any individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was criticism of this Bill last week by the Progressive Democrats. Deputy Mary Harney said she felt the Bill was too restrictive, that it was not <Col N="1659" /> liberal enough.  She said there should be a wider ambit of categories of children who might be available for adoption.  She also made the very sweeping statement that there were children who were sent out by their parents to commit crimes and children who stayed out too late at night.  I found this statement most remarkable considering the fact that we are trying to bring forward legislation that would be in compliance with Article 42.5 of the Constitution.  She may have been confusing this legislation with legislation which would impute to the parents of children who were involved in lawlessness some criminal responsibility for that behaviour.  That is totally outside the ambit of what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>She also said she felt that the High Court should not be involved in deciding on whether an adoption order should be granted and that there should be less of an adversarial atmosphere in family law tribunals.  The problem with this sort of suggestion is that we are dealing with the constitutional rights of citizens and surely the High Court would be the proper arbiter as to whether an adoption order should be made in any given circumstances. In that regard the Deputy seemed to have been confusing the very restrictive parameters in which one must operate an adoption law under the Constitution with some global or overriding reform in the general family law area in relation to custody, maintenance or whatever.  Her criticism that this Bill is not liberal enough is misplaced.  That has been recognised by previous speakers such as Deputy McCartan and by Deputy Shatter who stated that we are faced with the fact that we have constitutional provisions which require very careful study and that as a result of that we must ensure that legislation based on those provisions is free of any constitutional flaw.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that perhaps previous Parliaments have delayed in bringing in this sort of legislation which is agreed to in principal by all of us. However, it is important that we ensure that we draft a Bill which will be within the ambit of the Constitution.  The <Col N="1660" /> suggestion that once the Bill is passed that it go before the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution is a very good and commonsense suggestion in view of recent decisions and the remedial measures that have had to be taken by the Legislature as a result of certain legislation or treaties having been struck down by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>There is no objection on this side of the House to the principle of the Bill. Many legitimate children have been deprived of the kind of family atmosphere to which they are constitutionally entitled.  That constitutional entitlement was made clear by Justice Walsh to the Adoption Board, An Bord Uchtála, when he claimed that you could have an abandonment of your constitutional rights that the rights of parents are not totally inalienable; they are inalienable in the context in which they are exercised or they are not exercised.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of the Bill.  When the previous Bill was published we had a seminar in Trinity College at which eminent people spoke and very serious contributions were made.  It is the duty of a Minister when he takes on an office of State to familiarise himself completely and be totally happy with the proposals and with his own Bill.  That is a preserve and a right which he has.  If the Minister Deputy O'Hanlon, decides to use it in this instance he certainly will not be the first and certainly he will not be the last regardless of who is on the Government benches.  In his Second Stage contribution he said he will move for the production and the publication of a Bill to be discussed in this House as soon as possible.  Deputy McCartan suggested earlier that he was putting it on the long finger and that he would not deal with it. The Minister has given a commitment on Second Stage and I am prepared to take him at his word.</P>
    <P>We should try to get an all-party agreement on how we should proceed on these issues &mdash; an opportunity which was lost when the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown reported.  It is the prerogative <Col N="1661" /> of Government to bring forward legislation.  They have given a commitment that legislation will be brought forward as soon as possible when the Minister is satisfied with all the provisions in a Bill.  If we do that there will be no need for party political arguments.  It is a matter of timing.  We are not talking about the next decade or the next five years, but as soon as possible.  I think we will see the publication of a Government Bill very shortly and these issues can be discussed on an all-party basis with a view to rectifying the discriminatory position in which legitimate children find themselves who would otherwise be available for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  It is clearly common case between all sides in the House and, indeed, has been common case in the community for many years that the plight of the abandoned legitimate child needed to be dealt with. It is a tribute to our adoption system that the method of dealing with the plight of that citizen was to look to our adoption code to provide the answer to the problem. Our adoption code can withstand examination as to its success or otherwise and clearly pass that examination with flying colours.  There is no doubt that adoption as practised in this country has been outstandingly successful.  I say that on the basis of empirical observation rather than as a result of any objective data that might have been ascertained through research.  If there is one flaw in our adoption code it has been the absence of monitoring research from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister for Justice it was a contentious area being pressed on me by social workers who were interested in the adoption field that we should have research facilities so that the operation of the adoption code could be scrutinised and evaluated in a scientific and precise way.  So far as I recall I provided funds for a scheme of research and I would be interested to know if that scheme was continued and is still continuing.  By <Col N="1662" /> definition, research in the area of adoption is a long-term process because it involves monitoring the progress of the group and peer groups being observed over a considerable number of years dealing with childhood, the teenage period and probably young adulthood in order to make comparisons to see how the various groups fare out.</P>
    <P>I recall that, when proposing an amending Bill, in 1974 or 1976, I gave figures of research analysis that had been done in another jurisdiction.  There was an analysis of a group of adopted children, a group of illegitimate children who had not been placed for adoption, and a group of legitimate children. That analysis in the jurisdiction of the United States showed that there was little difference of achievement between the legitimate children and the adopted children, a slight edge in favour of the former, but there was a significant difference, or lack of achievement on the part of the illegitimate group who had not been placed for adoption and who had been kept by their mothers.  It was an interesting piece of research, the results of which were not terribly popular, because they went against the then current thinking in the world of sociology that mothers should be encouraged to keep their children born outside wedlock. I will not comment on that aspect at this stage because it is a sensitive and difficult area.  I just mention the results of that research carried out in the United States at that time.  If Members are interested, I have no doubt they will pursue the records of the House to trace my words in 1974 or 1976.</P>
    <P>As I say, on the basis of empirical observation in this country I think we can be satisfied that our adoption system has worked well.  There have been literally tens of thousands of children placed for adoption and if a cohort of the population of that magnitude did not achieve normally, or did not fit normally into the social streams in which they were placed and become good citizens this would surely manifest itself in such a way as to be noticeable.  That it has not done so and that there is general satisfaction on <Col N="1663" /> the part of the adoptive parents, on the part of society at large and on the part of those who are professionally involved in that area with the scheme as practised in this country, is proof that it has worked satisfactorily.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that it has worked outstandingly well.</P>
    <P>A great tribute must be paid to those who were responsible for initiating our scheme of adoption, the officers of the Department of Justice who devised and implemented the original adoption scheme and who also were responsible for advising on the amendments which were subsequently made in 1974 and 1976 to cure certain defects which had manifested themselves in the scheme some 20 years after its inception.  I want to pay tribute to the officials of that Department. The scheme was heavily scrutinised in the late seventies and there were calls for radical change in adoption procedures.</P>
    <P>There was even a suggestion that adopted children should be entitled as of right to know their ancestry.  Changes of a radical type were called for and were resisted, not to the point of being excluded, but on the grounds that they fundamentally affected a scheme that had worked well and required careful scrutiny and analysis.  Because the changes did not come overnight, pressure grew for the transfer of the administration of adoption to the Department of Health.  In due course that took place and it may well have been a good move.  I think it was motivated on the basis of an assumption that the people in the Department of Health would be somehow more humane than those in the Department of Justice. I am sure the people in the Department of Health would be the first to agree that this would be a fallacious assumption. Possibly the real reason was that those who had been seeking reform thought they might meet less of the hard-nosed legal analysis which is part and parcel of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Department of Justice and that they might not meet that to the same extent in the Department <Col N="1664" /> of Health.  We will know whether that is true when the Minister produces his own Bill in due course.</P>
    <P>The adoption scheme has worked very well.  Proof is that it is now sought to solve the problem of the abandoned legitimate child by enabling that scheme to take that child into its ambit.  When I was Minister for Justice and had charge of the adoption area I was bringing forward amendments to the adoption scheme.  This problem was then as live an issue as it is today. Like every person with an ounce of compassion &mdash; and I would claim at least that &mdash; I was anxious to solve it and was taken by the arguments that the way to solve it was to expand the law so as to permit the adoption of legitimate children.  I have to say that the advice I got then was that such a course was constitutionally extremely dubious and that it would require much consideration and possibly considerable evolution of case law before one could say it was constitutionally appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am not sure even at this stage that case law has evolved to a stage where we can say that the proposals in this Bill are constitutionally secure and constitutionally safe.  It is at least arguable when one considers the very clear provisions of Article 41 read in conjunction with Article 42.5 that what is proposed here may be in conflict with those Articles. I do not propose at this stage to become involved in a detailed analysis of what Article 42.5 means when it says that the State by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents.  That can mean a lot of things; it can mean many things to many different courts.  It might not mean what is proposed here.  There may be other ways.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>The views expressed here on all sides display this underlying worry about the constitutionality of what is proposed. Deputies who have spoken have perhaps been slow to put undue emphasis on the legalities of an issue lest they might be accused of being heartless or uncaring about the immense human problem which the measure is attempting to solve. I can understand that and I was somewhat <Col N="1665" /> loath myself to speak in the terms in which I am now speaking.  There is always the danger that one may be accused of being unduly legalistic and hard-hearted by paying attention to the law at the expense of the person.  All I can say in answer to that is that there was no worthwhile family law reform of any sort introduced in this country in the past ten years except what I introduced as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise to anybody for making the point that we must consider the legal context in which this Bill is being proposed.  There has to be a doubt about it.  It is not good enough to say that the House can rely on Article 26.  As I understand it, there is an obligation on this House not to propose legislation unless it is sure it is constitutional.  I understand that is a convention of our procedures, and a very proper convention it is, because under the Constitution we have a duty to conform to the Constitution as much as any other organ of the State and we are not entitled to put forward legislation about which there is a question mark and hope that the President in his wisdom may refer it to the Supreme Court.  It is not even proper to hint that he should because that is a trespass by us into his domain.</P>
    <P>I mention these points because they are real and serious and I wonder if this problem should be approached from a different perspective.  In approaching the problem from the perspective of the adoption code and seeking to apply it to the case of the legitimate abandoned child, are we making a fundamental misjudgment of what adoption is?  In my opinion adoption provides two things for the illegitimate child and it was in regard to the illegitimate child that it was first introduced into our legal code.  It supplied two needs of that child: first, it gave that child the permanency of a home within a family, something which the foundling did not have &mdash; it had been abandoned to an institution; secondly, it gave that child &mdash; who in those days was a <i>nullius filius</i> and until we change the law will continue to be &mdash; a family, a name, parents, brothers, sisters, entitlement to succession rights and all the other <Col N="1666" /> attributes of being a full member of a formal family.  That is what adoption was designed to do &mdash; to provide the two wants of the abandoned child.</P>
    <P>The case we are dealing with in this Bill is not the case of the abandoned illegitimate child, with the exception of the illegitimate child where the mother had not agreed to its placement for adoption. That is a different and smaller category which can be dealt with adequately by the provisions of this Bill.  The category that causes the difficulty is that comprising the legitimate abandoned child.  If I am right in what I say is the nature of adoption, namely, that it provides two things, only one of those is necessary in the case of the legitimate child.  By virtue of its legitimate birth that child already has the status of family, albeit a family that has neglected and abandoned him. Nevertheless the status is there and there is no need for an adoption code to give a status that already exists.  What is required is something in our legal system that will give a permanent home and a guarantee of a system to look after the well-being, material and spiritual wants of the foundling.  We should be addressing our minds to that aspect of our legal system because it would achieve what we all want.  It would take these unfortunate foundlings out of care and give them the benefit of family life.  They do not need the status of adoption to give them a family because they have that by virtue of their birth, but they need something to give them a permanent home where they will be safe from the danger of being reclaimed by unworthy parents who have abandoned them.  Possibly in addressing this problem we should consider the question of fosterage.  I have not researched this aspect but it might be an area where it would be possible to give permanency without at the same time coming face to face with the constitutional impediments which I see in the present measure.</P>
    <P>I put forward these thoughts for the consideration of the House and the Minister. It is only right that we should have this debate and that it should be frank. While considering the immensely compassionate call made on us by this section <Col N="1667" /> of our society, we cannot answer that call by ignoring the constitutional system by which our society is governed.  We can say what we like about our Constitution, and many people have had hard things to say about it, but it is there and as long as it is there we just cannot ignore it.  We have to take all of its provisions into account.  We have a constitutional duty here in this House to ensure that we do not propose or pass legislation which would be in conflict with the Constitution or even legislation which we think might be in conflict with the Constitution.  One of our tasks is to act as upholders of the Constitution.  That is a serious obligation on us and if we are careless about that obligation because the motive is excellent, the motive being to cure the plight of these unfortunate children, on another occasion the motive might not be so compassionate, so compelling or so popular and we will begin to be careless with our Constitution and end up in conflict with the courts with regard to its interpretation and implementation.  That would not be desirable.  We must be careful of the fundamental provisions of the Constitution which provide for the division of powers.</P>
    <P>There was criticism in this House some time ago that the Supreme Court judgment on the Single European Act interfered in the area of the executive. That was a bad example.  If one wanted to consider interference by one organ of the State in the affairs of another that was a bad example to use against the Supreme Court.  Probably there are better ones to be got.  If we look at section 2 and we see the immense burden we in this House are seeking to place on a court and all the things that a court will have to do to satisfy itself before it makes this judgment of immense consequence &mdash; taking a child away from its natural parents forever, the child they conceived and brought into the world.  Unworthy though they may be, the court will have to decide that those parents have forever and ever abandoned their child and they must lose that child forever and ever.  The <Col N="1668" /> court will have the immense burden of deciding that, looking over its shoulder at Articles 41 and 42.5.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, these are real problems which exist and will not go away.  We must bear them in mind as we are considering this measure.  That is why I urge the House and the Minister to turn their attention to another method of solving this problem.  I have indicated a possible method.  It is no more than that and it may be fruitless when examined, nevertheless it should be examined.</P>
    <P>These are some views on this Bill.  I welcome its introduction as it has enabled this debate to take place.  It will bring into public focus again the plight of the children concerned.  I support the Bill.  I am not prepared to say that my doubts are less valid than the wisdom of those who put forward the Bill.  In any event the Bill is a vehicle for this debate and those doubts will be teased out in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I join with my colleagues who have urged the Government to take this Bill, accept it and let it get on to the next Stage when all these constitutional and legal doubts can be teased out.  If they are shown to be of no moment, to have no weight or substance, they can be disregarded and this Bill can be enacted and bring about a very necessary, worthwhile and longawaited reform.</P>
    <P>Should they turn out to have validity and the House cannot convince itself that the Bill is on all fours with the Constitution, obviously we will have to put our collective minds and collective wisdom towards devising an alternative method.  I urge the Minister to accept this Bill and let this important debate continue because, as Deputy Flanagan said, there is no doubt that if it does not continue at this stage &mdash; I can speak from experience; the complexity of preparing a Bill of this nature is immense &mdash; the Minister will not have a Bill in this House before the summer recess.  It will be the Michaelmas term before we receive the Bill, if then.  I suggest that the Minister should accept this Bill and let us get on <Col N="1669" /> with this important work immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First I congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing this Bill before the House.  It was regrettable that the Bill published by the previous Government in November 1986 was not passed through the House prior to the dissolution of the 24th Dáil.  The Minister would be very wise to allow this Bill to go through the House and see it through to Committee Stage.  While I welcome the fact that we have an opportunity to introduce Private Members' Bills in Private Members' Time, I feel it could be seen as a waste of Dáil time if there is not some constructive follow up to the Bill by allowing it through to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will rethink what he has already considered over the past week because basically this Bill is very similar to a Bill drafted by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, and at that time that Bill was drafted with the assistance of the officials of the Department of Health and the legal Department of the Attorney General. The same mechanisms and the same assistance and service are available to the present Minister.  As the officials who were advising the previous Government were very much the same as those who are advising the present Government, I do not think any legislation brought before the House by the Government will vary considerably from what is before us here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving the more legal points raised by previous speakers, we should consider what the Bill is about.  It is about children. It is about a certain section of children who at present do not enjoy the security of a family, the love of a mother or the goodwill and bond that exist within a family.  Those are children who are deemed in law to be legitimate but who at the moment under the present adoption laws are not entitled to be adopted.  In 1952 when the legislation that governs adoption today was introduced to this House, it was not seen as necessary to accommodate the adoption of legitimate children, but 35 years onwards we must <Col N="1670" /> realise that we are living in quite a different Ireland with a good many different social pressures on people.  We have more marriage breakdowns.  Many children are abandoned because of pressures be they social, economic or whatever and at the moment many legitimate children are denied the enjoyment of family life because of the non-existence of laws to cope with their peculiar situation. Deputy Cooney spoke about adoption which he said does two things: it gives to an illegitimate child the permanency of a home within a family and it caters for the <i>nullius filius</i> by giving that child a name, title and succession rights.</P>
    <P>I suggest that adoption does far more than that.  A child is not aware of status or title.  He or she becomes aware of them on becoming older.  A child is a youngster.  He is aware of family and the love of a mother and a father and the security that that can bring.  That is what we should address ourselves to and not to the fine legal titles that many have addressed themselves to here this evening. It is very important for the psychological development of a child that there is security around that child.  We in this House will be found wanting if we do not take early action to ensure that the hundreds of children out there who do not enjoy that happy scene at the moment are provided with it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health basically agrees with the Bill and has some reservations, one of which is ridiculous and which could be very adequately dealt with on Committee Stage.  The Minister expressed concern at the fact that the Bill does not deal with the adoption of married children under the age of 18 years of age.  That is a very weak argument on which to reject the Bill before the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The men who died in Loughgall last Friday night were members of an organisation which is the greatest enemy of Irish nationalism, an organisation that has robbed, plundered and murdered indiscriminately for 18 years and which has sought to divide the people of the North and, indeed, the people of this whole island.  Only a fortnight ago they murdered a judge of the Northern Ireland court and his wife, two people who were innocently driving home from this part of the country.  I did not agree with many of the judgments of Judge Gibson but the idea that that gives me the right to wipe him out could only be conceived by members of the Provisional IRA.  They have adopted precisely the same tactics with people they call informers in their own organisation.  They act as prosecuter, judge, jury and ultimately executioner of these people in the name of the Irish people but without a mandate.  That was clearly demonstrated in the election here only three months ago and it has been demonstrated clearly in elections for a long time now.  They have no right to speak or act on our behalf or on behalf of the Northern Nationalists.</P>
      <P>The people with the right to speak for nationalism on this island are the elected representatives of this House and the elected representatives of Northern Ireland who came together to draw up the Forum report out of which came the Anglo-Irish Agreement which now gives the right to a Minister of this Government to raise matters in relation to security and other matters of that type through the Anglo-Irish Conference.  They are the legitimate voice of Irish nationalism, and not the Provisional IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> The Anglo-Irish Agreement set out as one of its objectives to improve the relationship between the two communities in the North and between North and South and to bring an end to violence. All of this is anathema to the Provisional IRA.  They do not want to achieve any of those aims and their purpose is to destroy the democratic institutions of this State and of the North of Ireland and to continue to drive a wedge between the two traditions here.  That is something which the Forum report and every Member of this House will abhor. The Anglo-Irish Agreement seeks to achieve trust between the two communities in the North of Ireland and that trust can only be built when the minority community see themselves as having equal rights with the majority community in the North.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement gives them that stature and through its operation looks after their interests.  Part of that trust must be the relationship with the security forces.  One of the objectives of the agreement is to improve the relationship of the security forces with the community.  That trust had been growing since Portadown in 1985 and particularly in the past 18 months to the extent that I felt I could say to Nationalists in Northern Ireland at the end of last year that I thought it was time for them to consider joining the RUC.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely important part of building a democracy that the minority and the majority see the security forces as being there for their protection.  The security forces in the North have had an extremely difficult job in the past 18 years.  Nobody could deny that.  It is essential that they too must work to attain and maintain the confidence of the minority and not just of the majority.  The minority must see them as their security force as well as the security force of the majority, because the people who will defeat the IRA in the North of Ireland are the minority Nationalist community who do not want violence.  They are the people who will benefit most from the defeat of the IRA in that they will be able to live their lives in peace as equal citizens, which again is something that <Col N="1673" /> the Anglo-Irish Agreement seeks to do for them.  For too long they have been caught between an unsympathetic State and those men of violence who feed on their miseries.  They want to get them off their backs.  They see in the Anglo-Irish Agreement a chance of doing that.</P>
    <P>I do not know what happened on Friday night in Loughgall.  It is alleged in the papers that the security forces had prior knowledge either through infiltration, a mole, or by some other detection means.  It is important that the minority should see that the security forces had no other option than to act in the way in which they did on Friday night. It is important because eight men are dead, eight men whom I would have preferred to see arrested, disarmed, tried and imprisoned.  There are examples in the past where even the most vicious of paramilitaries from either side of the divide during their terms of imprisonment changed their minds about violence. I would have preferred to see that than to see them dead even though they might be guilty of the most horrendous crimes and members of an organsiation which is the enemy of all people.  I would have preferred to see them arrested, tried and imprisoned than dead.  It is important that it is established that the security forces had no other choice than to behave in the way they did.  I do not know if that is so, but the Minister has the means of finding out.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that one innocent man lost his life on Friday night.  I extend my sympathy and I am sure the sympathy of everyone in this House to his relations and to his brother who was severely injured.  I know it is extremely difficult for the security forces in Northern Ireland when the IRA continually and deliberately try to create divisions between them and the minority and between the minority and the majority.</P>
    <P>All politicians, North and South, whether Unionist, Nationalist or any Member of this House, must continue what we have been trying to do for so many years now on this island, which is to establish, through dialogue and politics <Col N="1674" /> rather than through violence, a system of government in the North of Ireland to which the minority can give their allegiance and support.  The Nationalists must be given an opportunity to show, as many of them have so bravely done over the last 18 years that, given a fair deal, equal rights and opportunities, they will isolate the men of violence.  I am afraid there will be suspicions well fed by Sinn Féin and IRA propaganda that there is a shoot to kill policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his role as co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference, must let Nationalists see that he is vigilant on their behalf, that he will use his position as co-chairman of that conference to establish precisely what happened on Friday evening last, and to build on that growing confidence among the Nationalists and security forces in the future.  It is essential that the trust that had begun to develop in the last 18 months continues to grow.  The Minister can ensure that it does under the provisions of Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish agreement where it is said:</P>
    <P>(a)  The Conference shall consider</P>
    <P>(i)  security policy;</P>
    <P>(ii)  relations between the security forces and the community...</P>
    <P>(b)  The Conference shall consider the security situation at its regular meetings and thus provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community in the North of Ireland must see the co-chairman of the conference acting on their behalf and satisfying himself, as their and our representative at that conference, that the security forces acted as they did last Friday evening because they had no other choice.  I do not pretend that the job of being a member of the security forces in the North of Ireland is easy.  I do not pretend that the decisions they have to take, sometimes on the spot, are always right.  I have absolutely no sympathy for any member of the IRA.  Frequently I have a lot of sympathy for the security <Col N="1675" /> forces in the very difficult position in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>There is something much bigger, much more important, at stake here.  We are fighting for the confidence, trust and faith of the Nationalists in the North of Ireland within the democratic institutions of all this island.  The Minister sitting opposite, in his role as co-chairman, has the obligation now to ensure that that confidence built up so painstakingly over the last 18 months is not diluted as a result of what happened last Friday evening.  In that time many Nationalists in the North of Ireland have come to recognise that the gun is not the answer to their problems. Rather the patient and painstaking application of political dialogue will ensure success on their behalf.  That must now be built on.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put the Minister in a difficult position; I am not even asking him to reveal the full details of what happened to this House.  But the Nationalists in the North of Ireland must be assured that he is, on their behalf, establishing precisely what happened last Friday evening and that the security forces had no option but to behave in the way they did.</P>
    <P>There will be a general election next months in the North of Ireland.  We must be seen down here to give every possible support and absolutely no succour to the men of violence, but rather every possible support to those who want to see progress in the North of Ireland through politics and dialogue.  In this very sensitive, difficult time the Minister has a particularly difficult and sensitive job to do.  I am asking him here this evening to do that as quickly as possible &mdash; through the Anglo-Irish Conference, to regain the confidence of the Nationalists and of the security forces which I am afraid may have been damaged by the events of the last 72 hours.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the tenor and content of the remarks of Deputy Barry and Deputy Kennedy because they showed an appreciation of the sensitivity involved here.  As far as all the parties in this House are concerned we are committed to a united Ireland.  We are committed to peace and reconciliation in the whole island, to be achieved by democratic, political means.  In the interim period we want to secure better community relations in Northern Ireland, a better society in Northern Ireland, so that there is equal opportunity assured for all people in the North of Ireland, particularly the minority population, in regard to vital areas such as employment.  As a result of the New Ireland Forum process that has evolved in a continuing way, there is a serious sense of responsibility on the part of all political parties here in their view of the Northern Ireland problem. There is an understanding that basically what we have to do is seek to get the two communities in Northern Ireland closer together, get the Northern Ireland community and that of the Republic closer together, to allow for improved inter-community relations in Northern Ireland and ensure that we have an allisland approach to the problem, at the same time ensuring what one might call an east-west dimension between Great Britain and Ireland as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the events at Loughgall last Friday evening, I should say I am glad I have been given an opportunity to comment on them.  I should like to give the House a brief outline of what happened. When I got news of the happening through the Anglo-Irish Secretarial I kept in touch all through Saturday.  I was given information as it came through from the excellent staff we have in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat as part of their ongoing work.  Information was provided at the time.  Further information has come in since and is continuing to come in.  I have been following the matter very <Col N="1677" /> closely and have maintained close contact also with the British authorities in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I issued a statement on Saturday in which I described the attack on the RUC station in Loughgall as a further example of the futile acts of violence of the Provisional IRA.  I emphasise the words &ldquo;futile acts&rdquo; because it is the futility of the cycle of violence that is so horrible and only exacerbates the situation further from wherever the violence comes and, on this occasion, the initial violence did come from the Provisional IRA.  Of course it was met with further violence.  Therefore, what might be described as the cycle of violence is the horrible situation to which actions of the kind attempted by the Provisional IRA in Loughgall lead.  It is utterly futile.  The loss of young lives is a futile act in itself.  The contribution towards the sort of Ireland we are seeking, and sought to achieve by way of the New Ireland Forum report recommendations, is rendered more difficult when emotions are exacerbated by futile acts of violence.</P>
    <P>The factual situation as I understand it is as follows: at approximately 7.20 p.m. last Friday evening the Provisional IRA launched an attack on Loughgall RUC station.  Two vehicles were used in the attack, a JCB which was carrying explosives and a van.  The explosives were detonated at the perimeter fence and the force of the explosion ripped the roof off the RUC station and demolished the nearby telephone exchange.  In an engagement with the security forces eight members of the Provisional IRA were shot dead.  These were named as Patrick Kelly, Anthony Gormley, James Lynagh, Patrick McKearney, Declan Arthurs, Seamus Donnelly, Eugene Kelly and Gerald O'Callaghan.  A passing motorist, Anthony Hughes, was also killed and his brother critically wounded. The gun fire lasted approximately ten minutes.  Eight guns and a quantity of ammunition were recovered from the bodies.  The guns included six automatic rifles, one shotgun and one pistol.  Forensic <Col N="1678" /> evidence has linked these weapons to the murder of four members of the Ulster Defence Regiment and three civilans over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The violence which has been unleashed in the North this year has appalled all decent, law-abiding people North and South.  A total of 13 members of the security forces have been murdered by the Provisional IRA so far this year. These have included nine members of the RUC, three UDR members and one British Army soldier.  The North's second-ranking judge, Lord Justice Gibson, and his wife have been assassinated. A civilian instructor at Magilligan prison has been shot and his body used as bait to murder two policemen.  Alleged informers have been tortured and shot. A man doing civilian contracting work for the security forces has been killed and a number of others have died in paramilitary feuding.</P>
    <P>The campaign of violence mounted by the Provisional IRA is morally wrong. Injustices remain in the North but they can be and are being tackled by political means.  The use of such intense and indiscriminate violence to achieve political objectives in the situation now existing in the North is not justifiable.  The wrongs which are done by such violence are greater than the injustices which remain to be removed.  There is very little support in the Nationalist community North or South for such violence.  It is no answer to the problems of this island.  Violence drives people apart, it turns Irishman against Irishman.  I want no part of that. I am certain, in expressing that view, I am expressing the universal view of every Deputy in this House.  The late Mr. de Valera said in this House on 24 June 1947 that the problem of partition &ldquo;cannot be solved, in any circumstances that we can now see by force and that if it were solved by force; it would leave a situation behind it which would mean that this State would be in an unstable position&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to the Irish people today, and to the generations who will come after us, to protect the peace and democracy which have existed in this country for the greater part of this century. <Col N="1679" /> We will vigorously pursue our national goals and aspirations but we will do so only through the political process. There are injustices &mdash; political, social and economic &mdash; which must be overcome in the North of Ireland.  But we shall overcome them by using the framework for persuasion made available to us under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The peaceful, democratic and united Ireland to which we all aspire will not come about &mdash; indeed, cannot ever come about &mdash; if we seek to impose our will by force.  Only by peaceful persuasion will we achieve our objectives.  The &ldquo;armed struggle&rdquo; of the Provisional IRA is unacceptable to the vast majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The violence used by the Provisional IRA is also futile.  Quite apart from the moral question, in practical terms it is not advancing by one iota the cause which it ostensibly serves.  It is totally counterproductive and puts that cause into reverse.  It is destroying whatever basis may exist for co-operation between the Nationalist and Unionist traditions on the island.  The hand of friendship which all decent Irishmen and Irish women in this part of the island want to extend to their Unionist neighbours is being spurned because of the violence perpetrated by the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>I believe it is also right to say that the means used by the lawful authorities to counter this violence must be judged by high standards.  Concern for the safety of all human life must be the criterion for all operations carried out by the security forces who have that duty under the rule of law.  The State has of course a right and a duty to deploy reasonable force in defending itself and its citizens from paramilitary attack.  In the North of Ireland the scale of paramilitary attacks, particularly in recent weeks, has been daunting and the problems facing the security forces there are formidable. However, in a society in which one section of the community has long harboured suspicion towards the security forces, it is important that any circumstances in which the security forces <Col N="1680" /> have deployed extreme force should be clearly shown to have warranted the use of such force.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Barry's view that this must be demonstrated clearly in regard to the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland.  Because of the historical background to this whole situation it is very important, essential and right that everything the security forces do must not alone be but must be seen to be within the realm of the rule of law.  It is essential to take, brick by brick, the confidencebuilding measures that are needed between the communities in Northern Ireland.  Not the least of these confidence-building measures is the need to build up a regard on the part of the two communities, and particularly the Nationalist community, for the police force in Northern Ireland.  That is one of the aspects to which I will devote further attention within the conference milieu.  It is a matter for discussion at the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    <P>In the discharge of my duties as co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference I will be very concerned to uphold the principle to which Deputy Barry adverted that any action taken in the legitimate interests of security will be of a kind that people who respect the rule of law can support.  In particular, the Nationalist population who have suffered by the wrong exercise of an institutional attitude during a long number of years must be motivated by an acceptance of the fact that a legitimate police force operates within the Northern jurisdiction, a police force that will concern themselves with not alone exercising the rule of law but with exercising it in total fairness and in an even-handed, balanced and equitable manner towards all sections of the community.  The more that aspect permeates the consciousness of the two communities in Northern Ireland the better we can make progress towards a fundamental respect in that part of the island for the rule of law and for the protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 May 1987.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that a quarter of the investigative staff in the Office of the Ombudsman have been lost due to a cut of £100,000 between the Revised Estimates for Public Services 1987 and the Estimates published in January 1987 he will ensure that full co-operation is extended to the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my budget speech, the cost of the public service still represents too great a burden on the Exchequer.  I also mentioned that the steps which we have taken to curb public service pay increases must be matched by measures to secure a reduction in the numbers employed in the public service.  The reduction in the Ombudsman Estimate must be considered in that light.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the restrictions which have been imposed on the Estimate for the Ombudsman's Office should have any significant effect on the discharge of the office's functions.  I would call the Deputy's attention to the fact that after an initial, significant, increase in the volume of complaints received by the Ombudsman in 1985 as compared with 1984, the number of complaints received in 1986 &mdash; the last full year for which details are available &mdash; shows no appreciable increase over 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would envisage that by its very nature the work of the Ombudsman which appears to have peaked will probably decrease in the future.  At various points in his latest report, the Ombudsman expresses satisfaction at the progress which is being made in a number of key areas which had generated a significant volume of the complaints received by his office.  Inevitably, the remedying of these problems should result in a decrease in <Col N="1473" /> the volume of work being handled by the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to state what is the average delay in the collection of capital acquisitions tax. Capital acquisitions tax, which comprises a gift tax and an inheritance tax, is, generally speaking, imposed in respect of transactions or events and not by reference to any period of time.  Gift tax becomes due and payable on the date of the gift: inheritance tax, however, becomes due and payable on the date property is retained for the benefit of a successor which may be some time, and even years, after the relevant death giving rise to the claim.</P>
      <P>Assessments of capital acquisitions tax are made by the Revenue Commissioners on returns received from, or on behalf of, the taxpayer and over 75 per cent of the tax so assessed is paid within 30 days of the date of assessment.  Payment of the balance of the tax assessed is sought by way of reminder which normally issues two months after the date of assessment, followed a month later, if non-payment continues, by a 14-day notice to pay.  The case is then referred for legal proceedings to recover the amount due.  Interest at 15 per cent per annum is claimed on all tax in arrears.  In these circumstances, I do not consider that the collection of this tax gives cause for concern.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 20, 25, 56, 58, 59 and 60 together.  Total sales of lottery tickets to 30 April 1987 amount to just over £22 million.</P>
      <P>The balance in the National Lottery Fund Deposit Account at 30 April was £10,275,939.55.  From this, some operating costs and prize liability remain to be met.  No surplus funds have as yet been transferred to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The terms of the licence under which An Post National Lottery Company operates the lottery on the Minister's behalf envisaged that when the lottery is fully operational, its proceeds will break down as follows: Prizes, 45-50 per cent; APNLC&mdash;operating expenses, 18.65 per cent; management fees, 1.1 per cent.  Surplus paid over to Exchequer, 30.25-35.25 per cent.  Operating costs are projected to be somewhat in excess of 18.65 per cent for 1987 since start-up costs have to be met and the sales-cost ratio will be relatively high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The revised Estimates for the Public Service include £7 million which will be available to the Exchequer from the national lottery in 1987.  The Government have decided that this should be allocated in the following proportions: £3,150,000 for youth and sports projects; £1,750,000 to arts, culture and the Irish language; £2,100,000 to projects in the health area.</P>
    <P>Youth activities are to be included among the purposes to which lottery moneys may be applied.  The Minister for Education will determine in the first instance the apportionment of the £3.15 million allocated for youth and sport as between youth activities and sporting activities.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau is to be entirely financed from the national lottery and £2 million is being allocated for this purpose this year.</P>
    <P>It has already been announced that £0.25 million of the £1.75 million allocated for arts, culture and the Irish language will be made available to the Irish Film Board.  Decisions on the allocation of the balance will be taken by the Ministers directly involved.</P>
    <P>These allocations will not require any amendment of existing law.</P>
    <P>A decision regarding the distribution of any additional income accruing to the Exchequer from the national lottery over and above the £7 million referred to above will be announced later in the year when the total surplus available for 1987 has been more clearly quantified.</P>

      <P>I am most anxious to ensure that the Ombudsman receives the fullest co-operation from all public bodies and persons whose actions are subject to his investigation. The Ombudsman has said in his 1986 report that he appreciates very much the co-operation &ldquo;of the great majority of public servants&rdquo;.  Moreover, he also points out that, while on a few occasions confrontation between his office and public service bodies took place during the course of his investigations, in all such cases his recommendations were accepted.</P>
      <P>I should mention that when the Ombudsman was appointed, all Departments were formally requested to give him every assistance in the discharge of his statutory duties.  Departments were also instructed to adopt certain procedures which would help to ensure a good working relationship between the Ombudsman and Departments.  A copy of that circular has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>If I felt that the Ombudsman was not being accorded the respect and co-operation which his office warrants, I can assure the Deputy that I would take appropriate action.  I do not consider that the comments made by the Ombudsman in his last report call for such intervention on my part at this stage.</P>

    <P>The figure of £5.051 million is made up of the £4 million saving referred to in the reply and other savings announced in the budget principally relating to closing down the farm classification office.</P>
    <P>The changes in ministerial-departmental responsibilities decided by the Government have necessitated substantial revisions to a number of Votes. These changes which have been incorporated in the revised Estimates involve mainly (i) the amalgamation of the Votes for the Office of the Minister for the Public Service and (ii)  the restructuring of the Fisheries, Tourism and Communications Votes into the Marine (No. 35), Tourism and Transport (No. 40) and Communications (No. 41) Votes.  As a result, the revised Estimates for these Votes are not comparable with the original 1987 Estimates.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated that the level of staffing in his office is below what he considers adequate for the totally effective discharge of his responsibilities. A request for extra staff by the comptroller was not accepted, however, by the former Department of the Public Service, having particular regard to the fact that the office no longer had responsibility for the audits of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  That Department was anxious that the organisation and systems of the office be reviewed to establish whether its capacity could be increased by means other than the creation of additional posts.  The comptroller did not agree to this suggestion but I consider that such a review should take place before the provision of additional posts &mdash; which all have to be paid for by the taxpayer &mdash; is considered.</P>

      <P>In 1983 a circular issued to all Departments urging strict examination of postal costs and elimination of any wasteful practices.  Electronic payment of salaries direct to bank accounts &mdash; Paypath &mdash;<Col N="1490" /> reduces postal costs and already applies to many public servants.  Discussions are in progress with the Associated Banks to extend this facility to certain categories not covered by existing arrangements. Further instructions are being issued to all Departments to critically review their postal operations in order to achieve maximum economies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the plans, if any, he has to collect the health levy due by farmers to the Exchequer; the total amount of such sums now due; and whether he proposes to legislate for the charging of interest on arrears of such levies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health contributions due from full-time farmers were collectable by the health boards for years prior to the year ended 5 April 1985.  Contributions from full-time farmers for the year ended 5 April 1985 and subsequent years are collectable by the Revenue Commissioners as are contributions from part time farmers for all years.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Department of Health that a total of £6 million is still outstanding from the farming sector in relation to demands issued by health boards covering the period 1 October 1971 to 5 April 1984.  The arrears now being collected by the health boards are allocated directly to the budgets of the health boards.  Health boards are continuing to use the enforcement procedures available to them to collect outstanding amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that demands and reminders are issued to those who are charged with payment.  The next step in collecting outstanding payments would be to have collection enforced either through the courts or the sheriffs.  The arrears for the health contributions represent only a tiny fraction of the arrears which arise in the collection process under all tax heads. The resources devoted to the collection of any particular arrears must necessarily reflect the scale of those arrears in the context of all arrears of tax.  Available <Col N="1492" /> resources have had to be deployed in the enforcement of much larger sums of tax outstanding.  It has accordingly not proved practicable up until now because of overall limitations of staff resources to, at the same time, commence enforcement proceedings in the case of health contributions.  The situation is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>The total amount now outstanding from farmers and collectable by the Revenue Commissioners is £9.7 million.  This figure is no more than an estimate and on the basis of previous experience the amount will be subject to downward revision on closer examination, on appeal, and for various other reasons, and the figure will change accordingly. The actual amount which is likely to be collected out of the £9.7 million is £2 million.</P>
    <P>It would be of no avail to introduce interest charges while the situation remains that enforcement of the tax is not immediately practicable.  However, the introduction of such a change is something I will bear in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Civil servants whose career breaks are due to expire have the option of seeking to resume duty, extending their career breaks up to a maximum of five years or resigning.  In this context and based on current trends it is estimated that between 100 and 150 civil servants will seek to return to work before the end of <Col N="1493" /> 1987 and that a further 200 to 300 will seek to resume duty in 1988.

      <P>Established civil servants are not covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The statutory provisions for the payment to them of compensation for loss of office is set out in sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>Non-established civil servants are pensionable under the provisions of the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees, which is a non-statutory scheme.  On redundancy an unestablished civil servant, provided he has a minimum of five years service, is entitled to receive: (a) immediate payment of his lump-sum, calculated at the rate of 3/80ths of annual pay per year of actual service, and (b) a preserved pension, payable at age 65 and calculated at the rate of 1/80th of annual pay less twice the annual rate of contributory old age pension payable to a single person without an adult dependant per year of service.  The pension is calculated on the updated equivalent of his pensionable pay on his last day of pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as unestablished civil servants are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts, they are entitled to lump-sum <Col N="1494" /> payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if a separate tax section has been set up to approve the reimbursement of round-sum expenses by a private sector employer to his employee in accordance with a predetermined scale; the date of its establishment; the cost of the section; the savings achieved by it in the financial year 1985-86; if his attention has been drawn to the disruption being caused to business while employers are awaiting approval; if his attention has further been drawn to the burden being imposed on employees who cannot afford to incur expenses on behalf of their employers; the average time taken by the section to (a) respond to each application and (b) to grant approval; the statistics or criteria which are being used by the section to establish that payments are no more than reimbursing employees for the actual expenditure incurred; if the criteria are the same for public and private sectors for (i) costing allowable payments and (ii) granting approval; if he has made regulations; if not, if he intends to facilitate speedy approval of applications, rather than raising numerous queries on each application; if so when.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax treatment of round-sum expenses payments made by employers to their employees is dealt with in paragraph 35 of the Employer's Guide to PAYE (PAYE Guide No. 6) and the treatment is the same for employees in the public and private sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approval of round sum expenses payments made in accordance with a scale agreed between employer and employee (e.g. car mileage allowance, subsistence allowance, &ldquo;country money&rdquo; etc.) would normally be a matter for negotiation between the employer and his local inspector of taxes.  However, cases proper to the Dublin PAYE districts are for the present being dealt with, in addition to other duties, in a central area in Dublin General District.  Provided <Col N="1507" /> the relevant information being supplied to the inspector is satisfactory, there should be no undue delay in approving the payments in question.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the arrangements for dealing with the payments referred to in the question which are designed to counteract abuses which were prevalent in the past are being operated correctly and as expeditiously as current staff and other resources permit.  The inspector of taxes has no power to make regulations in this field.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of any case where a lengthy delay did occur in a tax district in granting the necessary approval and if she supplies the details I will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>As regards my own Department, staff complement and allocation are kept under review by the Department's management committee by reference to changing priorities, policies and workload. Any surplus staff identified are redeployed elsewhere.  Regarding other Departments the identification of staff surplus possibilities emerges from the control mechanisms operated centrally by my Department in relation to civil service numbers.</P>

However, he was allocated a quota of 5,648 gallons from the national reserve for new entrants which was set up in July 1985.  He would also, of course, qualify on a priority basis for an allocation from the flexi-milk available within his co-op.

Approximately one-third of the total would be new jobs.  While I am not in a position to give details of the precise work schedule for each of the bogs in question since this is an operational matter for Bord na Móna, I can say that, taken in the overall, development of these additional areas will span the five-year period over which EC assistance can be made available under the terms of the regulation mentioned above.</P>

      <P>The community council in question has sought approval for two projects under the social employment scheme.</P>
      <P>The first project which started in January 1987 proposed the setting up of a play school for socially deprived children. This project employs three people and will continue until January 1988.</P>
      <P>In order to remain within the budget provided for the social employment scheme in 1987 regional participation quotas have been allocated.  Consequently new projects and participants may commence only when sufficient numbers of current participants complete their term of employment under the scheme.  The south-east region of the NMS has a substantial list of projects awaiting clearance to commence.  In these circumstances while approval had been given in June 1986 for the second project which proposes work of a environmental nature, it may be some time before clearance can be given for the commencement of this project.</P>

      <P>In answer to a parliamentary question of 3 July 1986 it was stated that under the conditions of the social employment scheme a participant may normally be employed on the scheme for a maximum period of one year.  It was also stated that <Col N="1558" /> if the workforce in a particular area was inadequate the NMS would consider the re-employment of eligible persons who have completed a year on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The development of the scheme since mid-1986 has meant that more than an adequate workforce is available in the majority of regions, including the area referred to by Deputy Keating in his question of 8 April 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Drugs Advisory and Treatment <Col N="1560" /> Centre in Jervis Street does not operate a register of addicts as such.  A confidential record of those patients who have attended the centre is kept for the centre's own information.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse has examined the need to establish a register of addicts but the general view of the committee was that a sufficiently strong case does not exist to justify the establishment of such a register.  The committee is aware that such a register does exist in the United Kingdom but even the Home Office, who maintain the register there, recognise that there are serious shortcomings in it.  However, our co-ordinating committee are keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>I am setting out, in table form, the statistics available in relation to the total number of patients who presented for treatment of drug abuse at the Drugs Advisory and Treatment Centre for the years 1981-86, together with details of those who were treated for heroin abuse.

    <P>Of the 1,331 patients who attended the centre in 1986, 1,187 were residing in Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>We would estimate that there are approximately 4,000 hard drug addicts in this country, with the vast majority located in the Dublin area.  This estimate is based on information obtained from both the Drugs Advisory and Treatment Centre in Jervis Street and the Garda Síochána.  One must bear in mind that research has shown that there can be a three to four year time lag between first contact with hard drugs and first contact with treatment services.  However, we are doing our utmost to ensure that abusers come into contact with the treatment services <Col N="1561" /> much sooner, particularly through the work of community addiction counsellors in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>Aontas will receive £77,000 by way of grant-in-aid from my Department this year.  In 1986, the amount allocated to that body was £94,500, which was also by way of a grant-in-aid.  I appreciate that this represents a decrease in the provision being made for Aontas in 1987 over last year's provision.  The budget required sacrifices to be spread across all groups in society, while protecting those most in need.  Current economic circumstances are such that a reduction in public expenditure is essential if the Government is to restore our public finances to a sound footing.</P>

      <P>My Department has approved in principle the provision of the <Col N="1567" /> usual grants towards the cost of providing permanent accommodation for the All-Irish national school, Scoil Aonghusa, Drogheda, County Louth.  An outline plan for the project has been prepared and currently my Department is in negotiation with the corporation of Drogheda with a view to acquiring a suitable site.  I am not in a position at this stage to give details of the likely cost of providing the school, nor am I in a position to state when approval may be given to go to tender or when the building is likely to commence.  I think it fair to advise the Deputy that because of the extent to which my Department's 1987 allocation of capital for the national school building programme has already been committed prior to my assuming office, I am not likely to be in a position to allocate capital to advance this project significantly within the current financial year.</P>

      <P>The person in question has not been refused payment of a higher education grant.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities (county councils and county borough corporations). It is understood from Waterford County Council, the local authority administering the scheme in the area of the student concerned, that in the light of distance and local public transport services, this student could reasonably be expected to travel daily between his family residence and the college which he is attending.  Hence the lower-adjacent rate of grant in respect of maintenance is the maximum payable in this instance.</P>

It was subsequently reported to my Department that the selected contractor did not proceed with the work.  My Department in March 1987 authorised the school authorities to invite tenders again.  Their report on the tender competition was recently received in my Department and is under consideration. It is not possible at this stage to say when <Col N="1570" /> work on the project will commence.  My Department will communicate as soon as possible with the school authorities.</P>
