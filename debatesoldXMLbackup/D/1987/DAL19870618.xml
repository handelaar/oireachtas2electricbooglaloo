It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 5.30 p.m. today and not later than 9.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted at 9 p.m. tonight.  It is further proposed that the sitting of the Dáil shall be suspended today between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.  It is further proposed that Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, shall be taken without debate and shall be decided by one question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would answer the following query.  The Order of Business proposes a number of items including a limited debate on item No. 19.  It is proposed that Second Stage of the Labour Services Bill, which proposes to fundamentally change aspects of training and recruitment, be taken in a limited form of debate, of only two hours. That is allied to the situation last night when all Stages of the Tourist Traffic Bill were taken in 40 minutes.  It is also proposed to appoint five committees without any debate whatsoever.  Will the Taoiseach say whether he honestly believes that structure of an Order of Business is in any way satisfactory?  Does it not affect the rights and the obligations of smaller parties in this House to participate in the democratic process? Because of the way business is ordered there will be virtually no speakers from these parties.  Secondly, does he not agree it will fundamentally affect the rights and the obligations of every backbench Member in this House who has a right to participate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask a brief question in conclusion.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly of all a point which has not been demonstrated clearly enough, it sells short the rights and the duties of the Members of this House in terms of doing, in the public interest, the job efficiently and well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek clarification from the Taoiseach on two matters.  I believe it is normal that Whips' meetings take place on Thursday afternoons.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach if it would be in order for the Whip of the Labour Party to attend the meeting of the Whips <Col N="2543" /> this afternoon?  Secondly, does the Taoiseach not think it is appropriate if an announcement is to be made today in relation to sponsorship in the region of hundreds of millions of pounds of the Goodman meat company that that announcement be made in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That aspect of the matter is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, for the past four years the Taoiseach and his colleagues always insisted that an announcement should be made in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled that aspect of the matter out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach when the Export Promotion Bill is to be circulated?  I understand from an answer the Taoiseach gave last week that it must be taken before the summer recess.  Obviously, it would be desirable that there would be adequate time to study the legislation before it is debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the matters raised point by point.  The Labour Services Bill has, in principle, been around for a long time.  All we are proposing at present is to take Second Stage. Unfortunately, the Minister for Labour is not available this morning because of an illness but he will be here later in the day.  Perhaps the Deputy will have an opportunity of raising his objections on Second Stage.  It is a Bill the principle of which has been discussed in some considerable detail.  The Deputy could discuss with the Minister on Second Stage the question of when Committee Stage will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position with regard to the two hour limitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Whip could communicate with the Deputy about that matter later today.  On the question of the committees, this is really <Col N="2544" /> only a formality.  The committees were approved here recently, they went to the Seanad and they are coming back to the Dáil today so we can note they have been approved by the Seanad because many of them are joint committees.  With regard to Deputy Bruton's point about the Export Promotion Bill, it is a simple Bill. It proposes only to raise the limit of funds available to CTT.  I understand the Whips are discussing whether it is necessary to take it before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked about this matter last week the Taoiseach said there were very many complex decisions to be taken in regard to this Bill, including who should be responsible for the export promotion of beef.  That was specifically mentioned by the Taoiseach.  Now he is telling us it is a very simple Bill and that it is simply a question of raising limits. I appreciate the Government may have changed their minds on this matter.  It is my understanding that CTT will be forced to spend money during the summer without statutory authoristaion unless legislation is enacted before then.  Obviously, if that is so, it is desirable that legislation be circulated quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the whole area is a complex one.  What we propose, pending legislation dealing with the whole complexity of export promotion and sale of our products abroad, is just to do what is technically necessary at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about getting permission to attend the Whips' meeting today and the Taoiseach may want to reply to that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of courtesy to the Labour Party I should like to say that if the Whip of that party wished to meet the Government Whip this afternoon that can be arranged.  I cannot compel the other Whips to meet.  My duty extends only to ensuring that the Government Whip will be delighted to meet the Whip of the Labour Party at any time, possibly over a cup of coffee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter for the country and I am asking the Taoiseach to allow Government time to debate it in view of the urgency of it. The Taoiseach would be able to accede to any request if he wished.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to allocate Government time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Labour Services Bill I should like to reiterate what my colleague Deputy Keating said about it and ask the Taoiseach to consider setting aside further time for this major Bill which affects three major agencies of the State through which millions of pounds are channelled in funds.  There are many aspects to it which I would like to address and to date I have not had an opportunity to do so, irrespective of whether there was a debate on Second Stage in the last Dáil.  In fact, a separate Bill was introduced in the last Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view it is not repetition. I should like to make the point that on Second Stage of the last Bill the Minister, when in Opposition, spoke for more than one hour but we are being offered an hour and a half today.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made her point.  I should like to indicate that I wish to ascertain from the House the extent to which the proposals of the Taoiseach in respect of the Order of Business are agreed or are not agreed so that <Col N="2548" /> the Chair may clear up the matter by way of a composite motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise what I hope will be a non-contentious matter which relates to the Order of Business. I have read reports in the newspapers of new committees being formed. Some Members who belong to parties other than the main parties have suggested the concept of the new committees, such as a committee on foreign affairs, and there is no question of us being satisfied to return at the end of the summer recess to find the terms of reference, membership and scope of the committees decided in advance.  It would not facilitate the order of the business of the House unless we have an opportunity of debating adequately the number of new committees, their format, terms of reference and why some committees have been chosen in preference to others.  That is a reasonable request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the unfortunate contentious discussions we have had this week could be resolved if he would be willing to take an initiative to review the present procedures affecting the meetings of the Whips?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make that precise point.  I am asking the Taoiseach, with respect, if he will not consider that the best interests of the House, and the nation, will be served by getting that type of consensus rather than having this unfortunate unpleasantness every morning which will continue if we are forced down that road.  We do not want to go down that road but we are being forced to do so.</P>

You, a Cheann Comhairle, as well as anyone in the House, know the record and the tradition of the Labour Party in this House.  We have played a proud role since the fondation of the State but, at this stage, we have no possibility of having an input or anything considered for the Order of Business.

On this side of the House, our Whip endeavours to conduct the affairs of the House in the traditional manner to the best of his ability. It is not his fault that the Whips from the parties who have just left the House are very rarely available.  They are given, in so far as he is concerned, every possible courtesy and consideration in the ordering of business.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The article states:</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Ray MacSharry has modified the stringent conditions which must be met in order for professionals to obtain interim refunds of the new withholding tax on fees from certain State bodies.</P>
      <P>The original provisions, contained in the Finance Bill circulated on May 23 last, laid down the following requirements which must be met before an interim refund of tax may be made:</P>
      <P>It goes on to specify what they are and continues:</P>
      <P>The Minister has dropped the first three of the above conditions and now an interim refund may be obtained if the professional has complied with the fourth condition and produces certificates of the tax withheld.</P>
      <P>This is a very authoritative article by Mr. Pat Newham of KMG Reynolds McCarron.  He is a special correspondent for the finance page of the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Is the Minister doing something by regulation, or has he announced something quietly to the professions, or what is going on?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could help the Deputy.  Presumably amendment No. 42 which I moved yesterday on Committee Stage is what is being referred to. Let me, with the permission of the Chair give the details which I did not get the opportunity to give yesterday.  The amendment was:</P>
      <P>In page 18, Subsection (2), to delete lines 29 to 35.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment was to ease the conditions which will have to be complied with before an interim refund of tax deducted from professional fees will become due.  This is an amendment which has been around for the past few days and perhaps there are interpretations as read out by the Deputy being put on it.  I shall give the details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 makes provision for interim refunds of appropriate tax in certain cases.  In general a set off or refund of a tax under section 17 of the Bill will not be made until some time after the tax has been deducted.  Section 18 of the Bill provides that an interim refund will be made in certain circumstances.  The conditions set out in subsection (2) must be fulfilled before a refund under section 3 will be made.  These conditions are that the major portion, at least 50 per cent of the specified person's business receipts, must be derived from relevant payments and the major portion, again 50 per cent, of the receipts must be expended for the purpose of the trade or profession concerned. In addition, the inspector must be satisfied that the absence of an interim refund would give rise to hardship.  This is designed to cater for persons who must meet payroll and material costs in order to earn the receipts in question.  Profits of the accounting period or base period immediately preceding that which is the subject of the claim must have been finalised and the tax thereon paid and the <Col N="2575" /> claim must be supported by forms given under section 15.</P>
    <P>After consideration of this matter it has been recognised that the conditions I have just read out might prove unduly onerous and these are now being removed.  Interim refunds will now become due once the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) are complied with.  On Committee Stage I recommended that amendment and it is contained in the Bill before us this morning.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  &mdash;As respects the year 1986-87 and subsequent years of assessment, the Finance Act, 1980, is hereby amended in subsection (2) of section <Col N="2576" /> 1, by the substitution of `£5,600' for `£5,300' (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985), and of `£2,800' for `£2,650' (inserted by the Finance Act, 1985), and the said subsection (2), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section `the specified amount' means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in a case where the individual would, apart from this section, be entitled to a deduction specified in section 138 (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, £5,600, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, £2,800.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These are amendments which we had down on Committee Stage but which, because of the way in which business was ordered, could not be dealt with. Consequently we have submitted them on Report Stage.  The basis of amendment No. 1 is to seek to raise the exemption limits in line with inflation since the last time they were increased, which was in 1985, In our estimation they should be increased by about 5 per cent.  That is the figure we have provided for in the amendment.  It is a fact which no one can deny that the PAYE tax take in the current year 1987-88 will be up by £300 million.  That was stated in the Government's own back-up material in relation to the budget.  It is also a fact that there have been fairly wide concessions in this Finance Bill for farmers, businessmen, traders, industrialists and so forth yet the PAYE sector pay over 90 per cent of all income tax.  On average the PAYE taxpayer pays 50 per cent more than the self-employed person; he pays something like three times the amount which the large farmer may pay; at the same time we are asking the PAYE sector again to pay an increased amount in the current year.  This is intolerable.  The Taoiseach in his speeches in relation to the budget indicated that the Government recognise that the inequity in the tax system is causing more and more frustration among the PAYE taxpayers.  It is for <Col N="2577" /> that reason that we seek to have this amendment accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>An example of the way that the gap between PAYE taxpayers and other taxpayers has widened is evident by the fact that the Government are taking an extra £300 million from the PAYE taxpayers and yet the amount which has been taken from the farming community in farm tax has actually fallen from £52 million in 1979 to £33 million in 1986.  This is clearly intolerable.  It cannot be argued that the farming sector is any worse off than the PAYE sector.  Indeed, I would argue the reverse.  While the take from the PAYE sector has increased at the same time business tax relief amounted to something like £800 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>There are very grave inequities in the tax system.  By no stretch of the imagination could our amendment eliminate those inequities but at the very least we should attempt to ensure that those who are least well off, the lowest paid workers in the community, should have their tax exemptions raised in line with inflation. That is the basis of the amendment before us.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> One of the most extraordinary things in this Parliament is that the party that conceive of themselves as a Marxist party are the party who are putting down amendments to give relief on income tax.  Colleague parties of the Deputy's party in Europe would see themselves as parties of high taxation and to use that high taxation for public services of a very high order.  It is a reflection on how deep the tax burden bites here that a socialist party or a Marxist party are as concerned about the level of taxation as those parties who represent other sectors of the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very true that the bite is very deep. There are people in semi-skilled jobs and unskilled jobs paying the top rate of income tax.  I appreciate that the Minister does not have very much scope for tax relief in this budget.  It is modelled to a large extent on the budget on which we fought the election and we found ourselves in a position of not being able to give relief on income tax either.  Apart <Col N="2578" /> from one matter of equality between widows and widowers which would not cost the Exchequer very much, I have not sought to amend the income tax code in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy De Rossa for tax relief but the scope is not there for it.  It is a pity in the absence of having the scope to give relief the Minister has not taken the opportunity to put in the Bill a framework which would inspire a certain amount of confidence in the taxpayers that things will not always remain as they are and that there was hope of an equitable tax system and relief in the future.  The Minister should have begun to legislate for a framework which would enable him to progressively move to self-assessment.  A movement to self-assessment, signalled by a legislative measure in the Finance Bill, would be seen as a statement of intent and would help the Minister's economic policy even further.  On Second Stage I made the point I do not believe that an economic policy which is based on one plank of declining interest rates, a matter over which we have limited control, is a sufficiently broad based plank on which to build an economic policy.  We must move to a more equitable form of income tax where the incentive to work is restored.</P>
    <P>I insisted yesterday afternoon on putting to a vote certain changes in the arrangements for rebates on VAT to farmers, not because of the intrinsic merits of the section but because the section was introduced to recover money lost by the abolition of the farm tax.  It was a great mistake by the Minister to abolish the farm tax.  There was a perception that at long last something was being done to take a realistic sum from the farming community and it had a high level of acceptance among farmers.  It was a great pity that the Minister announced that he was proceeding to abolish the farm tax.  It is a great pity also that the Minister discontinued the work of the land assessment office because it will be impossible to widen the scope of taxation if there is no basis for that taxation.  At a minimum, the Minister should have proceeded to accumulate the data on <Col N="2579" /> property so that he or his successors might be in a position to restore farm tax or bring in some other tax at a future date which would widen the scope of taxation and lessen the burden on the unfortunate people who seem to carry the whole burden now.</P>
    <P>On the front page of this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> there is a report on the national debt.  It is clear to everybody there is very little scope to give income tax relief when all PAYE payments, except for £1 million, are swallowed up in servicing the national debt.  When all PAYE is servicing the national debt and there is only £1 million left over, it is not a time for grand eloquent gestures and people demanding an enormous amount of relief.  I know the constraints the Minister is under but as somebody who has been in the company of two previous Ministers for Finance down this road I think he has to give an indication of a legislative nature, and not just a statement in the House, that he is moving towards tax equity and that he intends to reduce the burden of taxation so that at least two-thirds of workers pay the standard rate and not a higher rate.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister does not have the scope we would like him to have, but levels of taxation are a major disincentive to wealth creation and work.  There is a direct connection between our unemployment levels and our level of taxation. I hope the Minister will reaffirm what he said previously.  I ask the Minister to explain also his position on self-assessment. He has not explained this since he became Minister.  During the election campaign he gave the impression that he favoured the system of self-assessment. What is the Government's position on self-assessment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Addressing the comments of the last two speakers, there is a fundamental dishonesty in the amendment at this time.  Deputy Noonan has pointed out some of the problems.  Would it that any Finance Minister were in a position to improve the lot of those on PAYE or in any other tax area.  The facts are <Col N="2580" /> otherwise.  Deputy De Rossa in his contribution and in the amendment is touching on a favourite theme of his party &mdash; the divisions between the urban and rural communities, between PAYE workers and farmers.  This is unhelpful.  We have far too many divisions in a small society. To continue what is a divisive debate and one that does not have a great deal of meaning in the context of the tax take is unhelpful.  As Deputy De Rossa knows, the funds are not available.  It is incumbent on the proposers of an amendment such as this to say what cuts can be achieved to achieve the additional benefits suggested but there is no help in this.  We would all like to be more generous but the funds are not there.</P>
      <P>Referring to Deputy Noonan's point, the Government have indicated two important principles of tax equity and all Deputies and all thinking people and people who are even remotely in contact with what happens in public life are familiar with these two principles.  The first concerns the very basis on which we are to tax people, that is the principle that we will have a tax on income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is indeed an issue. However, that is an important principle. Special tax systems such as the farm tax simply create hostages to fortune and in the long term they are not effective.  They create a plethora of difficulties for the tax system and they have nothing to do with equity in taxation.</P>

      <P>The second principle is to bring two-thirds of taxpayers back to the standard rate in the earliest possible time. Tragically, the bottom line in this is the point that Deputy Noonan made as he was about to resume his seat, and that is that we have a national debt which is eating every penny contributed to the <Col N="2581" /> coffers of this State by the PAYE taxpayers. I should not have to remark that that national debt doubled while Deputy Noonan's party were in office.  It took from 1973 to 1987 for that debt to accrue and in the majority of those years the Ministers in office were from Deputy Noonan's party.</P>

      <P>The point is well taken that some sort of relief for the PAYE sector is necessary.  Certainly tax equity is something we should work towards, but there is no way in which we can achieve tax equity or justice or balanced public finances if we go along with piecemeal amendments which are put down by people who are not in power and who, thankfully, are unlikely ever to attain power.  These amendments were put down because these people wished to have something to show to supporters. This amendment has nothing with which to commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people, particularly PAYE workers, would agree that we should give concessions to this sector but the arguments made by Deputy De Rossa in relation to this Bill suggesting that it conceded concessions to farmers, to businessmen and so on is not true.  It is time we recognised that it does not do that.  The reduction in the VAT refund will bring in more money than we would have got in land tax so the farmers will pay more.  Deputy De Rossa referred to <Col N="2582" /> the reduction in farm taxation but everybody, whether or not they are farmers, knows about the very bad seasons we have had over the past three years, that they had an enormous impact on farm output and, therefore, on farm income. The Bill before the House shows that the VAT refund will take £9 million back from the farmers.  In so far as businessmen or professionals are concerned, we have the withholding tax.  Any concessions given in this Bill are for investment to stimulate the economy and to create employment.  This is the philosophy of our approach.</P>
      <P>The cost of what the Deputy is asking for in this amendment would be £3 million in 1987 and £5 million in a full year. As has been said by Deputy Noonan and Deputy Roche, given the present budgetary difficulties the Government had to decide that there was no scope for increases in personal relief this year.  It is no harm for us to recall that increases given in the 1986 budget were more than twice the level of indexation and will cost the Exchequer more than £200 million this year.  For these reasons I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The question of self-assessment was raised.  I indicated in my closing speech on Second Stage that the Government favoured the principle of self-assessment for income tax and corporation tax.  This will be given priority, but the implications of a change of this nature must be examined in the light of comments received from interested parties on the discussion document issued by the former Minister for Finance last January.  A limited amount of comment has been received to date.  In fact there were approximately six submissions, so there does not appear to be much interest in it.  We will have to examine this in relation to the degree of support for or interest in a change.  We cannot say anything further on self-assessment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that it would be nice to be in a position to do something to help the PAYE sector but at the moment it would just mean increased borrowing.  We are committed, as soon as resources allow, to bring in two-thirds <Col N="2583" /> of the PAYE taxpayers to the standard rate.  I was disappointed in the context of the overall finances this year that I could not do so, but I will be working diligently to bring that situation about.</P>

      <P>A number of points have been made in relation to this amendment.  Deputy Noonan made the point that he is surprised that The Workers' Party should propose tax relief. He went on to indicate why that should be so.  It is because the PAYE sector is burdened with 90 per cent of income tax. PAYE people do not account for 90 per cent of the income earning population of this State.  They account for approximately 60 per cent of the income earning population so why should they account for 90 per cent of income tax?  They do not account for 90 per cent of the income earned in the State.  I have not the figures available of the extent to which they account for income earned but perhaps the Minister has.  That is why we are proposing what I regard as a very minor relief, and we go nowhere near establishing tax equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made the point that the tax burden is very heavy and that he believes there is in existence a strong link between the tax burden and unemployment. I admit I do not understand where he sees that link.  If we assume it is the business community, the industrialists, traders and farmers, who have presumably the capacity &mdash; because we are told these are the people who must be given the incentives &mdash; to create jobs we cannot argue on the one hand that they are under-taxed and, at the same time, that the tax burden is preventing them from creating jobs.  Such an argument is not logical.  Presumably the Deputy is implying that because of the high PAYE tax rate there may be people out there who are not prepared to work and pay 45 or 50 per cent of their wages in income tax.  There may be a minority of such people, but I have come across very few of them.  Certainly no men or women with families I know of have opted out of the workforce because of <Col N="2584" /> the high rate of tax, because they could not afford to live on social welfare.  Bad as the tax system is and high as the tax take is, to try to exist on social welfare is a good deal worse.  I do not see the link there. Perhaps Deputy Noonan and Deputy Bruton, the former Minister for Finance, who is now here will explain that to me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche seems to fear the day when The Workers' Party will come to power.  He believes it will never happen. Perhaps he is right, perhaps he is wrong; we will not know for a while yet.  He made a point in relation to divisions in society.  The Workers' Party did not create these divisions.  We have not created divisions between rich and poor or between urban and rural.  The fact that the PAYE sector is over-burdened and that farmers, businessmen and industrialists are not over-burdened in no way creates a division between urban and rural.  I am sure the Minister and other Deputies who represent so-called urban and rural constituencies are aware that significant numbers of PAYE workers work in so-called rural areas and constituencies. I am aware of PAYE workers working for quite large farmers: they are paying their PAYE every week but their bosses are paying no tax.  It is not a question of a division between urban and <Col N="2585" /> rural; it is a question of tax equity for those who are paying week in and week out and the burden they are carrying. This amendment is doing no more than attempting to redress that to some small extent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy indicated that in proposing such an amendment we should say what cuts should arise as a result of the additional expenditure or loss of revenue. Again, I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that we have in our Second Stage contribution to this debate indicated clearly where we felt additional income could be raised.  We are not a party who favour cuts in the way the present Government have initiated cuts in the health services, for instance, in a totally <i>ad hoc</i>, arbitrary manner which is creating chaos in that area.  In the first place it is not my responsibility, although I do not dodge the question, to indicate where cuts should be made, but I argue there is a different approach to the economy which could avoid the kind of disruptive cuts which are being made by the present Government.</P>
      <P>For the life of me I cannot see why it is not possible for the Government to bring health service interests together to discuss the development of the health services.  Let me beg the tolerance of the Chair for a moment on this point.  There is no doubt there is substantial expenditure on health services and that we should get very much better health services for the money we are spending. However, to turn around and say, therefore, that we must cut the expenditure and sack porters, nurses, hospital doctors and a variety of other people working in the community as health co-ordinators, drug counsellors and so on as is happening in the Eastern Health Board area at the moment is not a rational approach to reorganising the health services.  In no sense will I attempt to indicate where further irrational cuts should be applied, but there is a rational approach to this area to which the Government, had they sat down and thought about it, could have applied themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the cost is too <Col N="2586" /> much.  I realised in proposing this amendment that that was prescisely what the Minister would say from the point of view of the totality of his Finance Bill.  He has it worked out to the point where a certain amount must be taken from the PAYE sector.  He argues that more is to be taken from the farming community this year.  I withhold judgment on that until I see the outcome because I do not believe it.  I do not believe that self-assessment, which I favour, will work unless there is a question of complete and full disclosure of assets, bank accounts, deposit accounts and other holdings.  I am well aware of at least one farmer of my acquaintence who has three farms only one of which is in his own name and he pays no tax.  There are many ways of skinning a cat.  The various elements of the self-employed community will pay the best accountants and so forth to find their way around the Finance Act and all the tax Acts.  I agree with self-assessment, but if we are going down that road there is a need to ensure full disclosure because it cannot work otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fall in the tax take from the farming community because of the bad years.  In my contribution I did not argue that there was a crock of gold out there, but I am saying that they are not taxed at the same rate as the PAYE sector.  That causes frustration and divisions which Deputy Roche referred to &mdash; not urban and rural divisions but divisions between the PAYE sector who are urban and rural and the farming community and the other self-employed elements in our community. Bad years do not account for the fall in the tax yield.  The tax to which I am referring is, if you like, a total tax, including rates which were abolished by a previous Government and were not replaced by any kind of income tax or land tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister contended that the withholding tax would also increase the tax yield.  Unless I misunderstood the principle of that tax completely, it simply brings forward the payment of tax.  It does not mean that there will be any <Col N="2587" /> additional tax paid by the persons concerned.</P>

      <P>No, I did not describe withholding tax as a concession. I pointed out that there was a large number of concessions, such as that in relation to traders who are now treated for tax purposes in the same manner as industrialists.  That is a significant concession. There is no parallel concession to the PAYE sector in this Bill.  The abolition of the farm tax was a concession to the largest farmers in this State.  There is no parallel concession being given in this Bill.  If the Minister cares to check the record of what I have said so far he will find that I did not refer to the withholding tax as a concession.  I was about to say that we have supported the withholding tax as a very blunt instrument but it does constitute some gesture, let us say, to the PAYE sector, some attempt to catch those who dodge paying tax left, right and centre.  If we can devise some means by which they pay as they earn, then by all means do so.  I do not see why it cannot be applied to those who collect fees in the private sector. Yesterday some Members almost had apoplexy here when it was suggested that it should be extended to the private sector as well as to those who collect fees from the State.  That would constitute a significant move if the Minister would consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I anticipated that the arguments advanced would be as they have been &mdash; that the cost would be too high, that we want tax equity but not now, that we must wait until everything is in order.  I do not believe that is acceptable to the <Col N="2588" /> vast majority of PAYE taxpayers who want to see equity now and not when the larger parties in this House see fit.</P>

    <P>(2) Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1986, shall have effect subject to the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  The First Schedule shall have effect for the purposes of supplementing subsection (1).</P>
    <P>This is in line with the previous amendment. It seeks to give some assistance to those on PAYE in the absence of indexation to allow for inflation.  It also proposes to increase personal allowance, employee allowance, married person's allowance, widowed person's allowance and an additional allowance for widows and others in respect of children.  We have a similar point to make in regard to this amendment as we had in regard to amendment No. 1, namely the take from PAYE workers has increased this year by possibly up to £300 million and perhaps more &mdash; we will know that at the end of the year.  There was no concession or reduction despite all the references by people on the Government and Opposition benches, both in this Government and the last one, to the need to widen the tax bands, the need for tax equity and so on.  There have been calls on the Minister to allow for indexation to ensure that at least when a decision is made on tax it will be maintained at the original rate and will not increase annually.  In this case we are seeking to add another 5 per cent to the allowances to give this slight concession to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa already made the argument about the advantages being gained constantly each year from each budget by other sectors and the same happened in this year's budget.  They would be at a loss were it not for the PAYE sector because without the increases in that sector concessions could not be given in other areas.  The arguments are so strong and so self-evident it is difficult to understand why the Minister for Finance last year and again this year <Col N="2591" /> failed to allow in his budgets for indexation and inflation.  The allowances for the PAYE workers have not kept pace with inflation and, therefore have been eroded year by year.  In other words, their allowances are being reduced each year. They are less in 1987 than they were in 1986 and they were less in 1986 than they were in 1985.  We all understood, after the Commission on Taxation reported, that such allowances would be increased or at least maintained by indexation.  We are not putting forward any new arguments on this but the Government are not making any concessions to the PAYE sector although they, like the other parties in the elections, said they would do so.  In that case one would expect that allowances would not be made to other sectors thereby increasing further inequity in the taxation system.  It is inequity that is causing the great anger and upset in the PAYE sector and has done so in the last seven or eight years. People never said they wanted income tax abolished, like the farming sector.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector are prepared to pay their full share provided other sectors pay their share.  Equity in the system and not a reduction in taxation is called for.  We are calling for a spread in the tax system so that all sectors, farmers, professional people, the self employed and everybody with an income, pay their fair share.  The amount of taxation levied on other sectors is not equitable in relation to the PAYE sector and they see that the money, even the small amounts of tax put on other sectors, is not collected. Furthermore, some of those other sectors are taking part of the PAYE money and not handing it over to the Exchequer.  As a result when an employer takes money from employees and does not pay it over to the Exchequer the Exchequer is at a loss that year and the following year there must be an increased take from the PAYE sector to make up for the loss being robbed by other sectors.  That is causing constant and increasing anger.</P>
    <P>The reason the anger is not being expressed in the way people want to express it is the huge unemployment problem that is hanging over everybody's <Col N="2592" /> head &mdash; it stands at 250,000 now and is expected to rise to 300,000 in the next few years.  That threat of loss of jobs which is being handed down daily when workers attempt to get better conditions is making everybody afraid to express their anger by walk-outs or strikes In effect, people are being intimidated by unemployment and the threat of further unemployment.  They are unable to express their anger as they did in 1979-80. It is dangerous to put that type of a cap on people's anger because it amounts to developing something that will cause a major explosion at some stage.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the Government will be any different from the last Administration despite the promises made in order to get the votes of the working-class people.  In our amendment we want the Government to retain the allowances at the rate established in 1985 at least.  It is worth pointing out that 1985 was not an acceptable year for the PAYE sector any more than any year since 1979 was but the allowances should be retained at less than inflation.  That is why we were asking for a 5 per cent allowance over two years.  We hope the Minister will accept that there is a need for making an allowance for inflation or some system of indexation so that there will not be this constant erosion of allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not intend to go back over the ground I covered when dealing with amendment No. 1 because the principle in both amendments is the same.  My attitude to them is the same.  I should like to draw the attention of Deputy Mac Giolla to a table included in his amendment in which he continues the discrimination which Deputy Bruton and I have pointed to in amendment No. 3.  In that table he suggests that a widow bereaved in the year of assessment should have an allowance equivalent to the married allowance and seeks to have that raised from £4,000 to £4,200.  What about a provision for a widower bereaved in the year of assessment? Deputy John Bruton will be dealing with our amendment, No. 3, but it is interesting to note that on the face of <Col N="2593" /> the table in his amendment, Deputy Mac Giolla has continued inequality.  Obviously, to lose one's spouse is a disaster in any family but we should get away rapidly from the tax code discriminating between the loss of a husband and the loss of a wife.  We all sympathise with a widow and we want to maintain the married allowance at twice the single person's allowance in the year of the bereavement for her but we must bear in mind that the man who loses his wife is in equally difficult circumstances.  We must remember that apart from the loss of a wife, and the tragedy for the family, that more women are working outside the home and contributing to the economy of the household, frequently on an equal basis with men.  I accept that The Workers' Party do not intend to discriminate between men and women but I was anxious to draw attention to the fact that they continued the discrimination in the table they presented in amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle involved here, and the arguments for and against it, are the same.  The increase in personal reliefs will have a similar effect.  All Deputies share a wish to increase personal allowances for the PAYE sector and that is a laudable aim.  I will not deal with the artificial division between people as referred to by Deputy Mac Giolla. However, it is worth referring to one point he made and putting the record straight in regard to it.  We have a good deal of distortion in the House from time to time and it is no harm to put things right.  Deputy Mac Giolla referred to election promises in regard to the PAYE sector.  He made many promises to that sector happy in the knowledge that he would be unlikely to be in Government and, therefore, would be unlikely to have to try to implement any of them.  The Government party, as the Minister said, promised to reach the stage where two-thirds of PAYE workers would pay at the standard rate within the shortest practicable period.  That is something we should all work towards rather than putting forward spurious arguments and objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2594" /> The problem with the amendment is one of cost.  We were told that the implementation of the last amendment would cost £6 million and my calculations suggest that the implementation of the amendment before us would cost many times that figure.  However laudable amendments are, if the cloth is not there it cannot be cut any finer than it is being cut.  The amendment may have some worthy aims to work for but it is not realistic.  On that basis it does not have much to commend it to the House. Realism is what should be involved in amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The major difference in my response to this amendment is that the cost in 1987 would be nearly £38 million, and in a full year, £63 million. Any Deputy who has been examining the public finances in the past few years will see that there is no scope for that kind of increased expenditure on increased reliefs.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Mac Giolla referred to unemployment.  I was amazed at the sparse references to unemployment and the huge problems that it and emigration have been causing.  To combat these twin problems we must try to get strict order and control of our public finances and then possibly we will make some impact on unemployment and emigration.  Huge numbers of our young people are emigrating.</P>
      <P>All people who have jobs must understand the difficulties.  They pay taxes but at least they are more fortunate than those who have not got jobs and little or no prospect of getting jobs.  All of us here must appreciate what needs to be done before we will be able to begin to correct one of our major problems in recent times.  Unemployment and emigration have been with us always to some extent but they have become more pronounced in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I must oppose this amendment.  Deputy De Rossa made a similar case and he repeated a figure that has been bandied about, that the PAYE sector pay 90 per cent of the income tax collected.  In fact, income tax on salaries <Col N="2595" /> and wages does not constitute 90 per cent of the total tax.  The figure is nearer to 75 per cent of all income collected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan in regard to widowed persons.  Each year, we have had amendments to the Finance Bill seeking to have widowed persons with children treated in the same way as married couples with children for income tax purposes.  There is no justification for not having similar tax allowances for widowed persons and married couples.</P>
      <P>I did not expect the Minister to accept amendments because his aim is to increase the revenue irrespective of whom it hurts or how it hurts the PAYE sector from whom it is so easy to take money.  When a new tax is demanded there is holy war from everybody else. The farmers breathe down your neck, and have been doing it during the past five or six years, and consequently every tax imposed was withdrawn within a year. Indeed in one case the tax they had paid was refunded by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.  The land tax has been abolished. The ease with which tax can be extracted from PAYE workers is such an attraction that Ministers continue to extract it every year despite the report of the Commission on Taxation and the general recognition that it is totally unjustified and immoral to be taking at such a rate from one sector and not taking anything from other sectors.</P>
      <P>The Minister used the argument of unemployment to explain why he should not give equity to the PAYE sector.  That is despicable.  The last Government put up similar arguments.  Taxes in respect of people who have the wealth and the property were abolished in the past few years.  Here, we have the lowest taxation of wealth and property in Europe, much lower than the US, Britain and elsewhere. There is an incentive by way of a 10 per cent only corporation tax for manufacturing industry, a 10 per cent corporation tax for shopkeepers and wholesalers in the export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which money is being <Col N="2596" /> thrown around for other sectors is intolerable when we appreciate what is happening to the PAYE workers.  We have been calling for subsidies instead of tax reliefs so that we can see exactly what is being handed out to whom.  Money is being taken more and more from the PAYE sector.  If they took a case to the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of a worker doing his week's work for a certain wage and never getting that wage for the work done &mdash; the only property which a worker owns is his weekly pay packet &mdash; the Government would be in a right pickle.  The Government might find that it is totally unconstitutional to refuse to give a worker the wage for which he or she is hired.  Farmers can find that rates are unconstitutional, others can find all sorts of taxes unconstitutional, but if the PAYE taxes were found to be unconstitutional, the Government would just collapse, end of story.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government should take a much more serious view and all future Ministers for Finance should follow suit in regard to taxation.  Each year it becomes more and more unjust: each year, more and more people are getting relief, many of them not paying any taxation, while the tax on the PAYE sector is increased year after year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is specious for the Minister to argue that the PAYE sector have a responsibility for the unemployed. Many people say that the trade unions are the cause of all the trouble, that those at work looking for more money are the cause of the trouble.  Those who are the cause of the trouble are Governments who do not face up to the people who have got to be faced up to, the owners of wealth and capital.  Unless they are faced up to, unless they are trampled upon, neither the unemployment problem nor the tax equity problem will be resolved.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2597" />&ldquo;1.  &mdash;Section 138 (b) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as amended by the Finance Act, 1986, is hereby amended by the substitution for subparagraph (ii) of the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(ii) is a widowed person whose spouse has died in that year of assessment, a deduction of &ldquo;£4,000, and&rsquo;. &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I gave the Minister notice some time back that with my colleague Deputy Michael Noonan, our spokesman on Finance, I would be raising this matter on Report Stage.  As I understand it there is a special provision in the law whereby a widow qualifies for a special tax allowance in the year of bereavement and this allowance is not available to a widower in the same circumstances.  I realise this dates from the 1967 Finance Act and was on the Statute Book long before recent developments in social thinking in regard to equality of the sexes and before the Murphy case in which the court decided that it was not acceptable to tax men and women on a different basis in a family situation.</P>
    <P>It seems therefore to be inappropriate to have a provision where men and women in the same circumstances, that is where there is a bereavement, are treated differently and a widower does not qualify for the same tax treatment as a widow. It would be wrong to claim that a widower faces more problems than a widow in the year of a bereavement and I am not making such a claim.  Frequently there will be particular problems for a widower but on the other hand there are also problems for widows.  I am not suggesting better treatment for a widower than for a widow, merely that they be treated the same.</P>
    <P>I believe this discrimination is unconstitutional and if challenged would be overturned.  I also believe the cost involved in making the proposed change would be relatively minimal.  I am not aware that this matter has been raised on the Committee Stage of Finance Bills in the past, and therefore I am not in a position to say what the cost of the change would be.  While I appreciate that the <Col N="2598" /> Minister has settled the overall outline of the Finance Bill this year, it is important that we should have a debate on this issue of social policy at this time.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's views on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I stress that our amendment is not drafted with all the technial resources that are available to the Minister and I hope he will not deflect the basic case I am making by referring to drafting deficiencies.  I am anxious to hear his comments on the general principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  Over a long number of years we have tabled amendments to Finance Bills not specifically relating to this issue but to have all widowed persons with dependants treated in the same way as married couples.  We argued that it is no less expensive for a widowed person, or a single parent, to raise a family than it is for a couple to do so.  The mortgage is exactly the same, the cost of clothing, food and so on are exactly the same.  We have argued that very strongly.</P>
      <P>The matter to which Deputy Bruton is referring is discrimination between a widowed woman and widowed man.  This is a matter of which I must honestly say I was not aware.  I knew there were no widowers' pensions for men, but I was not specifically aware that men were discriminated against in this way.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> By and large women are the sex who are discriminated against.  There is a lot of discrimination under law and in social practice against women in our society. This is a very small element of our tax code which discriminates against men. The fact that it exists will be used by some clever debaters as a reason we should discriminate against women in other areas.  If there is sexual discrimination against men or women in law, we should seek to remove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the discrimination against women Act.  Discrimination is the sum of many little things and we have <Col N="2599" /> come across discrimination in this Bill today which will cost the Minister very little to remove.  I ask him to do it.  We are not talking about a permanent allowance for widowed persons.  We are not asking for a widowed allowance for widowed persons which would be twice the single allowance; we are simply talking about an allowance in the year of bereavement which would be the equivalent of twice the single allowance &mdash; the allowance to married persons.  This applies to widows at the moment in the year of bereavement but nobody could make a case that this should not apply to widowers as well.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>This provision is obviously unconstitutional and case law makes it clear that if this were challenged the case would be successful.  It is unlikely that a group of bereaved people will come together and incur the costs involved to bring a case like this to prove their point. I ask the Minister what the cost would be and if he would do something for these people.  This would create a lot of goodwill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this amendment appears to arise from misunderstandings by the Deputies &mdash; that in the year of bereavement widows are entitled to more favourable tax treatment than widowers.  This is a complex issue as Deputies are aware and I will give all the details I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the amendment as proposed is negligible but it will not do what the Deputies want.  In the more usual case, that is where a married man is assessed to tax in respect of his own and his wife's income, and his wife dies, the man continues to be entitled for that year to the tax entitlements of a married person. Where the husband dies, the wife is entitled to an allowance equivalent to the married personal allowance, that is the higher widowed allowance, single, not double, rate bands and widowed mortgage allowances against her income for the portion of the year in which she <Col N="2600" /> became a widow.  It can be seen, therefore, that the widower and the widow are entitled to personal allowances of the same amount in the year of bereavement. However, a married couple are treated more favourably overall in the year of bereavement where the husband dies as opposed to where the wife dies.  This disparity of treatment arises primarily from the fundamental concept of the taxation of married couples and from the desire to give some additional assistance to a widow in the year in which her husband dies and when possibly her main source of support ceases.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies are suggesting that in the year in which one of them dies, a married couple should be treated exactly the same for tax purposes, irrespective of which of them dies, the amendment will not achieve this.  In a case where the husband was assessed in respect of their joint incomes and his wife dies, the husband would have to get the equivalent of an additional married allowance and additional single rate bands.  In these circumstances, the widower would receive personal allowances twice those of a married man and rate bands one and a half times those of a married man.  Clearly, this would be an unacceptable proposition. Section 138 (b) (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which grants the equivalent of the married allowance to a widow in the year of bereavement was enacted following representations over a long number of years for special tax treatment for widowed persons in the years immediately following bereavement. Widowers were already entitled to the married allowance in the year of bereavement.  Accordingly, in 1980, the equivalent of the married allowance was also extended to widows in the year of bereavement.  For the years after the year of bereavement, widows and widowers are entitled to the same widowed person's allowance and, if there are dependent children, to the same single parent allowance.</P>
    <P>In very unusual circumstances, under present taxation law, the widower might not be entitled to the higher personal allowance in the year of the death of <Col N="2601" /> his spouse, where he has elected to be assessed for tax as a single person.  He would continue to be taxed as a single person in such circumstances but he would benefit from the higher allowance granted to widowed persons which is £2,500.  The fact that in such circumstances he does not get the married personal allowance in the year of bereavement might be considered anomalous. In the circumstances, I propose to have the matter examined with a view to changing the law next year.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have been listening very carefully to the Minister's reply and he has only given a commitment to examine the situation where an anomaly arises when people opt for self assessment rather than joint assessment. That affects a very small number of people.  Will he give a general commitment to look at the whole section and the treatment of widows and widowers before the next Finance Bill?  The Minister seems to suggest &mdash; maybe I misheard &mdash; that a widow would revert to the single limits on mortgage interest allowances on home loans in the year of bereavement whereas the widower would continue at the £4,000 ceiling rather than at the £2,000 ceiling.  That is discriminatory and, therefore, the Minister should look at the whole area of the treatment of widows and widowers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will argue against this amendment also on the grounds of cost and I do not propose to delay the House unduly.  This special PRSI allowance was introduced in 1982 in response to a massive outcry from the PAYE sector at the increases in their PRSI contributions. As a means of defusing the situation, where there was massive withholding of taxes in protest at the huge take from their pay, this allowance was introduced.  Unfortunately, the allowance introduced at that time has been consistently reduced and we are seeking to have it restored to its original level in real terms.  The arguments which Deputy Mac Giolla and I made in relation to tax equity and the unfair burden which the <Col N="2603" /> PAYE taxpayer is carrying applies equally and strongly to this amendment and I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I see nothing wrong with the intent of the amendment but our position is that in Government we examined matters such as this and were unable to give the increased relief which is very desirable. However, we did not have the scope to do so.  We fought an election on these issues and we were fairly severely punished by the electorate.  I will not turn my party into a bunch of hypocrites by taking a different line three months later because we happen to be in Opposition. We will not indulge in the natural handstands of Opposition parties and turn into a bunch of whingers looking for concessions in all directions as if we had never been in office.  We are trying to establish a consistency of policy between our position in Government and in Opposition and we are succeeding.  We are the only party in the House who have maintained consistency in Government and in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I will not deal with the various changes of policy by the Minister's party, but another party in this House, who walked out this morning, since they went into Opposition and as late as the debate yesterday on the Finance Bill amendment in regard to the payment of advance corporation tax, propose to spend money like drunken sailors.  Yet they claim they are the party who introduced the concept of a stringent attitude to public expenditure. They cannot have it both ways.  If people fight an election on one basis and put policies before the people, in common decency they should maintain the logic of that position for at least a period of time until they can develop alternative policies in the light of changing circumstances.  I resent the histrionics of a group who stood for one thing and now progressively are standing for what is diametrically opposed to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has made <Col N="2604" /> some good points.  The realism of his contribution is very welcome indeed and the comments he made just now about the bunch of strolling players who wandered off the stage not so long ago were equally well made.  The concession being suggested for increased relief is something which, again, is desirable.  There can be no doubt about that.  Desirable though it may be &mdash; and desirability is not the only criterion by which we should judge actions or proposals which come before this House &mdash; we have to be realistic.  This particularly desirable change would cost a fortune.</P>
      <P>We have had a situation where over the past few minutes three amendments have been proposed here. Deputy De Rossa earlier on suggested that he had on Second Stage indicated where all the funds could come from.  I submit that is not the case.  This would be a very significant foregoing of revenue.  While the general points the Deputy has made about the need to lift the burden from the PAYE payers are valid, correct and generally widely accepted, this proposal simply does not stand the test of logic. We in this House all know that the funds simply are not there.  As Deputy Noonan has pointed out, the previous Government and the present Government have looked in this direction to find that the only thing that is missing is cash.  There is no shortage of goodwill in this regard. At the end of the day it is funds that are missing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make a general point in this regard, that ultimately, if realism prevails with regard to the national finances the first real benefits will start to accrue to the PAYE payers because the burden of unrealistic policies has fallen excessively and progressively on their shoulders.  It really is not sufficient for any serious party to come before the House and suggest we should effectively double the relief, as is suggested in this amendment and make the invalid points about cuts which they have made earlier.  Sadly, the two things do not stand together.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance many years ago said that the problem <Col N="2605" /> with this State is that we are republican with a republican purse and we cannot afford public officials, public servants or politicians who have imperial ideas.  We cannot afford this type of change however welcome it would be at this time.  Every Deputy in this House and everybody outside it knows that is the case.</P>

      <P>Those are the facts. Perhaps with the expert advice they have available to them in all quarters they might begin now to do out a profit and loss account of the proposals they make. Then we would see the picture in reality. It is reality within which I have to deal, or anyone who holds this office as Minister for Finance.  The reality of this amendment is that it would cost the Exchequer in some form or another, either through increased taxation or increased borrowing, in 1987 alone £50 <Col N="2606" /> million and in a full year £85 million.  I would remind the House that that is in addition to the cost of the concession of £286 which this year is £50 million and for the full year is £83 million to £84 million.  Taking into account what I have said on many occasions and what Deputies opposite and on this side of the House have said, because of the serious state of the public finances there is absolutely no way that consideration can be given to concessions of this nature when the huge costs are involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was not here when Deputy De Rossa moved the first amendment but I said then it was my commitment as Minister for Finance and that of my party in Government that as soon as possible &mdash; and, as I said earlier, I was disappointed we could not do something about it this year &mdash; we would move to a situation where 66 per cent of the people would be on the standard rate of income tax.  That is still our commitment.  In so far as this amendment is concerned I cannot accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few brief points to make.  It is unfortunate the Minister chooses to attempt to bluster his way through this issue, to distort what The Workers' Party have been saying in this House in relation to taxation.  We have made it quite clear that we regard the burden on the PAYE sector as far too heavy.  We have argued for tax equity.  It will presumably not be possible for the Minister to respond on this amendment but perhaps he will respond in the course of the day on the other amendments which will be discussed on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how much the various reliefs included in the Finance Bill for sectors other than the PAYE sector will amount to for the year 1987-88? I am talking about the new reliefs. Perhaps he would also indicate the magnitude of the reliefs already in existence for sectors other than the PAYE sector. I have said that 90 per cent of income tax <Col N="2607" /> is payable by the PAYE sector &mdash; the actual figure is 90.3 per cent.  The Minister said that it is 75 per cent.  I would like that to be clarified at some stage during the day.  I got my figure from official sources.</P>
    <P>It is wrong of the Minister to attempt to imply that the Workers' Party are in any way irresponsible in this House.  We have adopted a very responsible attitude to this question of taxation.  We have attempted to articulate here the very grave discontent which exists among the PAYE sector at the massive burden they are carrying and what they and we see as the constant bowing to very powerful vested interested in our society.</P>
    <P>One has only to recall the degree to which every Deputy was canvassed by the professional bodies in relation to the withholding tax.  This was not an attempt to take any more tax from them but simply to get them to pay their tax earlier. Deputies are under pressure from very powerful vested interests.  These are very small in numerical terms and in terms of the population and workforce of the State but it seems they are very powerful in the corridors of power of this House.  It is necessary that the PAYE sector's case be made equally strongly in this House.  This is what The Workers' Party are doing and will continue to do regardless of distortions and misrepresentations by the Minister or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the figure proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 1 to 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment on Committee Stage and I re-entered it so that I could talk about this section and get clarification from the Minister.  From one reading of the lines which I wish to be deleted it looks as if a loophole in the scheme is being closed.  If that is the intent of it, well and good.  On another reading of the lines it seems that this <Col N="2608" /> could put a spancel on the scheme which would make it inoperable and that there would be no uptake of it.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware this scheme was introduced by the last Government and it has worked very well.  There are factories around the country where significant numbers of employees now have shareholdings through stock options, productivity has gone up, industrial relations are far better, absenteeism has gone down and the general atmosphere of the workplace has improved out of all proportion.  One can see the effect the widespread practice of workers holding shares in the company in which they work would have on the country as a whole. The division between employer and employee would be drastically reduced. Everybody having a stake in the company in which they work would work much harder and productivity and competitiveness would increase enormously.</P>
    <P>The primary reason this amendment is put down is to increase the ceiling on relief and I would be very upset if it had a sting in its tail which would reduce the possibility of workers participating in this scheme.  The conditions laid down in the lines I have asked to be deleted are restrictive in so far as they refer to the proportions of ordinary share capital that have to be held other than by directors and workers.  I want a full explanation from the Minister of lines 1 to 24 on page 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a complete misunderstanding in relation to this but I will explain it.  The wording the Deputy proposes to delete is wording taken exactly from the 1982 Act which set up the profit sharing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to delete part but not all of the provisions of the Bill designed to prevent the relief in respect of dividend income derived from manufacturing profits from being abused through the substitution of tax related dividends for employee remuneration.  A similar abuse of export sales relief dividends took place in the past.  Abuse would take the form of employees, most likely the executive directors and higher <Col N="2609" /> paid employees, surrendering part or all of their salary in exchange for special shares of nominal value specially created by their employers for the purpose on which tax free dividends up to £9,000 could then be paid with a reduced tax liability in respect of the balance of the dividends.</P>
    <P>While the Revenue Commissioners have as yet no evidence of abuse of the relief this is not surprising considering that it was introduced only last year.  Tentative inquiries possibly leading in that direction have been received from one firm of accountants.  In addition, following the publication of last year's Finance Bill it was suggested at various seminars held by accountancy firms on the provisions of the Bill that the relief was a method of giving tax free remuneration to employees.  It was as a result of these suggestions that Deputy Bruton, the then Minister for Finance, decided to warn on Second Stage debate of the 1986 Bill in the Seanad when he said:</P>
    <P>If the section should be exploited as a mechanism for rewarding executives in such companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>These are the 10 per cent companies.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;by issuing tax-relieved dividends to them in substitution for normal forms of remuneration which would attract full rates of income tax, this will be regarded as an abuse of the relief. I wish to give fair warning now that, in the event of instances of such abuse being brought to my attention by the Revenue Commissioners, I shall not hesitate to take action against it by legislation which will have retrospective effect.  The acid test in determining the occurrence of abuse will be whether all dividends paid are realistically related to genuine investments.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to increase the relief from £7,000 to £9,000 in the case of dividends where the company concerned establish a profit sharing scheme for their employees will, of course, increase the attractiveness of a switch of this kind.  In the circumstances it is considered prudent to avail of the opportunity afforded <Col N="2610" /> by the increase in the relief to enact suitable provisions to forestall any attempt at abuse of the relief by the means mentioned above.</P>
    <P>The method chosen is to provide that the relief will be available only in respect of dividends paid on bona fide ordinary share capital of a company.  This category of share capital is defined in very similar terms in the ordinary share capital of a company which qualifies for relief under the approved profit sharing scheme for employees.  The lines which Deputies Noonan and Bruton want deleted contain a wording which is identical with paragraph 8 of the Third Schedule of the Finance Act, 1982, except that clause (c)  of that paragraph has been omitted. Section 5 has been so drafted as to ensure that the same qualifications will apply for the shares under both schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the profit sharing scheme the definition is designed to ensure that employees will be given shares of value in their employing company with the same rights and privileges as other shareholders and not be fobbed off with shares of spurious worth.  In the present case the conditions are similarly designed to prevent spurious shares being created for tax avoidance purposes particularly for the benefit of executive directors and higher paid employees.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have to explain any more because that puts on the record the exact position.  Deputy Bruton had some reports from a paper which I think he now accepts were a misunderstanding of what is being proposed here.  I hope I have explained it to the Deputy's satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation of this section but there is anxiety among people already involved in schemes about the application of this new section.  The profit-sharing schemes already introduced by companies have been a signal success.  In my constituency there are two companies who have issued shares, one in services and the other in manufacturing.  One company has 280 employees and when this scheme was <Col N="2611" /> introduced in 1984 they had approximately 80 applicants for shares.  The effect of the share offer in this company came about because the management and employees sought to have savings in utilising raw material and also in the energy saving schemes the company needed to impose.  Last year approximately 140 employees owned shares in the company.  It was difficult for the company to sell this idea but it has resulted in great industrial relations in the company and it has enormously improved productivity. It has considerably reduced excessive waste.  These people would be loath to hear that the Minister is now interfering with the scheme to which total commitment has been given.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister said that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, raised this matter in the Seanad, but it is significant that he did not proceed with the amendments then.  There is a belief that the terms of the section would compound the difficulties for ordinary employees in companies who hold shares on this profit-sharing basis.  I know that officers from both the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance have examined these schemes and that they are anxious to close off the loopholes but it would be wrong to stifle the scheme totally just to eliminate tax avoidance.  Will the Minister in his reply say whether ordinary employees in public companies such as those of whom I have spoken will continue to enjoy the same conditions as when they joined the scheme?</P>
      <P>I noticed, and it was welcomed last year, that the Minister reduced the number of years within which redeemable shares could be converted from seven to five years and that certainly was an improvement.  It certainly compared favourably with conditions in the UK. From the advice I have given this section will hamstring the scheme altogether and I regret it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 34, after &ldquo;duties&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>or to interest money borrowed on foot of contracts entered into prior to 31st March, 1987.</P>
      <P>This amendment is formulated to deal with what I consider to be one of the most disturbing aspects of the Finance Bill.  A very serious attack is being made on the relief being awarded to people who have raised home loans.  The Minister has decided that the home loan relief régime for income tax purposes will only apply at 90 per cent of its existing level.  I intend to spend some time with this amendment and the next amendment discussing the implications of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister introduced his budget he almost used the lines which we had used in our advertising campaign in the general election.  The Minister did not actually talk about breaking out of the vicious circle of over-spending leading to high interest rates, to high taxation and to unemployment.  He waited until the debate on the Finance Bill to use the phrase &ldquo;vicious circle&rdquo;.  The Minister took what we advocated as a major economic plan, the reduction of interest rates, <Col N="2613" /> and sought to make it his own.  We welcomed that in his budget speech, but then the Minister introduced at least two measures in this Bill which run counter to that stated policy.</P>
    <P>The benefits of reduced interest rates are manifold.  Obviously if one is in debt and interest rates are down that is good for the person who owes a lot of money. If somebody has a very large house and mortgage rates are down that is good for the householder.  The benefits of reduced interest rates are passed on to the householder who, in turn, has more disposable income.  The sum of all the increased disposable income from householders should give some little boost to consumer spending.  Those are good reasons for reducing interest rates, but the primary reason for reducing interest rates is that rates will come to a level where people and companies with money will invest in risk-taking activity here and it will pay them to take risks rather than to invest in Government paper when interest rates are low.  Even with the reductions, the incentive is not there for people or companies with spare cash to invest in risk-taking areas of this economy and, consequently, we have massive unemployment which is rising.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a direct relationship between over-expenditure by a Government and unemployment.  There is an even more direct relationship between the lack of investment in an economy and unemployment.  If people and companies do not invest there will be fewer jobs.  If people and companies do not invest in new activity there is no hope for the myriad of young people who will remain unemployed.  If we look at what has happened over the past while, not alone do we see this massive purchase of Government paper rather than taking any risk in the job creating area, but we also see our major multinational successful companies investing outside the country. Many of our successful companies are going into North America and taking risks there because the opportunity to make money there is greater than at home.  The Minister knows this and he can argue as effectively as I can.  Within <Col N="2614" /> that scheme of things, and if the name of the game is lower interest, rates, I cannot see why the benefits of lower interest rates cannot be passed on to the most harassed sector of our population.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal are fully operational. They were set up in 1974 to administer the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted and a provision of £3,200,000 has been made in the 1987 Estimates to enable them to make compensation awards to persons who have suffered personal injury as a direct result of violent crime.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal have been effectively rendered at nought to deal with injuries that arose as a result of crime since March 1986.  For that reason I ask the Minister if that is why the Minister's party undertook in their manifesto in the last election to review legislation in regard to support for victims of crime. With regard to the question, will the Minister address himself as to what plans he and his Department have to restore the terms of reference of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal so that victims of current crime and crime that has occurred since March 1986 will be compensated? It is totally disingenuous of the Minister who knows that they are dealing with a backlog &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the Deputy is confusing the abolition with the change in the scheme which was introduced last year.  The previous Government considered that the scheme's compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted was proving very costly to the Exchequer and decided that the Minister for Justice should review the conditions of the scheme with a view to reducing its impact on the Exchequer. Following consideration of the review of the scheme, the Government approved the revised scheme in January 1986 and in the revised scheme compensation may not be paid in respect of pain and suffering attributable to injuries sustained on or after 1 April 1986.  Compensation in respect of injuries sustained before that date is paid in accordance with the terms of the original scheme.  There is a substantial backlog of claims for pre-1986 injuries awaiting attention at present. Approximately £23 million has been paid in compensation since the inception of the scheme, but the provision in the Estimates in recent years has been below the estimated real cost of the applications involved.  This year, there is a provision, as I said, of £3.2 million for 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National <Col N="2617" /> Recovery</i> mentioned by Deputy McCartan there is a proposal to review legislation in regard to support for victims of crime.  However, in the present financial climate there would appear to be no hope, this year certainly, of reverting to the scheme as it was prior to 1 April 1986.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall the great hoo-ha and hue and cry that his party made in this House when the previous Government varied the terms of the original scheme and that his party's then spokesman on Justice, Deputy Michael Woods, gave a firm commitment which is recorded in the Official Report during the debate on that amending legislation to restore the <i>status quo</i> on the question of providing compensation for victims.  Does he intend to stand by that commitment given by Deputy Woods on the occasion which is recorded in the Official Report?  Will Fianna Fáil stand by it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I recall the comments made at the time the scheme was revised.  Equally I recall the support given to the scheme by Deputy Taylor as a loyal backbench supporter of the Government of the day who revised the scheme.</P>

Would the Minister agree that that is a scandal in circumstances in which society compensates personal injuries victims of road traffic accidents involving uninsured vehicles out of the fund especially created for that purpose?  Will the Minister agree that this is a scandal when gardaí in the course of their duty are compensated for pain and <Col N="2618" /> suffering but ordinary individuals who through no fault of their own are set upon by criminals receive nothing unless they can show that they have lost wages or incurred medical expenses?  Is the Minister really willing to stand over that and say that budgetary restraints require that that should carry on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="2620" /> for Justice his views on whether the current upper level of Land Registry fees is adequate in the case of very substantial transactions and excessive in the case of straightforward transactions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to fees for transactions other than applications under the ground rents purchase scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Land Registry is required by law to be self-supporting.  In deciding on the level of fees required to provide for this, regard is had to the work involved in each particular category of transaction and also to the number of transactions in each category.</P>
      <P>There are 18 different categories of fees, 17 of which are fixed rates, ranging from 30p to £30, relating to specific transactions. One fee depends on the value of the transaction and can range from £50 to £200, which is the maximum fee payable in any one transaction.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the current level of fees is generally satisfactory in achieving as reasonable a relationship as possible with the work involved in each category of case as well as conformity with the statutory need to be self-sufficient.  I should add that the current fees are substantially lower in real terms than they were 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>Reviews of the fees are conducted monthly.  Should the Deputy have in mind the appropriateness of the fee for any specific type of transaction, I am prepared to have it examined in the context of that on-going review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that dealings involving millions of pounds, which may involve a transfer of land for building purposes and which could take up the time of a senior examiner of titles for more than one year, if not over a year to complete, should not cost the same as a simple deal involving registration of a house that may cost, say £35,000?  Surely this is unfair.  Would the Minister not agree that the charges should relate to the extent of the dealing <Col N="2621" /> involved and, within reason, to the amount of time spent by a senior examiner of titles dealing with the transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The current fees order came into operation on 1 March 1984.  As the House knows, the relevant section of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, requires that the Land Registry be self-supporting. The fees have not been increased since 1984 because the Land Registry is self-sufficient under the present scale of fees.  All the fees are flat fees, ranging between 30p for inspections and searches to £30 for section 49 applications, voluntary transfers and transmissions on death, except in respect of transfers on sale and burdens where a scale of fees operates within a range of £50 to £200, based on the value of transaction. The maximum fee of £200 is reached at values of £30,001 and upwards.</P>
      <P>The most complex transactions are first registrations in respect of which the fee is £25 and section 49 applications where it is £30.  I understand there is a case for charging higher fees for these, transactions but, as yet, that higher fee has not been considered.  The Land Registry operates at present under the Registration of Title Act which came into operation in 1967.  The maximum fee in 1967 was £60.  On the basis of the movement of prices between 1967 and 1987 the corresponding maximum fee would now be £506 whereas it is £200 only.  A copy folio with map attached can now be obtained for £6 whereas, in 1967, that would have cost £3 which, at present price levels would amount to £25.32.  A land certificate which today costs £10, in terms of 1967 prices, would cost £16.88.  Therefore the Deputy will see that the comparisons are more than favourable for the work involved since the scheme came into operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who request political asylum at Shannon Airport are interviewed initially by immigration officers.  Their cases are <Col N="2623" /> considered by my Department by reference to the United Nations 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.  We do not insist on a formal request for asylum, as such, but regard any reasonably indicative form of wording or behaviour as an application.</P>
    <P>The representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Department of Foreign Affairs are consulted where necessary, and any necessary inquiries are carried out.  Each case is referred to me personally for final decision.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not kept in such a way as would enable me to state the number of persons who asked for asylum at Shannon Airport for the years prior to 1986.  I can say, however, that the total of 177 persons applied for refugee status in Ireland since 1981, and that 130 of them were granted refugee status.  These figures include 90 Indo-China boat people who came here in small groups during that time and 26 Ba-hai's who were accepted as refugees by the Government in 1985.</P>

In some cases it has been alleged that because of language barriers people's cases have not been properly processed and that, for some other peculiar reasons which I do not quite understand &mdash; they could be quite mercenary &mdash; people who have come from countries where they have been oppressed have been sent back to those countries.

      <P>In reply to Deputy Deasy's supplementary question, there are two United Nations documents dealing with requests for political asylum, the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has a supervisory role in relation to the Convention and the Protocol. We have an agreement with the representatives of the High Commissioner accredited to London and Dublin as to the procedure for dealing with requests for asylum.  Apart from the procedures outlined in the agreement with the UNHCR, two other procedures are followed: consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and, where the applicant wishes to go to a third country, consultation with the relevant embassy.  In interpreting the international instruments concerned, we have at our disposal a body of advice as already given by the UNHCR and a handbook on procedures published by them.  The Convention and the Protocol define a refugee as a person who and I quote: &ldquo;owing to well-founded fears of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country&rdquo;.  Many applicants are found not to qualify because there is no danger of their being persecuted on one of the grounds listed.  Many of the applicants are economic migrants seeking entry to a more prosperous country.  They seek refugee status as their best ploy since in many countries determination of the issue takes a long time.  As stated in the answer given earlier to Deputy Deasy, refugee status was granted to a total of 130 out of 177 people who applied in the period 1981 to date.  These figures include a total of 90 Indo-China boat people or Vietnamese and 26 Iranian Ba-hai's These groups were accepted by the Government and can be distinguished from individual or casual applications. The figures for Shannon for 1986 <Col N="2626" /> show that five applicants were allowed to stay here even though they did not qualify for refugee status under the 1951 Convention and the decision to allow them to stay was taken on humanitarian grounds, apart from those of the Convention.</P>

      <P>I might best answer the Deputy's questions by saying that in 1986 no applicant was granted refugee status, the number allowed to stay in Ireland was five and the number allowed to stay pending admission to a third country was one.  In 1987 one applicant was successful in seeking refugee status.  The number allowed to stay in Ireland pending a final decision was three and the number allowed to stay pending admission to a third country was four.  The number returned in 1986 was four and the number returned in 1987 was one but I cannot say where those people came from or their nationality.  I will come back to the Deputy on that.</P>

If one takes out the two block groups, consisting of 90 boat people and the 26 from some other countries &mdash; a total of 116 &mdash; the indication is that of the 61 others only 14 were granted political asylum here.

      <P>I am keeping the matter under review. I would like to emphasise, however, that emergency cases, for example cases of violence directed at a spouse or children or child abduction cases, where immediate recourse to a court is necessary are being taken on straight away at all the board's centres.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the three major law centres in Dublin, the Ormond Quay centre, the Gardiner Street centre and the Aston Quay centre, are currently not taking on any new clients?  As the majority of work done by those centres is in the area of family law and as the majority of people represented by them are wives, there is no real free legal service available for dependent wives and battered wives who require legal assistance.  Will the Minister acknowledge that there is now a crisis in the operation of these law centres?  Will he indicate the steps he intends to take as a matter of urgency to enable those law centres to provide the service they <Col N="2630" /> were providing up to February of this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the present position in regard to the restrictions on services in the 12 full time law centres.  Six of the centres are open to new ordinary cases, that is, non-urgent cases as well as urgent cases.  I am referring to Tallaght, Tralee, Cork North Mall, Limerick, Waterford and Athlone.  Five other centres, Gardiner Street, Ormond Quay, Aston House, Galway and Sligo, may be in a position to reopen in about two to four weeks time.  There are difficulties in Dublin and I understand that the three Dublin centres have been closed since February or March this year for ordinary cases but, I must stress, open for emergency cases of the type identified in my reply.  Only a centre in Cork is closed indefinitely but I am seeing how best I might be able to rearrange our resources to try to ease the pressure.  I must stress that all centres remain open to take on emergency cases, cases which in the opinion of the board involve immediate recourse to a court.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the centre in Tallaght, which was recently opened, has attempted to take the overflow from the Dublin centres and that it is now on the verge of closing?  Is the Minister aware that the centre in Limerick is on the verge of closing as is the remaining centre in Cork?  If the Minister does not take emergency action to provide additional legal staff in those centres by the end of July it is likely that there will be no more than two Government law centres open to provide legal assistance for people who cannot afford to pay legal fees.</P>

      <P>I have already outlined in some detail the wide variety of educational programmes and facilities available in the various prisons and the number of teachers involved in prison education in replies to recent parliamentary questions on 27 May 1987 and on 9 June 1987.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the VECs and other education authorities, constantly seek to adapt the content and methods of prison education to the particular needs of prisoners.  Efforts continue to be made to improve the quality of this specialised work by sponsoring prison teachers to follow external courses that are relevant to prison teaching and by organising special internal courses.</P>
      <P>The allocation to educational services in my Department's Estimates for 1987, which covers fees, equipment and materials for education and libraries in prisons, has been increased to £235,000 compared to 1986 expenditure of £176,000.  The salaries of most of the teachers employed in the prisons are paid by the relevant VECs.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice are responsible for the provision of all services other than the staffing of these facilities.  Therefore, would it not be worth while if the Department took over the staffing in order to provide a complete service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if that would be a wise thing to do, because the type of teacher varies to a great degree, depending on the institution, on the offenders and the courses they want to follow.  From experience it has become clear that the VECs are in the best position to provide the range of teaching skills needed to give a very comprehensive type of education to offenders.  If we were to have a section of the Department of Justice picking and choosing teachers we could not give as good a service as we are getting now.  That is my personal view but I am prepared to look into the Deputy's suggestion and see if it has any merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there much point in providing facilities if the staff are not there?  If you find different situations varying from VEC to VEC because of the allocation of funds to each VEC, one VEC might think it necessary, because of the allocation of funds to them not to provide the necessary staff.  What we should be doing in relation to education in prisons is trying to have the staff to give the education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think in looking at the prison system that the area in which we would have the greatest difficulty would be County Cavan where Loughan House is situated.  I was there last weekend.  There are nine or ten teachers there provided by the VEC and there is an extremely wide range of subjects available to the offenders.  I was <Col N="2634" /> very impressed by the way the County Cavan VEC have been helping and I am grateful to them for doing so.

It costs approximately £500 per week to maintain an offender in Mountjoy or Arbour Hill whereas if we maintained somebody on a works order it would cost only £28.50 a week.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what preliminary examination the Deputy is referring to but, if the question refers to the position of persons who completed application forms at local Garda stations this year, the situation is that all applications made to the Garda authorities have been transmitted to the Civil Service Commissioners who will be in touch with each applicant when the next competition is announced.

I am a <Col N="2641" /> little surprised to hear from the Minister's reply that there appears to be no evidence indicating a problem in that area because the local association held numerous meetings at which this issue was highlighted. Will the Minister consider what has been happening over the past few weeks?  The U2 concert will be held in Croke Park in a fortnight and almost everyone within a radius of a mile or two of that park is stocking up with three to four months supply so that they can meet the needs of the young people attending this concert.  Has the Minister come to any conclusion, about introducing identity cards for young people, because there is alcohol abuse.

During the same period there were the following number of prosecutions for drunkenness of persons under the age of 17 &mdash; ten in 1983, eight in 1984, 14 in 1985 and six in 1986.  With regard to the stocking up of booze for sale to young people who will be going to this concert in Croke Park, I will bring this matter specifically to the attention of the Garda Síochána.  As regards the other matters raised by the Deputy, it would be more appropriate if we were to discuss them when we are dealing with the intoxicating liquor laws which will be before us very soon.</P>

      <P>I understand that the question of the institution of family courts has not been considered in any great depth.

The initial advice to me is that the best which can be hoped for in these circumstances is a minimal provision to bring about more informality in family law procedures. The Law Reform Commission have yet to make any detailed proposals on family type court structures but their President recently indicated that they intend to take up this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>Appointments to the Bench are decided by the Government and there are no proposals to change that.</P>
      <P>Any system involving pre-selection or the creation of a panel from which appointments would be made, would require Government approval.

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that just as a committee select <Col N="2646" /> somebody suitable for the post of Director of Public Prosecutions a committee such as a judicial appointments committee is desirable?  Such a committee should consist of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General who would make recommendations to the Government of persons suitable for such appointment. They would also set down minimum qualifying standards other than those which consist of the number of years in practice.  Does the Minister agree that there is a need to appoint younger people to the Bench, including more women?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement regarding the circumstances surrounding the release of a person (details supplied) who had been charged with rape in the Dublin District Court in July 1986 and who has subsequently been convicted of murder and rape in the Central Criminal Court in London last week and in particular (i) the reason the book of evidence was not prepared in time for the hearing before the District Court, (ii) whether the full facts surrounding the release of this person were disclosed to the complainant and (iii) the reason a Garda investigation into the conduct of this case is only commencing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the afternoon of 30 May 1986 a complaint relating to an alleged rape was made to the Garda Síochána who immediately commenced an investigation.  Later that same evening the person referred to in the question was arrested.  Following contact between the Garda and an officer of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the person referred to was charged with rape before a Special Court held at Harcourt Terrace Garda Station.  He was remanded in custody to be brought before the Dublin District Court on 31 May 1986.</P>
      <P>The accused appeared before the Dublin District Court on 31 May 1986, on 12 June 1986 &mdash; when further charges including one of aggravated burglary were preferred against him &mdash; and again on 30 June 1986.  On each occasion he was remanded in custody with consent to bail, but the accused was unable to find a suitable surety.  On his 30 June 1986 appearance in court the accused was remanded, with his consent, to the District Court on 28 July 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the hearing on 28 July 1986 the <Col N="2649" /> court was informed that the book of evidence was not ready as the Garda investigation file had not been completed.  The solicitor for the accused asked to have the case against his client struck out, on the basis that his client had been two months in custody and the book of evidence was not yet available.  The District Justice struck out the charges and the accused went free.</P>
    <P>At that stage the Garda took steps to complete their investigation file with a view to having proceedings against the accused re-instituted.  The accused, however, left the jurisdiction.  He was arrested in London on 9 August 1986 and charged with very serious offences, including rape and murder; a plea of guilty to manslaughter and rape was accepted by the London Court and he has been sentenced to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the failure to produce the book of evidence within a reasonable time resulted in the striking out of the charges against the accused in this case. While I share the widespread public concern about this matter, I must stress that I, as Minister for Justice, have no function in relation to the preparation of books of evidence, or, indeed, in relation to any aspect of the investigation or prosecution of offences.  These matters are the responsibility of the Garda Síochána and the law officers.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which delay in completion of the Garda investigation file occurred and was responsible for the failure to produce the book of evidence are under investigation by the Garda authorities.  This investigation has been going on for some time.  Following an initial investigation which commenced in September 1986, a formal investigation under the Garda Discipline Regulations commenced in December 1986 and arising from that the Garda authorities have decided that a sworn inquiry is to be held into alleged specific breaches of discipline related to the investigation of this crime. This inquiry is due to commence, I am informed, in the middle of next month. The discipline regulations prescribe a formal set of procedures for matters of <Col N="2650" /> this kind and the conduct of these procedures is a matter for the Garda authorities. The commissioner is also considering the way in which all Garda officers who were concerned in this case discharged their responsibilities in relation to it.</P>
    <P>As regards the information supplied to the complainant in this case, the Garda authorities inform me that, in response to her inquiry, she was told by the Garda that the accused had been released by the courts here and was in custody outside the jurisdiction in relation to other charges. The complainant asked to be informed of the outcome of the court case which was then pending and information on this matter was given to her by the Garda on 8 June 1987.</P>
    <P>The information that I have on these matters has been acquired from reports which have been made to me by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Minister for his full reply although there are some aspects of my question with which he has not dealt adequately.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this is an appalling case and is far more serious than perhaps some of the cases we discussed recently in this House.  What steps did the Director of Public Prosecutions take to ensure that the book of evidence was prepared?  Secondly, was the forensic scientist involved in this case a State employee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, I do not think I have authority to speak on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this case &mdash; no Minister for Justice has.  In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the forensic scientist is an employee of the Department of Justice. May I also say to the Deputy that there are certain aspects of this case with which I, too, am not personally satisfied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the gardaí not re-arrest the said person?  Secondly, does the Minister agree that two months is <Col N="2651" /> more than adequate time in which to prepare the book of evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The first part of the Deputy's question is to ask why the gardaí were not able to effect rearrest. I gather that they were not able to because the person in question had absconded.  They could not find the person they wanted where they were looking for him.  What is the second part of the Deputy's question, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it only on 8 June of this year the the complainant was informed of the facts?  What aspects of this case is the Minister not happy with? As a final supplementary question, may I ask if the Minister agrees that this person, George Ireland, did not receive adequate treatment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious to everybody who it is.  It appears that this person did not receive adequate treatment when he was in custody in this country.  What efforts were made by the Garda authorities here to contact the authorities in Britain in relation to this person when he absconded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the person in question was given a sentence of ten years which expired on 17 April 1986.  During the course of his imprisonment this person was seen by a psychiatrist on 26 occasions, the last occasion being 20 March 1986.  I also understand that he was seen on a regular basis by a psychologist, welfare officers, chaplains and medical officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did keep them in longer than they were sent for, the Deputy would have something else to say.  Would the Deputy please wait for the reply?  His case was discussed extensively at liaison meetings which involved all disciplines &mdash; psychiatry, social work, chaplaincy, prison staff, etc.  He was regarded by all agencies as dangerous and was not considered suitable for any form of early release and he was not given any form of early release.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of his sentence he was allowed seven outings accompanied by either welfare or prison staff.  These outings commenced on 20 December 1985 and the last one took place on 8 April 1986.  On discharge, arrangements were made for the person in question to be set up as a fisherman in his own home town so that he would have income and occupation on his release.</P>
      <P>During the course of his imprisonment the offender was punished for misbehaviour on five occasions.  On each occasion the punishment imposed consisted of loss of recreation periods and warnings about future behaviour, as all the incidents were of a minor nature.  I should like the Deputy to understand that I am advised there is no cure for somebody with a personality disorder.  The only hope that can be expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P>In page 9, line 34, after &ldquo;duties&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or to interest on money borrowed on foot of contracts entered into prior to 31st March, 1987&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I made <Col N="2689" /> some preliminary remarks on the Minister's policy on interest rates.  I want now to refer to the precise implications of amendment No. 6.</P>
      <P>I object to this section and if I had been in a position to vote against the section yesterday I would have done so.  I put down this amendment first because there is an increase in income tax involved in the abolition of the 10 per cent mortgage interest relief.  In the budget we put before the people as part of our election campaign, we committed ourselves to having no tax relief of any sort and to balancing the national accounts by means of expenditure cuts.  The Minister's proposal increases income tax on anybody who has a mortgage.  In the case of young people who are recently married and who have full mortgages of £29,000 or £30,000, it increases the amount of income tax they pay by £20 or £25 a week.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I am opposed to it because it is the thin end of the wedge.  I have seen proposals along the line of this one coming from the Department of Finance previously.  Of course, all the relief will not be abolished in one fell swoop but once the precedent is established that the mortgage interest relief is vulnerable, I assure the House that next year the Minister will return with a proposal to bring the 90 per cent down to 60 per cent and the year after that it will be 30 per cent and before we know where we are mortgage interest relief will be abolished completely. There are other reliefs of a similar nature, for example, relief on insurance policies and on VHI insurance. The Minister's proposal is the thin end of the wedge introduced into this House in an incremental fashion.  He will proceed, if he is Minister, over the next few years to totally remove mortgage interest relief and proceed from there to remove other reliefs in income tax as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I object to this proposal because it is unfair and discriminatory in that at a time when the Minister expects interest rates to decline, no benefit will accrue to the mortgagee because what one gains from declining interest rates, one loses by having the mortgage interest relief reduced.  On a quick calculation I <Col N="2690" /> think interest rates on mortgages would have to fall by 1½ per cent before mortgage holders would break even and recover what they will lose by the reduction in the relief.  All the headlines in the world informing people that their mortgages are coming down and that there will be substantial reductions in their payments to banks and building societies cut no ice at all when on the other hand their income tax is going up as a result of the removal of this relief.</P>
    <P>We need to establish confidence in the building industry.  The building industry were full of hope last year because they thought that, after an election which the Minister's party were predicted to win, happy days would be here again and the building industry would be stimulated by massive expenditure of capital.  I understand a commitment was given by the Minister's party to spend a further £200 million and that VAT on building would be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Instead of that, there has been a massive cut in the capital programme for the building industry.  There has been no reduction in the VAT rate which applies to the building industry and a whole package of house grants, including the home improvement grants, have been abolished.</P>
    <P>This will be a further blow to the building industry, because the mortgage interest relief is a mechanism which allows people to trade up.  People on high gross incomes and on high marginal rates of tax find it in their intrests to trade up and this has stimulated the building industry in the past and will do so in future.  I am sure the Minister will say that 10 per cent is neither here nor there, but if one gets a mortgage of £30,000 or £40,000 on the basis of 100 per cent tax relief and then one finds it reduced, one does not know the Minister's intentions for the future, one would think again before one traded up.  This is a further nail in the coffin of the building industry.</P>
    <P>When we take this with section 33 where the Minister is imposing 10 per cent extra tax on the profits which banks make on the home loan sector of their <Col N="2691" /> business, it is a further heavy imposition on the building industry.  There will be no confidence in the House building industry as a result of this proposal.  I know the Minister needs the money and that he has his sums done on the basis of getting £10 million from this measure.  The amendment I am proposing will allow him to introduce this change and it will only apply to new mortgages and to borrowings and contracts entered into after 31 March 1987.  Anybody who borrowed money to buy a house on the basis of 100 per cent mortgage tax relief, prior to the Minister's announcement, should in all fairness be allowed the full benefit of that 100 per cent tax relief.</P>
    <P>That is a very unfair measure and another attack on the vulnerable sections.  It affects particularly PAYE people and none of the PAYE allowances is indexed.  There is no improvement in the tax position of PAYE workers.  Here, anybody on PAYE income tax who has a home loan will have to pay extra income tax.  Any benefit that might accrue from declining interest rates it totally cancelled by this measure.  I would prefer to be voting against the section, but as we did not get to it yesterday for reasons known to everybody, I took the opportunity to express my views on this amendment and on the next amendment which I will be moving when we complete discussion on this.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has rolled his remarks on this amendment into the next amendment as well so, with the permission of the Chair, I will respond in that manner.  This amendment just talks about money borrowed on foot of contracts entered into prior to 31 March.  I heard Deputy Noonan's remarks on this inside and outside the House over the past few weeks. I can only repeat what I have already said.  This concession will cost £160 million a year.  What is being done in this measure is that we are getting a clawback of £10 million of that.  Under amendment No. 6 the new regime would apply only to mortgages after 31 March and <Col N="2692" /> would virtually wipe out 90 per cent of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue, but it would be seven years if this amendment were passed before this would come into the regime as proposed in the Finance Bill.  In 1974 there were no limits at all on interest reliefs and the Deputy's party were in power when restrictions were imposed.  I felt obliged, in relation to nonhouse purchase borrowings in 1982, to restrict the concession allowed there. There is nothing new in that regard. Mortgage interest relief still stands at 90 per cent of what it was before.  The Deputies must accept that with the enormous cost of £160 million a year involved here and, bearing in mind that it was not possible to deal with the concessions we would all like in relation to the PAYE sector alone, because of the difficulties in public finances, it is a small amount and its effect has been virtually eliminated before this measure comes into effect. When the majority of people benefitting under this relief are paying tax at 47 per cent, there will be virtually no effect. They will have received this amount back in reduced payments because of the reduction in interest rates.  Within five months of the announcement of the budget changes they will have a gain. There is no difficulty in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to remarks he made <Col N="2693" /> in relation to a change we made because the banks involved in house mortgage had a certain concession at a 35 per cent rate of taxation as against 50 per cent. We changed that in this Finance Bill to 45 per cent.  At that time banner headlines appeared all over the country suggesting that this would add 4 per cent or 5 per cent for those who had house mortgages from the banks.  We are used to such frightening banner headlines in all respects whether in relation to health cutbacks, interest charges, or mortgage interest relief.  I prefer to deal with reality.</P>
    <P>What happened subsequent to these banner headlines about mortgages?  One bank increased the charge by three quarters of a per cent and since then bank interest rates have come down and, in so far as our philosophy in the overall budget is working, that trend will continue. While I accept the concern of Deputies and of mortgage holders at the way interest rates increased over the past 12 months, I recall that before Christmas Deputy Noonan as Minister for Industry and Commerce produced banner headlines to the effect that interest rates would drop by 5 per cent before we had our Christmas dinner over.  It took a lot of hard work and tough decisions by this Government to bring interest rates on their slow downward trend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to deal with reality.  I did not make a statement that interest rates would drop dramatically in the last three months, as did Deputy Noonan, knowing that it could not happen.  It took firm action and tough decisions to bring about what has happened so far.  Let us hope in the interests of this economy that that trend will continue because, all of that must happen before we can do anything about the biggest tragedy, the biggest cancer that exists in this economy.  That is the 246,000 unemployed and the tens of thousands who have emigrated in the last few years, <Col N="2694" /> and unfortunately many more will continue to emigrate.  Those are the facts. We cannot pick out bits and pieces of an overall programme and say we do not like that.  As I said in response to The Workers' Party this morning, we cannot have it all ways.  We cannot be against cutbacks and savings and increases in taxes and in the next breath say we should have further reliefs, further concessions, more expenditure.  We have borrowed to our limit.  We must face those facts.  It does not matter who is in the office of the Minister for Finance or any other Government office, that will have to be faced in the foreseeable future.  The quicker we can make the control that is now exercised work, the shorter the term will be before we can give some of the reliefs and concessions that we all as public representatives would like to give.</P>
      <P>I can deal only with realities.  If amendment No. 6 were accepted it would create an undesirable situation if at some time in the future interest relief was to be increased.  In those circumstances would the increase apply only to new mortgages? That is the ball game we are getting into.  While I accept the intention behind the Deputy's remarks, the changes that have been made in this area have come in for a great deal of criticism from many Deputies from all parties.  Bearing in mind the restrictions imposed in other years since 1974 I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister replying to Deputy Noonan spoke about the difficult financial position which the economy finds itself in.  It was interesting to hear him describe the economy as having some financial difficulties which he through his policies intends to rectify.  One of the aims is to bring down interest rates. Deputy Noonan in the amendment he has proposed is seeking equity for those people who have already made contracts. The Minister said he had sympathy in that regard but I do not think he had any desire to see relief given to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assertion that interest increases or decreases give rise to a certain hype in the media did not originate from this <Col N="2695" /> party.  The destabilisers last September and October certainly were not in our party &mdash; though we had one maverick.</P>

He is winning quite a few friends because of his forcefulness but the destabilisers are in the House.  A Deputy not too far from me here was kicking up a row every day about democracy, the state of the economy and unemployment but that Deputy herself last September and October created panic in financial circles by forecasting huge deficits and huge overruns. I do not know what are the Minister's forecasts.  I do not know whether he is going to have the huge overruns.  In the silly season he will have a bite at that cherry.</P>

      <P>The Minister has pointed out that he believes there are financial difficulties in this country.  Some people &mdash; I am not one of them &mdash; think that the conversion of Fianna Fáil to financial rectitude is something like the conversion of Saul on the road to Damascus. However, I believe the Minister when he tells me that he is going to stick to this. Because of his confidence in the success of what he is proposing and his attitude he should have a certain compassion on those people who committed themselves to these contracts at high interest rates. It is in the interests of all of us surely that extra pressure does not build up for wage increases.  Wage claims will follow the Minister's insistence on taking this 10 per cent slice off the relief on mortgage interest.  At the risk of being repetitive, let me say the Minister should consider his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister cannot reply, but his restriction on mortgage interest relief in this budget is extremely unfortunate in a number of respects.  If he had decided to reduce the ceiling on mortgage interest relief by 90 per cent &mdash; it is £2,000 or £4,000 depending on whether the mortagee is a single person <Col N="2697" /> or a married couple &mdash; one could see an element of progression in it.  Some people are being subsidised <i>vis-à-vis</i> their tax for very large houses.  This reduction to 90 per cent of the £2,000, £4,000 or whatever relief is claimable, will hit very hard those low income families who are on an SDA mortgage from a local authority and who entered into that mortgage in good faith, sealed a contract anytime in the last 20 years and now will have to pay more tax in respect of their mortgage.</P>
      <P>Secondly, having embarked on this road, it is possible that in the future it will move to 80 per cent, 70 per cent and be eroded further.  Of course, the net effect of all of this is that there is no real saving to the Exchequer &mdash; because more people will go on to local authority housing lists to be rehoused.  Furthermore, the £12 million the Minister will have saved this year will jam up real problems in the future, of social misery, of people having to live in caravans, living with their in-laws or in expensive private rented accommodation.  All of those problems are being stored up for a future administration. For the first time the previous Government had got housing policy in order.  Now it is heading into disarray again.</P>
      <P>When speaking on amendment No. 7 would the Minister give a commitment that he will not erode the mortgage interest relief further next year.  Will he confirm that this is not the thin end of the wedge but rather a once-off measure he is taking this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make a few things clear in relation to mortgage <Col N="2698" /> interest relief.  There is an argument &mdash; put in the Minister's terms &mdash; that it costs the State a lot of money to provide mortgage interest relief.  He quantifies the cost, as he puts it, to the State of mortgage interest relief.  Viewed from his position &mdash; and I do not blame him for this &mdash; it does appear to be a cost.  In fact it does not constitute a cost at all.  What the State has said consistently to people over many years is that payments of mortgage interest are discounted in tax computations. They have never seen it as a cost to the State.  They have entered into long term obligations on the basis of an implicit understanding from the State that those obligations will be treated by the State in a particular manner.  Those people pay out every halfpenny of the mortgage interest.  What they are told is that if they pay that money to a building society or lending institution a proportion of it will not be calculated as part of their income tax liability by the State.  It is putting the cart before the horse to describe it as a cost to the State.  From the individual mortgage holders' point of view the interest is actually paid out. What the mortgage holder is told is that if he does pay part of his income to a lending institution in these circumstances he will be treated in a certain way taxwise. He does not regard himself as getting a benefit from the State.  He regards himself as undertaking a long term commitment with a long term collateral guarantee from the State.</P>
      <P>That is why I find this measure adopted by the Minister on this occasion undesirable. This may be a one off step in terms of a 10 per cent reduction in the amount of mortgage interest relief one might receive in this financial year but it is put in such terms &mdash; as Deputies Noonan, Yates and Carey pointed out &mdash; as to invite speculation as to what that figure will be next year, the year after that and the year after that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who take out mortgages on houses are entering into a long term commitment. For the vast majority of people it is the biggest commitment of their whole lives.  They are entitled to have a degree of certainty of continuity from the <Col N="2699" /> State as to how they will be treated.  My worry &mdash; I think it is one shared by everybody in this House, including backbenchers on the Minister's side of the House &mdash; is that when one introduces an element of uncertainty into long term arrangements of this kind the net effect is that there will be less of an uptake on mortgages because there will be a question mark in people's minds as to whether they will be able to undertake the kinds of obligations involved and sustain them, especially in circumstances in which employment, wages, and so on are so subject to fluctuations and dangers as in the case now in an economic crisis.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Minister's attitude to mortgage interest relief.  I appreciate that the Minister can well say that, in a time when there are 250,000 people unemployed, those who have houses, those who benefit to this extent, have a moral obligation to shoulder their portion of the burden.  I appreciate all of that.  But I must re-echo the sentiments of Deputies Noonan, Yates and Carey, that there are different ways of achieving this.  There are more progressive ways to achieve this, which involve differentiating between those who can afford this diminution in their income tax relief from those who cannot.  A simple proportionate reduction of 10 per cent, as Deputy Yates said, hits the poorest, the people who have gone out furthest on the limb to try and provide a family home.  It will hit the people who have extended themselves as far as they possibly can on the implicit understanding that the State would not cut the limb from under them or shake them off the tree.  Those people who have taken the greatest risks, who have most to lose, who have least to sustain them are those who find themselves being treated proportionately in exactly the same way as the best off in society.  I regard that as unsatisfactory. Had the Minister wanted to attack mortgage interest relief, had he wanted to create this uncertainty about it, he could have done it in a fairer manner.  This way is slightly unfair and arbitrary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey, with some considerable <Col N="2700" /> rhetorical skill, made reference to Deputy Harney's statements last year in relation to the likely out-turn on the budget deficit.  The one thing I would ask the Minister to confirm at this stage is this, that in 1986 this House voted approximately £34 million for certain grants for improvements to dwellings. Without any authority from this House, in a manner which was totally unconstitutional, Ministers of the then Government not only trebled that obligation but created hundreds of millions of pounds worth of obligations for their successors to inherit in the most scandalous way.</P>

      <P>The Minister and other Members on the far side of the House will agree that this is a worthwhile amendment.  Anybody who takes the initiative of buying their own home will appreciate the immense importance of being assured of all possible incentives. There are many fees to be paid by any young couple buying a house.  There will be architects', auctioneers', solicitors' fees and so on, every one of whom pay VAT on those fees.  There is VAT paid on the materials used in the building of the house.  Then there is the further imposition of stamp duty on mortgages, memorials and so on, all amounting to a very considerable expenditure on people who had been assured that, at least, they would receive mortgage interest relief. For people on fixed incomes living on very tight budgets who find their resources are very small, this type of allowance is to be encouraged.  I am disappointed with the Minister's proposal to reduce this relief by 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister &mdash; I know he cannot reply on this amendment &mdash; to give an assurance to the House and to the people that there will be no further reductions in mortgage interest relief at any future date.  It is now at 90 per cent.  Throughout the length and breadth of the country thousands of young people are put to the pin of their collar to pay back their mortgage repayments each month.  To some people the income tax relief which they were allowed might be small but not to many people, young and old or where husbands are out of work and the Minister should give an assurance that he will not tamper further with mortgage interest relief and that he will retain it at 90 per cent.  People are disappointed with the reduction of 10 per cent but the foot is in the door and many people are afraid the Minister will put the leg in as well. This matter is of immense importance to many people.  It is a tremendous thing <Col N="2702" /> for people to buy or to build their own homes.</P>
    <P>Home improvement grants for many people led to bathrooms and bedrooms being built in houses and water supply being put in.  It meant a lot to many couples with large families.  As somebody who lives in rural Ireland, I was very happy to see so many people in my constituency and throughout the country who were at long last able to provide proper homes for themselves and their families because of the home improvement grants.  They were of tremendous benefit to the people and the housing stock was improved enormously.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Debating with members of the Progressive Democrats is a bit like dancing the Paul Jones, when the music stops you decide which policy you have your arms around. Last October the PDs were in favour of abolishing all mortgage interest relief on home loans and many other reliefs also. In their tax policy of October 1986 they proposed to abolish the whole lot.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am glad they are changing their minds now.  I do not need to take lectures on financial rectitude from the Minister.  He referred to a number of statements I made and I will deal with them very briefly.  In regard to section 33 and how it relates to this matter, provided the banks loaded the effect of what the Minister proposes in this section on to new home loans the figure would be over 3 per cent.  If they spread it across their portfolio of loans it would be over 2 per cent but they will not do that.  They will spread the amount over their whole area of activity.  In this morning's paper there is a table from Allied Irish Banks which shows that there are reductions in every category of lending except in home loans where there is no change, the rate will stay at 12 per cent.  We are not getting the full benefits of the reductions we should be getting in the investment sector because the banks <Col N="2703" /> are spreading the loss across the sector. The Minister is going diametrically against his own stated policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister made many tax concessions in this Bill.  There is one in relation to the food industry and I do not know whether it is related to today's announcement but it seems very like sweetheart legislation.  I cannot understand why somebody would get a grant of £20 million or £25 million and on top of that get tax credit for that grant.  It is reasonable to give tax credits to encourage people to invest but to give a tax credit for investment plus the amount put in by the State is another matter.  The private investor gets the tax credit.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The financial services industry, the trading houses and so on are all included for concessions and we are all supposed to agree with those concessions.  The burden falls to the PAYE sector all the time. When the Minister was making up his figures he was £10 million short so he decided to take 10 per cent off mortgage interest relief and that amounts to £10 million.  I can see the thinking behind that because we have gone through it so many times.  The Minister came to the point where he could not get agreement for the cuts that he wanted to bring the deficit to 6.9 per cent and so he went for the soft option and the softest possible target, the PAYE sector, and hit them again by removing 10 per cent of the mortgage interest relief.  That is the thin end of the wedge.  That relief is on the sliding slope and it will eventually disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2704" /> We know what happened with interest on loans previously.  In the 1982 budget the Minister abolished relief on interest on borrowings other than for houses.  Five years later the same Minister is now reducing the mortgage interest relief on house loans.  If you borrowed previously to buy a car, to send your children to college or because you were in hospital you could claim tax relief against that interest but the Minister abolished that and now he is back with the same philosophy and this time it is the mortgage interest relief that is being reduced.</P>
    <P>If the Minister came into the House and advocated massive tax reform, a change in the tax bands and a reduction of rates &mdash; as the Commission on Tax Reform said, we have to do something about all the reliefs if we are to have lower rates &mdash; we could debate it but we might not agree with it.  We would say there was a reasonable approach to tax reform.  The Minister is ensuring that neither himself nor his successors will have any scope for tax reform because he is systematically taking away the reliefs that exist and clawing them into the maw of the Exchequer.  We will be left with reliefs gone and rates high and only the PAYE payers paying tax.  I am very disappointed with this.  I am going to press the amendment to a vote because if I leave it any longer I may not be able to get a vote on this issue.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the withholding tax.  I want to exclude from this provision anybody who has his tax affairs in order.  I understand it is the intention of the Minister to put certain professions on a current basis in the paying of income tax and this, in association with the new section I have drafted modelled on the treatment of certain sectors in the building industry, allows the Revenue Commissioners to issue certificates of authorisation exempting people who are fully up-to-date in their tax affairs from the withholding tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept this amendment.  He has made certain changes already but if his intent is to put certain professionals on a current basis for the payment of their tax he can make this exclusion quite easily.  The exclusion is for people who are fully paid up.  If his intent is something else he should inform the House what it is.</P>

I ask the Minister at some stage in the future to think of bringing in an amendment along these lines.  One or other of the amendments in Deputy Noonan's name or in mine contains a reasonable method of ensuring that the most unjust aspect of this tax will be mitigated, not as a matter of discretion but of right, in the case of certian taxpayers. It means that those who are conscientious in keeping up with their tax obligations will be dealt with on the same basis as other sectors and will not be penalised by having a withholding tax on their turnover, as well, possibly, as being taxed under PAYE on their remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had a very useful and wide ranging discussion on the provision of manpower services during the Second Stage of the National Employment and Training Authority Bill last November.  Deputies will recall that there was general support for the basic principles of the Bill.  A number of Deputies, including myself, however, expressed concern over the inclusion of CERT.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister for Labour in March, one of my priorities was to examine the Bill in the light of the comments made during the Second Stage debate.  I also had discussions with the boards and chief executives of the manpower agencies.</P>
      <P>Following this examination I have decided, as I announced in my Estimates speech, to omit CERT from the new body.  This decision takes account of the Government identification of the tourism sector as an area with great growth potential. It would be unwise at this juncture to change the status of CERT at a time when we are relying on the continued success of their efforts.  CERT will, therefore, retain their present status as a limited company accountable to, and reporting to, the Minister for Labour. The omission of CERT is the major change from the 1986 Bill.  Parallel with this move I have initiated consultations with a view to securing a substantial increase in the financial contribution of the industry to CERT and I have set a target figure of up to £0.5 million for 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major provision in the Bill before the House is to establish An Foras Áiseanna Saothair through the amalgamation of AnCO, the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency. These three bodies have served the country well and have contributed to the expansion of jobs and the reduction of unemployment.  In 1987, AnCO will train about 35,000 persons; the National Manpower Service will place 27,750 on <Col N="2714" /> employment schemes: and the Youth Employment Agency will assist about 5,000 persons in addition to its research and co-ordinating role.  The proposal to merge the bodies is prompted by the need to provide the best service possible for the public and to avoid the confusion and role duplication that has existed in recent years.</P>
    <P>The main functions of An Foras are set out in section 4 of the Bill.  These are essentially the same as those in the original draft.  They include the operation of training, re-training, work experience and similar manpower programmes, the provision of placement and guidance services and support for co-operative and community-based enterprises.</P>
    <P>The board of An Foras will consist of 17 members, including the Chairman.  In deciding on the composition of the board, the conflicting objectives of having bodies which are active in the labour market represented on it had to be reconciled with effectiveness and efficiency.  The achievement of this latter objective has, of necessity, meant a level of representation for many interests below what they would consider desirable.  The board of An Foras will be appointed by the Minister for Labour.  The board will consist of four representatives nominated by the ICTU; four representatives nominated by employer organisations; one representative of educational interests; one representative of social welfare interests; one representative nominated by youth organisations; two representatives of the employees of An Foras; and one representative from each of the Departments of Finance and Labour.  In addition, the Minister will appoint the Chairman and one other representative. I have included a Department of Finance representative in order to better link the operations of An Foras with macroecomomic policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also empowers An Foras to undertake consultancy work overseas on a commercial basis in line with Government policy.  This is likely to be an important feature of the new body's activities in the years ahead, by enabling them to take commercial advantage of their <Col N="2715" /> considerable experience and technical expertise and to make better use of their resources to increase their income.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years AnCO, in particular, have identified commercial possibilities for the export of their training expertise.  AnCO's reputation as an effective and professional training organisation has borne fruit in a number of overseas contracts for consultancy work and training.  Most recently AnCO were successful in securing a major sub-contract, worth about £4 million, for a £20 million World Bank project to improve the organisation and standards of training in Indonesia.  Overseas contracts for training and employment schemes will be handled by a subsidiary company which will be set up under section 4 (6) and 4 (7) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, in section 25, for the abolition of the upper age limit of 25 years in the use of the youth employment levy.  Under the Bill the levy can be applied to any group or category, regardless of age, which happens to be particularly hard hit by unemployment.  This will give An Foras more scope and flexibility in responding to labour market developments and in catering for the needs of their client population.</P>
    <P>Changes in our manpower agencies will not of themselves solve the problems in the manpower area if the Minister and Department of Labour do not take on the enlarged role of formulating, co-ordinating and evaluating policy that was envisaged in the White Paper on Manpower Policy.  The NESC Report on Manpower Policy made a valid criticism of Irish legislation governing the activities of State bodies.  NESC urged that the legislation is very specific and detailed in relation to financial provisions, but completely ignores the question as to how the Minister or the Department might influence the activities of these bodies in the context of overall policy.</P>
    <P>I accept that we have been weak in positioning our manpower services within a broad general economic and social framework.  There is a relationship between our training programmes and <Col N="2716" /> what is done within the educational system.  There is a connection between the payment of unemployment compensation and assistance being given by the National Manpower Service to the unemployed.  Training activities make a major contribution to the development of industry.  The only logical way to achieve a proper relationship and interface between our manpower services and economic, social and educational services is for the policy function to rest clearly with the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, to strike a proper balance between, on the one hand, exercise of effective policy and financial control by the Minister and, on the other hand, allowing the management of An Foras to get on with the job.  The Bill, as originally drafted, contained some provisions which attempted to achieve this objective.  Following an examination of the Bill, I have, however, strengthened the powers of the Minister in section 12.  The changes which I have made help to clarify and best give effect to the policy role by requiring An Foras to seek the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance for their future plans.  This still leaves An Foras with a considerable degree of flexibility in conducting their day-to-day operations within the prevailing agreed policy framework.  Section 12 provides for this. An Foras will, of course, contribute to policy making by the Minister through the giving of advice based on their knowledge of the labour market and the operation of programmes.  Under section 17, the Minister may give a direction to An Foras to carry out, or not carry out, specified activities.</P>
    <P>The tasks facing An Foras Áiseanna Saothair are formidable and challenging. We have nearly a quarter of a million unemployed and our labour force is increasing despite migration.  One of the features of the steady rise in unemployment has been the growth in the numbers unemployed for more than a year.  In the period 1979 to 1986, the proportion of the unemployed accounted for by long-term unemployment increased by 13 percentage points from <Col N="2717" /> 32 per cent to 45 per cent.  This increase has been concentrated mainly on over 25s and older workers.  Older workers in many cases find it difficult to compete for available job vacancies with better educated and more adaptable young people coming into the labour market. Prolonged unemployment and lack of work experience lead to financial hardship, skill obsolescence, demotivation and personal demoralisation.</P>
    <P>Assistance for the long term unemployed and the unemployed generally is now being provided in a systematic way under the Jobsearch Programme.  The contribution of the manpower agencies to the programme is to interview 150,000 people currently on the live register; provide 40,000 manpower opportunities for them; and provide places for a further 12,000 persons on a four week Jobsearch training course specially devised and operated by AnCO.  Generally speaking we are on schedule to meet our targets. The programme could not have got off the ground as quickly as it did but for the whole-hearted commitment and support of the staff in the manpower agencies.</P>
    <P>Despite the increase in the numbers attending second and third level education and institutions, the numbers leaving school with little or no educational qualifications have been relatively constant over the past number of years at about 5,000 per annum.  There is a need to assist these people through special labour market and educational interventions.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to develop our workforce so as to increase the competitiveness which is essential to the future development of the Irish economy. This applies in the case of our managers, our professional and technological staff, first line supervisors and operatives. Our future development depends upon our people producing goods and services which we can sell in the world marketplace. The goods being demanded, the location of production units and the methods of production are changing at a rate that could not be envisaged 15 years ago when we entered the EC.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to develop our small businesses and enterprises.  The <Col N="2718" /> rapid increase in the numbers employed in the US has been attributed in no small way to start-ups in small amd medium sized enterprises.  Our initial efforts here through the Enterprise Scheme, Start Your Own Business Course and the Community Enterprise Programme have illustrated the scope that exists for expansion in this country.</P>
    <P>Another important function of An Foras will be the provision of pre-departure information and advice to persons contemplating employment abroad.  Up to now this function has been the responsibility of the National Manpower Service under their obligations imposed by the EC regulations governing the free movement of workers within the Community. The amalgamation of the three bodies will ensure that persons trying to decide whether to go abroad or remain at home will be fully briefed on all the training and other opportunities available to them here so that they can make an informed choice.  If, in the end, they elect to seek employment abroad, An Foras will provide them with the best information and advice at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I mention these examples of the work of An Foras to illustrate that there is no shortage of work for the foreseeable future in the manpower area.  The work will involve, to a large extent, face to face contacts between the personnel of An Foras and their clients.  Technology will help in providing a first class effective service but, in the final analysis, we are talking about a labour intensive service doing valuable work for the community and the economy and offering job satisfaction to their employees.</P>
    <P>The area of concentration in the work of An Foras will vary from time to time. For example, an observer looking at the work of AnCO and the National Manpower Service in 1970 could not have foreseen, first, the extent of the training and the employment schemes being mounted by these bodies today, and secondly, the relative shift in emphasis towards employment schemes.  Mobility and flexibility will, therefore, be required on the part of the staff of An Foras. The provisions in the Bill dealing with <Col N="2719" /> arrangements for the transfer of staff from the three bodies to the new Authority are unchanged from the original National Employment and Training Authority Bill.  It is my intention to safeguard the existing conditions of employment of all the people involved.</P>
    <P>I realise that any major restructuring of existing manpower agencies in order to provide an integrated service could give rise to some apprehension on the part of staff in the existing bodies as to what the future holds.  I am confident, however, that the work to be done will require An Foras to make full use of the staff resources at their disposal.  I would see An Foras dealing with any imbalances in staffing as between their different services by deploying staff as required to the areas most in need.  Given the magnitude of the tasks in prospect, I would not envisage any large scale dismantling of existing services but would see instead the adaptation of these over time to achieve a more regionally based integrated service. The prospect of continuing support from the European Social Fund should further help to underline the future for the development and maintenance of a wide range of programmes by An Foras, calling on the expertise, experience and adaptability of the staff of the existing services.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Bill last November, I expressed the view that the success of An Foras would depend on how well they catered for the needs of different regions and areas in the country.  It is no good organising well at the top if such developments fail to achieve tangible improvements at the point of delivery. The Government stated in their Programme for National Recovery their commitment to the development of the manpower services on a fully regionalised basis.  It is my intention that An Foras should move rapidly to the provision of services more effectively at local and regional level.  This will also involve the development of closer co-operation with the appropriate education and social welfare systems.  A greater degree of devolution of decision making to local level will <Col N="2720" /> lead to more flexibility and innovation which can only improve the services to the unemployed, school leavers, the deprived and the unqualified.  My policy on the regional and local delivery of services, decision making and co-operation with other relevant bodies will be conveyed to An Foras under the mechanism provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the title for the new body.  It is clear from what I have said that the new body are an economic development organisation with a major social orientation.  It will be operating in a dynamic situation and will need to respond quickly and flexibly.  I believe that the title which I have opted for An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, best describes the mission of the new body.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I have tried to save as much time as possible by reading my speech quickly. Earlier on I said I would require half an hour at the end of the debate to reply.  It is necessary for me to take that time.  I will limit myself to what is absolutely essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill.  The Minister and the Opposition parties would agree that it is less than ideal that we have only a limited amount of time in which to debate it.  This would be so even if we had not had divisions.  It is even more so given that the time we are scheduled is further reduced.</P>
      <P>When this subject came for debate in the past, and when there were Private Members' motions anticipating legislation of this nature, Members took advantage of the debate to hang on to their views on manpower policy generally. They expressed their views on what the priorities for the different agencies should be and what they saw as the priority target groups.  It would be appropriate that we should have a full discussion on manpower policy at this stage. After all, this legislation is part of the response to the White Paper that was published by the last Government which was the first serious local manpower policy in more than 20 years.  It would be appropriate that that White Paper should be the subject of a formal discussion during the autumn session.  I formally request the Minister that that time be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a sense of disappointment among some people that they have not got an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  While it is unsatisfactory that the debate should be truncated, not to have agreed to the taking of the Bill would have been irresponsible because the truth of the matter is that those who are employed in the four agencies involved &mdash; AnCO, the YEA, Manpower and, in a sense, CERT &mdash; have all found themselves in a state of considerable uncertainty as public debate has waged during the past few years about what should be the structure of our manpower agencies.  More particularly they found themselves in a state of uncertainty since the publication of the White Paper and of the National Employment and Training Authoity Bill by the last Government.  It is unreasonable that that uncertainty should be allowed to continue any longer than strictly necessary. In those circumstances if we have to <Col N="2722" /> choose between a debate that is unsatisfactorily truncated and what I think would be the irresponsible approach of allowing that unsatisfactory state to continue the only thing a responsible Opposition could do would be to agree to the taking of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The measure we are debating is very substantially the measure which was introduced by the previous Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, during the lifetime of the last Government.  It is fair to say that there are only two changes: one is a change in name from NETA to FAS and the other is the decision in relation to CERT.  I am not going to quarrel about the titles.  If I had to put my money on one or the other I prefer the title, NETA.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision in relation to CERT.  Members of the House have changed their minds on this on various occasions.  I recall the time when the Minister encouraged us in Government to merge them all together. Some of us at that stage pressed the case to retain CERT because of their identity and the links they have forged with the hotel and catering industry.  The Minister was successful in convincing us that he changed his mind in the process &mdash; and I am of the view also &mdash; that it is best that CERT are left apart.</P>
    <P>While the Bill must be welcomed, it can be given a two cheers welcome. The test of legislation of this nature is essentially two fold: can we say with confidence that the levy payer will get better value for his money or that those who seek a place on one of the training programmes are going to get a better service? At this stage the best one can say is that it is not proven that they will.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed that more advantage was not taken of the delays, as a result of the general election and the need to reintroduce the Bill, to spell out in greater detail how this is going to work. Essentially this is enabling legislation which leaves us all guessing.  There are hints in the White Paper as to what is anticipated in terms of how the agency will be divided but we are no clearer as to how this is going to work.  The Minister <Col N="2723" /> in his contribution today and in his contributions when he was in Opposition indicated that he saw this as most important in a regional context.  I very much agree with him in that.  There is no point in amalgamating chief executives and doing things around Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square if the results are not felt right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are no wiser now as to what the Minister's plans are to make the legislation effective throughout the country. I had hoped that the opportunity would have been taken to fill us in.  For example, by this stage decisions must have been taken as to what the internal organisation is going to be.  Is there, for example, a structural or organisational chart to indicate who is going to be responsible for what; what the point of delivery is going to be; what the chain of command is going to be and so on?  These are the things which will determine whether this works. At present we suspend judgment.  As a first principle one might say that if you replace three bodies with one you achieve a degree of co-ordination.  It might or it might not.  The danger of this is that you simply substitute one very large quango for three smaller ones.  If you do not get the internal structures right you can forfeit the individual expertise of the three and have them lose their identity in a less effective and souless megaquango. Each of the organisations whose life will be coming to an end have served us well during the years.  It is important that what they do best should be retained.  While AnCO have come in for criticism, not all of it misplaced, they have a positive philosophy and have accepted enormous challenges.  Sometimes their adventurous nature has led them into projects in which they should not have got involved, but that &ldquo;get up and go&rdquo; attitude which was central to AnCO should not be lost by the new body.</P>
    <P>From the beginning the Youth Employment Agency have been criticised. Some of those criticisms were on the basis that expectations had been raised which could probably never have been fulfilled.  There was the constant <Col N="2724" /> complaint that much of the levy funding was going on training programmes and it was suggested that this was not what was intended.  That criticism is unfair as a reading of the Youth Employment Agency legislation will indicate but notwithstanding the criticism, the agency carved a quite distinctive niche for themselves in the areas of local employment initiatives, in responding to co-operatives of small-scale activity and so on.  What the Youth Employment Agency did was worthwhile.  It would be unfortunate if that was to be set aside.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of this new agency will depend on leadership and on the morale of those who work there.  Will the Minister clarify his thinking on these areas?  What are the Minister's intentions on the question of leadership?  In Opposition the Minister floated the idea of a full-time Chairman.  Is that still the Minister's view?  There are three executives who will have to find a role for themselves in this new amalgamated FÁS.  What will be their role?  If we do not get the top management structures right at the beginning, there is every danger this will backfire and do more harm than good because the areas of expertise the individual bodies built up will be lost and the sense of drive and commitment will be lost in a much bigger organisation.  It is absolutely essential to get the management structures right.</P>
    <P>The second important aspect is the extent to which those who serve it can be motivated and their morale boosted and maintained.  There have been some difficulties of morale within some existing agencies for one reason or another.  Manpower, for instance, have seen their role change substantially since their inception. Originally, they saw their role as being to identify more or less comparable numbers of vacancies with more or less comparable numbers of applicants and to match them.  They found they were not in a position to offer employment prospects to many of the people coming to them and they increasingly became involved in the administration of schemes of one sort or another, the Teamwork schemes, the enterprise allowances <Col N="2725" /> schemes and so on.  That had an effect on morale.  The Youth Employment Agency suffered from the beginning because they never had clarity of role.  People saw them doing things they never saw as being their function.  The Youth Employment Agency constantly had to be careful that they did not step on others' toes.  In the case of AnCO, there has been a substantial change of direction.  From an organisation who were to provide skills that were in short supply at a time of economic growth, they found themselves in the area of social training, community workshops, travellers' workshops, work in relation to the social guarantee and so on.  AnCO had to move away from what should have been their primary objective which was to provide a highly skilled workforce to take advantage of opportunities and to contribute to the creation of opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is important that the way in which this agency is launched is such that those who work in it and for it will be determined to give of their best.  There is no doubt that for some of the people who will find themselves moving over to FAS it is a potentially traumatic business.  For those who decided as school leavers that their career was to be in the Civil Service to find that they are no longer to be civil servants is something that, understandably, causes alarm.  That alarm is heightened in an instance such as this where they know that the agency will be substantially dependent on funding from outside the State and that to that extent it will be less under the direct control of the Government or this House in terms of future intentions.  Understandably, those who find themselves about to be moved out will be anxious about their position.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of this Bill purports to address this concern and it probably goes a considerable distance towards meeting those concerns, but the anxiety remains. It is appropriate that the Minister should make himself available to meet with the staff interests involved.  I know that some meetings have already taken place.  It is appropriate that the Minister should bend over backwards to respond to legitimate concerns, but he should not negate <Col N="2726" /> the whole purpose of the Bill.  Part of the purpose of the Bill involves a transfer of functions from the Civil Service to the new body.</P>
    <P>At this stage it has not been proved that this will represent a better deal for the consumer, the would-be trainee, the would-be job-seeker, or for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his Department will avail of the opportunity provided by the delay in bringing it forward to indicate where the savings and efficiencies will be and the scale of those efficiencies.  One assumes there is an expectation that economies of scale will apply.  How many offices fewer will be required?  How many offices can now be surrendered and what will the savings on those be?  What is the expectation in relation to staff numbers?  Is there a belief that the one merged agency will be able to do the same job more efficiently with smaller numbers in the future?  If that is so, what is the scale of the savings there? What numbers are involved?  If that is not the expectation, if the assumption is that more or less the same number of people will be operating, what will they be doing, since presumably there will have been some duplication of staff?</P>
    <P>Another area of substance in the Bill is the decision that the youth employment levy will be no longer confined to those under 25 years of age.  This makes sense. The age limit was at any stage an arbitrary one.  As our population has aged and as the percentage of our unemployed in the age group 25 to 44 has risen the distinction between under and over 25 became less and less easy to define.  The Minister should guarantee that there will not be a diminution of the response to the problem of youth unemployment.  That problem is not reducing simply because there are more and more people aged 25 to 44 unemployed.  It just means that we have a problem in that area as well.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa's point is well made, and I will do that. My concern is that the problem of youth unemployment would be somehow reduced in priority and the special attention it has received would be wiped out. That would be a most unhappy position because the decision to identify the young unemployed as a special priority group was made for a good reason.  It recognised that in pursuing whatever job opportunities are available the young unemployed are disadvantaged simply by reason of their lack of experience.  The social consequences of failing to address that target are unthinkable.  Therefore, when the Minister replies this evening I hope he will be able to give assurances to that group.</P>
      <P>A side issue to that which is causing some anxiety is that if the youth interests on the board of the new agency are reduced in their representation on the YEA that may represent a sign of the times.  I hope the Minister can give some assurance on that.  If not we will be tabling amendments overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conscious of the time, I will make just <Col N="2728" /> one further comment on the position of CERT.  While I said I am happy that the Minister is to allow them to maintain their identity, the question arises as to how they will relate to the new Authority and what sort of structures will be put in place to ensure that the two work hand in hand.  It is important that this new agency should work closely with the world of education and there is some concern that, even in their formative status, they have not been going out of their way to make contact with the education world.  I know there is a limit to what they can do until this is put through the House, but a deal of work has been done in anticipation of the House's decision.  One would like to think there will be maximum contact with the education world so that the work that will be done by this agency can be co-ordinated with what is happening in the RTCs, the NIHE and the vocational sector in particular.</P>
    <P>In deference to Deputy De Rossa I will not go further.  The measure must be welcomed on the basis of a widespread view that we must move towards some merger of existing agencies, but really we have to suspend judgment to some extent until we see how it operates in practice. The Minister can give us some reassurance by indicating how he sees the agency operating on the ground in the regions and what structures he sees them taking to themselves once they get up and going.</P>

      <P>The PDs object very strongly to the truncating of this debate. I realise that it has been arranged between the Whips of the Government party and Fine Gael, and we take grave exception to it.  I remind Deputy Birmingham that the choice was not between taking a truncated version of the debate and no debate.  The Government and Fine Gael Whips agreed this on the basis that the House would not sit in July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats in their policy discussion papers for the first national conference last year proposed the amalgamation of the State training agencies into a single service. We felt that the existing agencies had outlived their original usefulness in their existing form.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my speech on the Estimates for this Department recently, I would welcome a move to amalgamate the various agencies as being a step in the right direction, but I believe that it must go much further.  With a net Exchequer cost of £57 million in 1986 the role and function of AnCO as one of the three proposed agencies being amalgamated should be urgently and radically reviewed.  Their role in the provision of apprenticeship courses is a much needed one.  However, these courses all need to be properly structured and to provide the trainees with recognised trades and crafts.  There is no point in having six months courses which are intended to look like apprenticeship courses, for example blocklaying, when any tradesman or craftsman will tell you that after six months apprenticeship normally the trainee is still at the stage of carrying the tools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same problems arise concerning the National Manpower Service.  I regret to say that this service is now in a position where neither employers nor employees have confidence in them.  They have not <Col N="2730" /> been successful in placing a significant number of people in employment, which they were initially intended to do on a widespread national basis.  They have now been transformed into an agency who promote and administer temporary employment schemes, together with AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  The latter agency have played a nebulous role, weaving in and out of the other agencies and schemes.  They are, after all, called the Youth Employment Agency.  Where is the emphasis on the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo; to be seen in their activities?  How could they be said to be different from the activities of the other agencies.  It can be seen, therefore, that all three agencies have overlapping responsibilities and, as a direct result, inefficient and unnecessary administrative expenditure.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Bill conveys the impression that the Government will deal with the problem of unemployment. What we have here is a Bill to shift adminmistrative responsibililty from three organisations to one.  In effect, however, it is merely leaving all three in place and adding a further layer of administration and bureaucracy.  There is no proposal to reduce the size or the cost of the staff or property of these bodies.  On the contrary, significant portions of this Bill are devoted to cast iron protections ensuring the transfer and preservation of all features of the existing bodies.  There is also provision for the expansion and development of the functions of the existing bodies under the new umbrella.</P>
    <P>We must first look at the fundamental philosophy underlying the area of industrial training and temporary employment schemes.  Surely it is essential that we have regard to job creation and educational policy in conjunction with training and employment schemes?  If there is not close co-operation between the bodies responsible in these different areas much public funds will be wasted and opportunities lost to effectively plan for the future.  There should be strong links between the IDA, the new FÁS and <Col N="2731" /> also with vocational education committees throughout the country.  It seems most unfortunate that we are experiencing at present a change in emphasis in vocational education, which should surely be seen to work in tandem with the training authorities.  The news that the second level curriculum review committee's work is to be held up is also a blow to co-ordinated planning in this area, so is the news of the cessation of the career guidance section of the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>We have been hoping for many years that the curriculum for second level education will reflect what is there in reality, differing aptitudes as between children who are, on the one hand, academically inclined, and on the other, inclined towards practical skills.  We have, however, reached the stage where even to register on many AnCO courses the level of formal education required is such that those who are orientated towards practical skills often find themselves excluded from these training courses. While as high a standard of education in a formal sense is to be desired we should be providing a realistic option for those who are not academically inclined, and not force them into the unemployed masses by our unrealistic attitude.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the whole thrust of this Bill and of the White Paper on Manpower Policy do not concern themselves with the realistic world of work and job creation.  After all, what can employment mean except that it refers to real jobs?  The problems we have experienced up to now with the various agencies are not being fundamentally attacked in this Bill.  They relate to a lack of co-ordination between the agencies themselves and, as I have mentioned, between them and the job creation agencies.  We must question whether the fact that the European Social Fund has presented us with an opportunity to use extra moneys that would not have been available to us otherwise has made us forget the real planning involved.  That fund and the youth employment levy provided the State with a great amount of resources <Col N="2732" /> which I would submit have been spent in a haphazard and <i>ad hoc</i> way.</P>
    <P>What we have lacked up to now is a proper and coherent review of the Manpower and training areas authorising a policy to be followed when spending these funds.  The whole notion of a special levy for youth employment or, as it is now to be known, the training and employment levy, is a complete misnomer. It is not only another tax on income.  It is a tax which takes no account of allowances of degrees of liability, being levied on gross income.</P>
    <P>We would abolish the levy and, in the process, dismantle the whole training and employment schemes edifice, replacing it with fully-thought-out and effective programmes for job creation and proper training.</P>
    <P>For instance, the whole issue of the numbers of unemployed in various areas of the country and the way in which we tackle these individually should be re-examined. There are undoubtedly crisis areas to which priority should be given in the allocation of funds from this new agency.  We know the east is the hardest hit in unemployment terms but we should also know from the figures supplied by the Central Statistics Office every month that there are real black spots represented in those figures, such as Dublin itself with 72,000 plus people unemployed and areas like Dundalk which has an unemployment rate approaching 32 per cent.  Surely there is a real need to concentrate on these priority areas and avoid dotting resources all around the country?  There should be a realistic attempt made to solve the problems in a particular area and then move on to an area of lesser priority.  It is in the nature of any of these agencies that are set up that they will wish to see themselves operating nationally and the impetus will be to spread throughout the country.  We must ask ourselves the question whether this is the most effective use of our available resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister when in Opposition spoke about the dual purposes of the former Bill as being that of amalgamating the administrative structures and of <Col N="2733" /> improving efficiency and effecting economies. This Bill will not have the effect of reducing administration or effecting economies.  Indeed there is built in it that the existing structures of the agencies are to be fully protected, adding one further administrative layer.  There is no evidence that the sense of amalgamation will spread throughout the three existing agencies.  There is no structure, as shown in this Bill, to effect an amalgamation right down the line.  It would appear to be occurring simply at the top level.  I notice that the Minister, when in Opposition, in November last referred to a lack of structure set out in the Bill and expressed himself as being very worried that the task of amalgamation would not be effected.  I would echo those worries and put them to the Minister now when he is in a position to do something about them.</P>
    <P>The co-operation that has taken place between the agencies heretofore has been on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and depended greatly on the particular personnel on the ground.  It is absolutely essential that we simplify the whole procedure of registering either for employment or training schemes.  The red tape will have to be cut through.</P>
    <P>Young people are particularly cynical about transparent attempts to fob them off with unreal placements and jobs. They also become extremely frustrated when they have to register with a number of bodies, one after another, when they can see the waste and inefficiency involved in this process.  This Bill makes no provision for the reduction in the number of these applications and interviews. I am very disappointed at the Bill the Minister has introduced, particularly in the light of the speech he made on Second Stage of the last Bill and would ask him to address this matter when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the exclusion of CERT from this Bill, I have no strong opinion personally one way or another as to whether CERT should be included. I can understand the rationale behind allowing a body that has been successful at its work to continue to work as before. <Col N="2734" /> I would accept there is not the same case for the amalgamation of CERT as there is with the other three agencies.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another aspect of the Minister's contribution to the debate in November last.  It is on a subject with which I can agree with him.  He spoke of the enormous reduction in numbers entering apprenticeships and the lack of skilled tradespeople and crafts-people. I would agree with him that there are many half-baked apprentices around the country who have been on &ldquo;on-the-job training&rdquo; with AnCO but who were unable to finish their training in other employment.  There are also many thousands of building workers and others who would be in a position to take on apprentices who are, unfortunately, due to the recession in the building industry unemployed and have been for some time.</P>
    <P>Why could we not divert some of the resources available to FÁS under the auspices of the present AnCO Authority to taking some of these tradespeople off the unemployed lists and allocating groups of young people also from the unemployed lists to them for training?  It would have the advantage of making use of the skills and experience of many of these men and women.  It would also enable young people of 16 or 17 years to receive proper training for trades or crafts which would stand to them in the future.  Many of these young people will emigrate, but we should provide them with as much training as possible, before they leave, so that they can make something of their lives wherever they go.  By employing this mechanism we are also preparing a body of skilled workers who will be there ready and willing to take up work if the economy picks up in the next few years.</P>
    <P>If young people are left to rot on the dole queues for the first few years and more of their working lives, they may never find it possible to enter the working population.  All sorts of other social problems are being stored up by allowing this to happen.  Surely the net cost of providing such training for great numbers of our young people who would be interested in this would be quite small.  It is an example of the radical rethink that <Col N="2735" /> I feel must occur when we are faced with the choice of continuing present training schemes and investigating new approaches.  There are a few particular points which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention during Second Stage and ask him to reply to them.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 (1) (f), An Foras are given the power to facilitate and assist community groups and co-operatives in the provision of employment by establishing or enlarging enterprises of any kind.  I am concerned at the looseness of the drafting of this subsection and can foresee difficulties arising where the phrase of any kind is concerned.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate if the Bill indicated the kinds of enterprises which it foresees assisting, as a general indication, while not excluding others.</P>
    <P>Also under section 4 (1) (h), An Foras are to collect and publish data and information on services or activities, including statistics and forecasts in relation to their services or activities, and such other matters respecting their functions as the Minister may specify.  Surely it would be more efficient if the Central Statistics Office could take on as much of the gathering of statistics as is possible.  To duplicate the functions of both bodies seems unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 (5), I note that the Minister retains the power to remove the first director general from office.  I cannot understand why he should retain this power as An Foras will be in place at that stage and in the Bill they hold the power to remove any subsequent director general from office.  In fact I am not certain that the Minister should have the power to appoint the director general.  Should it not be that an independent commission would make this appointment and remove it completely from the political arena, whether or not that label is deserved?</P>
    <P>Lastly, I note that under section 12 (2) the Minister has control over the form in which the annual reports shall be presented.  Some balance has to be achieved in who should decide what is to be presented in an annual report.  However, <Col N="2736" /> I think it is not a healthy sign that the Minister alone has control over this and I ask the Minister for his thoughts on this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Progressive Democrats will oppose this Bill.  They feel it is not achieving the ends which we would wish it to achieve.  The amalgamation of the agencies under another banner is not enough.  We need a far more radical rethink on training, on employment schemes and on manpower and labour services generally and this is not the Bill to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I wish to express my reservations about the time given to this debate.  Nonetheless, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As has been mentioned already by Deputy Birmingham, this Bill reflects largely the thinking of Deputy Quinn.  It can be said that Deputy Birmingham, as Minister of State at the Department of Labour in the last Administration made an input to the Bill.  For this reason, I am sorry that the Bill has been retitled but that is only a small change.  To some degree the Bill has been changed in the area that refers to CERT.</P>
      <P>The National Employment and Training Authority Bill, 1986, followed rapidly on the publication of the White Paper on Manpower Policy which was published in September 1986.  This paper was the most detailed study of manpower policy in Ireland since 1965 and it provided a comprehensive look at the problems, the changes, the prospects and indeed the general profile of the features of the Irish workforce in the eighties.  In addition, it attempted to project the workforce needs into the nineties, providing a breakdown of the population in terms of age and skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Quinn addressed the features which were outlined in the White Paper and attempted to meet the changing needs of the workforce. The main purpose of the Bill was to integrate the main manpower agencies into one joint manpower agency, which Deputy Quinn felt would meet, in a realistic way, the growing problem of unemployment in Ireland.  Equally <Col N="2737" /> important, the new agency would make the most efficient and economic use of funding, both regional and local, which would be provided to the agency rather than dispersing it between a number of bodies.  Such dispersal had been found to cause duplication and, of course, waste. Waste in this economic climate is simply not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the Bill presented by Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Labour, lapsed with the fall of the last Government and so we have the Labour Services Bill before us this evening.  I must admit that I have no quarrel with the majority of sections in this Bill, because it reflects the work of the previous Administration, and I will vote for the Bill, but regrettably there are serious changes which this Administration have chosen to introduce and I must express my concern about them.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I must express disappointment that a large agency such as CERT, were able to exert muscle on the Minister and cause a big change in the original Bill.  The new Bill proposes to exclude this agency from the general integrated plan recommended in the White Paper on Manpower Policy and presented in the National Employment and Training Authority Bill, 1986.  This exclusion makes nonsense of an overall plan for manpower training and education because, so long as one manpower training agency remains outside, the resources must be duplicated, that is, the training centres, teachers, instructors, equipment and budgetary planning.</P>
    <P>On reading through the Second Stage debate on the National Employment and Training Authority Bill I note that the present Minister for Labour, the then spokesperson for the Opposition in this area, spoke about the successes of CERT which I agree with.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the staff concerned.  But, at the time Deputy Ahern spoke about these successes and the 100 per cent job placement success rate which he presented as an argument for leaving CERT as a limited company. This line of thought would seem to suggest that the other agencies, AnCO, the <Col N="2738" /> National Manpower Service, and the YEA, who are somewhat less successful, need to be integrated because of their lack of success, while CERT would be left to forge ahead.</P>
    <P>This is a line of thought which was also put forward by Deputy Colley and which I do not agree with.  I recognise the good job being done by CERT but it can be said that CERT recruited and tailormade the requirements to the needs of the tourist industry.  Therefore, unlike the other agencies which had to take on people who had in many cases very little chance of placement, CERT took on precisely the amount they thought would be absorbed into that industry.  It was very easy to come back with a 100 per cent performance.  We are not comparing like with like.  With all due respect to Deputy Colley, that was not a very fair analogy to make with the other agencies which had an extremely difficult task.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one important point about this view.  The entire philosophy behind the integration of the agencies was to eliminate some of the confusion in the minds of the public as to who does what.  At present manpower services are provided by four agencies. The existence of four bodies makes it more difficult to establish clear priorities between various programmes and place these activities within a comprehensive economic and social framework.  The increasing rate of change demands quick decisions and points to the need for a single body rather than a four pronged response.</P>
    <P>With integration the agencies will be in a better position to help one another, but more important, to help those who are most in need of their services and together present a number of lucrative choices to our young people and our unemployed.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to make and which I feel is very important is that all these agencies are funded largely by public finances.  They must be seen to be under the watchful eye of the Minister concerned and not dictating to the Minister.  They should be answerable and accountable to him in their use of <Col N="2739" /> funds, their performance and in their placement and education services.</P>
    <P>I again draw Deputies' attention to the White Paper on Manpower Policy with regard to funding for the various agencies. I have a number of figures but there is one about which I am concerned.  The tourist industry provided only £121,058 and it can be said they got real value for money whereas the same cannot be said for other industries and this created an imbalance.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's remarks in regard to the growth in the tourism sector as compared with the growth in other areas.  In recent times much emphasis has been put on the service industries as an area of potential growth.  It must be realised that there is a limit to this growth.  We must at all times bear in mind the magnitude of the unemployment problem and try to quantify how many people can be absorbed in the services sector.  In my view we are close to reaching the limit in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to the number of small industries in the United States but there is evidence that the bubble is about to burst there. We should not look too long in that direction. It is true that for many years the economy in the US was growing and jobs were being created but there is frightening evidence which I read in recent reports that there will be a serious problem in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to abolish the upper age limit.  Up to now we discriminated against people when they passed the age of 25 years.  The Minister should consider the plight of those who are 50-plus who are finding it extremely difficult to secure employment.  There is a need for greater cohesion between Government Departments to ensure that people do not lose out on pension rights when they are over a certain age.  There should be continuity in regard to pensions. The manpower agency and the Department of Social Welfare should introduce a scheme permitting people to transfer their pension rights from one job to another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2740" /> People fail to admit that the root cause of the unemployment problem is the system under which we operate.  I may be accused of making an ideological point but it is important to keep in mind that 250,000 people are unemployed.  Time and again the press bombard us with statements to the effect that the climate is not right for investment.  What is meant by that statement?  In my view it means that people are investing abroad to get 1 per cent or 2 per cent extra in interest. When we reach that stage the system becomes immoral.  It is wrong that people are prepared to export their capital to make a greater profit at the expense of increasing the numbers on the dole queue.  Until there is recognition of that there will not be any great change.  I accept that I represent a minority view here but if we do not recognise that fact now we will have to pay the price in years to come.  If people continue to send their money abroad to a more lucrative market to earn greater interest we will end up with trouble on our streets.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister referred to the fact that work was available in EC countries.  Are we trying to provide a safety valve through emigration? We see evidence daily near Leinster House of the number of people anxious to leave the country in the form of lengthy queues outside the Passport Office.  We must recognise that most of those people are preparing for lengthy though not leisurely stays abroad.  Once again we are treated to buzz words such as skill obsolescence, demotivation and personal demoralisation but they do not mean anything to me because I am concerned about the fact that more than 250,000 people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition in the Minister's speech that future development depends on producing more goods.  The emphasis must be on production and our manpower agencies should ensure, now that they have the services sector and the tourist industry separated from them, that there is greater production.  If we do not put greater emphasis on that we will find <Col N="2741" /> ourselves in serious trouble.  I will concede the remainder of my time to Deputy De Rossa.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to interfere with Deputy Mooney's maiden contribution and I thank her for giving me an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  For anybody to believe that any rationalisation or reorganisation of our training services is in any way significantly going to dent the unemployment figures <Col N="2742" /> is wrong and to oppose the Bill on that basis is a mistake.  While I have some criticisms of some of the provisions in the Bill generally speaking I welcome it.  I welcome the exclusion of CERT.  Deputy Mac Giolla on Second Stage of the original Bill made our position clear in regard to that.</P>
      <P>In my view the unemployment figures in real terms are closer to 400,000 than to the official figure of 230,000 because one must take into account those who are on different types of training schemes.  A number of matters concern me about the Bill.  The Youth Employment Agency are being absorbed into this new structure. The levy which pays for this new structure was sold by and large to the PAYE sector on the basis that it was a youth employment levy.  Some weeks ago the Minister, in response to a question, told me that of the £400 million collected only 24 per cent was spent on job creation.  I understand that 17,000 jobs were assisted by the levy but there is no indication of how many of those jobs still exist.  I hope the Minister has information in regard to that tonight.  I understand an assessment of £56 million on the self employed and farmers has not been collected and that the Revenue Commissioners have stated they do not expect to collect more than £10 million of that figure.  However, that amount should be collected.  I have no doubt that there are many self employed people and farmers who are availing of the services of AnCO, CERT and the YEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he intends to safeguard the interests of staff and I hope he will outline the steps he proposes to take to protect the interests of staff who will be transferred from existing agencies to An Foras.  I am sure the Minister is aware that this is causing great concern.  The relationship between the new body and the VECs is important.  Will the VECs be represented on the new Authority?  I understand that one board member will represent educational interests and I should like to know if that person will be from the VECs.  I note that there is no reference in the Bill to youth employment or youth training.  In my view there <Col N="2743" /> should be a specific reference in the legislation to the question of training and employment of youth.  The Minister will be aware that 30 per cent of those on the Live Register are under 25 years of age and that 21,000, or 80 per cent, have been on the Live Register for one year or more.  That is one reason there is a need to refer to youth employment in the Bill and increase the number of youth representatives on the new Authority.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corportion were set up to develop industry and to provide employment.  What role will they have in relation to the new body?  Will there be co-ordination and, if so, what form will it take?  It is essential that there be some connection between the two.  Clearly, in a rapidly changing world, training and retraining will be necessary and the creation of employment in endemic industry is the key to the entire problem.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the current level of unemployment in Ireland is unacceptably high and the scale of the problem which we are facing is, indeed horrifying.  At the moment there are more than 246,000 people registered as unemployed, almost 19 per cent of the entire labour force.  Over the last five years alone, 100,000 people have joined the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain groups within the labour market, however, suffer particular difficulties. A very disturbing feature of the unemployment statistics is the increase in long-term unemployment.  The latest figures show that more than 100,000 <Col N="2744" /> people, or 45 per cent of all those registered as unemployed, have been without work for more than one year.</P>
    <P>The effects of long term unemployment are particularly severe for those over 25 years of age.  In fact 52 per cent of all those over 25 who are unemployed have been without work for more than 12 months compared to 30 per cent among those under 25.</P>
    <P>Unemployment affects far more than just the persons who are unemployed. One-third of those on unemployment assistance and one-quarter of those on unemployment benefit have at least one adult and two child dependants.  The highest concentrations of unemployment are found in areas which are deprived in many other ways.  These factors compound the trauma of unemployment.  The hardship caused by unemployment are brought home to me day in, day out in my dealings with constituents.  Households who in better times would have had most of their family earning have now three, four or even five members unemployed.</P>
    <P>Although the growth in unemployment appears to have stabilised for the moment all indications are a continuing difficult employment situation accompanied by major structural changes with consequential effects for the labour market.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives of manpower policy must be investment in the workplace, in the education skills and technical competence of workers to enable them to cope with, and to capitalise on, new technologies.  The primary responsibility for such skill-investment rests with employers because they know what skills they have and what skills they need for new products and new processes.</P>
    <P>The State also has a responsibility to those entering the labour force for the first time and to the unemployed.  It has a particular responsibility for those at the end of the jobs queue &mdash; the long term unemployed, young people with no eductional qualifications or marketable skills; the low achievers and drop-outs from school; the socially deprived and disadvantaged and the disabled and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>The Government are doing their best <Col N="2745" /> to help those people but its resources are limited due to the Exchequer situation. It is important, therefore, that all those involved, particularly both sides of industry, work closely together to minimise the hardship and stress of those affected by unemployment, by co-operating with the State in sponsoring schemes and projects which offer worthwhile work experience and training.  Otherwise many of those on the live register will be condemned to a state of enforced idleness with all its attendant evils of despondency, depression and despair.  We cannot, and must not, allow that to happen.  This is why I welcome and support the Government's Jobsearch programme which offers a life line to those who could otherwise feel abandoned and rejected.</P>
    <P>The direction and pace of change are becoming harder to predict; it is difficult to anticipate what knowledge and skills will be in demand two or three years from now.  Workers and managers will have to learn to be more adaptable, more mobile and capable of responding more quickly to market changes.  Otherwise business and jobs will disappear.</P>
    <P>An Foras will have a major role to play in bringing about changes of attitudes and practices in the work place.  Whether we like it or not, the trend is towards the versatile generalist instead of the traditional specialist.  An Foras will have to act as a catalyst for change if industry is to survive.  There is something terribly wrong if goods such as shoes, clothes and even agricultural produce, can be produced cheaper in Britain and on the Continent and can be sold here at lower prices than home produced goods.  We must become more competitive both on the home market and overseas if we are to sell our products and expand our markets; the alternative is so frightening that we really do not have a choice.</P>
    <P>Over the years the manpower agencies have played a significant role in the general economic development of the country. The Irish labour force is now better educated, trained and more productive than ever before.  However, with the rise in unemployment, the role of manpower <Col N="2746" /> policy, and the agencies established to implement it, have increasingly focused on the needs of the unemployed.  A significant range of specific measures have been introduced in an effort to contain the unemployment situation and to assist the less advantaged.</P>
    <P>For some time however, there has tended to be a certain amount of confusion in the public's mind as to which manpower agency is responsible for what.  CERT, who have a clear role in the hotel and catering industry, would be excluded from this criticism.  In this context, therefore, it is essential that our scarce resources are developed and utilised to the maximum possible extent. There is general consensus that the various manpower services provided by the Department and their agencies could best be delivered in the context of a single integrated manpower body.</P>
    <P>The establishment of An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, which constitutes the major part of the Bill before us, will, I am convinced, lead to economies of scale and better integration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for having given me five minutes.  I was very glad to have been in the House to hear Deputy Mooney.  I should like to congratulate her on her speech.  I have only a few words to say on the Bill and I hope the Minister will forgive me if I begin with a criticism of the name, which I regard as peculiar.  I join with Deputy Birmingham in saying that I would have preferred a neater name.  &ldquo;An Foras&rdquo; reminds me of &ldquo;Fiche Bliain ag Fás&rdquo; or An Bord Glas &mdash; it is all very strange.</P>
      <P>However, one does not bring down a Bill for that reason.  I have long felt, and I should like the Minister to put this into his think tank, that the whole matter of the employment function, the employment support section of the Department of Social Welfare should be amalgamated with all the other agencies dealing with placement of the unemployed.  That should be seriously considered.  I speak as a former Minister for Labour, albeit for a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Close liaison and co-operation were <Col N="2747" /> developed between the Department of Education and AnCO during my term of office as Minister for Education.  There was much discussion at that time about overlapping between the Department of Education and AnCO, but when Deputy Birmingham was appointed to investigate the matter he cleared up a great deal of the problems and enhanced AnCO's role in bridging the gap between the education sector and the modern workplace.  The decision then to have a Minister of State with responsibility for both sectors proved most beneficial and a much happier and more fruitful relationship between Education and Labour ensured.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the representation from the education sector on the new board.  I understand that we will be submitting an amendment to have the educational representation on the board increased.  Education has a great deal to do with training of our young workforce.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the passing of the name &ldquo;AnCO&rdquo;.  AnCO have been the beacon of hope for many young people and their parents over the years.  They have equipped hundreds of thousands of young people for very good employment, mostly at home but sometimes abroad, and the training is considered to be of the highest international standard.</P>
    <P>The IDA have boasted they can sell this country to investing companies because we have a first-class, well educated workforce.  I believe the excellence of AnCo's training service was part of that selling exercise.  A constant flow of Ministers for Labour from EC and other countries visited AnCO which had acquired a very strong reputation abroad. A body which holds AnCO in very high esteem is the Manpower Services Commission in the United Kingdom which referred many people to AnCO so that they could see training at its best.</P>
    <P>The AnCO advisory service have carried out training assignments across the world, and have won valuable contracts in the face of multinational competition as the Minister mentioned earlier.  As a former Minister for Education I am <Col N="2748" /> aware of the achievement of AnCO apprentices in international competitions.</P>
    <P>AnCO have sometimes caused controversy. They have sometimes been misunderstood. They sold themselves so well that some Irish people begrudged them their success, as they do when people blow their own trumpets.  However, we owe a great debt of gratitude to AnCO and so do industry.  They have been prepared to pay for the service which AnCO provided.  They realised it was an essential part in their fight for survival in a difficult world.</P>
    <P>AnCO also became involved in the management area and played a very important role.  The Minister is on record in Opposition, and I am sure in Government although I do not recall it recently, as saying that we tend to blame the trade unions for work problems.  In my view, not half enough attention has been paid to the role of management and improvement in management to avoid the kind of problems we have seen.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my thanks to the AnCO staff for their innovation, dedication and excellence over the past 20 years.  I hope the three bodies coming together will be able to fulfil their mandate more efficiently and satisfactorily.  In conclusion, I ask the Minister to consider the employment function as well as the unemployment support function of the Department of Social Welfare in any future rationalisation of our public services.</P>

      <P>May I thank Deputies for their contributions. I regret their contributions were not as long as they might have wished and that some Deputies were unable to contribute.  I know a number of my colleagues wished to contribute but because of the time constraint, did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept without reservation the point <Col N="2749" /> made by Deputy Birmingham and we will have a debate on the White Paper on Manpower in the autumn.  I will go through the points raised by the Deputies but if I do not mention them all I give an undertaking they will all be seriously looked at in the Department.  I am sure Deputies realise why we must get this legislation passed.  We have been talking about amending the Manpower policy for a number of years.  We must take into account the morale of the staff &mdash; that is the point Deputy Hussey made.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned CERT.  I want to put on record our appreciation of all the organisations concerned.  As I said on a number of occasions, they were set up under different circumstances to do different jobs but times change and it is necessary for the legislation as well as the ground rules to change.  The introduction of this legislation is not meant to take from the very good work done by middle and senior management as well as the employees in all those agencies.  This legislation is not a reflection on the contributions these organisations have made over the years.  We must look at reality and see how conditions have changed. We must look at the difficult circumstances in which the Manpower agencies now find themselves because of our high unemployment.</P>
    <P>A number of people this evening reminded me of what I said in Opposition. One of the points I made over and over again was that it was not the job of the Manpower agencies to change the unemployment position.  At almost every Question Time Miniters quoted this to me when I was in Opposition but I repeat again this is an economic measure based on the performance of the economy and the agencies are under pressure to provide courses and employment schemes for the large number unemployed.  This is a challenging task for them.  Again, may I thank Deputy Birmingham and other Deputies for their understanding in giving us this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was asked the timescale for the establishment of the agency.  As I said already, I propose to appoint 1 January 1988 as the establishment day.  This will allow <Col N="2750" /> sufficient time to implement the organisational arrangements involving discussions with staff interest.  Deputies will appreciate that considerable discussions will have to take place because there are 3,000 staff members involved.  Secondly, there is the matter of the appointment of the Director General, an extremely important post.  Deputies asked if the name of the appointee had been decided; it has not.  Thirdly, the appointment of the board has been extended until the end of the year.  Fourthly, there is the matter of the development of policy guidelines for FAS.  In addition, from an accounting point of view 1 January would be the most suitable date as it is the beginning of the financial year of all the bodies concerned.  This would eliminate the administrative burden of producing and maintaining different accounts for the bodies concerned if the change-over were to take place during the financial year.</P>
    <P>The estimates and programmes for 1988 will have to be agreed.  As I mentioned, staff discussions will have to take place and items such as personnel and accounts, bringing the computer programmes together and negotiations regarding the Social Fund are matters which will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham asked me about the major tasks.  There are employment schemes, the ISDS, community enterprise, temporary employment schemes, transition from school to working life, the position for low achievers, which Deputy Colley asked me to look at in conjunction with the Jobsearch programme the long term unemployed, other groups with specific problems and the whole area of training.</P>
    <P>I stated many times, in Opposition and in Government, that it is no use concentrating on those at the top in regional structures.  As Deputy Birmingham said, the CEs have expertise in particular areas and their skills must be taken into account in relation to the formal structure of these organisations.  This will be the case as employment schemes will be taken into account on the one hand and training schemes on the other.  The administrative <Col N="2751" /> area will also be involved in bringing together the research and organisation of personnel functions.  I do not think there will be a problem in that regard but the details must be worked out with the chief executives involved and I hope to spend much of the summer having more discussions to put a proper organisational structure in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked why CERT was omitted from the new body.  I was advised that as it is a framework Bill in which the new body can be established, it would not be appropriate to enshrine in legislation details of organisational structures while they are being discussed because they are better dealt with on an administrative basis which would allow for greater flexibility afterwards, which is a valid point.  As a number of Deputies said, these organisations have been extremely flexible, particularly AnCO and Jobsearch, and they could, in conjunction with the National Manpower Service, get the organisation off the ground.  Also in relation to CERT, Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the tourist industry and that it had a great potential for growth.  CERT are an extremely successful organisation &mdash; I had a different view of them formerly &mdash; but they have now proved that they are capable of undertaking the job.  It has been argued that their contribution to tourism was not up to the mark but we have reached an agreement that the figure for 1988 will be £500,000 and that a further increase in funding can be best achieved through the continuation of CERT and their close identification with the industry.  The motivation and morale at present in CERT would not last if they were amalgamated with another body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham asked about the intention to ensure value for money in regard to FÁS, particularly in regard to regionalisation.  This should be left to the IDA instead of having further regionalisation structures.  However, I have not made a final decision on the matter.  We should also take account of existing structures in education and industrial and social welfare.  Redeployment will be based on value for money. <Col N="2752" /> Deputy Colley also referred to economies of scale.  We need a better service with some expansion of programmes, for example, the recent expansion of the SES which attempted to motivate the unemployed through face to face contact.  We must also consider economies of scale in redeployment and training and more employment schemes.  That does not mean a downgrading of AnCO who have done very useful work which it will be necessary to continue, especially for those who have not reached very high educational standards.</P>
    <P>Youth unemployment will receive priority within FAS and I intend to give a direction in that regard.  However, the abolition of the age limit will provide greater flexibility in the allocation of funds.  Of course, I take Deputy Birmingham's point that the position must be continually monitored.  Youth unemployment will benefit to a greater extent than others if there is an upswing in the economy.  It is proposed to have a part time chairman which is a more suitable arrangement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that FAS will not solve unemployment.  However, they can help through schemes like the ISDS and by putting major emphasis on community enterprise and local initiatives which will not overlap the IDA schemes.  Labour market information is based on the administration of the schemes and local knowledge. I accept that we need to look at all the training programmes and I gave such an undertaking recently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham requested a debate on the White Paper on manpower to which I agreed.  Such a debate could highlight the contents of the annual report and I am open to suggestions in that regard.  Indeed, the annual report for Labour is out quicker than any other departmental report and the Ministers involved should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not encourage emigration, it merely enables FÁS to provide a service consistent with our EC obligations and it will help people who wish to go abroad.  We must respond to realities and try to advise people who must emigrate.  I also accept the need to look <Col N="2753" /> at all the opportunities for employment and policies in regard to tourism.  In reply to Deputy De Rossa, FÁS will deal with all organisational arrangements involving discussions with staff interests and they will adopt a flexible approach and target resources at various groups in need.  We will also, of course, liaise with other development bodies.  Staff consultations and insurance is a sensitive area and later on we will follow through the whole organisational structure.  I have had informal discussions over the last number of days in the Department and with the staff representatives today.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from the contents of sections 7 and 8 of the Bill that I am seeking to secure the assurances for staff transferring to An Foras as proposed in the previous Bill and as adopted in the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, to cover the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs transferring to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  The provisions enacted in 1983 were the subject of extensive consultations with the staff over a prolonged period of some four years or so.  The timescale available to me and determined by reference to the need for urgent action on integrating manpower services will not allow me the luxury of protracted consultations.  In taking on board these provisions as agreed with staff interests as recently as 1983 I have signalled to the staff of AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service that I am sensitive to their concerns but I wish to give them the assurances on tenure of office, pay and conditions of service and superannuation arrangements won by their colleagues in An Post and Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>The distinction in the nature of service of the public servants and civil servants involved in the setting up of An Foras has required adaptation of the provisions of the 1983 Act which catered for the establishment of two separate bodies in the public sector.  This Bill involves the amalgamation of existing bodies in the public service with a service of my <Col N="2754" /> Department in the Civil Service into a new body in the public service.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains comprehensive provisions designed to ensure the continuity of employment of all transferred staff, to guarantee that there will be no worsening of the pay and conditions of transferred staff and to ensure that transferred staff will have the same degree of security of tenure as they would have had they continued in their existing employment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives comprehensive protection of the pension entitlements of transferred staff and makes the necessary legal provision to transfer existing pension funds.</P>
    <P>The arrangements as set out in section 7 (4) are in two parts.  First, the present employees of AnCO and YEA will become members of the staff of An Foras as from the establishment day.  Secondly, I will have power to designate by name civil servants of my Department who will, on such designation, become members of the staff of An Foras.  All these designations must occur before an appointed day which will mark the end of this transfer process.  I have discussed these matters at length with the staff concerned and have offered to forward a letter to the individuals concerned explaining the basis, so that there will not be any confusion.</P>
    <P>The Bill, where it allows for this period so that people can feel happy and settled, at the end of the day deals with an integrated organisation.  For the three organisations concerned and with regard to the earlier discussions with the other agencies, that is understood.  I have made myself available for any further consultations desired by any of the groups. The organisations are to consult with me after Second Stage on some important points of clarification.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that this Bill is all my own work, but it is not.  I should like to put on record not alone the work of the officials but in particular the excellent work done by previous Ministers for Labour, Deputy Quinn in particular, who pioneered most of the work, <Col N="2755" /> and Deputy Hussey who continued the work in her period of office.  I should like to thank these Deputies for the work <Col N="2756" /> done, which made it easy for me to follow through.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to proceed with this legislation initiated by the previous Government. While accepting the need for substantial legislation in this area I have some criticisms of this Bill.  The Bill as drafted could have an effect opposite to that indeed.  The provision relating to the ethics committees and to insurance could drive research out of the hospitals and into the commercial private sector.  This was the area which we hoped to control through this legislation.  Research into some terminal illnesses and into cancer would have to cease as insurance is not available here for research into those areas to cover any compensation claims. Despite substantial amendment and improvement in the Seanad there are still major flaws in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (c) of the Bill requires the trialist, the person proposing the trial, to name the ethics committee for the trial.  This is a recipe for chaos and it undermines the whole purpose of the Bill.  It is totally unacceptable that the <Col N="2759" /> proposer with the major interest, often financial, is, in the conduct of the trial, to appoint an ethics committee.  This approach by the Department is clearly as a result of their failure to consult adequately or to consult at all with the many professionals who have been voluntarily supervising the control of these trials for many years.  A hospital could not accept a case where a trialist sets up his own committee.  Indeed, the National Drugs Advisory Board would have to advise them against doing so.  Ethics committees, to be of any use, must be independent. This will have to be looked at closely.  I know the Minister has had discussions on this with some doctors in recent weeks and I would be interested to hear his comments.</P>
      <P>The ethics committees are central to the Bill because they will supervise the trials and will impose all the restrictions we are anxious to see effectively imposed.  Hence, any question about their independence would seriously undermine the whole thrust of the Bill which we support.  There exist in all hospitals and in some independent institutions, ethics committees &mdash; who have developed expertise in this area over a period &mdash; made up of people from legal, medical and scientific backgrounds.  The handling of clinical trials is obviously a specialised area which requires expertise. We have a very small pool of people qualified to handle the various ramifications. We have people who are experienced in this area and whose record stands for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago I put a question to the Minister asking how many complaints or claims the Minister had as result of clinical trials and the answer was that there was none.  That indicates that, within the health service, ethical committees have operated effectively to protect the public and yet have allowed medical developments to go ahead and research to take place.  In amending this legislation the Minister should consider incorporating those existing structures, or improvements incorporating those structures into the Bill.  He should lay down statutory <Col N="2760" /> guidelines for the make-up, appointment and dismissal of these committees and he should ensure that private institutions should be supervised by ethics committees from local health boards, not ethics committees appointed by the institutions or trialists.</P>
    <P>There should be some form of accountability and supervision in these ethics committees.  They will all have to be approved by the Minister but everybody will accept that the Department of Health has not the expertise and will reply on the National Drugs Advisory Board to provide it.  The National Drugs Advisory Board have had a system in operation but it needs to be given statutory basis and it needs to be extended to cover the private institutions who will have to participate in this procedure from now on.</P>
    <P>The current proposals are dangerously loose and could undermine the intent of the Bill.  If there are 100 different ethics committees supervising work in hospitals and each has to be agreed by the National Drugs Advisory Board and the Minister, the net result is total chaos.  In the area of clinical trials, speed is often of significance. The levels of delay that are possible because of the layers of bureaucracy suggested in the Bill are potentially destructive in the field of medical care and they should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the requirements for adequate insurance for compensation. On the surface it is a straightforward and worthy requirement and I support it.  I gather the current practice is that substantially all clinical trials are covered by insurance and the National Drugs Advisory Board would have required that.  However, it is not possible to get insurance for research into certain sensitive areas such as work with the terminally ill or with cancer patients.  Since the publication of the Bill, Irish doctors have made inquiries and have found that cover will not be provided.  Therefore, the net effect of this Bill is that research in our hospitals in these areas will cease.</P>
    <P>A further problem arises from the cost of insurance when available.  While drug companies and institutes will be able to pay these premiums, doctors within our <Col N="2761" /> universities and hospitals will not.  Hence much needed research which is not commercially attractive to the private, profit-oriented organisations may not be done. For example, St. James's Hospital submitted 60 trials to the National Drugs Advisory Board last year alone.  Some of those may have been funded by drugs companies, some would not.  Some would have been taken because doctors in the field saw a need to advance work in this area.  If they are required to have insurance which can be of the order of £10,000 a year for a premium for a trial, this would put it out of the reach of doctors in the medical service.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in drafting the Bill with the best intentions, it seems that we have hit at this area.  Perhaps awareness of the level of research going on in our hospitals was insufficient.  This issue must be resolved if we are not to exclude hospital consultants whose contracts require and encourage research to be substantially excluded from their work.  I ask the Minister to respond to these points.  He said he has had discussions with representatives of the senior doctors involved.  I hope he will see a way to deal with this.</P>
    <P>The solution may be found in the British approach whereby pharmaceutical companies agreed to pay compensation and the Department of Health and Social Security stated that they would make <i>ex gratia</i> payments to patients in their hospitals.  The question I put to the Minister elicited the reply that he had no claims to date arising out of trials in hospitals and there is no reason to expect a change in that following this Bill.  Similarly in Britain there have been very few claims indeed, and claims that have occurred recently in hospitals can be related to lack of informed consent.  This should be examined because it would be a very unwelcome and totally unacceptable side effect in the health services.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in drafting this legislation may be due to the fact that we are blazing a trail in control over clinical trials on volunteers.  In legislative terms very few countries have statutory controls over this matter.  Britain has no statutory <Col N="2762" /> controls over trials on volunteers but has controls under the medicines Act of trials on patients in hospitals.  The need for controls is being examined there.  Perhaps because we are leading the way in this area, and rightly so, we are having such difficulties in drafting the legislation because we have very little to work on initially.  The Bill was amended and improved substantially in the Seanad and I hope the Minister will be open to amendments and that we can be helpful in developing and improving the Bill and removing the remaining defects which are quite significant, particularly in the two areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those involved in the Seanad debate for their contributions and their impact and I congratulate the former Minister on tackling the issue and making progress.  I congratulate the present Minister on continuing that progress, but let me point out that consultation should have taken place with our drugs advisory board at an adequate level through his Department.  We are not permitted to refer to officials but let me say that the officials there might have been wiser to have taken that road and to have relied on people they had appointed, and who have served well in this regard, to test this legislation.  They could have pointed out many of the problems that had to be amended in the Seanad and will have to be amended here.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to protect participants, whether volunteers or patients, and to allow necessary and desirable medical research to proceed.  I ask the Minister to respond to a point which was raised several times in the Seanad.  Is it desirable for ministerial involvement in supervision to be as extensive as it is?  Is it not simply adding another layer of bureaucracy which can have little or no impact on the security of the persons involved in the trial?  Within his Department he has many talented people but their expertise is largely not specialised, not related to this area, and essentially he will be relying on the NDAB for advice in relation to any decisions he may have to make about <Col N="2763" /> trials.  Would it not have been better to have appointed that body statutorily, increasing their powers and establishing on a statutory basis the ways in which they will have to supervise trials and the regulations under which they will have to operate?  This would have been a better approach and, even at this stage, the Minister might reconsider the extent and perhaps the principle of the Department being involved in this way.  The NDAB have not been given total statutory control over this area to date.  They have had only a voluntary control.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the broadness of the definition in the Bill which states that the Bill is an Act to provide for control over the administration of one or more substances.  This is a very broad definition and already amendments in the Seanad have led to a number of exclusions.  The British Act refers to the administration of one or more medicinal products.  Some more defined term in this Bill would result in fewer problems for those engaged in using medicines in the ordinary way in the care of people.</P>
    <P>The sanctions in the Bill are inadequate. I should like the Minister to examine them, given the size of the business and the profits made.  I know that one of the drug testing agencies have been in contact with the Minister about a problem they have about the terms of the definition in a section of the Bill and I will be interested to know whether he can meet the points they raised.

While there is no time limit on the speeches, I am sure the House will appreciate that I am obliged to call the Minister to reply not later than 8.30 p.m. and some other Members are anxious to participate.

      <P>Some of the Deputies who were seeking to speak took up 25 to <Col N="2764" /> 35 minutes of debating time by the carryover of another business and I sat here awaiting the opportunity to speak during those 35 minutes.  However, I will conclude as quickly as I can because I know others are very anxious to contribute. The two points I made at the start are the ones I should like the Minister to address because they are the fundamental flaws in the legislation as it stands.  He can return to the other issues.</P>
      <P>We support entirely the initiative to bring in controls in this area.  We believe that a good deal of progress has been made on the Bill but that further progress needs to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The House will remember the tragic death some years ago of a young man in an institution in Dublin which caused a great deal of public alarm.  I was sufficiently interested to go along to the institute at the invitation of many of the people working there to establish what was going on.  As a result of that visit I was shown copies of the coroner's report which subsequently exonerated the institute completely from any responsibility in relation to the tragic death of that young man.  He had not disclosed he was taking another drug which, unfortunately, interacted with the one being tested.  There were four other volunteers on the same drug but they had no ill effects.  As a result of that tragic incident the institute initiated a number of new tests on volunteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently I raised the matter at our local health committee.  I informed them that the institute would be quite happy if the committee wanted to visit the institute and ask any questions of the clinical director.  The committee did visit the institute, as a result of which the director of the institute invited the local health committee to nominate two members to serve on their ethics committee. At that time I was nominated by Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla and a former councillor, Councillor Paddy Dunne, was also nominated to serve on that committee. I found out something about ethics committees and their functions.  As <Col N="2765" /> an ethics committee our function is not to become involved in the technical detail of any drug being administered but rather to satisfy ourselves that volunteers know there is always a certain risk involved in volunteering for drug testing and understand exactly what is being proposed to them.</P>
    <P>The institute are very happy with the provisions of this Bill and are very glad its provisions have been tidied up.  The punitive provisions of the original Bill were so as to have almost required the consent of the Minister for Health to authorise a doctor to give a patient a diet chart.  Much ground has been covered since.  As Deputy Flaherty said, much of the looseness was eliminated in the course of the Seanad debate.</P>
    <P>I should say that serving on this ethics committee, among others, are a housewife and myself.  I can assure the House that, as a public representative, I would not be serving on such an ethics committee if I thought there was any danger involved for volunteers.  I am absolutely satisfied that the volunteers are found to be healthy, young people.  There have been reports and speculation from time to time that old people, down-and-outs, and people in bad health were volunteering on the strength of inducements. There was much speculation about inducements.  It would be wonderful if, as in the case of somebody in Army service &mdash; when an officer was given a couple of weeks off to undertake FCA training &mdash; people could be given a couple of weeks leave each year to volunteer for drug testing if they wanted to do so.</P>
    <P>The safeguards are enormous.  For example, no drug testing can take place in the institute unless sanctioned by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  They are the people responsible for ascertaining whether a drug is toxic or whether it should be tested on a human being.  The National Drugs Advisory Board need not cost this State one penny.  The drug companies who want their drugs tested would be happy to pay whatever charge the National Drugs Advisory Board might <Col N="2766" /> levy in order to test their drugs on volunteers. At present the National Drugs Advisory Board is badly under-staffed, their personal grossly overworked. Because of the thousands of new drugs constantly being developed they are subjected to enormous pressure in sanctioning drugs for testing.  Therefore, our attention should centre not so much on the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology as on the National Drugs Advisory Board. Their activities could be expanded extensively without any cost to the State because the drugs companies who invest millions of pounds in drug testing would be quite happy to meet whatever would be the requisite charge or fee.  The Institute of Pharmacology would welcome that proposition.</P>
    <P>I heard recently there are about 5,000 diseases in the world at present for which there are no cures.  People who may be against the idea of human beings volunteering for drug testing, if they feel so strongly, should not even take an Aspirin for a headache.  They should remember that every single tablet ever consumed has been tested on human beings.  We hear much about the AIDS epidemic at present.  Drugs will have to be tested on human beings until ultimately a cure is found.  At present such testing takes place in the United States and on the victims of AIDS.  Scientists are endeavouring to develop a vaccine but that may take a long time.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that our Institute of Pharmacology is at present a world leader in drugs testing.  They have opened another institute in the United States which is proving to be very successful. There is sometimes an illusion created in people's minds that the Institute of Chemical Pharmacology are covering up something because of there being such huge sums of money in it for them in the testing of drugs.  The reason for the existence of our institute, another in Huntington in England, another in the United States and in a number of other countries is that, after the great thalidomide tragedy drug companies were afraid of testing their drugs for fear of something going wrong.  They wanted an <Col N="2767" /> independent, third party, to test their drugs.  They will not risk their reputations by giving the go-ahead for a drug, contending that it is perfectly safe for human consumption, if they have any suspicion that it is not because they would then be in dire trouble.  The large pharmaceutical companies will not allow themselves be accused of having put some drug on the market which they knew to be unsafe because there was big money to be made on it, such as happened in the case of the thalidomide drug, about which everybody knew.  An independent institute such as ours is worth millions to this country and it is important that we understand that.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the independence of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology. Certainly they could do without a tragedy such as occurred in the case of the death of the young student which was occasioned not by the usage of the particular drug being tested but by the interaction between drugs.  Prospective volunteers who come to the institute are screened for all sorts of complaints and diseases, for example, whether they have hepatitis, whether they are taking drugs of any type and what is the condition of their general health.  If there is found to be anything wrong with them they are not accepted as volunteers.  Part of my duty as a serving member of that ethics committee is to go in there and talk with volunteers.  Some may have been there three or four times. We ensure that no volunteer offers himself for testing more than he should, that the blood taken for testing is found to be within certain limits, that they are not being subjected to any pain or suffering and that they understand fully what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the question of inducement.  Why should they not be given some reward for this?  They are doing something which is of great benefit to mankind.  Many people have felt very hurt by this and that includes students who have been studying biochemistry in Trinity College.  Incidentally, for the first <Col N="2768" /> time newspapers are now allowing advertisements to be put in the papers advertising for volunteers.  This was something about which the newspapers had certain feelings but they are satisfied that it is perfectly ethical and quite safe so far as safety can be monitored.  It is more dangerous for any of us driving home tonight than it is to go in as a volunteer to the Institute of Pharmacology.  Those of us who are members of health boards are aware of the need for more generic drugs.  Some of the big name drugs are very expensive but, of course, there are lower cost drugs also.  This is one of the areas in which institutes of pharmacology are working.  They are developing new drugs.  They work with drug companies from France, Japan, the United States, Britain and many other countries from all over the world.  They are trying to develop cheaper forms of the same type of drug which will have the same effect. That work must continue.</P>
    <P>The Royal College of Physicians recently issued a book of recommendations which the institute follow.  In the institute all drug testing and monitoring is based on a Helsinki agreement. It is a lengthy document.  It stresses very carefully what can and what cannot be done where the testing of human volunteers is concerned.  The Food, Drugs and Administration Acts of the United States are also used.  It is good that we will have our own legislation and our own set of rules.  It is well we have not thrown the baby out with the water, which we might have done in the original panic measure which was introduced to control the testing of drugs.  It could have been very foolhardy and dangerous.  I can assure the Members of this House that my experience on the ethics committee has given me the greatest confidence that the safety of the volunteers is carefully monitored and will continue to be monitored.</P>
    <P>I stress on the Minister the importance of improving the National Drugs Advisory Board.  Among the members of the ethics committee is a toxicologist &mdash; who is also on the National Drugs Advisory Board &mdash; as well as a Jesuit priest, a <Col N="2769" /> housewife, former Councillor Dunne and myself and a professor of biochemistry.</P>
    <P>There is no testing on pregnant women.  In fact, I do not think they will take in women for testing, or do they?</P>

      <P>There are drugs that can be good for old people but may be very dangerous for young people.  One has to be very careful.  The Institute of Pharmacology have not tested drugs on old people, no matter what Deputy Flaherty may intimate.  I would like the Deputy to give me details, because I will certainly raise the matter at one of the meetings. Drugs are administered very carefully. There is a lot of work being done on arthritis and on Alzheimer's disease because as we all know they are looking for cures for this disease all over the world.</P>
      <P>There is a great need to improve the existing drugs, because all drugs no matter what they are have side effects of some sort, and ultimately either the drug or the disease will kill you.  The intention is that the drug one takes for a disease will prolong one's life and not shorten it. The objective of testing and developing new drugs is not only to eradicate and cure disease but to lessen their side-effects. I am not a doctor; I am a lay man who is conscious of what is happening in the Institute of Pharmacology and I am satisfied that the welfare of the volunteers is being very carefully monitored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Members of this House it is our duty to help and sponsor beneficial change in our society.  It is recognised there has been more change in society over the past 100 years than in <Col N="2770" /> the previous history of mankind.  It is also our duty and privilege to protect the weaker members of society from any form of exploitation, however well meaning that exploitation or its usage may be. The purpose of this Bill is to draw the balance between these two objectives.  In making the following points I am trying to help this process and improve the Bill in its dual objective of promoting and allowing clinical trials and of protecting those who volunteer to take part in them.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue and I welcome it.  The general thrust of the Bill is good. However, there are some matters in the Bill I would like to have clarified.  The central prohibition in the Bill is to prevent the conducting of clinical trials unless certain conditions are met.  Central to the conducting of a clinical trial is an investigation for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of the administration of one or more substances, where such administration may have a pharmacological or harmful effect.  The definition of &ldquo;administered&rdquo; which is contained in section (1) is central to this. It appears this definition is confined to substances introduced to the body orally, by injection, in other ways or by external application.  I feel there is a weakness in the Bill, as much of modern medicine is based on therapy, including psychotherapy, physiotherapy and manipulation in various forms.  Indeed, much of psychiatry is therapy-orientated.  All of these areas should and by their nature must be subject to experimentation.  In my view this should be covered in the Bill.  In other words, I would like the provisions enlarged to cover all sorts of genuine clinical trials and not those confined merely to the deduction of substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point arises out of that matter.  The conducting of a clinical trial is limited to a medical practitioner or a registered dentist.  This point has been discussed during the course of deliberation on the Bill in the Seanad and in this House.  There are many other people engaged in the healing process who are not so qualified and who, of necessity, will be involved in clinical trials and they <Col N="2771" /> should be covered by this Bill.  It is possible one cannot define in legislation a section broad enough to encompass people who may be genuine, or not genuine, so-called faith healers.  As no doubt the Minister is well aware, there is a grey area in many of the things that happen to people's illnesses.  I make these remarks having regard to the fact that people who are in pain and suffering and who are ill are particularly vulnerable, gullible and open to exploitation.  Much good can be done by genuine clinical trials and much harm can be done by bogus attempts to play on people's suffering. The idea of new drugs, new therapies and new cures can ultimately increase human suffering.</P>
    <P>The third point I am unhappy about in relation to this Bill is the power of the Minister of the day whoever he may be.  Most people will regard the Minister in these matters largely as an instrument of bureaucracy.  As we all know, bureaucrats are good and have some knowledge of most matters they deal with.  However, it seems in these matters that judgment by one's peers may be far more effective than judgment by bureaucrats.  Would it not be better that a person conducting a trial would get the sanction of his peers as well as the sanction of a Minister working through his bureaucrats?  A Minister &mdash; in this case it may be different &mdash; simply will not have the time nor the knowledge and neither will many of his Department officials have sufficient time and knowledge to deal with this problem.  Therefore, it is advisable that the conduct of these trials be linked to a far greater extent to professional bodies than is proposed. Abuse of the consents necessary should be deemed malpractice and should involve removal from the register of doctors or dentists, as appropriate. The governing bodies of these professions should set out guidelines for judging a trial to see whether a particular experiment comes within these guidelines and they should sanction it before and after the event.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the ethics <Col N="2772" /> committee.  At the end of section 8 is a small subsection which states that the composition of the ethics committee may at any time be changed with the approval of the Minister.  This is a rather limited subsection.  It does not say how this ethics committee is to be formed or by whom. It is perilously vague.  This matter may be covered by section 17 which deals with regulations generally.  However, I feel it needs much greater clarification.  There should be a much better provision in the Bill for the composition, knowledge and power of the ethics committee.  It is important that they be included in the Act and that they be known to exist and be readily ascertainable.  For example, should there be an ethics committee of two people or ten people?  How should it be composed?  Should it be composed of dentists, doctors or legal people and in what combination?  A number of disciplines should obviously be brought into force particularly when dealing with the question of consent and the adequacy thereof.  Will there be local or regional committees?</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out in some detail the guidelines the committee must consider but it does not set out who the committee should consist of, how they should be composed and what responsibility they ultimately have if they make a mistake. For example, how should they monitor a trial or would they have powers of inspection and entry?  I would like the Minister to expand on those points.</P>
    <P>As I said already, people who are ill are particularly vulnerable and gullible. At present many of the AIDs victims in the United States are going to Mexico, to Tijuana and such places for local cures which probably in the end will do them more damage than good but it proves that people who are ill will grasp at any straw in order to find a cure.  Any person in constant pain is an easy target to consent to anything he thinks might relieve his illness.  Much illness is of a mental nature.  The cause of the illness may be mental or the effects of the illness may affect the person's mental process. Therefore, the getting of consent is a matter of particular difficulty for people <Col N="2773" /> suffering from a mental illness or who are mentally affected by their illness.  Yet, however, it is in this field that much progress and much change is necessary.  This creates special difficulty and needs a special solution.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill should be set out in much more detail and should provide for objective impartial checks on the matter of consent.  The whole question of consent is a kernel issue in this Bill and is very much open to various interpretations especially by the legal profession. Should the consent not be administered by a person who has no connection with the trial and who has the qualifications to understrand the risks involved and to explain them to the participant in the clinical trial?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to payments for consent. I would like to mention something that has been referred to very often in the newspapers recently about the practice of drug firms paying doctors and hospitals. This seems to be convered by the ethics committee under section 8.  It is well known that drug companies dine and wine certain doctors.  Is this a payment or an inducement?  As reported at column 58 of the Official Report of the Seanad of Wednesday, 1 October 1986, that esteemed doctor, Senator John Robb, referred to a similar experience he had with a drug firm who offered him certain inducements in order to promote a certain drug.  What restraints are included in the Bill in regard to this practice? The same happens throughout the whole legal system.  We must remember that the integrity of a body is very much recognised as a freedom in this country.  This was concluded in the Ryan case of 1965. I would like to ask the Minister how is an ethics committee to value the payment against the risk involved?  What is the validity of a contract with a person suffering a mental illness if it can be shown afterwards that the person entering the contract was so mentally deranged that he was not responsible at the time for submitting himself to a trial?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to an article published in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> in September 1984 which dealt in detail <Col N="2774" /> with that aspect.  I am glad to have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate. In my sporting career I was exposed to the taking of several different substances before major matches.  There are great implications in the Bill for the sporting world.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a recent case in America when a former Olympic gold medalist was prosecuted for promoting steroids to improve performance.  We must also consider the administering of many substances in the sporting world which is out of control at present.  How will the Bill affect the administering of substances or gimmicks in the sporting world?  That is of great relevance to those involved, particularly our star athletes.  Indeed, the more professional the athlete and the more intense competition becomes the more the people involved are influenced to use certain fashionable aids.  In a lot of cases those substances have never been acknowledged as being safe.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is our duty to sponsor beneficial change in our society. Nevertheless, it is equally our duty to ensure the safety of our people against exploitation.  The Bill tries to achieve a balance between those ideals.  Many aspects of the Bill need to be clarified and, if given the opportunity, I hope to comment on the more technical features of it later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House.  Deputy Keating earlier, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, indicated our general acceptance and welcome for the Bill and our agreement for the need for statutory controls in this area of clinical trials where humans are participating.  I wish to raise a point in relation to the ethics committee.  It seems from the way the Bill is framed that a separate ethics committee will have to be formed for each clinical trial.  Will the Minister indicate the names of the members of that ethics committee?  Is he aware of the concern expressed about section 8, and the other sections that refer to the ethics committee, by some members of the Irish Medical Organisation? They are concerned about the <Col N="2775" /> future role of the National Drugs Advisory Board following the passing of the Bill.  Has the Minister received a request that the advisory board be preserved in its present status and role in the arrangement and approval of clinical trials?  Has he received a request that they be given a prime executive position by him in the approving of any clinical trials in the future?  Has the Minister received a request from them that ethics committees in general hospitals should have as part of their function the granting of local approval for any trials conducted in the committee's own hospital?</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made by the IMO &mdash; I am mentioning it in the House to give the Minister an opportunity of putting his response on the record of the House before we move to Committee Stage at a later date &mdash; that the proposal in section 8 for the establishment of a separate ethics committee for each clinical trial would be cumbersome and, in their view, eventually unworkable.  If that is the considered view of some eminent people in the IMO it raises serious doubts as to the effectiveness of section 8 and of the Bill in general.  I hope the Minister refers to that matter when replying so as to clear up the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the careful consideration they have given to the provisions of the Bill and the constructive way they have approached it.  I have taken careful note of what has been said by each Deputy tonight and on the last occasion the Bill was debated in the House.  Several Deputies suggested that members of certain other professions, besides doctors and dentists, should be allowed conduct clinical trials.  For example, physiotherapists were referred to specifically in this context.  I should like to point out that the Declaration of Helsinki, compliance with which is a prerequisite for approval of clinical trials by most drug regulatory agencies, stipulates that biomedical research involving <Col N="2776" /> human subjects should always be conducted under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person and that responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person.  In the Irish context, doctors and dentists have always been treated on a par and this is why we have provided that dentists may conduct clinical trials. I might add that an identical situation applies in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to physiotherapists, I am aware that there was some concern about the Bill's implications for ordinary physiotherapy practice and physiotherapy classroom demonstrations.  My predecessor, Deputy Desmond, gave an assurance in the Seanad that he was advised by his legal advisers that the Bill would not interfere with the ordinary activities of physiotherapists.  I have been similarly advised and I trust that such concern has now been fully allayed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Keating referred to the need to cost all proposals coming before the Dáil by way of Bills.  I would like to say, at this stage, that it is not envisaged that the proposals in the Bill will give rise to much, if any, additional expenditure.  I would remind the House that the National Drugs Advisory Board are already operating a notification scheme for clinical trials currently taking place.  Also, in accordance with general policy in these matters, the fees provided for in the Bill will be pitched at such a level as to ensure that this new statutory scheme is self-financing.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Deenihan expressed misgivings about the provision in relation to consent.  One of the basic principles of the Declaration of Helsinki to which I already referred reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any research on human beings each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail.  He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study, and that he or she is <Col N="2777" /> free to withdraw his or her consent to participate at any time.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is suitably reflected in the Bill's provisions, which stipulate that the proposed participant must be given sufficient &mdash; information in a comprehensible form to enable him or her to make a proper judgment on whether to participate in the trial.  This consent must be in writing.  If, for example, a participant is unable physically to write and give consent in the presence of two witnesses &mdash; Deputy Deenihan referred to clinical trials on children and the mentally ill &mdash; trials would never be carried out on children if they can be carried out on adult volunteers: it is only in cases of children suffering from serious illness for which treatment was not available would it be anticipated that such trials would be carried out.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mentally ill, the consent must be satisfactory to the Ethics Committee &mdash; they must be satisfied that the person acting on behalf of the mentally ill person, when the mentally ill person is unable to understand the nature of the trial, is a person whom the Ethics Committee would consider to be competent to give such permission.</P>
    <P>There must be a delay of six days after consent has been given by the ordinary volunteer before the clinical trial commences. This would give the participant time to reflect on his decision to participate. The Bill provides that a person may withdraw consent at any time without any contractual liability being incurred.  There are additional safeguards when a clinical trial involves patients whose condition the preparation under trial is designed to treat.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the more contentious issue of payments to participants. I believe that some recompense should be allowed for discomfort, for example, the taking of blood samples, and restriction of freedom, because participants may be confined for several days and require to fast and abstain.  There should also be payment for travel and meals.  However, the Bill clearly empowers the Minister to control the <Col N="2778" /> level of such payments.  These payments may be offered now only when provided for in a permission granted by the Minister under section 9 (8).</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the composition of the Ethics Committee.  Guidelines will be drawn up so that applicants will know what the Minister might be expected to approve of in terms of an ethics committee.  The applicant will submit the names of the proposed Ethics Committee at the time the application is made.  I would regard the following as the minimum requirements: there should be two medical practitioners, neither of whom is involved in the trial to be conducted; a nurse who is actively involved in patient care; one professional non-medical person involved in administration or business; one person with legal training and one member of the lay public who is competent and has integrity and whom the public would be expected to respect.  Deputy Briscoe tonight gave us an outline of how an ethics committee of which he is a member operate.  Deputy Briscoe who is an esteemed Member of the House is quite satisfied with that ethics committee, that they are competent and that they have the integrity that we would all want to see provided for in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flaherty and Molloy referred to hospital ethics committees and the need, perhaps, to form a new ethics committee each time it was proposed to carry out trials.  I assure the Deputies that the ethics committee in respect of research programmes being conducted in a hospital might well be the general purposes committee of that hospital.  Furthermore, a hospital that regularly carries out trials may refer to its ethics committee with a particular application without having to name the members each time so that it would not be necessary to set up a new ethics committee each time a consultant in a hospital wished to conduct a trial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Swift had some reservations about the lack of a specific provision in the Bill obliging an applicant to forward insurance details to the Department of Health or the National Drugs Advisory <Col N="2779" /> Board.  I would point out that the requirement for an applicant to forward a copy of a certificate of insurance to the Minister was dropped by way of amendment during the Bill's passage through the Seanad.  It was done because it was considered inadvisable for the Minister to have implied responsibility for confirming in advance that the insurance policy was inadequate.  I agree with my predecessor and the Seanad that such a provision would not be appropriate for inclusion in the Bill.  However, I would point out that there is an obligation on the Ethics Committee to have regard to the insurance.  Deputy Flaherty referred to the insurance provision and the cost that would result for the independent researcher, such as doctors in university or hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are some let-outs in the Bill in relation to the trials of products in the course of ordinary medical practice.  On the general question of insurance, however, it is necessary to provide for compensation for participants when the risks to participants are basically similar. It would not be equitable to distinguish between patients and healthy volunteers and in relation to insurance arrangements for major pharmaceutical companies and for individual researchers.  It is not possible or desirable to develop broadly-based legislation or problems that might arise for individual researchers in specific cases.</P>
    <P>The individual doctor engaging in the ordinary course of medical practice is completely exempt from the requirements of the Bill.  My legal advice is that ordinary medical practice would cover cancer or hospice care as any preparation being used would be to the possible benefit of the patient.  The dividing line between ordinary medical practice and controlled clinical trials become much greyer in relation to other conditions.  I cannot provide for every contingency in a broadly based Bill of this kind: it must be left to the integrity of the individual physician to distinguish between ordinary medical practice and medical trials.  The law must be complied with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2780" /> Deputy Bruton expressed some reservations on the sort of situation comprehended by the provisions of section 9 (7)  (a).  Except in exceptional circumstances, the consent of each participant must be in writing.  Section 9 (7) (a) seeks to cover one of these exceptions, where the patient or participant would be capable of comprehending the significance of his consent but is physically unable to give his written consent &mdash; he may have no arms or he may be paralysed.  In such a situation he can give his consent in any other manner provided it is given in the presence of two witnesses to the doctor treating him for the illness.</P>
    <P>Many of the points made by Deputies were of a very specific nature and arguably would require a lengthy set of specific requirements to be incorporated in the Bill.  This would pose a problem on two grounds &mdash; it would lead to a very rigid régime of control which might unjustifiably slow up necessary and legitimate research projects, and a closed list of specific requirements might not include a particular provision the relevance of which might only become apparent in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, gives the Minister and the National Drugs Advisory Board a flexibility to specify requirements on the lines of those suggested by Deputies during this debate.  While formal approval will be a matter for the Minister, he will rely on the expert advice of the board in arriving at his decisions.  All applications will be referred to the board for assessment and for recommendations as to any conditions which should be attached to the Minister's permission. The Minister will also be guided by the board in relation to applications for amendment of permissions to undertake clinical trials and revocations of permissions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ethics committee when Committee Stage of the Bill was taken in the Seanad, an amendment was introduced to section 2 of the Bill as published which was designed to confirm that it would be possible for a hospital which carried out trials regularly to refer <Col N="2781" /> to its ethics committee a particular application without having to name the members each time.  That deals with the point raised by Deputy Molloy.  There will have to be an assurance that the ethics committee will be constituted on the impartial basis required of such committees in accordance with guidelines which will be formulated in consultation with the National Drugs Advisory Board. I hope that this will allay the concern of the Galway branch of the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>The question was also raised tonight why the Minister should have authority in the Bill.  As in similar legislation, the Minister is responsible to the Dáil and the Dáil is responsible for the legislation. The Minister will consult with and delegate authority to the National Drugs Advisory Board but nevertheless it is important that the Minister have an involvement in the administration of this legislation since the Members of the Oireachtas have the responsible legislative authority.</P>
    <P>That deals with the points raised during the debate.  Again, I want to thank all the Deputies who contributed.  I have no doubt that the constructive and positive attitude displayed during Second Stage will also be in evidence when we take Committee Stage.  I will help the Opposition Deputies as much as I can to tease out this very important legislation to ensure that we present an Act that will stand the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand from the Minister's reply if he has any intention of proposing amendments on Committee Stage or if he is satisfied with the Bill as it stands, because this might have a bearing on our attitude. Will he sympathetically look at amendments on Committee Stage because we are very seriously concerned about this Bill as drafted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very appreciative of your facilitating my colleagues and myself in making a number of queries regarding today's announcement.  It is naturally a source of pleasure and encouragement to any right thinking person &mdash; including everybody in the House &mdash; when a project appears to be about to fulfil significant job expectations, when we are talking about a successful enterprise in which there will be significant, genuine and permanent employment.</P>
      <P>Our enthusiasm and our pleasure would have been greater if we had been able to get all the pertinent and relevant facts without resorting to this debate.  The purpose of my asking to raise the matter on the Adjournment is not in any way to dampen enthusiasm for the project or, to be frank, not to be over hasty in endorsing something, the contents of which we do not know.  I wish to ask for elaboration in regard to some very important details. To give an idea of the farcical way some of us believe this House is managed, I and a couple of my colleagues had to go to the tailend of a press conference, hover outside the door and meekly ask for a copy of the press kit in order to get a gleaning of what this announcement was about.</P>
      <P>I know it is not reasonable to expect the Government or a Minister to come into this House every time an announcement is expected about grant aid but this project has been developing for the best part of two years and it was hailed today as the biggest private investment in Ireland.  There were attempts to get information on the Order of Business and by way of Private Notice Question over the last couple of days.  The matter should at least have merited some presentation of facts, even in the Library, so that we would have had reasonable access to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We note with great interest the outline details published today regarding an investment of £260 million in the meat <Col N="2784" /> industry in a project being undertaken by Anglo-Irish Beef Processors Limited, Dundalk.  The only information I have is that given to me by the press.  There are two documents, one is a piece on public relations about the company &mdash; more power to them &mdash; which is irrelevant to the question of State expenditure.  The other is a two and a half page press release from the Minister's office which essentially gives one figure in relation to State commitment of investment.  It says that there is a £25 million grant from the IDA. However, the investment in total appears to be in the region of £260 million.  I want to ascertain precisely the exact composition of the total State liability, the exact degree of commitment, present and ongoing, by State and semi-State agencies, the exact composition of all the liabilities to which the State is now exposed and a clinical statement of investment by the company which will lead to a reasoned evaluation of the degree of State commitment.</P>
    <P>We will have other days and other ways to talk about the extraordinary situation where TDs had to go outside this House to get the facts.  The outline indications are that this project is welcome and that is the spirit of our contribution.  However, our welcome is qualified by those major questions to which there have been no answers and on which the Government should make a clear statement.  The central question is in regard to the total cost of investment, its exact shape, including the role of the semi-State agencies involved.  For example, it appears that the IDA will make a grant of £25 million to the company in respect of processing facilities.  The exact liability of the State is not clear in relation to the balance of the grant-aid, including the balance of a commitment, which I understand the IDA are making above and beyond the sum of £25 million.</P>
    <P>What is the exact level of State investment other than through grants?  What is the exact level of State investment through grants?  From where is it coming? Are the ACC involved and, if so, to what degree?  How precisely are they involved <Col N="2785" /> and for how long?  Are there arrangements in this package which amount to interest free loans from State agencies other than the IDA?  Is there any shareholding by a State agency, for example, ACC?  If so, what are the conditions, liabilities and implications of that shareholding? What is the return on share arrangements?  Most pertinently, when one analyses the full equation, what is the cost per job created?  What exact number of new jobs will be created?</P>
    <P>In other words to what extent is this a degree of buttressing existing jobs, a perfectly laudable exercise in itself?  Are we talking about temporary jobs in the context of new employment being created and to what extent are we talking about net, additional jobs realistically projected and expected, not hypothetically, speculatively or widely projected? Why specifically is this investment in the meat industry going to Anglo-Irish Beef Processors Limited, Dundalk?  I do not begrudge it to them but I should like to know why they were chosen.  Other areas of the meat industry which need development and investment have been expressing a desire to expand and yet appear to be unable to obtain any degree of sympathetic State response by means of investment?</P>
    <P>We regret, the lack of clarity and forthrightness in the announcement and indeed, the somewhat unprecedented if not unique press conference called literally within yards of this House when Deputies could not get the minimal information on the deal.  Anybody could walk in off the street and listen to the Taoiseach giving facts which we were unable to obtain.  Unfortunately these matters militate against giving the warmest possible welcome that one would usually wish to give to a major new project.  Recent experience has taught us all that these fundamental questions should be asked and answered fully in the context of any presentation of this nature.  We sought, therefore, to raise these questions and a number of others in this way tonight precisely because it is in the public interest to have all the facts on the table.</P>
    <P>It might be worth while in future, in <Col N="2786" /> view of recent experience, and in particular the incredibly shoddy treatment meted out to workers in the Hyster Company, to make public some element of the feasibility study on which the IDA make their judgments &mdash; not the confidential, key material graphs in the context of competitive internal matters, but the broad plan on which one could base a judgment as to whether good decisions were being made.  Perhaps that should be made public in future rather than a two line or two paragraph statement that the IDA are grant-aiding.  Those points are important.</P>
    <P>Mention of the IDA leads me to say that it is wrong for us to be negative about them.  We cannot have it both ways. When they do a good job we in this House are the first to claim credit and to cut the ribbons, but when there is a problem we are quick to blame them.  I have no doubt that like any institution they are not perfect. There was a suggestion during the week by Deputy Bruton that the board of the IDA were threatening to resign and that people were unhappy about the degree of expedition attached to this project. The Government could have asked the IDA to work a little longer, late into the night, or to burn a little midnight oil in coming to a conclusion.  If some degree of undue pressure was brought to bear on the IDA &mdash; and I have no evidence whatever to suggest there was; indeed any gleanings I have are to the contrary &mdash; such as would prejudice the proper decision making process, that would be certainly repugnant to us.  If it is simply a question of expediting without damaging the critical factors of the process, we are all for that.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister capitalise the degree of investment the IDA are making, including the tax breaks?  I gather from something said today that the IDA's statement of investment being at about £25 million is probably worth twice that when one includes tax breaks. Are there FEOGA grants involved here and, if so, how many?  In broad terms that is the essence of it.</P>
    <P>In general terms we applaud and welcome the apparent energy which this <Col N="2787" /> Minister of State is taking to his role in Government.  This is the first opportunity we have had to express sincere good wishes to him.  We have noted that his comments have been forthright and frank.  We hope that will continue and that the sense of urgency which clearly has been assigned by him to the development of this project will also continue. However, I sincerely ask him to consider whether evaluation of projects in this area &mdash; whether they be in the industrial or commercial area, or any other area of job creation should be such as to allow the public generally and this House in particular to draw reasonable conclusions.</P>
    <P>We have recently had some problems, putting it charitably.  I ask the Minister &mdash; if he wants, he need not answer me tonight &mdash; whether he would consider the suggestion of including in future, in the announcement of decisions relating to grant-aid, accompanying documentation as I hinted earlier which would give some glimmer of the business plan which had been the subject of approval.  I am not asking for the internal market research of a company on which they spent hundreds of thousands of pounds, or for some internal document to damage their profitability or their competitiveness.  Would it not be a help in the evaluation of industrial projects and job creation projects generally if we had a broader range of factors on which to make a judgment than simply the bottom line statement that grant-aid has been approved.  That might be a good discipline for us all.</P>
    <P>In broad terms on the basis of what we now know, this project looks like coming to fruition and it would be unchivalrous and begrudging if one did not put on record some degree of admiration for the quite extraordinary commercial and entrepreneurial flair of Mr. Goodman and all his workers who have taken a very front line approach in developing this very important industry.  To him and all his workers who make the factories turn, we send our good wishes and congratulations and our hope that this will give even greater targets, greater profits <Col N="2788" /> and greater returns for everybody in those companies.  The enthusiasm and warmth are nevertheless slightly qualified by the problems presented in the context of that very simplistic statement today.</P>
    <P>When we get these pronouncements in future I hope we will not have to forage for the data or scurry off somewhere to get copies of press releases which, by and large, are factual but nevertheless quite limited and also have a particular purpose, which is to put the very best gloss on things.  We are not fighting that business. We are in the business of making critical evaluations and seeing both sides.  I hope both sides measure up in this case, as they appear to.  I am not totally happy with the presentation of the facts and think they gild the lily more than just a little.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could respond.</P>
    <P>Could my colleague, Deputy Cullen, who has a long-time interest in this area of the industry and who has been pressing to get some data in this area also, with your permission be allowed to speak for a few moments to add one or two points?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Keating for sharing his time with me.  I do not want to delay the House unduly.  I attended the press conference today to seek information because obviously the broad range of this investment affects many areas, no more so than in my own constituency of Waterford, as I am sure the Minister is aware.  Deputy Keating has covered a wide range of very probing questions, the answers to which I shall await with great interest.  It was said at the press conference today that there would be a major investment in Waterford. Could the Minister tell me if that is an immediate investment, an activity to occur in the very near future?  Could he give the level of that investment, if it is immediate, and what the long term plans are?  What are the immediate jobs that can be expected to occur within the area and what are the long term prospects, given all the parameters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2789" /> What type of operation is it envisaged will be carried on in the Waterford area? Is it specific to the boning area or to the sheep area?  Could the Minister give me some information on that?  I have had many inquiries all day long from the people of Waterford, as the Minister can appreciate, and I am anxious to be able to answer in some way these very important questions.  They are important for many people in the light of the past history of Clover Meats.  People are extremely anxious to see a very serious level of investment and anxious to welcome it. They wish for as much relevant information as possible.  Could the Minister answer some of these questions this evening so that I can act in a constructive manner as I believe somebody in this House should be able to do, with the right to seek knowledge and hopefully be given it to impart to his constituents?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of responding to Deputy Michael Keating and Deputy Martin Cullen who raised this matter.  I am pleased that the spirit of the contribution is one of welcome for this project.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware the details of this matter were presented at a press conference today in Agriculture House which is quite adjacent to here.  In many previous instances large projects of this nature were presented in various parts of the country and not so adjacent to this House.  I will be glad to fill in any of the details of the plan I can.</P>
      <P>This plan has all the characteristics of the type of development set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> notably a market-driven approach to food production creating new opportunities for adding value within the country, It also represents a major expansion of an indigenous company with a demonstrated capacity to be a world leader in the meat sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development plan envisages the modernisation and expansion of the processing facilities at Waterford &mdash; this <Col N="2790" /> will be particularly important to Deputy Cullen &mdash; Dublin, Muine Bheag, Nenagh and Cahir and the creating of greenfield processing facilities in County Louth and at Tuam in County Galway.  Two further greenfield locations will be selected at a later date.</P>
    <P>A mere listing of investment elements does not in itself convey the real significance of these proposals.  The implementation of the project will put Ireland at the very forefront of the international meat industry.  The plants will be world leaders in terms of clinical hygiene standards and packaging technology.  It will result in the company's existing output of boneless beef being increased from 39 to 100 per cent, and production being geared to the provision of long life added value consumer products.  The main element of this proposal is the development of new technology to extend shelf life of meat in its fresh and natural form.</P>
    <P>The scale of this project is indicated by turnover so that by the end of the five year programme the turnover is expected to increase by £500 million.  The direct permanent employment increase is estimated at 664 jobs with a further 500 seasonal jobs.  With the progressive dismantling of the CAP price support mechanisms the future of the beef industry in Ireland must increasingly be based on this type of development.  The cosy arrangement of dependence on intervention and third country markets is coming under increasing pressure.  We in Government are delighted to be able to assist projects of this nature which will reduce the dependence of the industry on intervention and on third country opportunistic markets.  The project locations are strategically spread around the country and will benefit a number of employment black spots.</P>
    <P>A feature of the plan is that 99 per cent of the additional output created will be exported resulting in a significant contribution to our balance of payments.  The import content of this project, because it is a natural resource industry, will be minimal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked ten questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to answer them.</P>
      <P>The project's objective is to enhance added value by an expansion of existing processing &mdash; this will entail the establishment of facilities to meet rigorous standards capable of handling and producing fresh chilled consumer packed meat with up to a five month shelf life in its fresh form.  The production of meat products from slaughtering to end-user requires conditions on a single site at an even temperature to reduce bacteriological contamination.  This cannot be achieved if the production cycle is broken.  These new longlife products will help smooth the seasonality of supply which at present is four to one and is an ongoing weakness of the Irish meat industry.</P>
      <P>Another notable characteristic of the development is in the use of the fifth quarter by-products.  The selection and segregation of raw material with high intrinsic protein will produce a range of more valuable products.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed about a possible creation of excess capacity in the industry.  The thrust of this project is greatly enhanced added value and not any dramatic increase in livestock throughput.  This project can stand on its own and on the basis of the promoters company's present kill.  This present kill is about 40 per cent of total slaughterings; even after the implementation of the project there will be plenty of room for competitive processors.  I assure the House that I will be happy to support any other beef processor or competitor in the sector who presents a similar application for grant aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three new slaughtering and processing facilities will have an additional <Col N="2792" /> planned throughput.  As the Deputies will be aware the expansion of beef cow numbers is already the subject of a promotional campaign launched by ACOT. I am very pleased to inform the House that early reports of the impact of this campaign are favourable.  Together with the reductions in interest rates &mdash; the further reduction of the Central Bank's STF rate this week is yet another firm pointer &mdash; the prospects for the beef processing industry are good.  I am confident that cattle numbers will increase and there will be no question of excess capacity.</P>
    <P>While the total state commitment for each permanent job is above average it does conform with all the IDA criteria which have been made more stringent in recent times.  I am totally satisfied and convinced that the project is excellent value for money, in particular when the value added in the country is taken into account.</P>
    <P>The strategic plan behind the proposal is to put Irish beef into world retail outlets as the premium market leader.  This programme is a milestone in the development of Irish food and agriculture.  In assessing the cost per job in this proposal it should be noted that indigenous agriculture-based projects have very substantial multiplier effects leading to many times more jobs being created in associated industry and services.  This type of project provides particular benefit to the economy by fully utilising the country's natural resources and raw materials.  The general multiplier is at least one to one so for each of the permanent jobs created in the meat industry there should be at least the same number of jobs in the packaging and associated industries.</P>
    <P>Over the last few days press reports had pointed to certain misgivings in the trade and indeed among some Deputies. These concerns were dealt with more than adequately in the course of to-day's formal announcement on the project.</P>
    <P>I was glad Deputy Cullen was able to be present to hear the details of this project.  I would like to assure the House that all normal and correct procedures <Col N="2793" /> were followed in the submission to aid examination by the IDA and ultimate approval by the Authority.  If we in the Department of Agriculture and Food expedite and encourage companies to bring about this type of investment we offer no apology whatsoever for that.  We want to see this type of investment and we welcome it.  In the many reports which have been issued on the meat industry one of the most recent was the Sectoral Report on the Beef Industry which pointed very clearly to the fact that we want added value in the country, that we want to reduce our dependance on intervention, on Third country markets and on the very sizeable number of live cattle leaving Ireland which last year amounted to 322,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the carcase beef which is exported for further processing outside the country, we want to bring that activity back home to create jobs here.</P>
    <P>The House may not have had the opportunity to study the financing of the plan.  The total investment will cost an estimated £261 million.  The financial commitment by the State will be £25 million in grants, together with repayable preference share capital of £5 million. In addition the EC is to be asked to contribute over the period of the plan from the FEOGA guidance fund.  The promoters will be responsible for the balance, together with the significant increase in working capital of £140 million.</P>
    <P>It will be quite clear from what I have told the House that this plan represents a radical approach towards the development of the meat industry.  In sponsoring the plan over the past couple of months, I am convinced that not only will it be a major breakthrough in itself but that it will point the way for other progressive participants in the food industry, so vital for this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific questions which Deputy Keating asked, it is the EC who are involved and the ACC has no involvement whatever.  There are no interest-free loans from State agencies. <Col N="2794" /> There is no shareholding by State agencies. The position in relation to Anglo-Irish Beef Producers Limited is that they submitted an application for grant aid. Because of their scale of operation and their performance over 26 years they are one of the best firms in the meat industry not alone in Ireland but in Europe.  We need that sort of performance to penetrate the markets in Europe and have Irish beef available to consumers in Europe.</P>
    <P>In relation to tax breaks, there is no underwriting of tax-based loans. However, it is normal commercial practice for priority projects sponsored by the IDA to benefit from access to tax-based loans.  Such facilities would be negotiated by the promoters in the usual way and, given the nature of the tax-based lending, it will not be possible to calculate in advance the capitalised equivalent to reduced interest rates.</P>

      <P>This project was officially launched only a few hours ago.  Comprehensive details were made available not alone by the Government but by the promoter and the Managing Director of the IDA.  As the IDA were the statutory body with responsibility for grant aid in this instance, the Managing Director, Mr. White, adequately and fully answered any of the queries in relation to it.  He made it clear it satisfied all the criteria. Specific conditions are laid down in the offer of grant which would have to be met before any State funds are applied to this project.</P>

On the key points, will the Minister tell us precisely the exact cost per job?  He indicated it was above average.  Will he tell us the total State exposure?  I include in that the question of some assessment of tax breaks because an assessment is essential if one is to say it is value for money.  We did not get the FEOGA dimension quite clear.  We are not clear either whether other semi-State bodies are involved but we would be grateful for a brief answer to those three elements which are central.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics relating to persons convicted of supplying, or of possession with intent to supply any particular controlled drug, are not recorded separately by the Garda.  Consequently, the information sought could not be compiled without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda resources.</P>
    <P>The information which is readily available and which is published in the annual crime reports, refers to persons convicted of unlawful possession of any controlled drug, including possession with intent to supply, and refers also to persons who have been charged with possession of heroin whether for personal use, or for sale or supply to others.</P>
    <P>This information is as follows: (a) Numbers of persons convicted for the unlawful possession of all controlled drugs, including possession with intent to supply: 1983, 1,054; 1984, 446; 1985, 618; 1986, 969.</P>
    <P>Note: Convictions obtained in any one year may relate to prosecutions taken in previous years.</P>
    <P>(b)  Numbers of persons charged with possession of heroin, including possession for personal use or to supply to <Col N="2663" /> others: 1983, 449; 1984, 340; 1985, 359; 1986, 341.</P>
    <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to specialised units like the Drug Squad is a matter for the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  The Garda authorities consider that the strength of the Drug Squad is adequate at present.  It is important, in relation to this matter, to bear in mind that while the Drug Squad plays a special role in combating the drugs problem, a vital contribution is made too by the many other members of the Garda Síochána who have been given special anti-drugs training and who perform valuable anti-drugs work as part of their normal duties. To date, some 1,730 members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Area have undergone specialist training in anti-drugs work.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, makes it an offence for a person other than a member of the Garda Síochána to wear any colourable imitation of the Garda uniform.  As I indicated in reply to Question No. 78 on 27 May 1987, it has been represented to me that the provision in the 1924 Act for the legal protection of the Garda uniform is inadequate. However, I understand from the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to indicate that this is so.  The matter has been the subject of consultations between my Department, the Attorney General's Office and the Garda authorities and, following these consultations, the Garda authorities have recently issued a circular to the force <Col N="2664" /> drawing attention to section 15 of the 1924 Act and directing that any suspected breaches of that section by an individual or group of individuals should be immediately investigated.</P>
      <P>Should it emerge that there is a problem and that amending legislation is necessary in order to provide a solution, the question of introducing such legislation can be considered.</P>

      <P>Records are not maintained in such a manner as would enable a breakdown of excise duty receipts as between franchised importers/distributors and other persons to be given.  A breakdown of the 1987 figures as between category A and category B motor vehicles as requested by the Deputy is not yet available. However, a total of £64.64 million was collected in the period 1 January to 31 May 1987 from the excise duties on motor vehicles and motor-cycles.  The corresponding figure for the same period in 1986 was £71.43 million.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, following a request by the wife on 16 March 1987, the husband and wife are being taxed for the current year under the provisions relating to separate assessment and the appropriate certificate of tax-free allowances has been issued to each spouse on this basis.  If they now wish to opt for joint assessment on the aggregation basis for 1987-88, the wife must notify her local inspector of taxes in writing to that effect before 6 July 1987.  The husband should then advise his inspector of the manner in which he wishes his tax-free allowances to be apportioned between himself and his wife.</P>
      <P>If the couple wish to have their liability for the year 1986-87 reviewed, the husband should submit their forms P60 to his tax office to enable the joint review to be carried out.</P>

      <P>To qualify for payment of disability benefit a claimant must have 39 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The records of the Department show that the person concerned has only 31 paid social insurance contributions since entry into insurance.  He was in receipt of unemployment assistance from 1968 to 1987 and was awarded credited contributions. Prior to that period, he apparently had some period of insurable employment in the United Kingdom but this cannot be taken into account under the EC regulation as he has not taken up employment since that time.</P>

She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 5 June 1987.  The appeals officer allowed her appeal and arrangements have been made to have arrears due, amounting to £3,188.82, paid at her local post office on Friday, 19 June 1987.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of jobs created by the IDA in each sector over each of the last 10 years and in the current year; the average cost of each job through the authority; the comparison between the level of job approvals and the actual jobs created for the same period.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the number of jobs created in IDA supported projects in each year 1977 to 1986, by sector, is as set out in the following table.  Figures for 1987 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The average cost per job sustained in the periods 1978-84 and 1979-85 is set out in the annual report of the IDA for the years 1984 and 1985 respectively which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Similarly the number of jobs approved by IDA in each year 1977-85 is contained in the annual reports for those years.  The 1986 figure will be published in the annual report for that year.</P>

      <P>At 1 June 1987, the numbers of applications on hands for driving tests were 622 in Letterkenny and 250 in Buncrana.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of managing the driver testing system, the country is divided into six regions.  The two test centres to which the Deputy refers form part of the North West Region.  At present, there are five driver testers assigned to this region. Their attendance at each of the test centres within the region is determined by reference to varying demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2680" /> The average waiting time from date of application to granting of a test appointment in the two centres in question is now of the order of 6 months.</P>
    <P>The main reasons for the delays are the increased demand for driving tests in recent years and the general constraints on the recruitment of public servants. Every effort is, however, being made to ensure that delays in arranging tests in the 47 centres throughout the country are kept as uniform as possible.  Testers from other regions are periodically assigned duties in the north west region for this purpose.  Arrangements have been made to assign three additional testers to this region on a temporary basis with a view to reducing the average delay in the region.</P>

      <P>I understand that two employees of the firm concerned have lodged appeals under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act with the Employment Appeals Tribunal, but no notices or applications relating to any other payments have been received in my Department from or in respect of such employees.  My Department will be prepared to assist in any way possible in securing payment of any statutory entitlements to the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts qualified employees are entitled to payment of statutory lump sums on the termination of their employment.  If the employer concerned in this particular case has issued the employees with redundancy notices (form RP 1) and redundancy certificates (form RP 2) but has not paid them their statutory entitlements, the employees should complete forms RP 14 and forward them together with the completed forms RP 2 to my Department for payment of the lump sums from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  If the employees have not received the redundancy certificates but consider that they satisfy the conditions for eligibility under <Col N="2685" /> the Acts, they should submit completed appeal forms RP 51A to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in order to establish their entitlements.</P>
    <P>If the employer company have gone into liquidation or receivership, the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, will apply as regards outstanding wages, holiday pay and certain other debts related to pay due to the employees.  If the company are insolvent, the employees should complete forms IP 1 and forward them as appropriate to the liquidator or receiver who should then apply to my Department for funds to pay the employees from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  In regard to any entitlement of any employee to payment in lieu of minimum notice, he/she will first have to establish that entitlement by appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, again through completion of form RP 51A. Any tribunal award in favour of the employee of a company in liquidation or receivership under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act would be payable from the fund.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern of the directors of community care and medical officers of health about the conditions under which meat is slaughtered for human consumption and I share their anxiety regarding the effectiveness of current procedures towards the protection of human health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the aims of the proposed new Bill on slaughterhouses which is under <Col N="2686" /> consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, is to try to achieve a level of operational hygiene and meat inspection in domestic slaughterhouses on a par with those now obtaining in the export plants.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these proposals will bring about a satisfactory situation and will allay fears and anxieties in relation to meat presented for sale for human consumption.</P>

      <P>The content of medical school courses is primarily a matter for the authorities of the bodies which award medical qualifications in this country.
