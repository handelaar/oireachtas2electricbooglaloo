      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Attorney General's office have completed a report as to the effect of the Crotty judgment on our international treaty obligations, including those that arise under our membership of the United Nations and as to the implications of the judgment for the conduct of foreign affairs; the contents of any such report and the action, if any, the Government intend to take in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the many suggestions from political, legal and academic sources, that our Constitution is in need of reform, he will consider establishing a suitable forum to consider the reform, if any, which is needed in the Constitution; <Col N="3" /> and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present for the establishment of a forum to consider constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Supreme Court judgment on the Single European Act, I would refer the Deputies to my reply in the House on 27 May last when I indicated that the complex issues involved were being examined by the Departments concerned, with the Attorney General.  This examination is nearing completion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate when it is anticipated that the examination will be completed as it is some nine months now since the Crotty judgment was delivered?  When that examination has been completed, will a report be made publicly available and published as to the Attorney General's conclusions and recommendations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the body which will now make recommendations regarding the disposal of some of the funds of the national lottery following his decision to abolish the National Heritage Advisory Council; if he will indicate the amount of money that will be made available for heritage and conservation projects; the manner in which the decision will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration is being given at present to the establishment of a broadly-based national heritage council to advise on all aspects of conservation and the protection and preservation of our national heritage.  The advice of this body will be taken into account in the allocation of direct Exchequer and lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Taoiseach not consider it appropriate that allocations under the national lottery were also made in the context of the Estimates just published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question deals with the moneys for the conservation and protection of the national heritage.  My reply is to the effect that we are going to set up a broadly based council who will advise on the disbursement of lottery funds in that area and future allocations of Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clarify the question because the Taoiseach probably misunderstood. Why does the Taoiseach not see fit to announce the disbursement of lottery funds with the rest of the Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, some of the lottery funds for this year have already been allocated.  Another <i>tranche</i> will shortly now be decided upon. My colleagues and I felt that it would be <Col N="5" /> better to publish the Extimates, have the reaction of the Dáil on those Estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Taoiseach to say that he intends to set up a broadly based council to advise him on national heritage matters having just abolished the National Heritage Advisory Council?  Would he not agree that that is a completely contradictory approach to take?  Would he further not agree that it makes no sense whatever to come into this House, having abolished the National Heritage Advisory Council, and tell us that he is going to set up another council with no provision having been made for that anywhere in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it I can understand the Deputy's perplexity, but there is a very rational explanation for it. The council who were there were very limited in the ambit of their responsibilities. They really were only a council to advise on buildings, and a limited range of buildings.  I discussed the matter with the chairman of the council and explained to him that I was anxious to set up a much more broadly based council who would have general responsibility for all the heritage and conservation area and that perhaps we would consider having his council subsumed into that and maybe a sub-committee of this broadly based council having responsibility for what is now under the jurisdiction of the present National Heritage Advisory Council.  Really I am aiming for a much more broadly based council responsible for the whole area and not at all to do away with the responsibility which the present council are discharging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find all of that very interesting and still somewhat perplexing.  Is the Taoiseach saying now that the new council that he proposes to set up will have a wider remit than the previous National Heritage Advisory Council? What provision has been made in the Taoiseach's Estimates for 1988 for this new, more broadly based council with a wider remit to pursue their activities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has inquired whether any members of his Government, or the spouses or immediate family members of any members of his Government own shares in a personal capacity in any of the oil exploration companies likely to be affected by the Government announcement of 30 September last in relation to oil terms; the steps, if any, he has taken to satisfy himself that no member of his Government is subject to a conflict of interest in this matter, wittingly or unwittingly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice governing conflict of interest requires Ministers to alert their colleagues where any matter before Government is one in which they or their family have a material interest and unless the Government decide otherwise, not to take part in decision-making in that matter.  I am not aware of any breach of this principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying in relation to the question that no member of the Government and no members of <Col N="7" /> Ministers' families have shares in any of the companies that would be affected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy fully understands the position which is that there is no particular inhibition on any Member of this House holding shares or any other property.  What is of importance is that there should be no conflict of interest where a Minister is concerned and that matter is taken care of by the principle which binds on Ministers to, if an issue arises in which there would appear to be a conflict of interests, inform their colleagues and if necessary to refrain from taking part in that discussion. My information is that there is no such conflict of interest hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Taoiseach that I also have read rules in relation to the conduct of Ministers' affairs.  Is the Taoiseach saying that no member of the Government declared an interest in any of the oil exploration companies prior to the changing of the terms for exploration last month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's economic objectives covering the period to end-1990 are set out clearly in the <i>Programme for <Col N="8" /> National Recovery</i> published on 9 October, 1987 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on that day.</P>
    <P>The Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers Association, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society have drafted that programme which involves the creation of a fiscal, exchange rate and monetary climate conducive to economic growth, including in particular the stabilisation of the National Debt to GNP ratio at an Exchequer Borrowing Requirement level of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP by 1990; movement towards greater equity and fairness in the tax system, including in particular income tax reductions to the cumulative value of £225 million over the next three years; diminishing or removing social inequities in our society, including in particular maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and within the resources available considering special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments and intensification of practical measures to generate increased job opportunities on a sectoral basis.  As regards talks with representatives of the banks and financial institutions I and the Minister for Finance met representatives of the major financial institutions on 24 September, 1987.</P>
    <P>The meeting was a reflection of the growing importance of the financial services sector and of a desire on the part of the Government to work together with the financial sector to increase national prosperity.</P>
    <P>The themes of the meeting were investment in Ireland and how it might be encouraged; interest and exchange rates; the financial consequences of the move to a single European market and the management of the national debt and progress in establishing the international financial services centre in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that nothing he has said following the publication of the public service pay deal, <Col N="9" /> which he calls a plan, and that nothing in what either he nor the Minister for Finance said yesterday, gives any clear view of the Government's intentions in relation to the protection of deprived sections of our community and that neither is there any clear idea of the Government's intentions in relation to taxation?  Will the Taoiseach agree also that to present an intention of reducing taxation or of giving tax reliefs amounting to £225 million over three years is a pretty puny effort for a Government composed of people who two years ago found the return of over £200 million to the taxpayer in one year to be inadequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been hammered out in agreement with all the social partners and is regarded by them as reasonable.  So far as the Government have taken any criticism in regard to that matter from the economic establishment, it is that they should not have given any tax concessions at all. However, as the Deputy knows it is the Government's intention to endeavour to progress towards taxation reform as economic circumstances permit.  That is what is attempted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has just said that this agreement was hammered out with the social partners and that they found it reasonable.  One or two of the social partners do not now feel that it is as entirely reasonable as they thought when they were signing it but that is a matter for another question.  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether any of the working papers that were put before that conference will be made available to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be neither necessary nor desirable.  What is put before the House and before the people is the programme as finally hammered out.  A lot of the suggestions and submissions were made in confidence and it would be most unusual to make any such <Col N="10" /> papers public.  If the Deputy were fair about this he would accept that it was a major achievement by the social partners and by the Government to be able to reconcile all their conflicting interests and get support and agreement for a programme for economic recovery.  The Deputy is less than generous in not giving some credit to the Government but he should accept that the social partners deserve commendation for being able to reach agreement on this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the publication of the Book of Estimates makes the proposals in the plan for national recovery less likely to be achieved particularly in relation to social welfare, education and job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The two documents are part of the Government's overall fiscal and economic strategy.  The programme aims at economic recovery. This Government see sound public finances as an essential basis for economic recovery.  We need the fiscal improvement which is envisaged by the publication of the Book of Estimates side by side with the positive measures for sectoral development in the national programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that some of the social partners now seem to be less than enchanted and find that some of the agreement did not mean what they thought it meant?  Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a difference between negotiations with the social partners and the debate we have in this House?  My question about the working papers has been answered by the Taoiseach in a way which I can only conclude is less than properly deferential to this House.  Would the Taoiseach agree that when this House is about to carry out its proper business in the examination of Government expenditure plans, we should have available to us at least the same information that people outside of this House have had in conspiring with the Government to make an agreement that will be paid for by the rest of us?</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's statement that he considers the cutbacks announced yesterday to be an integral part of the plan that was agreed with the social partners, can he say whether he disclosed, during the course of the negotiations leading to the plan, the detail of those cutbacks?  Were the social partners advised during the negotiations of what the Government had in mind by way of the cutbacks that were announced yesterday?</P>

      <P>There was no particular disclosure of the Estimates.  The duty of the Government would be to produce the Book of Estimates first of all to Dáil Éireann.  We did that.  We would be very rightly criticised if we had disclosed any details of the Book of Estimates to anybody before they were published in Dáil Éireann.  However, it is no secret to anybody that for the past six months the Government were engaged in a particular exercise designed to produce a Book of Estimates which would achieve substantial reductions in Government expenditure.  Everybody knew that that was what we were doing all through the summer.  That is what we have done and that is what we produced to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I will not hold the Taoiseach to the last three decimal places there.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that to have allocated so far this year £1.3 million to the arts from the proceeds of the national lottery is in fact a perversion of the original intention of the lottery?

Would <Col N="17" /> the Taoiseach not agree that on 14 October it is rather a ridiculous situation to find that only one-fifth of the proceeds from the national lottery this year have been allocated?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's strategy for industrial job creation is set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was published on 9 October 1987.</P>
      <P>The objective of Government policy will be the creation of approximately 20,000 extra jobs in manufacturing industry on average each year over the next ten years with the actual provision accelerating as the programme policies take effect.</P>
      <P>The programme for employment creation is being developed on a sectoral basis and will build upon the more competitive environment generated by the Government's fiscal and monetary policies. This sectoral development strategy will be based on:</P>
      <P>&mdash;market research at home and abroad which will indentify development and employment potential;</P>
      <P>&mdash;our natural resources;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the new advanced skills in our workforce and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the achievement of increased market share in selected sectors and markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>with specific and realistic job opportunities being identified for each sector. Sectoral job opportunities covering such <Col N="21" /> sectors as food, horticulture, tourism, marine and manufacturing, have already been identified and are detailed in the programme.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the policy being undertaken to expand and diversify our industrial base include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the rationalisation of the industrial promotion agencies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;giving greater priority to the market and technological orientation of indigenous industry through the expansion and growth of selected Irish companies firmly rooted in the economy;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a shift in resources from the support of fixed asset investment to the upgrading of marketing, product development, R and D and management expertise;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the linking of State support to the achievement of specific employment targets;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of trading houses to provide a new and effective export service to indigenous firms to help them increase their share of overseas markets;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of Ministerial Offices for Trade and Marketing and for Science and Technology; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the promotion of investment from overseas designed to give greater emphasis to the integration of such investments into the Irish economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the job proposals in the plan he referred to are purely aspirational? For example, the plan states that the beef industry should provide 1,000 new jobs over five years and that in regard to toolmaking output can be increased to around £20 million giving 1,000 extra jobs.  There is no reference in the plan as to how those jobs can be created.  In the course of his reply the Minister referred to the &ldquo;competitive environment&rdquo;.  I wonder if he will agree that the creation of the environment he mentioned &mdash; the former Government mentioned the <Col N="22" /> environment for the four years they were in office &mdash; to induce manufacturing to provide extra jobs causes job losses?  Will he agree that that has occurred consistently in recent years and that, on his own estimate, it will result in a further 14,000 job losses in the coming year? When does the Minister consider that job creation will begin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on what the previous Government talked about for four and a half years.  I will confine my comments to what we have talked about and achieved since we came into Government in the important and critical area of creating the right environment for investment.  As the House will be well aware, interest rates have come down by 5 percentage points since we came into office.  At the level of interest rates previously existing, it was unrealistic to expect investors to invest. There are very few businesses here of which I would be aware that could borrow money at the then interest rates and hope to be able to make repayment on any investment.</P>

I am sure that the Deputy is only too well aware of the adverse comments made abroad before, during and after the General Election about the state of the Irish economy. It was referred to by the economists as a &ldquo;third world economy unwilling and unable to face up to its responsibilities in tackling its financial problems.&rdquo;  The situation is beginning to come right.  This economy cannot be isolated from what is happening on foreign markets.  There is at the moment a tendency for interest rates to edge up, but the publication of the Book of Estimates will at least stabilise the situation and give investment a chance to take place and from that jobs will flow.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the measures, if any, he proposes to take to reduce and control the cost of motor insurance in particular, insurance for younger drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair and Deputy Barry, I shall reply to this question.  I am aware of the burden which high insurance costs impose on all sections of the motoring public and I intend to do everything practicable to alleviate this burden where possible.  I am particularly anxious to improve the position of young drivers.  However, the cost of insurance is directly related to the level of claims occurring.</P>
      <P>The motor insurance industry in Ireland has had significant underwriting losses in recent years.  In the absence of a change in the underlying claims experience, lower insurance rates for young drivers would mean higher rates for other categories of driver.  More mature drivers have been statistically proven to be somewhat safer than their younger counterparts whose rates reflect the higher risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the insurance supervisory authority, my primary responsibility is to ensure that companies are maintaining their solvency margins and reserve requirements.  I must, therefore, respect the right of insurers to charge economic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.  The initial loadings imposed on first time insureds and more specifically young drivers can be offset over time by earning a no-claim bonus. However, many young drivers have several years of claims free driving as drivers <Col N="28" /> on their parents' policy, when they first take out insurance in their own name. Many of them get no credit for this.  I have had discussions with motor insurers and they have undertaken, when the Courts Bill is enacted, to give a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no claim bonus to young drivers taking out their first policies if they have been named drivers on their parents' policies for two years, have a full licence and have been accident free. I will be pressing for further improvements. Benefits should also come from tackling legal costs, uninsured driving and road safety, which are being considered in the context of the current joint Government/insurance industry discussions on how to reduce the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>A major motor insurance company has recently introduced a special young drivers scheme on its own initiative, which sets down a maximum premium in absolute terms while at the same time allowing a young driver to commence earning an entitlement to a no claims bonus in the ordinary way.  I would urge other motor insurance companies to follow this lead.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that it is only when the overall burden of claims costs is reduced that insurance companies will be able to reduce premiums.  For this to be achieved, it will be necessary for the motoring public generally, and young motorists in particular, to improve standards of driving and road safety &mdash; standards which are all too often lacking at present.</P>

The Bar Council listened to what I had to say and are now considering the points which I put to them. I am awaiting a reply from them.  I simply invited them on a voluntary basis to consider whether or not the level of legal representation in insurance cases was something they could stand over and I am awaiting hearing from them in that regard.  Assuming we get a positive response, it will help to reduce costs.</P>

I asked them to consider on a voluntary basis, as has happened in other countries, whether they would take an initiative in that regard and I am awaiting hearing from them.  There were some differences of opinion in regard to who precisely said what and who heard what but when you ask a profession to consider some voluntary redundancies they might not hear as carefully as they would normally hear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of discussions with the Insurance Industry Federation.  As I outlined in my reply, the Courts Bill will enable them to introduce this new scheme which will give between a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no-claims bonus to young drivers taking out their first policies if they had been named drivers on their parents' policies for two years, have a full licence and are accident free.  Also, the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out during the summer to the insurance industry that he will not necessarily approve increases in insurance premia just as a matter of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point. We have made it quite clear to the insurance companies that for a long time now they have been saying that if they get the Courts Bill they will bring down costs.  We intend to hold them to that commitment.</P>

      <P>Reducing insurance premia is only one part of a programme. The programme includes items such as the Courts Bill, the number of lawyers involved in a case, a book of quantum of damages if that is possible, looking at pre-trial procedures, what various Departments can do about greater safety on the roads and the question of uninsured drivers which adds about £70 to £80 on every premium in the country.  All those matters are being looked at very carefully.  Other Departments are involved.  Both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I are working on a programme to reduce insurance costs. There is no one spot on which you could put your finger on and say by tackling that it will make a major difference.</P>

      <P>All of this is touching spots and is no more than tinkering with the system.  Is the Minister of State considering in his discussions and negotiations with the insurance industry the introduction of a nationalised scheme of no-fault liability?  That is the only effective way one can get over the overloading of these matters, with costs by lawyers and insurance brokers.  Are we just going to have an endless tinkering with the system which is what the Courts Bill and the many other things will really do?</P>

There is a range of areas on which we are trying to make some progress.  Let me say in this regard that the Fine Gael insurance policy document which was released during the summer was helpful in that it also pointed to a large number of areas where we can and are taking action.

      <P>Furthermore, the Confederation of Irish Industry, in conjunction with the Quality Research Unit of Galway University, are organising a series of one day seminars to be held at various venues around the country starting the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> A good response was received to the discussion document and the views expressed will be taken into account in reaching decisions which will be taken shortly regarding the directive, including the question of allowing a state of the art defence.  A decision will also be taken shortly regarding the manner of implementation of the directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that implementation of this directive will mean increased claims against producers with a consequent increase in insurance premia and possible bankruptcies? Will he further accept that the only effective defence against such claims is preventive action based on some quality management practices?  I put down this question before the end of the last session.  Will the Minister accept that this is too little, too late and that what we need is a national quality drive to prepare industry for the implementation of this directive which, of course, will have benefits in other areas also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said in that this is too little, too late.  In the first instance, I am not very long here and, secondly, industry is only too well aware of the serious implications of the introduction of this directive. The product liability directive will impose a no-fault liability on the producer of a defective product.  Let me also point out to the House, that the directive gives a number of options to member states in relation to the development risk defence and the financial limits to be set on claims.  Primary products which have not undergone initial processing may also be included or excluded from liability. Therefore, it is not fair to suggest that industry is not aware of the implications of the implementation of this directive. Of course, it is.  I am continually receiving submissions and in the next week or so I will be attending a seminar at the CII. When I have seen all the submissions I will make my decision on the best way I can protect Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="34" /> accept that this would need to be done very quickly and that genuinely in the interests of this country and of our producers a major national quality drive is needed right up to the date of implementation of the directive in August 1988?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am concerned about the need for quality and excellence in products.  I would draw to the attention of the House and of the Deputy in particular that there has been great work done by the Irish Quality Control Association over quite a number of years, and indeed by the various State agencies, in hammering home the message of quality to Irish manufacturers. Indeed the day is not far off when the success or otherwise of their enterprises will depend on their quality, it being a major factor of all the others that comprise excellence.  Indeed that has a bearing on the implications of this quality product directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary questions in April 1987 to which the Deputy refers were essentially concerned with import substitution.  Following a review of existing import monitoring systems, I will shortly be putting to Government a series of proposals aimed at assisting Irish firms to maximise import replacement on the home market.  These include the strengthening of those systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the strengthened systems proposed are consistent with our <Col N="38" /> commitment to achieve the completion of the internal market for goods and services by 1992.</P>
    <P>In common with other member states Ireland operates the import monitoring systems allowed under EEC regulations. Because of the vigilance of the Commission in relation to any measures, including monitoring, which would offend Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome which prohibits restrictions on imports, the extent to which additional levels of monitoring takes place in other EEC countries is difficult to identify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 35 and Priority Question No. 41 together.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, we have stressed the overriding importance of getting order into the public finances.  Without such order there would have been a continued outflow of capital from the economy, high interest rates, an unstable exchange rate and a continued deterioration in the national debt/GNP ratio.  Such an environment would not have been conducive to investment and employment generation.  The improved fiscal and monetary climate, created by this Government, will stimulate investor confidence and greater economic activity and thus contribute much more successfully to the creation of new employment and the maintenance of existing employment.  It is important that in the national interest all sectors of the economy contribute to this policy goal.  The Industrial Development Authority can be no exception.  I am satisfied that with an improved environment and a much more concentrated approach to industrial development, as outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> there will be no diminution in the effectiveness of the Authority's job creation role.</P>
      <P>The IDA currently employ 665 people. It is likely that, in addition to the normal turnover of employees, voluntary redundancy will be offered to around 70 employees.</P>
      <P>I am at present having discussions with the Authority about what changes may be necessary to the organisation's structures and activities to ensure that they are not only properly focused but can perform their functions within their 1988 allocations. I am not in a position to say at this stage what precise changes will be implemented or what activities may be curtailed or eliminated.</P>
      <P>The question of the appropriate location for IDA offices is an operational matter which relates to the day to day administration of industrial policy and is not therefore a matter which comes within my competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of changes have already <Col N="40" /> been introduced into our industrial policy which should ensure that we create more jobs at less cost to the taxpayer.  These include the establishment of performance criteria and the linking of State aid more directly to employment and value added in the economy, a shift in State aid away from supporting fixed assets to meeting specific weaknesses in Irish industry in the areas of marketing, product development, R &amp; D and management expertise, the promotion of overseas investment that will provide greater linkages in the local economy and finally a more rationalised structure in which the various promotional agencies operate.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister said in reply to a previous question that the number of job opportunities arising from the IDA has been declining, and that earlier in the year he said the pipeline was getting dry, does he consider it to be a wise move to ask this organisation to cut 100 jobs at a time when he and his Government are claiming that they will increase job numbers? They set what I consider to be very ambitious targets for the next number of years.  I believe they will have great difficulty in realising those targets.  In view of this, how can the Minister justify an organisation, which I believe he respects and which I know have done a very good job down the years, cutting back their numbers at a time when we need them so badly to increase job opportunities? Despite all the Minister has said in his reply, how can he justify cutting back on these job numbers when these are the people who are in charge of attracting jobs into this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the IDA, as a semi-State agency, can be no exception to the treatment dished out to every other agency.  Second, I am not satisfied with the job ratio in the IDA at home to those employed in their offices around the world.  Third, I am not satisfied that any agency should be immune from restructuring at a time when money must be saved.  I am satisfied that there is fat in <Col N="41" /> every organisation and it is my responsibility on behalf of the Government to rout out that fat.  That does not suggest that the effectiveness of the IDA will be diminished in any way.  In fact, they can be a more effective and efficient organisation at the end of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, to welcome the Prime Minister of Australia, the Honourable Robert J. L. Hawke, M.P., to Ireland and to mark his visit in a signal manner, the Prime Minister be invited to address the Dáil at its meeting of Wednesday, 21 October, 1987; that the proceedings on that day commence with a speech by the Ceann Comhairle welcoming the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's address and an expression of thanks by the Ceann Comhairle for the address; and that the sitting be thereupon suspended until 2.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visit to Ireland by Prime Minister Hawke in his capacity as Head of the Australian Government will be the first official visit to our shores by an Australian Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister will be warmly welcomed in Ireland and <Col N="238" /> it is right that he should be afforded the courtesies appropriate to his position and to the relationship between our two countries. The links between Ireland and Australia go back to the foundation of that great nation.  I am happy to say that these links, based on personal associations, historic bonds and shared values have been complemented in recent years by an increase in contacts at State and Government level.  President Hillery was received with the greatest courtesy and warmth when he visited Australia in 1985, the first visit by an Irish Head of State.  Over the past few years many Australian Ministers have visited Ireland including the Foreign Minister, Mr. Bill Hayden, who came here last May.  An official visit by the Australian Head of Government is, therefore, both welcome and appropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate that Prime Minister Hawke is able to accept our invitation just a few months before the beginning of the Australian bicentennial celebrations.  Next year will be a year of great retrospection and celebration for Australia, that vast island continent which has developed over the past two centuries into the modern, prosperous and progressive nation it is today.  The Government are grateful for the invitation from the Australian Government to participate in these celebrations. Ireland wishes to honour Australia; we also wish to recall and pay a tribute to the massive contribution that Irish men and women have made to Australian life and achievement.  Three out of eight Australians today are of Irish origin or descent.  Of the eight Australian Prime Ministers who held office between 1929 and 1949 six were of Irish descent.  That makes Australia a very Irish country indeed.</P>
    <P>Of all the Irish communities around the world none is more readily identifiable, more vibrant or of greater importance in the land of their adoption that the Irish in Australia.  They are far away; they have been fully integrated into Australian life but they are still bound to us by close and enduring ties.  The visit of the Prime Minister provides us with an opportunity <Col N="239" /> to expand and deepen our links with this splendid community of the Irish overseas and express our pride in their pre-eminence.</P>
    <P>As an expression of our great goodwill towards Australia the Irish Australian Bicentennial Committee, under the chairmanship of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, have prepared a programme of events to mark the year. Principal among those is the gift of a microfilm copy of the 40,000 Irish convict records in the State Paper Office which we will present to Australia, where the people's interest in their heritage and past is growing.  The committee will also send a rich exhibition of our gold and silver treasures from the National Museum, to demonstrate the ancient and highly developed civilisation that is part of the Australian heritage as well as ours.</P>
    <P>I know that the Prime Minister's visit will heighten awareness here at home of the Irish contribution to Australian life. It will also focus Australian attention on Ireland.  Until now only a very small percentage of the many Australian tourists who arrive in Europe each year come to Ireland.  We plan to increase that number.  We must also expand our business links with Australia and seek to promote more Australian investment here. The increase in recent years in the number of emigrants, many of them from the young skilled sector to Australia represents a great national loss.  Our regret is mollified, however, by the knowledge that the modern multicultural society of Australia is a good place for the Irish, and offers them the prospect of a rewarding and satisfactory future.</P>
    <P>The visit of Prime Minister Hawke to us is an honour.  We see it as a further event in a story which stretches over two centuries, a story full of sadness and deprivation but a story too of great achievement, of heroism and the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.  The visit will further improve relations between our two countries and bring us closer together, two friendly nations who, in this troubled world, trust and respect each other.</P>

      <P>I am happy to agree with the Taoiseach's motion that we should invite Prime Minister Hawke to address the Dáil, that we should honour him in that way on his visit here and that we should have the opportunity of hearing from him.  As the Taoiseach has pointed out, there is a long history of ties of many different kinds between our two countries, some of them painful, some of them stories of deprivation, others, and the more modern ones I am happy to say, far more fruitful and far more beneficial.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see from what the Taoiseach has said that further progress has been made in relation to the transfer of records, as the Taoiseach mentioned, both on microfilm and in computerised form, and of papers.  It is something which we can contribute to the record of the links between our two countries and I am very happy that we can do that.  As the House will remember, there have been other occasions when we have been in a position to transfer other objects with different associations to parts of Australia where again, perhaps we could safely say both countries benefited from the transfer.</P>
      <P>The links that we have with Australia are not just historic and neither are our modern links simply commercial.  Some of my colleagues have had the opportunity of visiting Australia and of meeting members of the Federal and the State Governments there at various times in the past few years and we have always found those contacts to be stimulating and informative and I hope that will continue. Australia, and the Irish community in Australia, are now at the point where there is a very noticeable enrichment of our own traditional culture from people in Australia who participate in it and this might be an occasion when we could mark that fact and note that it adds something to the richness and tradition of our own culture.  For those reasons it is entirely appropriate that we should honour Prime Minister Hawke in this way.</P>

We recall, as was emphasised by the Taoiseach, the contribution of the Irish in Australia to the building of the nation.  We must emphasise the leading role they have played in the building of socialism and the labour movement in Australia and, in particular, the great Peter Lalor of Eureka Stockade fame, the brother of our own James Fintan Lalor, the rural socialist of the 19th century.  We extend a very warm welcome to Prime Minister Hawke.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We started debating these amendments in June last when we spent <Col N="242" /> about an hour debating Committee Stage of the Bill.  On that occasion we had what I would describe as a constructive debate to the extent that we discussed some of the issues involved in these amendments. Considering the time that has elapsed since we commenced this debate we should remind ourselves what the amendments relate to.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to place all children in a position of legal equality.  The intention of the Bill as I see it, and as I think it is understood on all sides of this House, is to ensure that existing discriminations that apply with regard to children born outside marriage are effectively abolished, and that all children, no matter what the circumstances of their birth, are placed in a position of legal equality <i>vis-à-vis</i> their parental relationships.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill, to which the proposed amendment relates, provides for the manner in which relationships are to be deduced between children and their parents.  To paraphrase, the effect of the section is that in the event of a child being born, the question of whether the child is born to a couple who are married or who are not married to each other should not in a sense determine the relationships of that child for legal purposes betwixt and between its parents and other relations.  Put simply, a child born outside marriage is put into a similar position to that of a child born in marriage for the purpose of deducing relationships.  That section also seeks to provide for the adopted child to ensure that where a child is adopted by a couple he or she will for all purposes be deemed from the date of the adoption to be the child of the adopters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until recently in this country a couple who were unable of themselves to conceive a child could resort to adoption and adopt a child pursuant to our Adoption Acts by way of an adoption order made by the Adoption Board.  In effect the children who were adopted were nearly always born outside marriage.  Although the number of children born outside marriage has increased dramatically &mdash; they now constitute 10 per cent of the total <Col N="243" /> number of children born in this country &mdash; the number of children available for adoption has reduced dramatically.  The total adoption orders made in 1986 when compared to 1977 shows a reduction of 35 per cent.  In 1977, 1,296 adoption orders were made and only 831 in 1986.</P>
    <P>Until the start of the eighties practically all the adoption orders made were in respect of childless couples or couples who had a child or children and who were married and wished to have more children and could not do so.  Therefore, it can be assumed that out of the 1,296 children adopted in 1977 in the region of 1,200 adoption orders were made in respect of childless married couples.  In the statistics for 1986, whereas there was a 35 per cent drop in the total number of adoption orders, there was over a 50 per cent reduction in the number of adoption orders made in respect of married couples. In 1986 the total number of adoptions in respect of couples who were unrelated to the child was in the region of 600.  The reason is that more mothers were retaining their children and about 200 adoption orders a year are now being made in favour of relatives of the child, a large proportion of those being adoption orders made where a mother has retained custody of her child, marries subsequently a person who is not the father of that child and both jointly adopt.  In a nutshell, far fewer children are available nowadays for adoption to Irish couples who cannot have children of their own than in the past.</P>
    <P>Experiences in Ireland in this area are mirrored by experiences in other countries. Medical techniques are now available which provide alternative means whereby couples who cannot have children through normal or ordinary sexual intercourse can conceive and have children born to them.  Artificial insemination has been in use in this country for some time now and has been availed of by couples in circumstances in which the husband through the use of AI causes his wife to be pregnant.  In those circumstances when a child is born as a result of the use of AI by a husband's <Col N="244" /> semen to his wife a child born to a couple under the Status of Children Bill will be in the same legal relationship to his parents as any other child.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have tabled is designed to deal with another area.  In some circumstances the AID is being used where donor semen is used and where a husband is not the donor of the semen which ultimately results in his wife becoming pregnant and giving birth to a child.  This technique is available in this country today to Irish couples who wish to have children and who have been unable to do so without the use of such a technique.  It has been available here for some years now and can be availed of by married couples living in this country or outside Ireland if they do not want to avail of it within Ireland.</P>
    <P>Not generally realised at the moment is the fact that if a couple have a child by the use of AID, even where the husband wishes such child to be born as happens in practice, co-operates fully and assists his wife and where it is a joint family decision that a child be conceived in this way, currently under our law that child is illegitimate and has not a legal relationship to the husband.  Under our law currently that child in real terms does not have inheritance rights in the husband. That child suffers all the legal disabilities the child born outside marriage currently has and will have until the Status of Children Bill becomes law.  A number of other countries have faced up to this issue.  It involves this House in no question of any nature of moral issues.  It does not mean that this House has to say that we either approve or disapprove of the use of AID as a technique.  This House should acknowledge the social reality that AID is being used by childless couples in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with a measure of this nature we owe a duty to those couples to ensure that their child is in the same position of legal equality as any other child would be who was born to a married couple.  It would be ironic if in this Bill we extended rights to children in adoption &mdash; as we should do &mdash; while depriving children born as a result of the <Col N="245" /> use of AID of the same rights.  That is an inexplicable approach.  Such children are being born and the number of children being made available for adoption and being adopted is declining.  I predict that when next year's report is published by the Adoption Board, from which I have quoted statistics, it is probable that less than 800 adoption orders will be made by that board.</P>
    <P>As the numbers of children available for adoption decrease, the numbers of children that will be born as a result of artificial insemination, whether or not the husband is the donor, will increase.  This Bill affords this House an opportunity to place children born as a result of the use of this technique in a position of legal equality.  When speaking in this House on 25 June I said that the simple question that arises here is, if a couple themselves cannot conceive and if they can, as they are free to do within our law, resort to AID in order for the wife to conceive and give birth to a child, that both the husband and wife wish to have as part of their family, if there is any valid reason for suggesting that child should in some way be treated differently, should be kept legally apart from the family, should be the subject of a discrimination and placed in a sort of legal limbo, while we choose to ignore its existence.  The Minister in his response referred to all the different complex issues that arise as to the various medical techniques that can be used for the conception of children and which have been developing in recent years. There are a number of techniques which can currently be used, some of which are very controversial.  I am not dealing with some of these areas.  I am dealing with a practical reality currently in Ireland.  I am dealing with an issue to which this House should respond.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he would welcome discussion on the issue and suggested that it was very controversial.  In making that comment, the Minister indicated that he would oppose this amendment. It should be brought to his attention that although he thinks this is a very controversial issue, in the context of this amendment to this Bill, it is not <Col N="246" /> perceived as such outside this House.  The debate we had on this issue on 25 June got considerable publicity as did the fact that the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats all indicated their support for this proposal. Despite that publicity, there has been no row.  I have not been inundated with correspondence indicating massive disagreement with this proposal.  In fact I have not received a single letter about it from anyone opposing it.  I urge the Minister to adopt a constructive approach.  Perhaps during the summer months, the Minister has had an opportunity to get advice on this issue.  I appreciate that before we adjourned for the summer the Minister did not have a great deal of time to consider this amendment but he should now adopt the same constructive approach to this Bill as was adopted when it was in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was in the Seanad, extensive amendments were made to it. They were accepted by the Government of the day because this is a complicated technical measure and it is important to get it right.  There was no loss of political face on the part of the former Minister in accepting amendments and in tabling her own amendments because of the debate in this House.  The Minister should now agree that this is not a matter of major controversy, that it is not a matter of kicking the political football around.  I am not making a party political point out of this issue.  There is not one to be made out of it and there in no suggestion that any such issue could arise. Will the Minister accept the amendment as tabled?  This amendment is designed to put the legislation on a par with similar legislation in other jurisdictions.  All it will do is ensure that we will not leave a small minority of children for the foreseeable future in a legal limbo.  These are the forgotten children of the Status of Children Bill, the children for whom we were unprepared to provide legal equality, the children who for some undefined political reason, we thought we had to ignore.  Will the Minister accept this as a constructive amendment to improve a Bill that has been greatly improved <Col N="247" /> during its passage through the House and which is a somewhat different Bill from that which originally came before the Seanad.  This is to meet a very real problem which is not currently a very great problem although there will be an increasing number of children for whom this provision can promptly provide.  I hope this amendment will have the Minister's support as I know it has the support of the other parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to come in here because, regrettably Deputy Shatter did not consult with me in advance of his offering on the amendment.  Our position is not as he represented it.  Certainly, the issue of artificial insemination is one that this House will have to address in time but we should consider it in the light of all the facts and in the context of comprehensive legislation to address it.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not realistically address any of the problems that might in time be presented and for that reason The Workers' Party will not support Deputy Shatter in this amendment.  The Bill has had a long and tortuous passage through both Houses so far and it should not be delayed in its final Stages.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that this Bill has been remarkably improved by both sides of the House.  The Bill started out from Deputy Shatter's party.  The issues of artificial insemination, third party donor and so on were as alive then as they are now but the proposers did not seek to deal with this issue on the inception of the Bill.  It is now somewhat late for any member of Fine Gael to say that this is the time to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also query the proposition that the current state of the law is one in which a child born of a third party donor would be considered illegitimate by our courts. I am not convinced of that.  There has not been a judicial pronouncement to that effect and it will ultimately be a matter for the courts.  The issue will arise as to how for example a process that is surrounded by confidentiality can ever give rise to subsequent proof for litigation as <Col N="248" /> to the source of the third party donation in the instance of artificial insemination. The position, as I understand it, is that issue borne of a valid marriage carries with it a very strong presumption of legitimacy and that is the first principle that we should always seek to safeguard.  The amendment suggests the introduction of an area of litigation in family law based on the absence or otherwise of consent of the other party to the marriage.  That opens up a minefield of litigation.  We have seen that whole area very hurtfully and dangerously opened up in adoption and the process leading to adoption particularly in the context of single mothers and the issue of the absence or presence of consent at the relevant times and the very heart rending consequences for children having to be returned out of a very settled family situation to a parent who perhaps on second or third thoughts sought to recover the child.</P>
    <P>I am not at all happy with the proposal as it stands.  It is beginning to cloud many of the issues that the Bill is fundamentally designed to address. Clearly, in time, the House will have to address this whole issue of third party donation and artificial insemination generally.  It should not be considered in the context of this amendment and for that reason we will not support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as I mentioned earlier in the debate before the Summer Recess, I am opposed to this amendment but this is not on a matter of principle but because it brings up the whole issue of human artificial fertilisation and this Bill is not the place to deal with that subject.  This is a very complex matter which would require to be considered separately on its own merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any legislation on this subject would involve recognition of the medical procedures involved and would, of necessity, have to deal with questions of regulating the agencies concerned and prescribing the circumstances and conditions under which the procedures could be carried out.  In addition to artificial insemination by a donor which is the only procedure <Col N="249" /> covered by the present amendment, it would be necessary to cater for other analogous procedures such as ovum donation and embryo transfer.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that such legislation would raise fundamental legal, medical, moral and ethical issues, and would also be a matter of conscience and deeply felt religious belief for a substantial proportion of the public at large.  In these circumstances it would be essential that any proposals for legislation should be the subject of wide-ranging consultation with the Churches and other religious groups, and also with the legal and medical professions, interest groups concerned with family matters and the public generally.</P>
    <P>There has, in fact, been no consultation on the subject of AID in the context of the Bill now before us.  I referred in the earlier debate to the attitude of the previous Government who accepted that the question of AID children should be considered separately from this Bill.  That was the attitude of the previous Government. This matter was, accordingly, not mentioned in the consultation document on the Bill published in May 1985.  This approach was in line with the approach taken by the Law Reform Commission. In their report on illegitimacy at paragraph 387 the Commission concluded:</P>
    <P>The subject of artificial insemination by a donor raises important moral and social issues that are more properly matters for determination by the legislature.</P>
    <P>... The question of general social policy towards A.I.D. appears to us to be outside our remit.</P>
    <P>The Commission went on to say at paragraph 389:</P>
    <P>The Commission does not consider that that part of the subject of A.I.D. that is directly affected by the proposals concerning illegitimacy should be dealt with.  The Commission could, for example, recommend that, where a husband consented to A.I.D., he should be regarded as the father of the child.  But any such recommendation <Col N="250" /> requires that all aspects of A.I.D. be examined, including such fundamental questions as the following: Should falsification of the register of births by persons resorting to A.I.D. cease to be criminal?  Should A.I.D. when practised by a woman without her husband's consent be a ground for legal separation (divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>)? If so, does such conduct fall within the existing ground of adultery or cruelty, or should a new ground be created?  If A.I.D. is performed on an unmarried woman, who should be regarded as having legal parental rights in respect of the child?</P>
    <P>390.  Some of the problems concerning A.I.D. especially where the woman is not married, raise questions concerning paternal relationship that are clearly related to those that arise where the mother is married.  It can be argued that a man with whom the mother is cohabiting should not be denied the legal status of &ldquo;father&rdquo; merely because he is not married to the mother.  To answer one or two questions without formulating a general policy on the subject of A.I.D. would, in the Commission's view, be likely in the long run to create further difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the attitude of the present Government on this matter in no way differs from that of the previous administration.  Furthermore, I am convinced that this is the proper and responsible way to deal with such a serious matter.</P>
    <P>An undesirable aspect of the amendment is that it amounts to providing by statute for the falsification of the births register, since it would require a man other than the child's biological father to be registered as father.</P>
    <P>Also, as presently drafted, the amendment could produce an undesirable result clearly not intended by the proposer.  It could be read as meaning that where two couples had concluded a surrogacy agreement under which the wife of one couple underwent AID treatment, with the husband of the second couple as donor, the first husband would have full parental rights over the resulting child.  This would <Col N="251" /> be the direct opposite of the result intended by the surrogacy agreement.</P>
    <P>There is certainly faulty drafting in the amendment and I mention these matters only to give an indication of the complexity of this whole question.  I do not wish to be taken as being unsympathetic to the position of the children born in consequence of these relatively recent scientific developments.  On the contrary, it is out of consideration for their difficult position that I feel very strongly that this whole matter calls for the most careful and sympathetic consideration.  I would suggest, moreover, that there must be very few such children in this country at present and that the problem of their legal status is not of such pressing urgency that it requires to be dealt with in some way, however inadequate, in the present Bill.  I need hardly remind the Deputy and the House that one solution to the problem lies in the couple concerned adopting the child, although I can understand that couples in that situation might be reluctant to undergo some of the procedures associated with adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished at the attitude of Deputy McCartan.  I do not know whether his approach results from a fear of the Government losing a vote on the issue and the implications of a political nature that could derive from that, because I was very careful to say, in my opening remarks, that the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats and the Workers' Party supported this measure and not refer to any other Deputy who might be of an independent position who might also support it but who has not yet gone on the record of the House on that issue.  The Workers' Party, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats, on the record of this House, supported this measure on 25 June last. Deputy McCartan may be unaware of the fact that his colleague, Deputy De Rossa, spoke on that occasion and I quote from column 3706 in the Committee Stage debate of the Dáil Report on 25 June: Deputy De Rossa said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> I, too, support the amendments ... and I am surprised and disappointed at the Minister's dismissal of them.  He indicated that there are serious problems in relation to them but he has not outlined those problems. Amendment No. 3 very clearly states that where the husband was not a party to the agreement to have the insemination technique used, this would not apply where this is shown to be the case in court.  There seems to be no valid objection to moving in the direction which is being proposed here.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy De Rossa and Deputy McCartan have talked to each other about what their party view is on this issue.  I am very disappointed, first with the approach of The Workers' Party. It is a party that presents itself as being in the forefront, committed to issues of social reform.  They are doing a spectacular U turn on what, in political terms is a minor issue but which is of great importance to a small number of children. It is very hard to understand how one Deputy in a party that has three Deputies could on 25 June express such enthusiastic support for a measure and have a colleague come in later to say that their party are opposing it.  The Workers' Party will have to work that out for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is opposing this because he feels it is a new area and he does not think that what I am saying is necessarily correct.  The current legal position is that if a child is born to a couple as a result of artificial insemination by donor the child is illegitimate. The presumption of legitimacy may apply and, currently, that presumption has to be dispelled beyond reasonable doubt but in so far as these presumptions have any relevance the difficulty in dispelling that presumption will be considerably reduced by the Bill.  The way this can arise is where a couple who have given birth to a child subsequently have a child by artificial insemination by donor. Should the husband die a claim may follow about inheritance rights.  If the first child knows that the second child was <Col N="253" /> conceived in the way I have outlined the child's mother may be put in the witness box in court and asked how her second child was conceived.  If she says, &ldquo;actually, we used AID&rdquo;, the child conceived in that way, according to the Bill before us, will not have the same inheritance rights to the deceased husband as the first child.  I accept, as the Minister has said, that the problem applies to a small number of children in Ireland although we do not know how many children have been conceived in those circumstances. The Minister was correct in stating that all the areas have complications but they have no relationship to this amendment. The amendment cannot have any impact other than one where a husband and wife agree to use AID for the conception of a child.  The only effect of the amendment will be to ensure that the child has equal rights to the husband who subsequently acts as father, and to the wife.  It can have no other implications of any nature.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted from the report of the Law Reform Commission, a group who avoided dealing with this issue because they put it in the context of a variety of other legal complications which have no relevance to the amendment.  It is not of great relevance to the amendment whether a woman who uses AID without telling her husband can be alleged to have committed adultery.  The amendment is not about the husband and the wife other than ensuring a procedure is used by agreement but it is about the child that is born as a result of the use of a technique. The Law Reform Commission stated at paragraph 383 that if the legal concept of illegitimacy were to be abolished this would have important implications in respect of artificial insemination.  The commission went on to duck dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>If we do not deal with this issue at this stage within the narrow area I am suggesting the matter will not be dealt with here for decades.  This is the first time since 1930 that we are dealing in a statutory way with the position of children born outside marriage.  We have returned to it 57 years after the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, <Col N="254" /> 1930, was passed.  The House will not confront for at least 20 years any of the complex medical issues that the Minister has referred to, issues that fall outside this one confined area I am dealing with. We are not very good here at facing up to issues of this nature.  Clearly the Minister does not fully understand the reason and the rationale for tabling this amendment. He told us that this applies to a small number of children and I agree with him, but he went on to say that people do not have to use this technique, that they can adopt children.  He accepted that they may not want to adopt.  The point I was making earlier was that there are 50 per cent fewer adoption orders being made in 1987 than were being made in 1977 in respect of married couples.  The Minister may not be aware that a large number of the adoption societies here have closed their doors to new applicants for adoption because they have got too many people whom they have assessed as suitable for adoption on their books and for whom there are no children available.</P>
    <P>Adoption is ceasing to be an option and that option will continue to reduce in the coming years.  While we have at present a small number of children who fall into this area in my view the numbers will increase.  The amendment seeks to ensure that those children are treated in a position of equality.  There is no point in abolishing the status of illegitimacy for one group of children and allowing a new group to retain that status and to be in a legally inferior position.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why that is necessary. All the other issues that need to be confronted can be faced on another occasion although I anticipate it will not be in the lifetime of this or the next Dáil. There is no reason why we cannot, within the narrow confines of the amendment, confront the position of this small group of children who are involved.  The amendment does not have anything to do with embryo transfer, that is another issue. The amendment does not have anything to do with surrogate motherhood.  It does not seek to make any provision for or say anything about surrogate motherhood. Those issues may arise on another <Col N="255" /> occasion.  There is a need to see the amendment within the narrow context that it tries to provide for.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that out of his consideration for children born as a result of new medical techniques he is opposing the amendment but I suggest that if the Minister wishes to consider children being born as a result of this technique the only logical thing to do is to support the amendment.  If we do not support the amendment we are saying to these children that we do not recognise their existence, that we are going to regard them as legally inferior and that, because the number of related medical techniques are terribly complicated, we are not going to direct our minds to dealing with their problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to falsification of the birth register but nobody has mentioned the falsification of registers. We are talking about the position of children born to a couple in circumstances where the couple are married, where the husband has consented to a new technique being used for conception and where the husband, and the wife, want to act as mother and father to the children born to them and do not wish their children to be in a position of legal inferiority.  Are we going to create the absurd position that can pertain in certain circumstances at present in which a couple who use this technique to have a child can make application to the Adoption Board to get an adoption order in their favour in respect of a child born to them as a result of the AID technique?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is saying that enacting this provision into our law will in some way disturb the legal framework in a way that will be detrimental to children, I must point out that there is nothing to stop any couple trying to regularise the legal position in that way.  If a husband is concerned that he may not have a legal relationship with a child born as a result of AID the couple can apply to the Adoption Board for an adoption order. The couple will then be in a position of legal equality.  At present our law is in that absurd position.  One of the reasons for <Col N="256" /> enacting the Status of Children Bill is to place children in a position of legal equality but another reason is to stop the situation where mothers felt they should apply to the Adoption Board to adopt their own children so that they would be in a position of legal equality with other children in their relationship with them. At present a number of unmarried mothers annually apply to the Adoption Board for adoption orders in respect of their own children.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to put children born as a result of AID in a position of legal equality.  It is designed to cut out the necessity for the sort of nonsensical approach that I can see being adopted in the future where children so born will find themselves the subject of adoption applications which will have to be processed by our Adoption Board.  That is reducing the law to absurdity.  It is another Irish solution to an Irish problem. We are unique in the way in which we find such solutions.  The Minister is saying that because related areas are very complicated we should now pretend that this is not an area that should be confronted, that we should currently take the view that there are so few such children being born here that we should not deal at all with the matter and should consign these children to a future legal limbo.  I am very disappointed that this is a matter upon which we shall have to call a division.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that Deputy McCartan should express the views that he has expressed, although I appreciate that he may not be all that expert in this area.  I would have hoped, when his colleague, Deputy De Rossa, had indicated that his party were giving support to this measure, that Deputy McCartan would have given similar support.  I would have hoped that instead of talking about divisions we would be doing what this House should be able to do, which is to constructively debate legislation and ultimately, across the floor of the House, agree amendments rather than try to find spurious reasons for opposing them.  The Government always have to find a spurious reason for opposing Opposition <Col N="257" /> amendments.  All the objections made to this amendment by the Minister are spurious in the extreme.  To reject this amendment is to reject the right of children born as a result of AID to be put in a position of legal equality with all other children conceived in the usual and natural way by married couples.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into a cross-fire with Deputy Shatter on his perception of our spurious reasons for not supporting him.  It is no job for myself or The Workers' Party to help him to do the job that he should have done three years ago when his own Government introduced this legislation.  They did not seek at that stage, despite the benefit of the Law Reform Commission on which the Deputy so heavily draws, to address this whole problem.  My remarks have been distorted on this.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to learn that there has been a change of decision on this amendment on the part of The Workers' Party, which amendment the Labour Party had indicated on the last occasion before the summer recess that they would be supporting.  Our opinion on it has not changed over the summer recess.  We said then that we were supporting this reasonable, fair and proper amendment and we stand by that decision.  We are not changing our position on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> As has been said, the number of couples that would be involved is very, very small.  It is sad when a young couple find when they want to have a child or children that they cannot do so.  The opportunity presents itself on this occasion for helping such people.  Deputy McCartan may hope that the opportunity may arise in some more detail at some future date, perhaps it will and perhaps not.  It is here before us and we have to meet it.  If we can help a family who find themselves in that unfortunate human situation we must help them, unless in doing so it would in some way harm or affect somebody else.  If it were shown to me that the provisions of this amendment would cause harm or hurt to some other party or parties, then certainly my party would have to look at the matter again.</P>
    <P>Here is a very human proposal.  A family who want a child succeed in having one, with the consent of both spouses, by using the AID procedure, this child is wanted and happily accepted.  Can somebody explain why we must put a legal bar in the way of that situation?  Who will benefit, who is this designed to help?  I presume that we come here to try to help the people who are affected by unfortunate situations.  Can the Minister or Deputy McCartan or anybody else tell me who would be helped if we refuse to recognise the husband, wife and child as a family unit?  Who would refuse that couple the right to call the child their own?</P>

      <P>The Minister says that it is not.  The purport of the amendment is to make those three people into a family, to recognise them as a family unit without the necessity for an adoption procedure. That would cause joy and happiness to the very small number of families involved here.  It would give them great satisfaction to know that the law recognises them as a family unit, the same as any other family unit.  It is not really the business of anybody else and will not cause harm, hurt, or upset to anybody else.  Why cannot we, for once, do that <Col N="259" /> for them, giving them our imprimatur? Why do we have to devise spurious reasons for refusing?  Why put that couple through adoption procedures, with consequent expense?  We would put them through that trauma for what purpose? Here is a child who is cherished from the first months of its existence and we are enforcing adoption.  I am astounded at this about-turn.  I had hoped that this very human amendment would have been adopted by Dáil Éireann.  I still hope it will be.  I beseech Deputy McCartan to have a rethink.  It is a very sensible and limited amendment.</P>

      <P>I have to keep reminding myself that at long last we are on the Committee Stage of the Status of Children Bill.  This Bill was treated with constructive compassion during its passage through the Seanad where amendments were accepted regardless of which party had introduced them.  Despite the long delay in the passage of the Bill, a delay which we all deplore, the Bill continues to condemn and to exclude a certain group of children in our society.  Now, on the Committee Stage we are inserting another exclusion order.  We are now going to widen the list to include children whom we have up to now castigated, reduced to second class citizens and denied equal rights.  By not accepting this amendment a number of children will continue to be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the status of children, <Col N="260" /> children born of woman and we would hope, as Deputy Taylor said, with love, and wanted.  Enough children are born into this world without that advantage.  It amazes me that we as legislators, can sit here this afternoon and bring up arguments as to why we should continue to exclude any children, but particularly those born disadvantaged. Who makes the law?  It is our responsibility to do so.  The Minister in reply to Deputy Shatter said he could not accept this amendment, an amendment which is logical and, above all else, just.  The Minister cannot accept the amendment because he has not had consultations with the churches, the medical profession or the vox pop.  We have a responsibility, which was carried out so well in the Seanad, to introduce the best possible legislation.</P>
    <P>I am both amazed and disappointed that Deputy McCartan suggests that a future debate on the ethics of genetics which all of us in this House understand has to be debated carefully, cautiously and conscientiously, should prohibit us from inserting a just clause for all our children in this Bill.  I would like to question both Deputy McCartan and the Minister as to whether they are serious in putting up the boundaries they have put up today.  The first boundary, the one that Deputies Taylor and Shatter and myself have already spoken about, is in relation to excluding still further a group of children in our society.  The other boundary I see appalls me.  It would seem, and this has come through from Deputy McCartan's remarks, that because Fine Gael introduced a Bill three years ago which did not contain this amendment it is not acceptable now.</P>

      <P>I am sometimes weary of the length of time it takes to go through the various stages of a Bill but at least <Col N="261" /> I recognise that what can emerge is a consensus and sometimes an amendment is accepted on Committee Stage which improves a Bill.  I would ask Deputy McCartan to recognise that one of the reasons we have so many stages in our legislation and why we go through them so cautiously, and so slowly at times, can be seen clearly in this debate today.  The Committee Stage of a Bill is the most important Stage as areas that may not have been drafted properly are open for debate and, one would hope for agreement.</P>
      <P>There are two depressing aspects to this debate.  The first relates to the treatment of our children and the second relates to the lack of agreement and constructiveness not alone in this debate but in so many other debates and particularly from a party from whom I would not expect it.  Even at this late stage I ask Deputy McCartan to try to recognise what this amendment seeks to do and not to put off forever legislation just because consultations have not been held with everybody outside of this House.  It is our responsibility to introduce the best legislation possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House because I made both my position and that of my party clear before the summer and, unlike others, I have not changed mine. I am surprised by the views expressed by Deputy McCartan.  Perhaps, it has something to do with the personality of the person moving the amendment.  The last time we introduced a Bill regarding children one of the Deputies of The Workers' Party was absent and, unfortunately, as a result we did not get that Bill through either.  Deputy McCartan's comments were to the effect that we need more time to discuss this, that and the other.  Such comments have been used in this House for years to delay progress on Bills, be they in relation to children, divorce or any other aspect of social policy.  Bills have been delayed and put on the long finger both in this House and in the Seanad because politicians, particularly Ministers, always tell us that we need more time to consult with the <Col N="262" /> churches, the medical profession and various other groups.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barnes has said, this Bill deals with the status of children.  It is great that after a long time we have a Bill in this House which is capable of receiving support from all parties and which seems to remove the shameful tag of illegitimacy which has attached to so many children for far too long.  I am delighted that the forces which tried to prevent progressive legislation in this area were no longer able to do so but it is disappointing that a category of children, albeit very few children, born as a result of artificial insemination by donor should be excluded and that we should leave any doubt as to our intentions in this House to treat all children equally and to give them equal legal status.  We are missing a golden opportunity because there is a sufficient number of Deputies in this House who do not belong to the Government party and who can have this amendment passed if they all stay together just as they did before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>We have now debated this amendment in so far as we can take it.  There is no point in my reiterating my disappointment with the Minister.  I would hope that whether this amendment is won or lost, the Minister would look in a constructive way at the amendments which have been tabled from all sides with regard to this Bill.  I hope that the rather foolish attitude adopted by Deputy McCartan will not permeate the rest of this debate.  It is part of the function of the Dáil, as a legislative assembly, to seek to improve measures and Bills as originally published by the Government of the day or, if it is a Private Members' Bill, as published by the Private Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not make any apologies for the fact that some of the amendments which have been tabled are amendments to a Bill which was originally tabled by my party, a party who, for some years, were committed to putting children in a position of equality.  It was always recognised that this was a difficult and complicated area and as that Bill went through the Seanad my party had the maturity to <Col N="263" /> accept amendments proposed by other people and to table some amendments themselves so as to improve the measure. That is what we are about in this House today.  We are about ensuring that aspects relating to putting children in a position of equality, in so far as some aspects may have been overlooked at the drafting stage or in the teasing out of the Bill, are catered for.</P>
    <P>I assume that Deputy McCartan is serious in some of the amendments he has proposed to this measure though it emerged in the debate in this Chamber on 25 June that The Workers' Party had effectively copied some of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage in the Seanad without realising that some of them had been accepted on Report Stage in the Seanad.  If Deputy McCartan has any comment to make about sloppy thinking or preparations on the part of any party in this House in relation to this Bill he is on a very sticky wicket having regard to the rather peculiar approach of his party some months ago in tabling amendments, some of which had already been dealt with on Report Stage in the Seanad by cogging them from the Committee Stage proposals.</P>
    <P>Squabbling between parties in this House as to who is more committed to given Bills has no real relevance as far as the general public are concerned.  Deputy Barnes is right; this Bill is about children being put into a position of legal equality. I can see no rational reason for regarding some children as less equal than others. <Col N="264" /> This amendment seeks to ensure that the intent of this Bill extends to some children, the forgotten children of this Bill when first published, but to whom my party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats, and I believe some Independent Members of this House, would like to see the provisions of this Bill extend and wishes to see those children have the same legal equality in their relationship with and to the people who are their real parents, the husband and wife, who will be their father and mother. The position of the father should be recognised just as should be the legal entitlement of such children to be treated as equal to all other children.</P>
    <P>I would still hope at this late stage that The Workers' Party would reconsider their attitude to this amendment as we go to vote on it.  I do not expect the Minister will change his mind on it. Unfortunately, that is the type of politics with which we have to deal in this House. It is also the type of politics which results in so many people outside this House being so disillusioned with the way we perform our duties here.</P>

      <P>There are two possible situations.  In Ireland a child is adopted by the Adoption Board making an adoption order.  It is quite clear that a child in those circumstances is covered here.  The second situation relates to a couple living in Ireland who adopt a child in a foreign country such as England, South America, the Philippines or India.  The current position is that because so few children are available for adoption in Ireland, couples who do not resort to using new medical techniques for the purpose of having children adopt children outside Ireland. In this Bill it is stated that where a foreign adoption order is made, which is recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in this State, children so adopted will be in a position of equality. I am asking the Minister to clarify the current law in relation to the adoption of children outside Ireland.  If a couple <Col N="268" /> adopt a child in England, Peru, Chile, the Philippines or India, in what circumstances do we currently recognise such adoption orders?  Without knowing that, the exact effect of this section is unclear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unclear and it is a matter for the courts to decide on each case.  There is no statutory provision.  The position may not be clear in a particular case until it comes before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a reason for asking the question and, in a sense, the Minister has given the reply I expected.  Currently, there is no law in force in this country with regard to the recognition of foreign adoption orders.  The position is that in the absence of any law, our courts can develop law at some stage when an issue arises.  Different countries have different rules applying to the recognition of foreign adoption orders.  In England and in different states of the United States they also developed particular rules.  Courts uniquely developed rules relating to their own peculiar judicial perceptions but most countries take the view that legislation is needed to state the circumstances in which foreign adoption orders should be recognised.</P>
      <P>A few moments ago we decided to leave a small group of children out of the provisions of this Bill.  A large and increasing number of children will be adopted by Irish couples outside this country and a number of children who have been adopted in foreign countries by couples living in Ireland are already living here.  The adoption of those children is not recognised in Ireland unless the parents go through another form of adoption process under Irish law and for some parents that is impossible because of the circumstances of the particular child's adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no Deputy in this House in any party &mdash; I will extend it as far as the Attorney General's office &mdash; who could currently say in what circumstances our law recognises foreign adoption orders. The reality is we do not know what children will be affected by that provision.  It <Col N="269" /> is unsatisfactory that the position should remain that it is effectively left to the courts to decide the issue on the basis that no legal principles or guidelines are set by this House.  I urge the Minister, in the context of Report Stage of this Bill, or his colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, the Minister for Health, in the context of any adoption legislation he intends to bring before this House, to provide for a statutory system which lay down the basis upon which we recognise foreign adoption orders.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that we do recognise foreign adoption orders, I have tabled some amendments to the Bill in line with what the Minister is proposing here but all of these amendments have the impediment that nobody knows the circumstances under which a foreign adoption order will be recognised.  If a couple in this country went abroad and adopted a child outside Ireland, nobody can tell that couple the circumstances under which that foreign adoption order will be recognised.  This is becoming a very urgent problem at a time when there are not sufficient children available for adoption in Ireland to accommodate the numbers of couples who are seeking to adopt.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this issue in the context of Report Stage of this Bill. If it is not deemed that this is an issue that can be dealt with properly under the Status of Children Bill, it is certainly an issue that should be regarded with some considerable urgency by the Department of Health in the context of any adoption legislation they may bring forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter that the position is not clear and the reason is that there are no cases on record and each case depends on its own facts as regards whether the procedures of the foreign adoption conform to the principles of common law as determined by the courts and applied to a particular case.  I agree that statutory provision by way of an amendment would be desirable. Perhaps between now and Report Stage, I will see if it is appropriate to introduce such an amendment to this Bill <Col N="270" /> or if it would be more appropriate to the adoption laws.  I will consider the matter further before Report Stage.</P>

    <P>I was referring to this amendment a few minutes ago when I said I had tabled an amendment that relates to the problem we discussed with regard to adoption in the context of section 3.  In section 9 there is a definition of an adoption order and it seems that there is no reason, provided some clear rules are made eventually as to the recognition of foreign adoption orders, for not incorporating this amendment also.  It would in a sense co-ordinate this provision with an earlier section in the Bill and make it similar to the Guardianship of Infants Act.  I do not see any reason for not doing that.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 17 to 23, to delete the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; and substitute the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`father' includes a male adopter under an adoption order, but, subject to section 11 (4) of this Act, does not include the father of an infant who has not married that infant's mother unless either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an order under section 6A (inserted by the Act of 1987) is in force in respect of that infant, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the circumstances set out in subsection (3) of this section apply;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 8 are intended to deal with the point made in relation to subsection (3) of this section as discussed on Report Stage in the Seanad.  It was suggested that the subsection as it stands at present could be interpreted as conferring on the child of an annulled marriage a position under the Constitution which would lead to unintended anomalies because under the existing provision <Col N="273" /> the parents would be treated as if they had been married.  The intention behind the section was to ensure that where a marriage was annulled in the circumstances set out in subsection (3) the father would be the guardian of the children of the union without having to apply to a court under the proposed new section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  The matter has been examined since the debate in the Seanad and it is now agreed that the existing provision goes beyond what is required and the revised version set out in these amendments achieves the desired result and is confined to the guardianship issue.  It provides that where a marriage has been annulled in the circumstances set out in subsection (3) the father will be the guardian of the children.</P>
    <P>The justification for this provision in the Bill is that by making the father in a voidable marriage guardian after the marriage is annulled it continues the preexisting legal position, and in making the father in a void marriage guardian it will continue what will generally have been the <i>de facto</i> situation.  The father will have been regarded as and will have been acting as the guardian.  The provision applies in the case of void marriages only where the father believed that the marriage was a valid marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reason for the Minister's amendments, but I suggest that what is wrong in the context of this is the legal scheme being adopted which creates rather strange anomalies.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 7 proposes that the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; as contained in the Bill as it has come to this House should be changed and that &ldquo;father&rdquo; should be held to include</P>
      <P>a male adopter under an adoption order but subject to section 11 (4) of this Act, does not include the father of an infant who has not married that infant's mother unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an order under section 6A (inserted by the Act of 1987) is in force in respect of that infant or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> (b)  the circumstances set out in section 6B (inserted by the Act of 1987) apply or</P>
    <P>(c)  the circumstances set out in subsection (3) of this section apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In a moment I will explain the implications of this.  My amendment No. 9 proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 7, to delete lines 41 to 46, and in page 8, to delete lines 1 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a) The circumstances referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; in subsection (1) of this section are that the father and mother of the infant concerned have at some time gone through a ceremony of marriage, which ceremony was celebrated prior to or at some time during the period of 10 months before the birth of the infant and which ceremony resulted in a voidable marriage in respect of which a decree of nullity was granted after, or at some time during the period of 10 months before the birth of the infant.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then consequential amendments are proposed arising out of those amendments in the context of amendment No. 11 which proposes:</P>
    <P>In page 8, to delete lines 50 to 52, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;unless there is in force an order under section 6A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act or unless the circumstances set out in section 6B (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act apply or a guardian has otherwise been appointed in accordance with this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14 to section 12 are then interrelated.  They are:</P>
    <P>In page 9, line 2, to delete &ldquo;section&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sections&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In page 9, to delete lines 12 to 20 and substitute the following: <Col N="275" />&ldquo;(3)  Rules of Court shall provide for the procedure to be used in the making of an application under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In page 9, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;6B Where the father and the mother of an infant have not married each other and where the father is registered as the father of an infant in a register maintained under the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1987 the father shall automatically be a guardian of the infant and no application by the father to be so appointed as provided for in section 6A of this Act shall be required.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The final amendment arises after section 13 but before section 14.  It would insert a new section and would amend the Guardianship of Infants Act by providing for a section 11A.  That section would confer a jurisdiction on our courts which they have not got currently and the absence of which creates considerable difficulties, and the Minister's amendment does not deal with this at all.  This proposed amendment is to allow the courts when nullity cases are heard to decide issues relating to the support payments and guardianship and custody of children.  That new section 11A would provide:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where the High Court grants a decree of nullity in respect of a void or voidable marriage it may following the making of such decree upon the application of either party to the proceedings make a declaration of parentage with regard to any infant or infants born to the parties prior to the granting of such decree.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a declaration is made by the High Court in accordance with subsection (1) herein the High Court may, upon application being made to it, exercise the jurisdiction conferred by section 6A (inserted by the Act of 1987) of this Act and by section 11 of this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> Let me explain in non-technical terms what this is designed to do and how it differs from the Minister's proposal.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, currently sets down the circumstances in which a parent is automatically the guardian of a child, and describes the rules that apply when a custody dispute arises between parents.  It also confers a jurisdiction on the courts where a couple are joint guardians of their child, where a married couple are still married to each other and no decree of annulment has been granted, to determine custody disputes and disputes relating to the guardianship of children and allows the courts to make maintenance orders for the support of children.</P>
    <P>The Status of Children Bill in seeking to put children in a position of legal equality repeals the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, and in subsequent sections allows the courts to make orders for the maintenance of a child, be it born inside or outside marriage under the Guardianship of Infants Act and under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.</P>
    <P>The simplest area to deal with first is the nullity area, although it is the last amendment to which it is relevant.  At present if a decree of annulment is granted in our courts, be it of a void marriage or a voidable marriage, the children of the couple whose marriage has been annulled are automatically made illegitimate.  The High Court order has that effect and the children are rendered illegitimate and at the end of the granting of the decree of annulment that is the end of the High Court's involvement in the matter.  At present, having granted the decree of annulment a result of the decree is that the mother becomes the sole guardian of her child.  The second result is that the father loses his guardianship rights and if the father wishes to have access to his child, or even if it is in the interests of the child that the father have custody, the father currently has to bring a separate set of court procedures in either the District Court or the Circuit Court to have custody orders made in his favour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> If the mother wants maintenance support for the child from the father she has to bring a new set of proceedings in the District Court or the Circuit Court at present to get what is known as an affiliation order.  If the father simply wants access to the child he brings proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act in the District Court or Circuit Court.  The Minister's amendments and the earlier amendments to which I refer seek to preserve what I would describe as the parental relationship between parents and their children in certain specified circumstances where decrees of nullity are granted, but none of the Minister's amendments deals with the issue that I raise in amendment No. 15 where I seek to insert an additional section into the Guardianship of Infants Act.</P>
    <P>If we take my earlier amendments and the Minister's amendments in a simplistic way their general intent is, in certain circumstances where a decree of nullity has been granted, to preserve the parenting relationship between parents and their children.  What the Minister's amendment does not do and what the Act does not cater for is what happens when the decree of annulment is granted and there is a dispute between the parents as to who shall have custody of the children, or about visitation or access rights for the other parent or about what support payments should be made for the support of children by the financially better off parent, to the parent who has custody.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment would say in certain circumstances the husband and wife would remain joint guardians.  Once the marriage is annulled, we get over the problem of the children being retrospectively bastardised, but the problem which has not been dealt with is that once the decree of nullity is granted, the father and mother cease to live together, and the children cease to have a relationship with their parents.  As things stand, if this Bill is passed with some of the amendments the children will maintain a relationship with the parents but the High Court will still have no power by way of ancillary orders, having heard a nullity <Col N="278" /> case, to make an order as to which parent should have custody of the children, as to access rights for either the mother or the father and as to what maintenance should be paid for the children in a case where the mother has custody and is dependent.</P>
    <P>Even when this Bill is enacted it will be necessary, if the couple cannot reach agreement about those issues, for them to start off a new set of court proceedings in another court, which can only prolong the upset created by the family breakdown, add considerably to the legal costs and help to add to the couple's problem. Lawyers who specialise in family law have seen how appallingly distressing a nullity hearing is, particularly where there are young children but it is even worse to come out of it knowing that one may have got a decree of nullity but that one has to start all over again in another court.  Amendment No. 15 seeks to insert section 11 (a) in the Bill and I hope the Minister will accept it.  It would mean, having determined a nullity case, the High Court, if told that the couple did not agree as to which party should have custody, would be in a position on the basis of the welfare of the child to determine which parent should have custody, what the access arrangements should be and, where a payment should be ordered for child support, would be allowed to order that such payment be made.</P>
    <P>In this context I draw the Minister's attention to the report on nullity of marriage prepared by the Law Reform Commission which said that when granting decrees of annulment the High Court should have power to make ancillary orders with regard to child custody, guardianship issues and child support. The report also said that the High Court should have power in certain instances to make other types of financial orders, but that relates to something other than children. What I propose accords with what the Law Reform Commission said should happen in the context of granting decrees of nullity.  It also accords with what the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown recommended in their report when they said that when decrees of <Col N="279" /> annulment were granted the High Court should possess the powers to determine disputes relating to guardianship, custody and maintenance of children.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am dealing with this amendment first is that even if the Minister does not find my other amendments acceptable this amendment fits in with his amendments and with the amendments I have tabled, because there are two different schemes that could be accepted here.  In the context of the amendment I have tabled, and in the context of the amendment the Minister has tabled, circumstances can arise in which decrees of annulment will be granted where there may be a dispute as to the parentage of a child.  A dispute may arise as to whether the &ldquo;husband&rdquo; whose marriage was annulled is truly the father of the children born to the person who was his wife before the annulment was granted.  This provision allows the High Court to determine the parentage issue without having to go through another court proceeding.  As things stand the law does not deal with this.  It was not perceived in the current Bill that this area is of relevance to the status of children, to the issue of illegitimacy and to the issue of custody of children who are currently regarded as illegitimate. Will the Minister accept amendment No. 15 as it would considerably improve the law and it would accord with recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown?</P>
    <P>I will refer to the other amendments and the reasons for the differences between what I have set out and what the Minister has set out.  In section 9 there is a definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo;.  For the purpose of the Guardianship of Infants Act there is an attempt to determine in what circumstances someone would be regarded as the father of a child.  There are certain circumstances in which there may be no dispute between a couple as to who is the father of the child.  They may be living together permanently and know who the father is, but as the Bill is at present it appears to require that unless there is a <Col N="280" /> marriage or a marriage that has been declared annulled, even where a couple agree if someone who is a father wishes to be made a guardian of his child it will require some type of court procedure. That is not necessary.</P>
    <P>Where there is a dispute as to who is the father of the child, the court will have to resolve it and section 12 of the Bill which incorporates section 6 (a) provides a procedure where there is no agreement between a couple as to their being joint guardians of a child, for the court to determine whether someone should or should not be made a guardian.  Section 6 (a) as it will be incorporated in the Guardianship of Infants Act, which is section 12 of this Bill, provides that where the father and mother of an infant have not married each other, the court may on the application of the father, by order, appoint him to be a guardian.  Then it goes on to say in subsection (3) that rules of court shall provide a special procedure for determining an application where the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the father as guardian and the father is registered under the Births and Deaths Registration Act effectively as the father.  What I am proposing in the context of the new section 6 (b) which we seek to provide is that, in circumstances where the father and mother acknowledge each other's relationship to their child and where the mother agrees that someone is the father of her child by virtue of them registering the birth of the child and the father being registered as the father, instead of it requiring a court application, the father automatically is a guardian.  Where there was a contest between mother and father, the father could not be registered without court proceedings under this Bill in the context of the Registration of Births Act.  But what this Bill creates is the following situation. To step outside the legalistic complications of this, let us assume a couple have lived together for 20 years and have had four children born to them.  The father's name is included on a birth certificate. They have continued to live together.  The father and mother regard themselves as joint guardians of their children.  In order for the father to <Col N="281" /> become a guardian under the Minister's proposal, court proceedings must be brought to have the father named as father.  Under what I am proposing in those circumstances once the father is, under the Registration of Births Act, registered as the father, he automatically becomes the guardian and court proceedings are not necessary.  Under this measure, if a couple's marriage is annulled, for example, by a Church tribunal, and one party to that marriage goes through another marriage which is invalid and they have children, in order for the new couple to have the father of the children held up as a guardian of his own children, court proceedings are necessary.  In the context of the amendment that is proposed here, where there is agreement between father and mother about registration, court proceedings would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal creates an anomaly which, by incorporating the measure I am proposing also in amendment No. 15, does not have to arise.  The Minister's proposal seeks to provide that someone would be regarded as the father of the child even if there is a void marriage but if the father reasonably believed in certain circumstances that the void marriage was a valid marriage.  If there is a void marriage there is no marriage at all.  What we are doing here, to quote a constituency colleague of mine who uses the phrase regularly in this House, is slavishly following English law in using a formula that they have used in England which is just as confusing there as it will be here if we transplant it into this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If a marriage which is voidable is subsequently annulled in circumstances in which a child was born either before the decree of annulment or within a few months of it, it makes a lot of sense that the husband to that marriage should still be regarded as the father of the child. But in circumstances where a couple went through a ceremony which was not merely voidable but which was void, had no legal impact at all, it makes absolutely no sense that the position be that if the father reasonably believed the marriage <Col N="282" /> to be valid he is regarded as father but if he did not reasonably believe it to be valid he is not regarded as father.  Are we going to ask the courts, for example, at the end of nullity proceedings to decide whether it was reasonable for a particular father to have regarded his marriage as valid or not?  The validity of the marriage has no relationship, and should not have, to whether someone in that sense is held as a guardian or as a father or whatever. The amendment I have tabled seeks to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with all of this is that it is complex and involved.  I appreciate that there are aspects of this that are extremely difficult to explain.  Because we are dealing with a technical area of law it may be difficult to see the difference between what the Minister is proposing in the earlier amendments and the amendments I am proposing.  The amendments I am proposing are merely designed to ensure that there is clarity as to the circumstances in which someone is held to be the father of the child and the circumstances in which he is not and ultimately, if a decree of annulment is granted, if there is a confusion as to whether someone having had his decree of annulment granted, first is the father, second is a guardian, third should have custody or access or fourth should contribute to the support of a child that everyone has always regarded as his, that ultimately the court can deal with that without either the mother or the father being forced as some later stage to commence a whole new set of court proceedings. In a sense this is designed to maximise the rights of children and clarify their position while minimising the necessity for people to have to run to the courts.</P>

      <P>I understand we are taking a number of these amendments together.  I want to address my remarks to one in particular that is proposed by Deputy Shatter, amendment No. 14.  I rise to indicate my opposition to that proposal.  In essence what is being requested there is that if at any stage after the birth of a child the name of the father <Col N="283" /> appears on the register of births and deaths as the father he then becomes automatically the guardian.  I do not believe that that is a desirable regime.  I think that we should leave it to the whole regime as envisaged in the Act itself under section 6 (a), namely, that even in those circumstances though the father's name might appear on the register he should, nonetheless, if a dispute arises, be obliged to apply to the court for the right of guardianship.  It is based on a practical appreciation of many of the instances where very often in the immediate aftermath of the birth of a child to an unmarried couple the mother, who often is considered and no doubt is in a vulnerable and sometimes emotionally weak position, might well agree to the insistence by the natural father of the inclusion of his name on the birth certificate.  The inclusion in those circumstances of an automatic right to guardianship subsequently, <i>ad infinitum,</i> is an undesirable development and it would be far more realistic if the regime as envisaged would be applicable to those circumstances as well.</P>
      <P>I am impressed with the arguments Deputy Shatter has advanced in respect of amendment No. 15 and I support him in that but I have reservations about amendment No. 14.</P>

      <P>The alternative subsection (3) proposed by Deputy Shatter in amendment No. 9 is in my view not appropriate.  My initial reaction was that amendment No. 15, to insert a new section, 11 (A), of the Guardianship Act dealing with the High Court's functions in nullity cases was not therefore required. Subsection (3) in the Deputy's amendment differs from the Government's proposals in two important respects.  First, the alternative subsection (3) proposed makes no provision for the situation where the marriage ceremony is performed after the birth of the child to the couple.  The effect of such a postnatal ceremony of marriage on the guardianship position is clear at present and will continue unchanged after this Bill <Col N="284" /> is enacted.  The father, by marrying the mother of his child, becomes the child's joint guardian.  That being the case, I can see no good reason why there should be different treatment of the father who is regarded as guardian because he underwent a voidable marriage ceremony before the birth of his child as against one who is guardian because he underwent a voidable marriage ceremony after the birth.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Government amendment is to clarify and remove doubt as to the father's status as guardian in the wake of the annulment of a voidable marriage, but Deputy Shatter's amendment would, to my mind, leave the position inconsistent and uncertain. Leaving the question of guardianship following an annulment to be determined by the court granting the annulment has admittedly a certain attraction, but it ignores the fact that, in the case of a voidable marriage, the presumption that the marriage ceremony was valid means that, up until the annulment, the father has in fact been treated for all legal purposes, including those of the Guardianship Act, as being the mother's husband and guardian of his children. That proposal was accepted in principle by the previous Government, and is also accepted by my Government.  It will, of course, be open to a court to circumscribe the father's position as guardian in appropriate cases in the wake of an annulment, if the children's mother applies under the Guardianship Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, no provision is made in Deputy Shatter's proposed subsection (3) at amendment No. 9 for the position of a father as guardian of children of a void marriage.  This contrasts with the provision in Government amendment No. 8 which, in line with the provision in the Bill as it stands, makes certain the position of the father of children of a void marriage in circumstances where he reasonably believed at the appropriate time that the marriage ceremony was valid.  Where this is the case, then the father will have been acting as guardian; the Government's proposal will ensure that he may continue to do so, thus <Col N="285" /> guaranteeing minimum disruption to the children.  It is important to remind ourselves that, while in the case of a voidable marriage the marriage is treated in all respects as valid until it is annulled by the court, a marriage which is void <i>ab initio</i> is just that: it was never a marriage from the start and does not need a court decree to make it void.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the position of a man who goes through a ceremony of marriage with a woman whom he believes to be single or widowed, or to have been divorced by a decree obtained abroad, which he believes is recognised in this country.  They live together and have children of whom he is to all intents and purposes guardian.  If after some years he discovers that he has been duped by a bigamist, or if the woman's husband who was missing and presumed dead returns from abroad, or if he takes legal advice which shows that his earlier view of the validity of his wife's divorce was mistaken, what then?  Is he to be compelled to go to the High Court in order to obtain a decree of nullity, and then to seek a declaration that he is parent of his own children and to be appointed guardian, as would be the case under Deputy Shatter's proposal at amendment No. 15?  A decree of nullity is not necessary in such a case, since the marriage is clearly void <i>ab initio</i> and there is no need to go to the expense and trouble of High Court proceedings to get a judicial statement of the obvious. The proposal which the previous Government put forward, and which the Government amendments now before the House merely tidy up, appear to me to offer a much more satisfactory solution to this problem.  In the case that I have outlined, the father will continue in his position as guardian, secure in the knowledge that it is for those who seek to deprive him of his role as guardian to show that he did not reasonably believe at the appropriate time that the marriage was genuine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 14 would have the effect that, in the case of a child whose parents have not married each other, the father could become guardian of the child jointly with the mother by the simple expedient of having <Col N="286" /> his name entered on the births register. This proposal is totally at variance with the basic policy of the guardianship provisions of this Bill.  That policy is that, in the case of a child whose parents have not married each other, the father should not become joint guardian of the child unless that is in the child's interests.  The purpose of this policy is to safeguard the interests of the child in each case, while at the same time giving the opportunity to fathers of children born outside marriage to share the responsibility of their children's upbringing if they are willing to assume it.  Guardianship is not to be seen as some sort of reward for the father for acknowledging or being forced to acknowledge his paternity of the child.  It is not something to be thrust willy-nilly on a man merely because the fact of his parentage has been recorded on official records.  It is a complex set of responsibilities and rights in relation to a child, whose upbringing may be radically affected by it, and whose individual circumstances and interests must be taken into account, so as to ensure as far as that is possible that the effect of appointing his or her father as guardian will not affect the child's upbringing adversely.</P>
    <P>The procedure for registering a person as father of a child whose parents have not married each other will be greatly simplified after this Bill is enacted. Section 52 of the Bill provides for the possibility of a parent presenting the Registrar of Births with a court judgment naming the father as father, on which the registrar will be obliged to act.  The types of judgment which may be used for this purpose are set out in section 48 and include maintenance orders, including affiliation orders, granted before this Bill becomes law.  The production of such an order scarcely ranks as a high recommendation that the father will be a suitable guardian, when one considers the difficulties that mothers usually have to surmount in order to obtain it.  There is no doubt also that Deputy Shatter's proposal would act as a serious discouragement to unmarried mothers against identifying the father or pursuing them for maintenance.  This cannot be in <Col N="287" /> the interests of the children involved, since the benefits conferred by this Bill on children whose parents have not married each other will be largely illusory if such children are deprived of the possibility of knowing their fathers.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions that the Government amendments, Nos. 6 and 8 will lead to uncertainty in the operation of the law on guardianship.  A basic inconsistency lies at the heart of this set of amendments tabled by Deputy Shatter. On the one hand, at amendment No. 14, he would have registration of the father as such on the births register as the only qualification for the father to become guardian.  On the other hand, he is proposing in the same set of amendments, an elaborate and complicated regime for fathers of children of void and voidable marriages.  It is the usual position in the case of a void or voidable marriage that for some of the time, at least, the parties will have been under the impression that the ceremony was a valid one.  They will accordingly have acted on that basis as regards any children of the supposed marriage, and the father's name will, as with all children of married couples, have been entered on the births register.  There is a clear inconsistency, therefore, between amendment No. 14, which by the mere fact of entry of his name in the births register would make the father guardian of the child without further ado, and the other amendments which would in some cases require the same father to involve himself in additional costly High Court proceedings in order to secure his position as guardian.</P>
    <P>That is one inconsistency.  Another one &mdash; there may be more &mdash; is evident between amendment No. 9 and amendment No. 15.  Amendment No. 9 provides apparent certainty for the father whose voidable marriage ceremony took place prior to the birth of the child.  By the way, presumably this period is intended to encompass &ldquo;the period of 10 months before&rdquo; the birth, which gets special but superfluous mention in the amendment. We are, I suppose, meant to understand from this amendment that such a father <Col N="288" /> is and always has been guardian of his child.  Why is it then that this father is still exposed by the proposed amendment No. 15 to the possibility that he may be relieved of his role as guardian by the High Court in the wake of nullity proceedings? The Deputy's proposed section 11 A is clearly expressed to apply to all cases where a decree of nullity is pronounced, including those covered by his amendment No. 9.  These inconsistencies demonstrate clearly that if the amendments proposed by Deputy Shatter were to reach the Statute Book they would result in uncertainty, legal expense and perhaps heartbreak for many unwitting fathers.  I believe that the Government amendments, if adopted, would not do that.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 15, I started by giving my initial reaction to it, but in the light of the arguments put forward by Deputy Shatter in support of this amendment here today I am prepared to look at the principle of the amendment between now and Report Stage to see if it would be possible to go some of the way to meet him on it.  I would do this on the understanding that amendments Nos. 6 and 8 are accepted today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain a difficulty which I have with the Minister's approach, in particular in the context of a situation in which there is not necessarily a contest between parents?  The Minister has talked about unnecessary court proceedings.  His approach as described in the Bill as it exists at present means, in effect, that if a mother and a father residing together who are not husband and wife agree that this is their child and the mother wants the father to have joint guardianship rights, there is no mechanism under which that can be done without a court application.  This section, which is referred to in the Bill under the Guardianship of Infants Act as being the new section 6A but is section 12 of this measure, says that there will be special procedures or special rules of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect here is a couple who have had <Col N="289" /> a child and may have lived together for one or 20 years, may wish to be married to each other but cannot because of the peculiarities of our legal system.  Even if they agree between themselves that they are the mother and father of the child and should both be joint guardians of the child, under the law as it would be if this Bill were enacted without my proposed amendment they must get a court decree. It would seem that many people will be put to a great deal of unnecessary expense in bringing many unnecessary court proceedings. In most countries in the world there is a mechanism whereby a couple who are not in dispute with each other but have a child outside marriage can, by the signing of documents without any necessary court proceedings, simply create a legal position whereby they are the joint guardians of that child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy's amendment say about the mother's consent being necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment about which I am talking is amendment No. 14 involving a mother and father who have not married each other and where the father is registered.  The father will not be registered effectively without a legal process determining that he is the father or without the mother agreeing to his being so registered.  That is the legal reality here.  Where the mother does agree there is a necessity, via the mechanism that I am proposing, or another mechanism, for this Bill to allow a couple to be joint guardians of children born to them without their having to go to court. The court they would have to go to under this Bill would be either the District Court or the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a number of District Court and Circuit Court judges dealing with many applications relating to children born outside marriage that need never go near a court at all.  The parents will be seeking advice, paying solicitors, going through the law centre system, or free legal aid if they cannot afford to pay a solicitor.  They will possibly be instructing barristers and going into court to do <Col N="290" /> something which, if they were able to, they could do by consent.  There is something wrong with that system, where people have to go to court unnecessarily. I do not accept the Minister's technical objection to the amendment but I am concerned that because the issue is so complicated it may not be resolved in the context of calling a division here this evening.  I am concerned that there be a procedure which has some common sense attached to it.  To force people into court should not be necessary.</P>
    <P>In New Zealand in similar legislation it has been possible to enact a provision where a couple, in effect, can become joint guardians of their children and have a parental relationship if a child is born to them in circumstances where they are living together.  The mechanism I am proposing here with regard to registration of births is one similar to that adopted under the New Zealand Status of Children Act of 1969.  It is not something that has not been thought out or tried.  It would seem that what is described as the special procedure provision which will arise under the new section 6(3) basically states that the rules of court shall provide a special procedure where the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the father as guardian and the father is registered and such procedure shall be as informal as possible.  I do not see why we could not have a procedure whereby if the mother consents in writing and the father is registered the father could not automatically assume guardianship rights.  The mother's consent is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, going to be necessary under this measure for the father to be registered in the first place.  That may not arise in certain instances &mdash; I accept that &mdash; but in the majority of instances in practice it probably will.  It seems unnecessary in the context of subsection (3) to say to those people that they must go to court.</P>
    <P>A comment was made that the mother might in a weak moment &mdash; I think Deputy McCartan said this &mdash; agree to somebody's name going down on the birth certificate.  The Minister referred to whether it would be in the interest of the <Col N="291" /> child's welfare that someone who is a father should be named as a guardian. Could I suggest with respect that we are looking at this not from the point of view of the child?  When disputes arise between mothers and fathers in a marital situation, leaving aside an unmarital situation, they think they have possessory rights over their children.  The child often becomes a pawn in the middle of a war between husband and wife.  Many court cases are heard currently where a marriage has broken down and where not only does the mother wish to have custody of her child, which may very well be in the child's interest, but because there has been a marital row she does not want the child even to see the father or have contact with him.  The courts have taken the view that children have a right to have contact with both their parents and that when a marriage breaks down children have a right to have contact with the non-custodial parent, who is usually the father.</P>
    <P>Taking the Status of Children Bill and putting children in a position of legal equality, I would adopt the view that children born outside marriage or in circumstances where currently they are not in a position of equality have the right to have access to their father as well as contact with their mother.  I am concerned particularly about section 6A if unamended being incapable of being operated at all in practice.  We are saying to judges that if somebody wishes to be named as guardian and have an involvement in his child's upbringing and if that child is born outside marriage that someone should be named as a guardian only if it is in the interests of the child's welfare. On what basis are the courts going to determine the welfare issue?  In the case of a mother who says that she does not wish this man to be involved in the upbringing of her child and the father says that he does wish, I do not know how a judge will decide when it is in the interests of the welfare of that child to give the father those rights.  I can see extreme circumstances where it will not be, but in the majority of instances the <Col N="292" /> situation will be very little different from that arising in the marital area.  The difficulty with this measure is in the context of the first portion of section 6A that there are no guidelines at all as to how judges should deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is an extremely complicated area but I do not accept many of the criticisms the Minister has made of the amendments I have tabled. I do not want to unnecessarily delay the House but some of the criticisms the Minister has made of one section could become praises of another section.  The reality is that some of the things he has used to criticise some of the amendments are then turned on their heads in reference to other amendments.  One thing I am clear about is that while the Minister may say that what I am doing would create a problem, which I do not believe is the case as it would resolve many of the problems, I have no doubt that the Minister's own approach would equally leave many problems.  For example, it was stated that where marriages are void people do not need to get court decrees. The reality is that people normally only discover that they are void when they bring nullity proceedings and do get court decrees.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his amendment is saying, in the context of amendment No. 15, which I have tabled, that where there is a void marriage it may mean people will have to go into court to have an order made.  In fact, that would not be necessary.  Where a marriage is void and this is where there is a thread running through all of the amendments the reality would have been that the couple before the marriage being declared void would have registered the birth of their child. That is part of the purpose of amendment No. 14.  Accepting amendment No. 14 would mean in most cases that where a marriage has been declared null and void and where children have been born to a couple before nullity proceedings, no issue about paternity, maternity or parentage will arise because the child has been registered in the names of the father and the mother.  The birth certificates will have conclusively dealt with that issue <Col N="293" /> unless either side has very positive evidence they can raise.</P>
    <P>In the context of nullity, be it void or voidable, section 14 says in effect that where a couple get a decree of annulment and if a child has been registered in the registry of births with the couple named as father and mother the father is joint guardian and a decree of annulment will not affect that.  This means that there is no need for anyone to get involved in labyrinthine or complicated studies of whether the father reasonably believed that the marriage was valid or otherwise. On the basis of that proposal, in most instances where a void or voidable marriage is annulled the father and mother will remain joint guardians.  There will be no dispute over parentage and the only area where a dispute might have to be resolved is in the area of custody and maintenance.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is a complicated matter. In a sense, this Bill is not a party measure and people should not try to score party political points on it.  Regardless of whether amendment No. 8 is adopted, the position will become a great deal more complicated if the Minister's approach is adopted.  Under this amendment we are providing that if a marriage is declared void the father would retain guardianship rights if he reasonably believed the marraige was valid at the time it was celebrated.  In doing so, we are not providing any jurisdiction for the courts to determine whether he had that reasonable belief.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to accept amendments Nos. 14 and 15, which have a direct relationship to the nullity position, and if amendment No. 8 is accepted in the context of a consideration of conferring on the High Court when it grants a decree of annulment, ancillary powers to make orders for custody, access and maintenance support, it is going to be necessary to confer powers on the High Court to determine a dispute between a couple where it is alleged that the father at the date of the marriage did not reasonably believe that it was a valid marriage.</P>
    <P>That is an issue which could arise and it does arise under this amendment and <Col N="294" /> in the Bill as currently drafted without making a provision for when a court is to decide that issue.  The Minister may say that nobody may raise that issue but in a situation where marriage breaks down a wife who may have been very badly treated may want to cut off the father from contact with the children.  One can argue that in most cases it is in the interest of the children they maintain contact with the father.  Where a marriage has been annulled the wife may subsequently argue in court that the father of the children has no legal rights because he could not have reasonably believed that the marriage was valid.  In so far as that is an issue which may remain part of this Bill and if my amendments are not accepted there is no mechanism for a court to decide that issue.  They can obtain a nullity decree and later go back to the District or Circuit Courts and start all over again.</P>
    <P>There is a very big problem with this issue.  I have no theological attachment to the amendments.  The amendments we have tabled are to tease out this problem, to see if we can confront it.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is willing to see if an amendment can be made, which is acceptable to him, to confer powers on the High Court to make ancillary orders. I learned at a conference I attended over the weekend that representations have been made to the Minister's Department explaining the need for this.  A group of family law solicitors made the representations in the context of a Nullity Bill but I do not think it was understood by them that the issue could be dealt with here.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is willing to look at this issue but he may not be necessarily aware that there are a number of in-built complications in what he is proposing.  What has been in the Bill to date, in fairness, will give rise to many unnecessary court applications in circumstances in which most other countries have found it unnecessary to provide for people to go to court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be said that, by and large, this is an excellent Bill, a Bill which many people have wanted for a <Col N="295" /> long time.  If it has one defect &mdash; this is exemplified in this group of amendments on the sections we are dealing with now &mdash; it is that it is making provision for too heavy a reliance on court proceedings. Too much is provided for by way of procedures and court applications to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, etc.  That is something which should be avoided to the maximum possible extent. Of course, cases will always arise where court proceedings are unavoidable but we should cut down the necessity for court applications so as far as is reasonably possible, particularly when the civil legal aid provisions in this country are so sparse.  Even the simplified and informal procedure which the new section 6 (a) refers to will still mean going to court or involving lawyers in some way.</P>
      <P>There will be only two choices available to a man or women in these circumstances. They could consult private legal advice but the number of lawyers who specialise in this field is few and their services can be costly so many of those concerned will not be able to avail of that kind of procedure or even of the simplest court application or of an informal court application.  People in that category, if they are to do anything at all, would have to fall back on the civil legal aid procedures which regrettably and to our shame are very sadly lacking.  It takes months to get an appointment.  The number of cases which they will take is strictly limited.  We ought to bend over backwards to find a way of avoiding the necessity for court applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the situations with which we are dealing here is that referred to in section 12 (6) (a) and amendment No. 14.  I am not happy with Deputy Shatter's amendment as it stands.  Nonetheless it is on the right track.  His amendment provides that there be this automatic guardianship of the father if the father's name appears on the birth crtificate.  That is reasonable enough as one condition but should not be sufficient in itself.  For example, one could visualise a situation in which the mother had agreed to have <Col N="296" /> the father's name put on the birth certificate. Deputy Shatter is quite right, in virtually all cases the consent of the mother would have been necessary to have the father's name put on the birth certificate.  At some period beforehand, at that time, all might have been well between that man and woman which resulted in her consenting to the father's name going on the birth certificate and the certificate being issued in that name. But some period afterwards the position between them might have altered or deteriorated very considerably, when she might have very strong objection to the father's name being put down as joint guardian along with her.</P>
    <P>I would be happy with Deputy Shatter's amendment, No. 14, if it contained the additional provision that, at that time, the critical stage &mdash; not just at the time of issue of the birth certificate but at the later stage &mdash; she agreed, in writing, to the father being appointed as joint guardian with her.  If that was done perhaps consideration should be given to avoiding the necessity of having a court application provided for in those circumstances. I should be interested to hear the Minister's view on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course everybody in the House would agree that the interests of the child should be paramount.  What we are trying to do here is overcome a problem, and it is a problem, which is that hard cases make bad law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might attempt to deal with the points raised by Deputy Taylor.  There are many forms of living together, some are temporary and some are for fairly long periods. The difficulty is that the law cannot make provision for the good cases without allowing in the bad ones as well.  The mother, in agreeing to registration, does not necessarily want that to include guardianship; that is a fact.  Are we creating a situation in which the mother might be forced into allowing the father to become guardian?  That is something we must think about.  Deputy Shatter's proposal is tantamount to making the father of a child who has not married the mother automatically the guardian in all <Col N="297" /> cases.  This is akin to proposals made by the Law Reform Commission in their report on legitimacy.  Those proposals were not acceptable for a number of reasons.  First, guardianship would be a completely unreal concept where the father was not known or did not himself know he was the father and, even in circumstances in which he could be identified, in many cases.  Automatic guardianship of the father would not be in the interests of the child.  Furthermore, the reality of many cases of birth outside wedlock is that the mother is left to bring up and provide as best she can for her child with no help or co-operation from the father.  That is the reality of the position. To place a mother in those circumstances in the position in which she must consult with the father on matters concerning the upbringing of the child would impose an unnecessary burden on her.  It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would not operate against the interests of the child.  The alternative, that the mother should go to court in order to remove the father &mdash; that is assuming he could be found and identified &mdash; from guardianship is equally unacceptable in that an unmarried mother or mother-to-be has quite enough problems to face without the additional worry, expense and inconvenience of having to institute court proceedings in order to bring up her child on her own.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted in sections 11 and 12 of the Bill is endorsed by the results of a survey carried out by the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children.  This organisation is an umbrella body encompassing most, if not all, of the bodies, both State and voluntary, which deal on a day-to-day basis with the problems faced by unmarried parents and their children.  In the aftermath of the publication of the report of the Law Reform Commission the federation asked all its constituent member organisations for their views on the recommendations in the report.  The results of that survey showed that the recommendations on guardianship were overwhelmingly rejected.  Subsequent indications are that the proposals as <Col N="298" /> enshrined in this Bill, are strongly supported by many of the federation's members.  In particular, Cherish, the Association for Single-Parent Families, have been most vocal in their support for this approach.  I believe that that approach was welcomed generally by all parties in the course of the debate on this Bill in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely happy with the Minister's response on the net point I raised.  Subsection (6) (a) itself also provides that if the mother consents in writing to the appointment of the father as guardian and the father is registered on the birth certificate rules of court shall provide a special procedure for determining an application.  That recognises the validity of a situation in which a mother will consent in writing.  It still obliges her to go through a court application, albeit an informal one.  It is still a court application.  She can be constrained to sign a form for a non-court application, or she can be constrained to sign it for a court application.  The point is, if the father's name is on the certificate, and if she consents in writing then the difference between us and the Minister is slight.  The Minister contends it still puts the mother through the necessity of the court application, informal, though it be whereas I am asking the Minister to consider in those circumstances letting the father be appointed as joint guardian without the necessity for that court application. The written signature of the mother is a factor already in subsection (6) (a).  Why put her through the necessity of a court application?  I really do not see the necessity for it in those circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies Shatter and Taylor that there is no Member of this House who would attempt in any way to intimidate or render life more difficult for the mother, but, in the context of the provisions of this Bill, two factors arise.  One of those Deputy Taylor has raised already, that of too numerous court cases and a lack of access to courts already experienced. <Col N="299" /> None of us would want anybody to have to go through this process unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>The other factor is one of a positive approach to encouraging guardianship. Here there is not much difference between the thinking of Members on all sides of the House.  What all of us would be attempting to do on Report Stage would be to lessen the court procedures, formal procedures that could be costly and occasion long waiting lists.  Above all we would not want in any way to prevent the guardianship of the father being encouraged or rendered more difficult or negative by having to go through the mechanics of a court procedure that is unnecessary if other safeguards are provided and written into the provisions with regard to the mother and child.</P>

      <P>By moving this Bill here this evening I wish, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, to give notice that it represents the first step we intend taking in the area of parliamentary reform for which there is an urgent need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill, 1987, proposes to prohibit the payment of pensions under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Acts, 1938 to 1983, and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts 1938 to 1983 to the holders of certain offices in the State. The effect of this will be to end the situation which has long since been anomalous, and seen by the public at large to <Col N="300" /> be so, where two incomes from the same source are being drawn by one person in respect of the same or similar employment. This situation has been recognised by the Progressive Democrats from their inception.  It represents the type of privilege which politicians have, which is indefensible outside the political arena.  It divides those who legislate from those whom they are supposed to serve.</P>
    <P>This notion that politicians are insulated from reality and are, therefore, not serving the people has been growing steadily over the last ten to 15 years. Many thousands of people felt alienated from political life because of the unrealistic aura surrounding it, until the party of which I am a member was founded. What encouraged me, and many thousands of others also, was the acceptance of reality as the starting point for the party.  One of the realities most keenly felt by the public at large was a cynical disregard for most of what the leaders of this nation had to say.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who wishes to tackle the problem at its source &mdash; to look at the institutions of State, how they are run, their relevance and how the restoration of public confidence in them can be achieved.  I am not one of that band of people, including unfortunately some Deputies in this House, who think that to speak of the ineffectiveness of our Government and Oireachtas, the abuse of privileges and the effective insulation from reality, is to let the side down in some way.  Such people could be likened to the &ldquo;speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil&rdquo; brass monkey brigade.  Simply because they will not speak about the need to reform, are we all to accept that no reform is needed?  The public outside this House, who pay all our salaries and pensions, will not be satisfied with that attitude.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on pensions referred to in this Bill will affect a number of sitting Members of this House, including two of my own party.  It will also affect the President, judges, MEPs, Senators and some other officers of the State.  In individual cases the step we are advocating seems to be pretty harsh.  Are we <Col N="301" /> saying that these individuals do not deserve to have their experience and long service recognised?  No, we are not.  We are saying quite clearly, however, that the payment of pensions in these circumstances <i>per se</i> is not valid, and they should, therefore, be abolished.</P>
    <P>The idea here is to right a wrong, to correct an injustice.  It is important to realise that while removing the anomalous pensions situation we are not making scapegoats out of TDs.  What we want here is fair play both for politicians and for members of the public.  We are also saying that wider reforms of the Oireachtas are needed.  This would include a reduction in the number of TDs, abolition of the Seanad, restructuring of the work of the Dáil and its committees and a review of the way in which public representatives are paid.  In the case of the last mentioned item, it would seem natural and right to this party that length of service and acquired experience would be rewarded, perhaps by way of allowances as in many other employments, State and private.</P>
    <P>The essence of the payment of a pension is surely that it commences when the payment of a salary ends.  That is where the crux arises here.  A Minister or Dáil Deputy or Senator is a public representative. The thread of being a public representative runs right through holding any one of these positions.  It is not possible to be both a Senator and a Deputy at the same time but it is, however, possible to be a Minister at the same time as being a Senator or a Deputy.</P>
    <P>Being in that Ministerial role does not alter the basic status of the person &mdash; he or she remains a public representative. When he or she ceases being a Minister that status remains, the job continues. Yet we pay a pension to that person even if they continue to carry on the same basic role as before.  The role of being a Minister certainly adds extra responsibilities which demand extra remuneration, which should cease with the lifting of those responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In Britain, ex Ministers receive no pension from their former role if they revert to ordinary public representative status. <Col N="302" /> They do, however, receive an addition to their pension when they retire at 65 which recognises the extra responsibilities they held.  Extra allowances are paid to a certain number of front bench spokesmen in each party which recognises their extra responsibilities and expenses.</P>
    <P>Why have we devised the system we have?  Surely public cynicism is fuelled by this knowledge and by the knowledge that it is the politicians themselves who were responsible for awarding each other these benefits?  No wonder I often hear constituents saying that Dáil Éireann is in reality a private club which makes rules to protect its own privileges and position. I want to see that changed.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats want the ordinary people in the street, who do not know much about what goes on in Government, to feel that their trust in their public representative is generally well founded.  That will not happen unless we set out to win that trust fairly and squarely.  We will not, however, win that trust if we continue to set ourselves apart from other income earners.  Employees in other walks of life on equivalent incomes cannot get a pension until retirement, irrespective of merit or experience.  They are rightly unfavourably disposed towards their public representatives receiving such pensions.</P>
    <P>When we were campaigning in the last general election many thousands of people whom we met praised us for our stand on this issue.  Even supporters of other parties, while continuing to support that party, agreed that the pension situation was wrong and should be changed. The issue has come to be in the public's eye the epitome of the abuse of power which the man or woman in the street believes politicians indulge in. How can we, as the leaders of the community, demand that the black economy be eliminated and social welfare abuses be stamped out when we have acknowledged anomalies in our own system of paying ourselves, about which we have done nothing.</P>
    <P>This issue is one of leadership.  It is one of restoring faith in the political system through its politicians.  There will be a <Col N="303" /> saving from the passing of this Bill.  For the last year for which figures are available, the amount spent on pensions which would be eliminated under the provisions set out here was over £200,000.</P>
    <P>The allocation in the Estimates published yesterday for next year's expenditure showed an increase in the provision for Oireachtas pensions of £151,000, which is partly explained by the need to make payments to former Oireachtas Members now holding public or judicial office.  The cost of those pensions, together with ministerial pensions paid to sitting Oireachtas Members, could have paid for restoration of the Ombudsman's Office's allocation to its position after the last budget, now being cut by a further 17 per cent.  That office, which should be seen as the citizen's bulwark against injustice in the administration of government can be compared in its role with that of the person who oversees Government expenditure, the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the light of those cuts, ministerial and Oireachtas pensions fade into insignificance.  If, for example, we had made the changes we are proposing, we might have been able to retain, too, the National Social Services Board, the AntiPoverty programme and many others.</P>
    <P>The money saved is not the central issue, but the message emanating from this House is.  Politics is, in a way, on trial.  Will the political elite defend its privileges or accept what the common sense of the ordinary person in the street can see, i.e. that ministerial pensions are an example of politicians looking after No. 1?</P>
    <P>That leadership which must be shown on this issue by the members of this House must not stop at this.  If Members here want to carry the citizens of this country with them in the measures needed to bring about economic prosperity, we must reform this House to make it more efficient, effective and value for money.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill before us is the first step.  I would see, as would my party, an urgent need to reduce the number of <Col N="304" /> TDs, an exercise which should be carried out alongside the next electoral boundary revision.  This is perfectly feasible within the terms laid down by the Constitution. We are heavily over represented in our Oireachtas compared with many other countries.  This leads to a trivialising of the role of the public representative and draws him or her into a web of weaving strokes for constituents, instead of wrangling with legislative matters and issues of national importance.</P>
    <P>This should be dealt with in the context of a full review and revamping of the method of payment of TDs.  As I have said, this House is where the example on all these points should come from.  The Progressive Democrats have used as a motive for action the phrase, &ldquo;Leading by Example&rdquo;, on a number of issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to state to this House to-night that the Leader of our party, Deputy O'Malley and the chairman of our party, Deputy Bobby Molloy made known today their independent decisions to that parliamentary party that they are voluntarily giving up the ministerial pensions which they receive.  They have made this very difficult decision because they believe, first, that the principle of the Bill we are proposing is correct.  They wish to put all possible force behind the making of that case, and show their abhorrence of the continuation of a practice which the public have rightly condemned.</P>
    <P>This voluntary relinquishing of their pensions, which in personal terms is no easy decision to take, makes a clear statement. That statement is that they believe reform should start here, in the heart of the Dáil.  It is a significant gesture acknowledging the hard decisions which face thousands, and hundreds of thousands of people every day in this State. Where do our opponents think reform should start?  Who do they think should lead the way?</P>
    <P>Do they not think that on a day when the general public are coming to terms with the shock news of £485 million worth of spending cuts, when many are worried about basic services like primary education and when many public servants are worried about the future of their jobs, <Col N="305" /> this House should show by example not just its willingness to share but also to give a lead to the public by being prepared to take less?</P>
    <P>We in the Progressive Democrats are leading the way by introducing this measure as a first step in Oireachtas reform.</P>
    <P>Another area we should reform is the Seanad.  It serves no particular role, despite the intentions when it was established. It is still searching for that role and no amount of dumping of legislation on it and making it sit for much longer sittings than the Dáil will help it to find that role.  We do not need the second House.  What we need is an active, effective, modern, businesslike Dáil.  This would serve the country far better than having two inert old-fashioned Houses, neither of which is effective in what it sets out to do.</P>
    <P>A third area which is positively scandalous is the existence of 15 Ministers of State.  We proposed a reduction to seven last year, and that they should serve particularly in Departments which have a large proportion of their work with the EC.  The practice of appointing so many is seen by the public at large for what it is, &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;.  Neither did the recent debacle between the Minister for Agriculture and his junior Minister do anything to enhance the standing of this breed of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The matter of taxation of TDs, which gives rise to many misconceptions &mdash; particularly the one that they do not pay tax at all &mdash; is another which must be tackled.  Not only should TDs pay tax, which they definitely do, but they must be seen to pay on a par with other PAYE taxpayers, which at the moment they do not.  It is another example of allowing themselves to be insulated from the reality outside this House.  This party have taken the lead by introducing this Bill in the Dáil.  They published it last year, pursued the matter to the point where in the first session of the sitting of this Dáil we are bringing it forward for a Second Reading.  This party have led by example in that case.  Our individual members have led by their example.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and <Col N="306" /> I look forward to receiving support for what are eminently obvious anomalies. The Bill is a start in the proper reform of the Oireachtas generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question put down today by one of the Deputies of the Progressive Democrats, information was given listing the names of all Members and ex-Members who are in receipt of ministerial pensions.  This debate was well signalled in the media and, through official channels, to each Member of the House and it is very significant that of all the Members of the House who are in receipt of ministerial pensions only one has deemed it fit to attend this debate, the former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  On all the other benches I cannot see any other Member who is in receipt of a pension even though we know there is a large number of them in all the other parties.</P>
      <P>For some time past, I have been convinced that there is no moral justification for continuing payment of Ministers' pensions to ex-Ministers who continue to serve as Dáil Deputies at a time when 250,000 people face permanent unemployment, 40,000 people have to emigrate annually and 10,000 people have been thrown out of their jobs by Government decree.  It is surely immoral to expect these people, who have so little control over their destiny, to suffer while we tolerate excess and wasteful expenditure in the payment of Ministers' pensions and maintain 15 Ministers of State costing millions in expenses and in duplication. Indeed, one Minister of State has a Department which spends about £6 million on schemes and yet it costs £1 million to administer that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can this House ask that these Estimates be accepted when those who are administering the cuts are not prepared to apply any cutbacks that affect themselves?  Let those who will answer. It is not just idealistic youth who are cynical of politicians.  The mass of our people are equally cynical when they observe the lavish expenditure of those in high places while our country is on the <Col N="307" /> brink of bankruptcy.  The great void in political life is leadership.  The decision I have made will present serious personal problems for me but it is important to remind the House that giving has no real meaning unless it hurts.</P>
    <P>I join in sympathy with those others who must suffer because of decisions made by this Government and I believe that it is a time to share.  I wish to confirm, therefore, to Dáil Éireann what my colleague, Deputy Anne Colley, has said &mdash; that is, that I intend notifying the Paymaster General to cease payment of ministerial pension in respect of periods served by me as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education from July 1969 to May 1970, as Minister for Local Government from May 1970 to March 1973 and as Minister for Defence from July 1977 to December 1979, this decision to take effect from 1 January 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the introduction of this Bill and I appeal to all Members of this House in all parties to give it very serious consideration.  It is a measure which is part of an approach that this party is seeking to adopt towards the need for a reform in this House and it focuses principally on one specific area of abuse.  It is fundamentally wrong for people in active employment simultaneously to drawing a salary for that employment to draw a pension in respect of earlier service within that same employment.  That abuse is particularly pernicious when it is one which we have established and maintained here under a general cloak of parliamentary secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not that many of the people involved are making a lot of money out of this anomaly; it is not that there is a great deal of money to be made out of politics generally, but it is that this House, above any other institution, must give example and that example has to be such as to imbue in the public absolute confidence in and respect for this House and all of its Members.  It is not just anomalous, it is socially profoundly unjust that people who have worked for decades in the public service &mdash; for <Col N="308" /> example, in organisations such as CIE &mdash; are being asked to exist on pensions of a few pounds when people who have served three years in this House and are still young men and women are drawing substantial pensions arising from that service, bearing in mind that all of us volunteered for public life in the first instance.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to address that question. We are not saying that we in this party have any particular monopoly of wisdom or virtue but that in a peculiar way we have a mandate for pressing for this change because it was part of our policy and, unlike the example of some other parties, we have no intention of reneging on that which was fundamental in the election which we fought and the support which we won in that context.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for drawing particular attention to the example given by my two senior colleagues, Deputies O'Malley and Molloy.  I do not wish to embarrass them in any way but that example of voluntarily relinquishing what I suspect is now in many ways essential to both of them is an example which must move all of us and which, I hope, in due course will be recognised among the public as probably one of the most significant and certainly one of the most selfless acts seen in this House since its institution.  It is not about words but about deeds and there is a cost and a pain to it.</P>
    <P>It has been motivated predominantly by the consciousness of those Deputies of the trauma and the distress at present prevalent in our community arising directly out of Government policy and arising specifically out of our peception that there is unprecedented hardship and difficulty for many thousands of people and that somehow the people in this House must reach out and say to people who are suffering that kind of trauma: &ldquo;we understand, we sympathise and this is one small way in which we sympathise with you and want to act with you in bringing about an improved and a more just situation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That example is the beacon to all of us, myself included, and to the general <Col N="309" /> public as to how to conduct ourselves both in this House and outside it.  The message surely is that we cannot bring about social or economic progress, we cannot lead by example unless each one of us is willing to give a little, or in this case perhaps give a great deal.  Deputy Colley referred to other abuses and unquestionably they exist.  The summary of that whole phalanx of abuse and privilege is that never has the public perception of this House been lower in the general esteem.  If we are to address that problem, then this evening marks a watershed in our approach to it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt there will be speeches from the Minister and perhaps the Opposition parties giving reasons this should not happen.  There will be references to the Bill not being correctly drafted and we will be told that the whole area is being examined and that we will wait and see.  I do not want to hear those excuses because that is all they are.  We are sick and tired of being told that matters are being looked into and being reviewed.</P>
    <P>I want to address specifically the Opposition amendment put forward in the name of Deputy Noonan.  To put it as charitably as I can, it is derisory.  It does not even address the comprehension in the original Bill.  This amendment refers to the Gleeson Committee who are dealing with aspects of remuneration for Oireachtas Members.  Our Bill is about many other things too.  It is about this abuse by not only people who are Members of this House but also Members of the European Parliament, those who serve on the Judiciary and elsewhere, including the first citizen of this country &mdash; not that we want in any way to draw him into this personally.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not even attempt to do justice to the broad tenets of our Bill.  It seems to be a form of knee jerk and cowardly reaction to an initiative which is not just necessary and essential but is bold and courageous.  We have spent the past 12 months trying to introduce this matter in the House and have witnessed the rules of this House being rewritten systematically and over a period of time to exclude us from raising <Col N="310" /> anything in the House.  Now we are being told that a committee will present proposals to us in due course.</P>
    <P>Some of us who have been in this House for some time have not a great deal of confidence in extra parliamentary committees.  We want the Minister to say this evening that this Bill is right.  We are not too pushed about the drafting of it: we are quite willing to discuss that, that is flexible.  However, we are not willing to deal with the essence of it which is that it is wrong for people who are still active in public life to draw pensions arising from earlier service in public life.  It is no more complex than that.  It is as sharply focused as that and no amount of prevarication, ambiguity or procrastination can detract from that.  That is the essence of it.</P>
    <P>There are many people in public life and many people associated with former office holders here.  There are many people drawing pensions who are entitled to them and who deserve and need them. In due course we will see this party putting forward submissions relating to the broad area of remuneration for TDs. There are things that are wrong.  It is wrong that somebody who is in the House for 20 years and who has a breadth and depth of experience at a number of levels should find himself or herself on the same level of remuneration as somebody who walked in here the first day.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the Bill in the way it has been presented by Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley, has implications for families and for standards of living, aspects of security of this job need response and treatment.  The salary a TD earns is by no means outlandish, but taken in the context of the public perception in general and based on areas of relative advantage and privilege which some Members enjoy, there is need for wide reform.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Colley said, this, therefore, is only the first of a series of measures which we will seek to advance.  We must revise the system and structure in this House and reduce the number of Members.  The representation is outlandish for a country the population of <Col N="311" /> which could probably be, if not lost, certainly obscured in a city like London.  It is preposterous that there is a level of bureaucracy and administration through government, central and local, all over the country which involves 40 local authorities, eight health boards, numerous VECs and a multi-tiered layer of expensive, unnecessary and quite often predominantly bureaucratic administration, most of it unnecessary and much of it obscuring the essential thrust of what those bodies and organisations are supposed to do.  We are for sweeping away much of that.  We cannot throw out everything overnight and nobody wishes to do so, but think, for instance, of our hospitals where a nurse cannot even make a phone call, while the expenses of the health boards and the officials working within them came last year to some £13.5 million.  The examples of overlapping, duplication, waste and fraud clearly exemplified in page after page of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with reference to areas of public administration are a recurring theme in his reports and are not addressed by this Government nor are they a feature of any reformist approach by the Government.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a ripe and fertile field for us to deal with when we come to reform in this House.  This evening we are trying to bring the first element of that reform into focus and to tell people that it is not that we claim any credit for that but that in our hearts we believe that it is wrong that people employed in this House should simultaneously draw pensions for three or a few more years' service, many of them presumably with most of their parliamentary and public careers before them.  I would like those who do not propose to support our Bill to address, without waffling or ambiguity, the question of whether they agree with that principle.  Do they support the concept of people, some of them in the ranks of other parties, some of them young men and women, getting a salary for their present job plus a pension arising from <Col N="312" /> having given three years service in this House?</P>
    <P>Not alone is this Bill timely and essential but if we are to redress the slide towards abject cynicism among the public in general arising from the broad view they have that all of us in here are essentially some kind of secret society who write our own rules, pay ourselves what we wish, have a whole range of hidden perks, subsidised restaurants and a litany of advantages over the ordinary citizen, we must deal honestly and fairly with each of those points.  There is truth in some of them.  It is not an answer to say that others have similar advantages, that perhaps the restaurants in the public service generally or in Departments have bigger subsidies and provide cheaper meals.  That is not what we are asking here.  We are seeking to focus on how we can address the essential questions relating to ourselves.  We are not asking some committee working behind closed doors, accountable to nobody publicly or otherwise, for the integrity of their report or even to stand over their recommendations. We are saying that this is a job for men and women elected by the people and we are asking people not to funk that.  Each of us in his or her heart knows precisely what is needed and that need is to undo what is clearly a profound injustice.</P>
    <P>In the list of payees given in reply to a question today were many names, some of people who have served this country extremely well and who are no longer in this House, and none of us would begrudge those men and women that pension. It is at least in part a contributory pension.  Others are widows or widowers perhaps of former distinguished public representatives and this Bill is not aimed at those people either.  On the contrary, looking through that list today one could not help but have a certain degree of evocative feeling about a number of people who served this House well and who have since, unfortunately, passed on.</P>
    <P>Our Bill is aimed at people still in public life and the issue which we choose to incorporate in that first Bill &mdash; there <Col N="313" /> will be others &mdash; was the simplest, clearest, sharpest focused example of a form of anomaly, to use a tired word, which we could fasten on.  We see no complexity about it.  I appeal to this House, therefore, not to support under any circumstances the Fine Gael amendment which falls short even of addressing the terms of reference of our Bill.  It does not even pretend to deal with the wide compass of our measure.  Even if it did, it would still be the same form of ritual delegation to an anonymous review body working privately behind closed doors to which we have become so accustomed here whenever a thorny issue arises, and this is thorny.  That amendment is a disservice to the Bill and unworthy of support. I am disappointed that a sincere attempt was not made to address in a comprehensive way the thrust and detail of our Bill.  This is not a top of the head Private Members' motion.  It is a carefully drafted, legislative proposal over which our party spent many months of consideration in terms of conception and development and the precise drafting of the measure.</P>
    <P>In passing I want to say to the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, that last night I admired his apparently steel-like resolve, the firm jut of the jaw, if he will pardon me for saying so, and the clearsighted approach he took to issues.  He exuded a certain sense of control, insight and confidence in his own capacity to do those things which he believes are important.  I appeal to that Minister tonight to exude that same sense of leadership and to say to this House: &ldquo;This Bill is not perfect in every respect but we accept what it seeks to do.  We intend to implement what it seeks to do at the earliest opportunity&rdquo; and tell us precisely how he intends to do that.  If he does so he will be doing a very good day's work for this House, this country and himself as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In summary, I appeal to all Members not to dig themselves into entrenched positions this evening but to consider this Bill, reflect on it and on the examples that members of this party have given, and to endorse what it is trying to do.</P>

      <P>Fraud and abuses were mentioned before Deputy Keating spoke at all.  As I have previously indicated in this House, it is not my intention to promote or support legislation designed to end the payment of ministerial and Oireachtas pensions to the holders of certain offices and to sitting Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> Members of the House will be aware that the authority for the payment of pensions to Members of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament who were office holders and, as a result, are in receipt of pensions in addition to their parliamentary allowances, lies in legislation enacted in accordance with the Constitution.  The relevant legislation is the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, as subsequently amended. The origin of the Act lies in the acceptance by the Government of the day of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Ministerial and other Salaries appointed under warrant dated 4 June 1937, before I was born.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Inquiry, which was chaired by Dr. John Shanley, recommended that there should be provision for a pension in the case of any person holding ministerial office for not less than three years.  The justification for this recommendation is set out in detail in the report.  In essence, the committee felt that such provision would help to reduce the financial sacrifice involved in holding office because of the enforced severance of all active connection by the person concerned with his original occupation or profession and also the near impossibility while in office of providing for the future of himself and his family.  The committee also felt that even where it was possible for a person to maintain some degree of linkage with his original occupation, he could still find it extremely difficult on relinquishing office to take up again where he had laid off.</P>
    <P>The report then went on to say and I quote:</P>
    <P>The severance from his former means of livelihood will often be irremediable and he will be left with no assurance whatever as to the future, although his high position, unlike that attained in other walks of life, is due to concentration on matters concerned with the public interest and public affairs.  Experience has shown that the sacrifices involved in taking office as a Minister have been such that unless <Col N="316" /> some remedy be found many persons who might otherwise have been attracted to a political career and whose services would have been most useful to the nation in that sphere may be deterred from accepting office unless provision is made to ensure that their future position is safeguarded. Another consideration that arises, is the desirability of retaining ex Ministers in political life, as their knowledge of affairs and experience of administration must be of great value to the community in the examination and criticism of legislative proposals in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is now nearly 50 years since the committee concluded that the onerous duties of ministerial office and the sacrifices involved were such as to warrant the grant of pensions.  I venture now to say, without fear of contradiction, that the intervening years have seen not a diminution in those duties of office but rather a vast increase in the levels of involvement and responsibility of those holding ministerial office.  This is a consequence of the huge changes and developments which have taken place in the economic and social life of our country since the mid-thirties and the commitments which we now have in the world at large, including our membership of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>It was also a recommendation of the Shanley Committee that, with the exception of the parliamentary allowances of Deputies or Senators, any other remuneration or pension received from public funds should give rise to the abatement of ministerial pensions.  The resulting legislation &mdash; the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 &mdash; provided accordingly for the exclusion of parliamentary allowances from reckoning under the abatement rules.  The Act also provided that abatement on a sliding scale should apply to ministerial pensions where payments other than parliamentary allowances were received from public funds.</P>
    <P>That situation continued until 1965 when the Pensions Abatement Act of <Col N="317" /> that year provided that throughout the public service as a whole, abatement should be limited to a situation in which a person in receipt of a pension from public funds would be re-employed in the same service as that from which he has retired.  Up to that time, re-employment anywhere in the public service after retirement would give rise to abatement if the pension plus the new salary exceeded the current rate of the retiring "&gt;salary.  Members will, no doubt, be aware of many cases in the Civil Service, local authority service, health and educational areas or in State-sponsored bodies where public service pensioners &mdash; for example, retired gardaí and Army personnel take up duty in the private sector and continue to draw their pensions while receiving the pay appropriate to their new employment. Indeed, the thinking which contributed to the modification of the abatement provisions in 1965 was based on the proposition that a pension should be regarded as having been earned in its own right by the period of earlier service. That proposition is also reflected in the fact that public servants can take their pension entitlements with them when they move to other jobs in the public service or in international organisations.</P>
    <P>The reason I have commented in this detail on the background to the pension arrangements is to show the House how the present system was the product of the thorough and painstaking deliberations of the Shanley Committee and how it has been adapted over time.  The arrangements which are now in operation for nearly half a century have played their part in maintaining both the quality and stability of our political institutions.  It is not a system which I would wish to see lightly jettisoned in answer to any call, misinformed or otherwise, for its abandonment.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to the process by which the total remuneration of parliamentary and certain other office holders is determined in the context of former and current provisions relating to the payment of income tax, expenses, allowances and superannuation.  This, of course, is a complex and delicate process <Col N="318" /> calling for a high degree of competence and judgment on the part of those to whom its determination is entrusted.  On the one hand, there is the legitimate case of those who by reason of their election or appointment to what must be among the most demanding of professions, are expected to give of their utmost in the service of the community.  It is only just and natural that the endeavours of the holders of high public office should merit a reasonable and fair return.  On the other hand, there are compelling reasons which call for an objective and impartial consideration and weighing of all of the issues.  There is a certain degree of misunderstanding and a lack of knowledge about the interplay of these issues.  In some instances there even seems to be a feeling abroad that in some way or other the recipients are the determinants of their own benefits.  This is, of course, far from being the true position.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that since 1983 when the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices Act, 1983 became law, the pay of parliamentarians has been automatically adjusted in line with general pay increases in the Civil Service.  Prior to that time, it will be remembered, it was not at all unusual to find that the pay of parliamentarians had fallen seriously behind in relation to national pay rounds.  The subsequent adjustment of parliamentary pay so as to bring it back into line, belated though it often was, became a rather traumatic experience to which I am certain few Deputies, if any, would wish to revert.  It is, however, important to remember that these public service increases of a general nature only followed a process of intensive bargaining, often prolonged, during which considerations such as ability to pay and the need for restraint were vigorously advanced and argued.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of automatic adjustment for general pay increases, as provided for in the 1983 Act, there were two major examinations of the levels of remuneration of the members of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary and the higher public service.  The first was in 1972 and <Col N="319" /> the second was completed in 1979 &mdash; nearly eight years ago.  Both of these examinations were carried out by the independent Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In January 1986, the then Government agreed in the context of pay negotiations, after requests from the unions, that a further review should be put in hand and an undertaking to that effect was given in the ensuing pay agreement.  Accordingly, the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was reconstituted and an appropriate reference made to it in July 1986.  Included in the reference was a request to the review body to examine and report on the remuneration of members of the Government, Ministers of State, certain office holders and the allowances of members of the Oireachtas.  The review body was also requested when making its reports to have regard to the state of the public finances and current Government pay policy.  The existing provisions for Ministerial pensions are a datum which will doubtless be taken into account by the review body, as was done on the occasion of the last two general references, in recommending rates of remuneration for Ministers and other parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>Apart from the particular instances to which I have referred, the review body has otherwise functioned over the years as a standing body advising successive Governments on higher public sector pay levels.  It is a body whose reports have always been noted for their thoroughness and careful research.  When the review body was originally being set up, it was decided by the Government that it should consist of persons of standing and high integrity in the community.  Also, it was considered essential that the members should be generally accepted as having no commitments to or affiliations with any of the groups coming within the review body's purview.  A further consideration was that the members would be drawn from different walks of life with a variety of backgrounds so as to reflect <Col N="320" /> a broad range of experience and professional expertise.  The present chairman of the review body is Mr. Dermot Gleeson, Senior Counsel, who replaced Mr. Liam St. J. Devlin.  Mr. Devlin was appointed chairman when the body was first set up in 1969 and he continued to hold that office until he resigned on 31 December, 1983.  The other members of the review body are: Ms. Maeve Carton, Accountant, Arthur Anderson and Co.; Mr. John Donovan, past Chairman and Chief Executive of ESSO, who has held a wide range of appointments including chairmanship of the Industrial Development Authority and the Public Service Advisory Council; Mr. Cormac McHenry, Member, Labour Court; Mr. Stephen O'Connor, Chief Executive, Waterford Co-operative Society Ltd., and Ms. Evelyn Owens, Deputy Chairperson, Labour Court.  In mentioning the names of the members of the Review Body, I want to acknowledge publicly the special contribution which they are making in undertaking the important tasks entrusted to them.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the pensions payable to former Ministerial and other office holders are not a matter in which the recipients should be seen as the arbitrators. I have no doubt that there is a general consensus in the House on this point.  I have demonstrated that the review process is firmly outside the scope of influence of those involved.  This is as it should be.  It relieves the recipients of the anxiety that their case should have a fair hearing while, at the same time, they are free from any charge or suggestion that in some undefined way they can unfairly manipulate the system for their own financial gain.  That, I must emphasise, is not so.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that the current reference to the review body also requested it as a first step to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether the remuneration of the groups concerned had fallen seriously out of line with that of comparable jobs in other employments since its last report and, if satisfied that serious anomalies or inequities existed, to recommend an interim increase to rectify <Col N="321" /> them.  Acting on this request, the review body recommended in an interim report that there should be an increase of 15 per cent for higher public servants, the Judiciary, chief executives of State-sponsored bodies and Members of the Oireachtas.  The Government, however, on 13 March 1987, in view of the serious state of the public finances and the need for pay restraint generally, decided to postpone indefinitely any action in relation to the implementation of the interim report.  This is a clear illustration of the firm intention of the Government to maintain the same degree of discipline and restraint in matters of parliamentarians' pay and other remuneration as is required generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to move an amendment to this motion.  My amendment is as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo;and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, conscious of the fact that the whole question of pay and conditions of Oireachtas Members, including pensions now paid to former Office holders, is before the Gleeson Committee declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill and, in doing so, invites the Gleeson Committee to consider the option of paying all former Office holders an additional increment for each year of service as an Office holder, and paying pensions, which should be on a contributory basis, to former Office holders only on their retirement from the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first time that the question of pension arrangements for holders of Ministerial office has been debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The pension arrangements for office holders are provided for, as the Minister has informed us, under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938, as amended by subsequent legislation.  The 1938 legislation was enacted on foot of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Ministerial pensions and other emoluments under the chairmanship of <Col N="322" /> Dr. John Shanley.  The Shanley Committee recommended the introduction of Ministerial pensions on the grounds that any person who:</P>
    <P>Attains Ministerial rank is obliged to cut himself adrift more or less completely from his former occupation or profession.  If his tenure of office becomes protracted it may be extremely difficult for him on retirement to take up the threads of his former business.</P>
    <P>I quote what the Minister has already quoted.</P>
    <P>The severance from his former means of livelihood will often be irremediable and he will be left with no assurance whatever as to the future, although his high position, unlike that attained in other walks of life, is due to concentration on matters concerned with the public interest and public affairs.  Experience has shown that the sacrifices involved in taking office as a Minister have been such that unless some remedy be found many persons who might otherwise have been attracted to a political career and whose services would have been most useful to the nation in that sphere may be deterred from accepting office unless provision is made to ensure that their future position is safeguarded. Another consideration that arises is the desirability of retaining ex Ministers in political life, as their knowledge of affairs and experience of administration must be of great value to the community in the examination and criticism of legislative proposals in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There was a further recommendation by the Shanley Committee concerning abatement of ministerial pensions where the person concerned was receiving other remuneration or pension from the public purse.  Those abatement provisions, however, were abolished under the terms of the Pensions Abatement Act, 1965.  I believe that the reasons enumerated by the Shanley Committee are still valid.  I believe, however, that there <Col N="323" /> is a problem.  It is a problem of perception rather than of reality, but it is the function of this House to deal with both matters of perception and reality in public affairs and we should do all in our power to bring about a situation where the public perception of the reality accords with reality.</P>
    <P>The problem with perception here, arises, I believe, from the use of the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; to describe the emoluments received by former office holders as recommended by the Shanley committee. We associate the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; with retirement.  Some members of the public find it difficult to understand why a person in active public life, in receipt of salary, should be treated as if he had retired and be awarded a pension.  The word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; is also associated with old age.  Some members of the public find it difficult to understand, why people in the flower of life, and, indeed, some people who are still young, should be treated as if they were aged.  And yet the arguments put forward by Dr. Shanley's committee are not alone valid but, I believe, have more validity now than when the Ministers Pensions Act was first passed in 1938 by this House.</P>
    <P>Twice in recent times the question has been re-examined by eminent people, who are not Members of this House, and there was no recommendation for change.  I refer of course to the Members of the Independent Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In both the 1972 and 1979 reports from this body, it has been stated that the members of the committee had regard to the superannuation provisions for office holders in making recommendations on their remuneration.  In other words, not only did the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector examine the question of pensions for office holders, and recommend no change, but they actually reduced what they considered to be the rate for the job appropriate to office holders, because they would benefit subsequently from pensions on losing office.  In effect the review body treated ministerial pensions as <Col N="324" /> deferred pay but despite this, the difficulties of public perception still remain.</P>
    <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector has been reconstituted.  It has new membership, as outlined by the Minister, under the chairmanship of Dermot Gleeson SC from which it derives its colloquial name, the Gleeson Committee.  That committee, which has already submitted an interim report, should be requested to deal with this issue along the lines of my amendment.  We should have an incremental salary scale for TDs and Senators and my amendment is contingent on this.  I wanted to include this recommendation in my amendment, but was advised that this was not in order as it was outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In case of any doubt about the matter, I want the Gleeson Committee to examine the possibility of TDs and Senators being paid on an incremental scale.  If they recommend this, I believe office holders when they lose office should be paid an increment for each year of service as an office holder, in addition to their entitlement as a TD or Senator.  In these new circumstances I think that pensions should only be paid to office holders on retirement from the Houses of the Oireachtas, and that this pension like some, though not all, public service pensions, should be on a contributory basis. I propose that Dáil Éireann ask the Gleeson Committee to consider this, together with the other aspects of pay and conditions of parliamentarians already under consideration.  It is very difficult to be both judge and jury in one's own case.  All Members of this House are subjectively concerned with the Bill which is before us tonight.  I am a former office holder. The Minister for Finance at present holds high office.  Deputy Colley who has moved this Bill here tonight may be an office holder in the future.  Indeed, her father who was highly respected in this House and in the country generally was entitled to benefit from the provisions of the 1938 Act during his period in Dáil Éireann when he was not an office holder. Because of our past, our present or our prospects we find ourselves very close to <Col N="325" /> the argument.  Consequently, it is preferable that an outside body of the eminence of the Gleeson Committee should examine this question objectively and make their recommendations to the Government.</P>
    <P>We have Deputies of very high quality in all parties sitting in this House at present.  I do not believe, however, that we are getting a cross-section of all the talent available in the country as a whole. This is because some people simply cannot afford to be Members of this House because of the loss of income they would incur by moving from their present profession or business to become full time politicians.  I find increasingly in our party &mdash; I presume the same situation pertains in other parties &mdash; that members of the professions and of the business community while actively involved in politics are reluctant to run for office.  This reluctance arises from the fact that they simply cannot afford to run as the loss in income and the loss in time is too much for them to sustain both personally and for their families.</P>
    <P>Anecdotal evidence is not always the best evidence but I would like to tell the House two short anecdotes which arise from personal experiences when I was a Minister.  One occurred when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The chairman of the board of the National Development Corporation after it was set up informed me that it would be impossible to get a chief executive for that body if the remuneration offered was within the Devlin scale for semi-State bodies.  I succeeded in getting Government agreement for a salary of £48,000 which was outside that scale.  The chairman subsequently informed me that this salary was not sufficient to compete with the type of pay and conditions available to people in the private banking sector which was the target market for the chief executive.  In my early days as Minister for Justice I was sitting at an official dinner beside a senior banker here and was enormously impressed as an neophyte holder of office to be there.  In the course of conversation he remarked that he was bemused by the fact that his salary <Col N="326" /> was exactly twice that of the Minister for Finance.  We have an obligation to construct a proper career path for Members elected to this House.  The concept of increments, so widespread in the public service, is an acceptable method of achieving this.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak on behalf of a group in the House that is increasingly getting larger, those who are full time public representatives and who rely on what they get paid here to sustain them and their families.  That is not the experience of all Members.  If we are to talk about Dáil Deputies' salaries being topped up by ministerial pensions we should look at the Members who are not full time Members of the House.  We should look at the people who can use this House as a convenient downtown office, some of them on their way to a place where one can get £1,500 for the first day and £1,000 subsequently per day. We should also remember that some Members cannot afford to be here unless their spouses are working.  I do not want to be a kept Deputy but some people can afford to be here if their spouses are working and others wonder if we can continue to stay here if our spouses are not in a position to return to work.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy to get personal on this matter but I do not have any intention of doing so when explaining my position.  I do not intend to cast aspersions on any other Deputy.  I was pleased, despite many of the references in the speeches by the Progressive Democrats, that they did agree with the burden of what I am putting forward in some side remarks they made.  Deputy Colley suggested by inference that a system of allowances for front bench Members might be appropriate.  Deputy Keating, who always oozes sincerity on occasions like this, remarked that he did not think it right that people in this House with, say, 20 years' experience should have the same remuneration as somebody starting for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson Committee which is independent, eminent and not subject to influence by people in this House should examine the situation.  Let them see if <Col N="327" /> they can create a wage structure and a career path for professional politicians who want to dedicate their lives full time to the business of democracy.</P>

In that I am glad that, if even only in a gentle way, the spokespersons for the Progressive Democrats agree that not everybody should be on the same level of remuneration and that there should be some career path, either through promotion or seniority, available for Members of this House.  One could go on.  This is something that we have to look at objectively.  I doubt if it is possible to get any group in this House in any party not only to look at it objectively but to be publicly perceived to be objective. That is why I am saying that we should use the objective review group that are already examining these matters.  I recommend my amendment to the House and ask that the changes I am proposing be seriously considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The most telling point made by the Minister this evening was his comment that former ministerial and other office holders who are recipients should not be seen to be the arbitrators in this matter.  I recall very vividly that when I came into this House in 1969 it took us at least four or five years to have the Devlin Review Body established to review not only the general levels of higher remuneration in the Public Service but also the levels of remuneration of Members of the Government and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There was a thorough review in 1972 and I recall Deputy O'Malley participating in that review.  There was a further on-going review in 1979.  In 1972 and 1979 the general level of remuneration and the allowances paid and pension entitlements gained by office holders were the subject of intensive discussion <Col N="328" /> and report by the Devlin Review Body that we all remember.  These comprehensive reports are still available.  It was not suggested at that time that there should be any change in the system of pensions paid to former office holders.  I make that point because I strongly hold the view that there should be an outside and separate role played by an independent body determining allowances and the level of salaries &mdash; they are classified as salaries and allowances under Statute.</P>
      <P>This business of Deputies in the House adopting unilateral, separatist, party political, perhaps understandably developed, viewpoints, putting them forward as a solution to a particular problem is not the right way to go about it.  One would not require much trade union experience or experience in the Public Service to see how flawed that approach really is.  I have expressed the view within and outside Government and to the review bodies that the system should be reformed.  My only interference in relation to this matter was when the Gleeson Review Body proposed a 15 per cent increase.  As Members of the Government sitting around the council chamber, we decided that we would not implement the 15 per cent increase and that was that. I recall the decisions of Deputy O'Malley and some of his colleagues who were Ministers at the time not to accept a Dáil pay increase.  We subsequently had to pay tax on it because it was a statutory allowance.  It was a rather interesting anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People learned from those occasions that the best way of resolving this matter was by way of an independent review body.  I recall proposing in Government the last members of the review body, distinguished persons, particularly the chairman, Dermot Gleeson, Senior Counsel, who replaced Liam St. John Devlin, who reported on many occasions on this matter and on the totality of the Public Service levels of remuneration and so on, and also distinguished members such as Evelyn Owens, deputy chairperson of the Labour Court, who was <Col N="329" /> nominated also on to the currently existing Gleeson Review Body.</P>
    <P>Having pointed out the wrong approach to this, I want to comment on the present position.  I have been paying, as a citizen and have been proud to do so since 1952, for 35 years, social insurance, ever since I entered employment.  Whenever I ceased to be employed as an insured person, I became a voluntary contributor.  I am currently paying on my Dáil salary 6.5 per cent as a voluntary contributor.  Hopefully I will continue paying it up to the age of 65, to give me cover for a retirement pension and an old age pension and to give cover for my wife and family for a widow's pension and dependant pensions.  Every time I went over the limit, I continued to pay as a voluntary contributor.  That is as it should be &mdash; we should pay for our pensions.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I have been paying, for the Houses of the Oireachtas superannuation scheme, 6 per cent of salary on top of the voluntary contribution since 1969, from entry into the Dáil.  That is as it should be.  I would have no objection whatever if the Minister for Finance told us tomorrow that the Exchequer subvention for the Houses of the Oireachtas superannuation scheme was in excessive deficit and that the contribution would have to be raised to 8 or 9 per cent.  I would pay because, whether I enjoy it or not myself, I have a fundamental responsibility to protect my family in terms of demise and there is also a responsibility devolving on Dáil Deputies, particularly those who have no other source of income.  One anomaly stands out in relation to the so-called pensions to former office holders and that is that they are non-contributory. Whatever else they should be, they should be contributory.  I believe in earned payments, earned pensions, earned by pay of contribution.</P>
    <P>This House is believed to be festooned with Deputies who get free drink, free or subsidised meals, free telephone, free envelopes and free travel at the expense of the taxpayer.  There is a public myth that Deputies are an elite species festooned with perks.  As we Deputies well know, particularly those of us who have <Col N="330" /> been here for a couple of terms, the reality is quite different but that should not give us any exemption from paying for the pensions that are paid to those who have held office.  Indeed, I have considerable sympathy for and appreciation of the merits of the amendment proposed by Deputy Noonan in which he suggests that there should be an examination of the incremental aspects in addition to the fortieths paid from the ordinary superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>He made some very sensible points.  I presume that the movers of the Bill before the House will give that matter some consideration before the debate on the Bill closes.  Having said that, I am also strongly of the view that the current review body should review the present level of remuneration.  I vividly remember, as a member of the Government, going to senior business management persons to ask them whether they would be prepared to accept positions as chief executives of certain bodies.  They laughed at the level of remuneration we were offering them.  Finally, the Government had to pick the sixth or seventh person on the list to take the job.  That was also in part a consequence of the decision not to pay the 15 per cent increase recommended by the review body for the Judiciary, the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies and Members of the Oireachtas.  That decision was published at the time.  There is a need to review the overall levels and, admittedly, this is an extremely sensitive matter, especially in terms of public service pay levels, but it is a matter which should not be shirked and one which requires examination.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to a rigorous examination of the current system of paying pensions to former office holders, particularly if it is related to, first, contributions, secondly, to the general scheme of pensions and, thirdly, to an examination of the age at which pensions are paid.  Age is important.  As we well know, in the Parliaments of Europe the members have to wait until they reach a particular age, in some cases it is 50 in others 55 and in others 60, before they <Col N="331" /> are entitled to draw a pension.  In the United Kingdom, a member has to be 65 before he can draw a pension.  In that sense, we are in a unique position.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill, as proposed, are simplistic in their approach.  When I entered this House in 1969, it was littered with morning lawyers who become politicians in the afternoon.  They used to run in from the front car park &mdash; there was none in the back at the time &mdash; having thrown off their Law Library gowns and rush into the Dáil to give it the benefit of a couple of hours of their wonderful legal competence.  We at that time had to live off what was a relatively low salary. Indeed, many of the politicians who entered this House decided to use their sojourn here to become lawyers and to go out to develop their incomes.  I never succumbed to that temptation because I believe that one should be a full time Deputy.</P>

      <P>I used to suffer a certain degree of jaundice when, as Minister for Health, I would go to visit a hospital and meet there in the role of head of security a former public servant aged perhaps 56 or 57 who was drawing a substantial pension from the public service.  I would say to myself that nobody ever referred to that kind of case.  It is not unknown that within the precincts of this House there are several such persons whose cases might merit a review, in the context of equity.  If it is going to be sauce for the political goose it should be sauce also for the general gander.  Again, I stress that I have no objection whatsoever to a major review of this particular anomaly, an anomaly which relates in particular to the lack of contributions.</P>

    <P>No party are more preoccupied with lower taxes and reduced contributions for State services than are the Progressive Democrats.  Therefore, I take our colleagues at their word and look forward to the day when their future office holders and perhaps their current ones would also <Col N="332" /> surrender their entitlements in regard to widowhood or to spouses.  I take it that that will be generously ceded also, presumably after consultation.  I look forward to a more rational discussion of what has been put forward here tonight. As far back as 1983 my party at two successive conferences adopted policy statements, long before the embryo was hatched in a Progessive Democrats PR exercise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Farrelly gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Ashbourne community school, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having given me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment this evening. The Minister of State present will be aware that this project first got the green light on 26 January 1982, when sanction was granted by the then Minister for Education for the provision of a second level school for Ashbourne and its catchment area.  Having overcome many hurdles early in June 1985 a 14.5 acre site to the rear of the community complex was purchased by the Department of Education. Later that month the local community advanced the option of a community school versus a community college or a diocesan school, when the Bishop of Meath agreed to participate as a trustee of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date stages 1 and 2 of the planning of the 650-pupil school has been completed. Stage 3 &mdash; the development sketch &mdash; is expected to be completed within the next couple of weeks.  Stages 4 and 5 were targeted to bring the project to tender stage by mid-summer this year. Over the period of years involved, the Department of Education co-operated in <Col N="334" /> every way possible with the second level school committee.  Indeed over the period of time when ever the committee wished to meet Ministers they were only too willing to do so, at the request of myself and Deputy J. Bruton, to ensure that the project was begun as quickly as possible.  The committee learned that in 1985, when the site was purchased, Meath County Council had no objection whatsoever to its acquisition and did not contend that its purchase would have any effect on the proposed by-pass of the town of Ashbourne.  However, this year the committee learned that there was some objection or problem raised. Officials of the Department of Education were to contact Meath County Council to sort out that problem five months ago. To date no meeting has taken place.  It is a minor problem affecting a small corner of the site only.  Had there been a commitment on the part of the present Government to have officials of the Department sort out the problem with Meath County Council the matter would have been resolved by now.</P>
    <P>The second level school committee now feel that the project has been shelved.  When the Coalition Government left office earlier this year there was no secret about the fact that the project was due to be started towards the end of this year with a completion date targeted for the school of 9 September 1989.  The Minister may not be aware that there are at present 650 pupils being transported out of Ashbourne every morning to 12 different schools, ten in Dublin and two in County Meath.</P>
    <P>I might point out that Ashbourne is one of the fastest growing towns in County Meath having over 3,000 on the voting register.  To date the cost of transporting children on a weekly basis has amounted to well over £2,000.  It will be seen clearly that the Minister has a role to play in ensuring that this project is brought to fruition.  I am amazed that a request by Senator Wallace and three Deputies in the constituency for a meeting of the school committee with the Minister or her Minister of State has been refused. The reply was to the effect that the <Col N="335" /> Department or Ministers themselves were not anxious to meet the committee at present.  This committee is one of the finest with which I have worked and deserves better treatment.</P>
    <P>If progress is not made on this project, then I believe my worst fears will be founded, which is that one of the fastest developing towns in County Meath will not have a second level school.  I do not believe there is another town in the country with a population of comparable size that has not got a second level school of some kind.  Indeed a local candidate in the last general election in the area, now a Senator, who sat in this Chamber over the summer period said that the Coalition Government had neglected the position, contending that Deputy John Bruton had no sympathy with the problem being encountered.  I doubt very much that the project would have reached the stage it had when the Coalition Government left office were it not for the work of Deputy John Bruton and I, along with the commitment of the then Minister for Education who saw the genuine need of the children and their parents in the Ashbourne area.</P>
    <P>The last leaflet circulated contended that this project must be brought to fruition, that, with Senator Mary Wallace having been elected to Seanad Éireann it would be.  That leaflet bore the names of Deputies Dempsey, Hilliard and Lynch. Three matters must be tackled immediately if there is a genuine will and commitment to ensuring that this project is brought to fruition as soon as possible. First, the Minister or her Minister of State must request their Departmental officials to sort out the problem of the site <i>vis-à-vis</i> the proposed by-pass.  The Department contend it constitutes a problem.  Speaking as a member of Meath County Council I contend that it is not a large problem, that one meeting would sort out the matter.  Second, I would ask the Minister of State to give a commitment here this evening to meet the second level school committee who have been involved in the project since 1980.  In 1980 they made a request to <Col N="336" /> meet the Minister, Deputy Wilson, and eventually in January 1982 they met Deputy John Boland who was then Minister. Later they met Deputy Hussey when she was Minister and the two different stages I mentioned were approved.</P>
    <P>A number of other developments had taken place and the Department had accepted a commitment from the council about the site, which was purchased in 1985.  It is an ideal site because of the community complex for which the Government before 1981 provided £100,000.  Children attending the school could use the community complex on a daily basis.  It would not cost the Department of Education any further money for the provision of such facilities.</P>
    <P>I am sad I have had to raise this matter because we had all expected that work would have commenced on this project before the end of the year.  I do not accept that the problem regarding the site could not be sorted out between the county council and the Department of Education, provided the senior Minister had the commitment to deal with the matter and arrange a meeting.  Two years ago an agreement in principle was made that there was no problem about the site but now the council have decided there is a problem.  I do not like to jump to conclusions but I hope the Department are not standing behind the council on this issue and using it as a way out of building the school.  The council had no objections in 1985 and that is why the Department agreed to buy the site in the first place.  I see Deputy Hilliard in the House and he is aware of the facts of this case since he was involved at the time the site was being purchased.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give a commitment to meet the committee on second level education, together with the public representatives, who should not be excluded.  I also ask for a commitment that the officials of the Department will contact the county council and sort out the problem relating to the by-pass.  This matter is costing the parents well over £2,000 per week and 650 children are being taken out of the town by bus to attend school, although Ashbourne is one <Col N="337" /> of the largest developing towns in the county.  We must consider the serious long term effect on property.  When people are considering moving to the town they ask about the water supply and sewerage and whether there are schools available.  The answer is that there are primary schools but there is no secondary school.  I do not think there is a town of comparable size anywhere in the country which has no second level school and I ask the Minister to give a commitment that the project will go ahead as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The new second level school which has been sanctioned for Ashbourne will cater for 650 pupils and will be a deed of trust type community school.  A school for 800 pupils was originally proposed.  The commencement of architectural planning was delayed because of difficulties in acquiring a site.  When the site was eventually agreed, the requirements for the area were reviewed by the planning section of my Department in the light of other developments proposed for the adjoining areas of Dunshaughlin and Dunboyne. The outcome was agreement that Dunboyne would get a separate school, that Dunshaughlin would not have an extension and that Ashbourne would get a new school for 650 pupils.  A briefing session was held in the Department with the design team in January 1986 and architectural planning is proceeding.  It is currently at stage III, the developed sketch scheme.</P>
      <P>I wish to clear up one or two matters mentioned by the Deputy.  There is no evidence on file of any great urgency with regard to the planning of this scheme over the past seven years.  The parents originally initiated this project in 1980 but it is now only at stage III.  This does not indicate any great urgency on the part of the previous Government.  I should not like the Deputy to infer that this project has been proceeding with any great haste prior to last March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it has taken seven years to get to stage III, it is quite clear that there has not been the degree of urgency one would have expected.  The site at Ashbourne is located beside an existing sports complex which will be available for school use.  This means that a separate physical education hall for the school is not required.  The area of the site purchased is 14.5 acres and is larger than what would normally be required for a school of this size.  The Department are considering the possibility of also locating a primary all-Irish school on part of the site, provided that this does not result in unacceptable restrictions being placed on the development of the community school.</P>
      <P>In April 1987 the Department were informed that Meath County Council were anxious to acquire a portion of the site for the proposed Asbourne by-pass route.  This was the first intimation the Department had of the county council's intention despite the fact that numerous discussions had been held heretofore with council officials regarding the site and its suitability for the proposed school.</P>
      <P>Planning of the school has been delayed pending the resolution of this-matter. To date the county council have refused to consider a request from the Department to alter the route of the road away from the site.  It is clear that if the county council proceed with the proposal it will mean that the all-Irish school could not be accommodated by this site and the layout of the community school facilities would have to be altered to accomodate the road.  While this need not necessarily alter the location of the main buildings, it would certainly result in increased costs because much work would have to be written off.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to make whatever efforts are necessary to make progress on this project.  I do not accept that the Department have been negligent since last April in their efforts to reach agreement.</P>

When these problems are resolved the rate at which this project, as well as all capital projects, may proceed will depend on the availability of capital.  The breakdown of the capital allocation for 1988 is now being examined by the Department in order to determine what projects, if any, may be allowed to proceed to the next stage of planning in the coming year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's statement about my failure to meet with the parents' committee, perhaps he would bring to my attention the request I got for such a meeting and the reply I gave indicating that I would not meet them.</P>

I am happy to meet them provided I have something worthwhile to discuss with them and that some progress can be made at such a meeting.  At this time I can make no progress by meeting the parents because we must first sort out the difficulties which exist between Meath County Council and the Department. As I said, I am anxious to have those difficulties sorted out and that we proceed with the planning of this project but let me make it clear that when the difficulties are sorted out we will have to look at the further planning of this project in view of the current financial position. However, that question has not arisen to date and it will not arise until we reach agreement with Meath County Council on this proposal which, as I said earlier, we were not informed about until as late as last April.  That is the present position. I am satisfied that the Department of Education have not in recent months neglected this project and that there has not been a slowdown with regard to its planning.  It is proceeding as it has done over the last number of years.</P>

      <P>IDA's company development programme, with appropriate participation by CTT, attempts to take an overall view of a company in order to build up the necessary technical, managerial and marketing expertise within the firm.  CTT's marketing schemes address specific marketing weaknesses in firms.

      <P>The concept of the development company referred to by the Deputy has not been fully tested by these agencies as it is felt desirable to assess the experience obtained from the various programmes initiated by both the IDA and CTT which are aimed at building up the strengths of companies.  Examples of such programmes are the company development programme and group marketing schemes.</P>

      <P>The board of the new agency will determine, in conjunction with me, the organisation and structure most suited to the tasks demanded of them, and will identify, and implement, possibilities for economies in staff numbers.  It would be premature, at this stage, to say what the staff complement of the new agency will be.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government announced on 31 July 1987 that in order to meet new challenges and to further enhance the development of the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly, they had decided to streamline and rationalise the structure of the State organisations dealing with the area and to extend the remit of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in the areas of <Col N="47" /> industry and tourism.  The decision reflects the Government's intention that the company should be given a more integrated and creative role in contributing towards national recovery in the region.</P>
    <P>The target date for implementation of the Government decision is 1st January 1988.  With effect from that date, it is intended that, in so far as industrial development is concerned, the functions exercised at present by the Industrial Development Authority in the region will be carried out by the Shannon Development Company.  The detailed arrangements to give effect to the Government decision are currently being worked out.</P>
    <P>I would wish to see how the Shannon Development decision works out in practice before considering any possible extension of the concept to other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Due to budgetary constraints, new advance factories are only constructed to meet the specific requirements of an individual project.  It is not, therefore, intended to construct a new advance factory in New Ross at this time.  The IDA are however, continuing to actively promote their 27.5 acre serviced site in the town for suitable projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that price competition benefits consumers.  However, I am concerned that short term supermarket &ldquo;price wars&rdquo;, which are based on the selling of certain grocery goods below cost, are not in the long term interest of consumers, manufacturers, small retailers or indeed of the retail grocery trade as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission concluded earlier this year that below cost selling is an unfair trading practice which is contrary to the common good.  I agree with this view and I have, accordingly, made an order under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 banning below cost selling and making certain other changes in relation to the regulation of the grocery trade.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the Bill to confirm this order will now receive a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Casual Trading Act, 1980 licences to trade are granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  However, the designation of casual trading areas and the granting of permits to trade within these areas are matters for each local authority in respect of their functional area.  In addition a local authority may attach such conditions as they deem appropriate to any permit granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Act of this type must represent a balance between different interests &mdash; permanent traders, casual traders and <Col N="49" /> consumers.  In general, such problems as have arisen in relation to casual trading since the Act was enacted relate to conflicts between different interests involved in particular areas rather than to any inadequacy in the statutory framework. Legislation cannot provide solutions to all potential problems; it can only provide a framework in which local problems can be dealt with in an orderly way.  I believe that the present Act provides such a framework and I have at present no plans to amend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The successful promotion of the purchase of Irish made goods is dependent on the development of strong, competitive, indigenous companies which can realistically compete, in both domestic and export markets, in terms of price, quality and reliability.  The extensive services and expertise of State agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council are available to assist Irish industry in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, I will be seeking Government approval shortly for a number of initiatives on import substitution aimed at further strengthening manufacturers in the home market.  The House will be aware, of course, that any such measures must be compatible with our EC obligations. While the Government seeks to give all possible support the Deputy will recognise that, ultimately, the main responsibility for selling Irish goods at home or abroad rests with Irish manufacturers themselves.  I would urge Irish buyers to give Irish consumers a real choice by seeking out and promoting Irish manufactured goods where these match <Col N="50" /> their foreign counterparts in quality, price and delivery.</P>

      <P>The Government made provision in section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, to encourage corporate investors by enabling them to secure taxation relief on investments in Irish-based film productions of up to £100,000 each year. Taxation relief on those lines had been sought by the industry on the grounds that a major input of investment capital <Col N="61" /> would be attracted to help Irish film production become a genuine business activity and produce a wide range of film projects.</P>
      <P>This new investment opportunity will complement existing tax-based incentives to investment in film-making.  Such incentives include:</P>
      <P>Film-making is taxed at a rate of only 10 per cent as compared to the normal corporation tax rate of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Investors in film-making companies can get relief from full rates of income tax on dividends.</P>
      <P>Film-making comes under the Business Expansion Scheme.</P>
      <P>The development of an indigenous Irish film industry will also be facilitated by various public sector bodies, including NADCORP, RTE and the Arts Council. NADCORP has already invested in excess of £0.5 million in the Irish film production sector and will continue to evaluate opportunities for further investments of venture capital in that sector. Under the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> RTE will divert £1 million to the independent film/video producing sector to produce more homeproduced programmes.  Finally, the Arts Council has a statutory function in relation to film and has operated a successful film scripts award scheme.</P>

      <P>The Government share the concern that exists about a number of cases in Britain in the seventies in which there is <Col N="65" /> evidence to suggest that there may have been a miscarriage of justice.</P>
      <P>The appeals in the Birmingham Six case are due to begin on 2 November next.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</P>
      <P>As regards the Guildford Four, the British Home Secretary, in response to my representations and the representations of others, has ordered a police inquiry into new evidence which has come to light.  I understand from the Home Secretary that he will decide in the light of this police investigation whether to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal.</P>
      <P>The position as regards the Maguire family case is that the Home Secretary is still of the view that no new matter has arisen to justify referral of the case to the Court of Appeal.</P>
      <P>While the case of Miss Ward is being kept under continuing review, the Government have not to date made any specific representation in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have consistently supported the demands of those convicted in the Birmingham, Guildford and Maguire cases for a review of their convictions. As I have said, the Birmingham <Col N="66" /> case is pending before the Court of Appeal and it would not be appropriate at this stage to comment further.  As regards the Guildford convictions, I have strongly urged the Home Secretary to refer the case to the Appeal Court.  Likewise, in the Maguire case, I have conveyed the view to the Home Secretary that, notwithstanding that no new evidence has come to light, the concern and misgivings expressed by, among others, the Government are such that the interests of justice require that these convictions also be reviewed.</P>

    <P>The overall aim of Government fiscal policy is to restore order to the public finances by bringing about in the first instance a stabilisation of the Debt/GNP ratio and a reduction in it thereafter. Fiscal policy will be geared to achieving the stabilisation objective by 1990 at the latest.  This will necessitate further reductions in borrowing over the next three years.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to reform of the tax system as to improve its equity and efficiency.  In particular, the Government intend to give additional tax relief to income taxpayers over the next three years in line with their commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published recently.  This commitment entails giving income tax reductions to the cumulative value of £225 million, including increases in the PAYE allowance costing £70 million.  In the context of this provision, the Government will make significant progress towards having two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate by adjustment of the 35 per cent band.</P>

    <P>The proportion of our national resources being pre-empted by debt service payments doubled in the decade to 1987. This gives the clearest indication of the need to reduce our reliance on borrowing and to restore order to the public finances. The first steps in this direction were taken by the Government in the March 1987 Budget and progress will be continued under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> so as to ensure that the growth of our national debt and its servicing cost will be brought into line with our ability to sustain them.</P>

      <P>A return of income form has been sent to the taxpayer and when he submits that form, duly completed, to the inspector of taxes, his correct liability (if any) for the current year will be determined.</P>

      <P>The bail money was lodged in the District Court on 23 September 1985 and was placed in an interest-bearing deposit account until 5 December 1985 when it was transferred to the Circuit Court in the normal course because the prisoner had been sent forward for trial to the latter court.  The interest which accrued up to the date of transfer of the money was paid to the prisoner.  In the Circuit Court the money was placed in a current account.  This is the normal procedure unless the person lodging the money requests that it be placed in a deposit account and no such request was made in this case.

      <P>A medical officer visits the prison each day except Sunday and is on call at all times.  In addition, arrangements are made for the offenders to attend hospital for tests, treatment etc. when required. A psychiatrist attends once a week and as required.  The services of a psychologist are available from Monday to Friday.  Representatives of various community based agencies involved with drug addiction visit the prison and are available to those who wish to avail of such contacts.  I should mention also that these offenders are housed in the recently renovated officers quarters where each cell has its own ablution and sanitation facilities.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to pursue the question of the transfer of the new Unit in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital to my Department.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny who was 66 years since 2 January, 1987, received payment of an old age pension from 22 February 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Under the provision of the scheme, payment of Old Age Pension commences from the first Friday after the date on which the claim is received, or from the first Friday after the date on which the claimant first becomes entitled to pension, whichever is the later.</P>
      <P>Although the person concerned was 66 on 2 January 1987 he only applied for pension on 17 February 1987 without any explanation for his late application. Accordingly, payment commenced from 23 February 1987, the Friday following the date of receipt of the claim.</P>

      <P>There is no trace of a claim having been received from the person in question in 1985.  A claim was received on 16 June 1987 in respect of a confinement on 24 April 1985.  The position is that it is prescribed by statutory regulations that a claim for Maternity Benefit must be made six weeks before the expected week of the confinement. Where a claim is not made within the prescribed time, and good cause for the failure to claim in time is shown, the claim may be accepted.  In such cases, however, payment may not be made in respect of any period more than six months prior to the actual date on which the claim is received.  The claim in question was over six months late.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of disability benefit from 6 December 1982 to 7 February 1987 when payment was disallowed following an examination by a medical referee who <Col N="131" /> expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His case was then referred to an appeals officer who decided that he was capable of work during the period from 9 February 1987 to 6 May 1987, the date of the latest medical certificate before him at the time, and was not entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of that period.</P>
      <P>No further medical evidence was submitted by the claimant until 7 September 1987, and a deciding officer again held that he was not incapable of work and was therefore not entitled to payment of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was notified of this decision on 30 September 1987 and was also informed of his right to appeal the deciding officer's decision within 21 days.  To date no letter of appeal has been received.</P>
      <P>However, if he does appeal the decision to disallow payment of benefit, arrangements will be made to have him examined by a medical referee.  His claim to disability benefit from 7 September 1987 will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was examined on 16 April 1987 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in nine months.  A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned appealed <Col N="132" /> against this decision and arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 16 October 1987.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of that examination.</P>

      <P>A letter dated 9 August 1987, in connection with a dental benefit claim, was received from the person concerned. The letter was acknowledged and has been receiving attention.  The position is that the person concerned was employed by a British company from August 1983 to November 1985 and, although he worked in this country, social insurance contributions deducted from his salary were paid to the British Department of Health and Social Security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of his claim to dental benefit his social insurance position was investigated and it was decided that under <Col N="133" /> EEC regulations his employment was insurable under the social welfare Acts. The British Department of Health and Social Security stated that it was not possible to transfer the contributions paid to them directly to the Department of Social Welfare and that the contributions would be refunded to the employers concerned. The question of collecting PRSI contributions due under the social welfare Acts is being pursued with the employers.</P>
    <P>In view, however, of the particular circumstances of this case pending completion of the inquiries, it has now been decided to treat the contributions as having been paid under the social welfare Acts and to approve the dental benefit claim.  Both the person concerned and the dentist have been notified accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decentralisation programme for my Department does not envisage the setting up of six regional centres outside of Dublin.  The programme as recently announced by the Government envisages the transfer of a <Col N="134" /> bloc of staff to Sligo and planning for this move is in progress.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, the Department are devising a range of measures to provide a more localised service for its clients. This is an ongoing programme involving practically all aspects of the Department's operations.  One-stop-shop facilities where claimants can inquire about and conduct the full range of their social welfare business are being provided in a number of the Department's local offices. In Cork recently a pilot scheme was begun of accepting medical certificates, which are normally posted to Dublin, from disability benefit claimants and keying them in directly to the Department's computers for processing and issue of cheques.</P>
      <P>It is intended over time to make facilities of this nature available as widely as possible throughout the country as resources allow.  This may require a strengthening of the Department's management at local and regional levels. However, decisions on this have not yet been taken as developments are still at an early stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the unfair assessment on small investments to social welfare applicants and particularly to non-contributory oldage pension applications; his views on whether this system of assessment is just; the steps if any, he proposes to take to rectify the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing means for entitlement to all social assistance payments account must be taken of the yearly value of capital which the the applicant may have.  In the case of the old age pension scheme the first £200 of capital is disregarded, the next £375 is assessed at 5 per cent and the balance at 10 per cent. Where the value assessed exceeds £52 a year or £1 a week an additional £1 a week is assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> The present system of assessment of capital allows persons with investments to qualify for pension.  For example, allowing for the fact that the first £6 of means, £12 in the case of a married couples, is disregarded in determining the level of pension payable, an applicant for an old age pension who is married can have capital of up to £5,975 invested and still qualify for a maximum pension. Applicants can have capital of up to £51,735 and still qualify for the minimum pension.</P>
    <P>The whole area of means testing for social assistance is currently being examined with a view to rationalising the different rules of assessment which apply under different schemes.  The method of <Col N="136" /> assessment of capital is being examined in that context.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 140 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> The national fuel scheme is intended to meet a current need for assistance with heating expenses and, in keeping with this intent, allowances under the scheme can only be allowed from the date of application.</P>
    <P>Extensive publicity, both by way of general media interest in the rationalisation being undertaken and by way of paid newspaper advertising has already been afforded to the scheme this year and further newspaper advertising is planned shortly.  It is not considered that television and radio advertising is necessary.</P>
    <P>Each of the health boards, who are responsible for administering the national fuel scheme for categories of recipients other than the unemployed, have already placed, or are about to place, advertisements &mdash; in the national newspapers in the case of the Eastern and Southern Health Boards and in the local newspapers in the case of the other boards.  These advertisements highlight the fact that fuel allowances are only payable from the date of application.</P>
    <P>The Department will shortly be placing further advertisements in the newspapers and, in addition, will be placing posters in local offices throughout the country publicising the scheme.</P>
    <P>The employment exchanges are responsible for the administration of this scheme for long term unemployment assistance recipients and application forms have been issued to all unemployment assistance recipients who may qualify under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Every effort has, therefore, been made to ensure that the scheme is widely published.</P>

    <P>In the case of Minister of State Brennan's civilian drivers, a third driver is employed on a temporary basis only, to replace another civilian driver who is on extended sick leave.  The salary figure shown above, represents the weekly salary of two civilian drivers plus the Department's contribution to the salary of the driver on sick leave.</P>
    <P>The function of the constituency office is to support and assist me in the organisation and running of constituency affairs and likewise the function of the private office is to provide the necessary services for the day-to-day running of my Department and to advise on current events and developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> At the moment 5,500 persons are employed in grant aided industry in 86 companies in the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>In addition the Tallaght Enterprise Centre has been very successful.  Eighteen units have been constructed comprising a total of 27,263 sq. ft. 12 of these units are occupied.  One office is used as a management administration office, two are reserved for projects and will be occupied in December.  Two units are currently being promoted.  In addition the Get Tallaght Working Group has been allocated 3,000 sq. ft. and is raising finance to fit out eight sub units for community projects.</P>
    <P>The enterprise centre is an ideal starting point for small companies and I understand that the IDA are optimistic that many of the projects will expand out of the centre and be replaced by other start up companies.</P>
    <P>Finally, during 1986 and 1987 IDA grants were approved for five medium/large sized projects in the Tallaght area which are expected to lead to approximately 320 jobs over five years. In addition, 12 small industry projects were approved for the area from January 1986 to date and have the potential to create 70 full time jobs by 1988.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the very sensitive, security, strategic and commercial considerations involved in relation to the resources in the case of my Department, I am satisfied that it is necessary to follow the practice of successive Ministers for Energy in asserting that it would not be in the national interest to publish the identity of the consultants employed in each particular assignment.  I can, however, give to the Deputy data on the number of consultants involved and the total fees paid to them:</P>
      <P>15 October 1986 to 14 October 1987: Petroleum Exploration and Development (7 individuals and 4 firms/organisations) &mdash; £180,000; Natural Gas Programme (3 individuals and 6 firms/organisations) &mdash; £426,000; Minerals Exploration and Development (1 individual and 1 firm/organisation) &mdash; £25,000; Miscellaneous (1 individual and 1 firm/organisation) &mdash; £24,000.

      <P>Statistics on the number of pollution incidents reported to, or investigated by local authorities, are compiled on an annual basis from returns submitted by local authorities.  Figures are not available for the number of incidents to date this year.</P>
      <P>The following tabular statement gives details in respect of water pollution incidents where local authorities have secured convictions this year.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate to identify offenders in the House.  In addition to the cases shown local authorities have initiated court proceedings this year in respect of a further 98 pollution incidents.</P>

      <P>The Environment Awareness Bureau, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is the Irish National Committee for European Year of the Environment and a sum of £230,000 including a special supplement of £100,000 for EYE, has been provided from the Environment Vote to meet the expenses of the Bureau in 1987.  Information on the amount of money being provided at local authority level for EYE projects is not available and authorisation of such expenditures by my Department does not arise.  Approximately £360,000 has so far been allocated from the EC budget towards environmental awareness activities organised or backed by the <Col N="181" /> national committee.  These activities have also received substantial sponsorship from the private sector for a variety of EYE projects.</P>
      <P>A number of my Department's activities also have an EYE dimension.  These include the urban renewal programme, the Custom House Docks project and the designated areas programme, the grants totalling £500,000 towards major parks projects, the implementation of the Air Pollution Act and the Clean-Up Ireland Campaign last May.  In addition, my Department has asked local authorities and other Government Departments to draw up programmes consistent with the objectives of EYE.  These programmes are outlined in the booklet published by the National Committee entitled &ldquo;A Strategy for the European Year of the Environment&rdquo;, a copy of which is available in the library.</P>
      <P>Research is not a prime objective of EYE.  However, I expect that a considerable body of documentation will be produced in the framework of EYE.  I will make available to the Deputy a list of documents which have come to my notice to date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the tourist industry centered on inland fishing in the area of Lough Sheelin, County Cavan, is now at serious risk as a result of the continued pollution of the lake; the proposals, if any, he has to take action to reverse the present disastrous situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the condition of the lake has deteriorated and of the possible implications of this.  The problem in the lake has historically been associated with the spreading of pig slurry and there is little doubt that this has been the major source of the nutrient load entering the lake and the adjoining streams.</P>
      <P>The Lough Sheelin Management Committee is at present finalising slurry management plans for the major pig producers in the catchment.  These plans will quantify the extent of the problem and will determine where and when slurry spreading can take place, as well as the rate of application of slurry at any one time.  The committee has to date received a high degree of co-operation from producers in this task.  Cavan County Council, which is the statutory authority for water pollution control in the area, recently issued notices to pig producers under Section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 banning spreading during November, December and January of the coming winter and restricting it during this month and next February.</P>
      <P>The local authority has also used its powers under the 1977 Act to require an industrial plant in the catchment to install phosphorous removal facilities in its effluent treatment plant.  This will have the effect of further reducing the phosphorous input to the lake.</P>
      <P>Cavan County Council are investigating other point and non-point discharges which could be having an effect on the condition of the lake with a view to taking appropriate remedial action if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> The need for further action in relation to the Lough Sheelin catchment and similar areas is being considered by the Cabinet Committee on Water Pollution which has been meeting under my chairmanship.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement on the campaign, if any, that is being undertaken to promote road safety and, in particular, against drinking and driving; the moneys allocated for such campaigns for 1985, 1986 and 1987; the amount estimated for 1988; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of the public awareness aspects of road safety generally is the primary role of the National Road Safety Association, which operates under the aegis of my Department.  On 28 August, 1987, I announced that the Association, the Fire Prevention Council and the Irish Water Safety Association <Col N="191" /> would be merged into one safety body, with effect from 1 January 1988.</P>
      <P>Since 1978, the NRSA has been particularly active in promoting public awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving, especially at the Christmas and New Year periods.  During this summer, the Association also undertook a drink/driving campaign in conjunction with the Irish Insurance Federation.  I am satisfied that these campaigns, combined with Garda enforcement of the drink/driving laws have had considerable success in reducing the number of drinkrelated road accidents and in bringing about a desirable change in social tolerance of the drinking/driver.</P>
      <P>Detailed analysis of road accidents support this view.  Between 1978 and 1986, road deaths generally declined by 39 per cent and injuries by 17 per cent.  Of even greater significance, however, is the reduction that occurred between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., the hours which are most associated with drink related accidents.  The number of fatal and injury accidents during these hours declined by 29 per cent overall and the proportion of all accidents occurring during the same hours fell from a third to a quarter.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures of road deaths for the first eight months of 1987 show that the overall downward trend in road fatalities since 1978 has been reversed to some extent.  The number of persons killed at 287 shows an increase over that for the same period in 1986.  As far as drink/driving is concerned, a preliminary analysis of the figures indicates that the proportion of fatalities occurring between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. has remained close to the 1986 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of the NRSA are funded principally from State grants.  The amounts of such grants were £558,000, £594,000 and £613,000 for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 respectively.  The association's income is also supplemented by cash sponsorship or contributions from the private sector.  These amounted to £31,000 in 1985 and £62,000 in 1986.  The <Col N="192" /> State grant provision for the new safety body for 1988 is £400,000.</P>

      <P>A statement outlining the present and projected financial position of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was received in my Department at the end of July this year.  While not making a formal application for a specific increase in premium rates, this document detailed the consequences of several policy options as viewed by the board and has formed the basis for an on-going series of exchanges between my Department and the board. These discussions have also included a number of other options which I wished to have evaluated before reaching a decision; I hope to issue this decision shortly.</P>
      <P>I am also considering in this context the board's annual accounts and report for the year ended 28 February 1987, and expect to lay them before the Dáil in the near future.</P>

Six personnel sustained minor injuries in the explosion; two of the injured personnel were admitted to hospital and discharged the following day and four were treated locally by battalion medical personnel.</P>
      <P>The explosion was caused by explosive devices placed against the supporting pillars of the house.  Investigations by the UNIFIL authorities have failed, to date, to establish responsibility for the incident.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.  The building project, comprising three classrooms and a general purposes area, for Rathmore national school, County Kildare, had been listed for preparation of working drawings, which would in due course form part of the tender documentation.  It will not, however, be possible to advance this project further at the present time because of pressure on my Department's capital provision.  In the shorter term my Department has been in touch with the chairman of the school board of management on the question of grant-aid for two prefabricated classrooms to relieve the school's immediate accommodation needs and for improvements to the existing building.  It is understood that this offer is acceptable and that the way is clear for the invitation of tenders for the work.</P>
      <P>My Department's Primary Buildings Branch will advise the chairman of the board as to when it may be possible to continue processing the scheme of permanent building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen no evidence of widespread concern about this matter.  In the case of national schools, a board of management may, under the terms of Rule 59 of the Rules for National Schools, authorise the closure of a school where the board is satisfied that the circumstances warrant it, provided the school remains in operation for a minimum of 184 school days.  School closures for religious ceremonies at the start of <Col N="230" /> the school year may be authorised under Rule 59.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, the position is that subject to my Department's regulations in regard to the minimum number of days on which schools are required to be in operation in the school year, the decision as to whether to close the school on any particular day is basically a matter for the management authorities of the individual schools.</P>
      <P>As my Department does not recognise the day in question as a day on which those schools are in operation it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the question of when such ceremonies should be held.</P>
