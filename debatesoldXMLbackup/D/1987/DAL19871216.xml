      <P>On No. 19, may I ask if this effectively means that amendments that have been placed by Deputies other than the Minister will not be voted on at any stage and how are the amendments placed by other Deputies to be dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  They may be dealt with but if they have not been dealt with by 10 p.m. then the only amendments dealt with at that time will be amendments put down by the Government. That is the standard procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In trying to elicit some information from the Taoiseach and the Government I will remind the Taoiseach that on many occasions in the past four years when he was Leader of the Opposition he quite correctly reminded the Government that important statements should be made in this House.  In that context I ask him if a statement will be made in the House in relation to the proposal to abolish the drugs refund scheme as this is the correct venue for such a statement of importance and many thousands of people will be affected by its abolition.  I ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health to confirm to the Members of this House if the scheme will be abolished as and from 1 January, whether regulations need to be brought before the House and, if necessary, when will those regulations be introduced?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will now confirm that the drugs refund scheme is going to be abolished on 1 January.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from a suggestion I made on Committee Stage that there should be a statement from the Minister if he had failed to act within 12 months on the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission for the making of an order in respect of a particular matter.  There have been considerable delays in respect of orders <Col N="2400" /> recommended by the Restrictive Practices Commission in regard to the ban on advertising and the restrictions on conveyancing by the legal profession and also in respect of the travel trade.  The delays in this case arose from the fact that, although orders had been recommended by the Commission to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Government's advice on legal aspects was that the matter should properly be dealt with by means of principal legislation sponsored by another Minister. The result was that the matter was passed to another Minister and there has been considerable delay.</P>
      <P>This amendment which the Minister is sponsoring would require him to make a statement within 12 months giving reasons for any delay in the making of an order in regard to something recommended by the Commission.  This provides some measure of accountability and follow-up in regard to any matter that would fall behind, so to speak.  I welcome the amendment by the Minister which is based on a suggestion I made on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;Section 8 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(e) amend, after consultation with all other Ministers concerned and with the agreement of the Government, any legislation, whether that be the responsibility of the Minister or of any other Minister, if this is necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the same problem to which I have just referred.  A number of recommendations have been made after considerable debate and examination by the Restrictive Practices <Col N="2401" /> Commission which have not as yet been acted upon because the Minister receiving the report &mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; was advised that he did not have the means of implementing the recommended orders since these were matters properly to be dealt with, in the view of the law officer of the Government, by principal legislation sponsored by another Minister.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the delays in getting rid of the ban on advertising by solicitors and also the delays in acting on the recommended removal of the restrictions on conveyancing by solicitors. These matters were referred to the Department of Justice for action in the form of an amendment to the Solicitors' Act which has not yet come before this House.  There is no clear indication as to when it will be introduced.  The result is that a recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission dating back to 1982 remains to be implemented because the Minister receiving the report was unable to deal with the matter by order as envisaged by the commission.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce the power to make the necessary changes by order but there is a safeguard that he must first consult with all other Ministers concerned &mdash; in the case of the solicitors it would be the Minister for Justice &mdash; and have the agreement of the full Government for the making of the order.  Even with that consultation, the matter would be dealt with much more quickly than relying on principal legislation sponsored by another Minister because it would be dealt with as a single issue arising out of a single report.  If it were left to other Ministers to deal with the recommendation, they would not do so other than in the context of another Bill which would contain all sorts of unrelated matter in respect of which there might be considerable delays at Cabinet or in drafting.  This is, of course, the case with the Solicitors' Act.  The problems holding up that Act are not related to the recommendations made by the Restrictive Practices Commission but are related to other matters which the Department <Col N="2402" /> of Justice have to consider.  The result is that nothing has been done about these recommendations because the Department of Justice are considering other aspects as well.  This amendment would allow the Minister, after due consultation with other Ministers and with the Government, to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister cited a court case involving the Cityview Press as a reason for his reluctance to deal with the amendment then proposed.  The judge said in that case that it was not possible to deal with something by order other than in respect of a matter which had been envisaged in the principal legislation. That is not a problem in regard to the Restrictive Practices Act or orders made thereunder.  The potential scope of orders is extremely wide-ranging, so much so that I have had occasion earlier in this debate to criticise it as unduly wide-ranging.  There is no basis as I understand it, at least from the extracts of the Cityview Press judgment as quoted by the Minister, for failing to act on this amendment.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which will become more and more acute, unless dealt with by this amendment, as a result of other changes made in this Bill.  Under this Bill the powers of investigation of the Restrictive Practices Commission are being extended into a whole host of sectors which are currently regulated by Ministers other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They are being extended into the entire transport area which is regulated by the Minister for Tourism and Transport by law for which he is responsible, into the banking area which is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and into other areas which are the responsibility of other Ministers. A Minister who has received a report on air transport, for example, recommending that an order be made may be told he cannot do it that way but must wait for air transport legislation.  That Minister and the consumer, who are concerned to see the implementation of the recommendations of the commission, could be waiting for years because such legislation might not be introduced until <Col N="2403" /> Aer Lingus next needed an increase in their capital or some other matter arose totally unrelated to the recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment the particular matters dealt with in the report of the commission, the abuses which are to the detriment of the consumer, could be dealt with on their own by an order after consultation with the Minister for Transport and the entire Government.  It could be done quickly under delegated legislation.</P>
    <P>It might be said that dealing with it under delegated legislation rather than by a principal amendment to the Principal Act &mdash; in this case the Air Transport Act &mdash; would deny this House the opportunity of debating the subject.  That argument is not valid because any order made under the Restrictive Practices Act must be debated and approved in this House by an affirmative motion before it takes effect.</P>
    <P>Within the context of my amendment there is more than adequate protection for every legitimate interest before the order would be implemented.  First, the Minister must consult with any other Ministers concerned, second, he must obtain the agreement of the Government and, third, the order itself must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, it is almost as extensive a form of consultation as would arise under principal legislation but it can be dealt with much more quickly and orders that would otherwise remain unimplemented can be implemented. Having considered the matter over the last week since conclusion of Committee Stage, I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting this amendment on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indeed considered this matter since the conclusion of Committee Stage.  In this amendment Deputy Bruton is proposing an amendment to section 8 of the 1972 Act which essentially would allow the Minister, with the agreement of the Government, to amend by order any other legislation, <Col N="2404" /> whether primary or secondary, if that were deemed necessary to give effect to any recommendation of the commission.</P>
      <P>When this amendment was discussed on Committee Stage I said it was very far reaching.  I have considered the matter further and have come to the conclusion that I could not accept the amendment without discussing it in detail with my Cabinet colleagues and without formal approval of the Government.  I know Deputy Bruton will appreciate the time entailed in going through that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment has the superficial attraction that it would permit recommendations of the commission to be put into effect by the Minister regardless of the existence of other legislation. However, that other legislation does exist in a number of areas.  It would be a recipe for chaos for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to seek to amend legislation which is the responsibility of other Ministers.  Indeed it would strike at one of the basic principles of proper public administration that, within the overall collective responsibility of Government, Ministers should have clear and distinct lines of responsibility.  I believe it is wrong to approach this subject on the basis that competition law, important though it may be, is superior to any of the other public policy concerns which are expressed in the law.  For example, the prudential supervision of banks is provided for in the Central Bank Acts while the Solicitors Act deals with questions relating to the maintenance of adequate qualifications and standards for solicitors. These and other Acts may have provided an undue degree of protection in the past to the providers of various services and may have been used to excessively stifle or restrict competition.  However, that in itself does not justify giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce responsibility for promoting legislation which determines the correct balance between these different public policy considerations. Neither the commission nor my Department can claim a particular expertise in any of the various areas which are the responsibility of other Ministers.  Other Departments have built <Col N="2405" /> up a fund of knowledge and expertise and are responsible for the administration of the functions of Ministers in a wide variety of areas.  I could not see how good public administration would be served by the Minister for Industry and Commerce seeking, for instance, to amend the Central Bank Acts, the Building Societies Acts, various Transport Acts and any of the myriad of other items of legislation which might be affected at any stage by recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>My Department could not possibly hope to master the implications of such legislative changes in the operation of the financial system, the impact on the national housing programme, the implications for international transport agreements or the effect on any other range of issues which might arise from amending legislation such as that to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The amendment accepts the interest and responsibility of other Ministers and the Government as a whole in any proposed legislation.  The fact of the matter is that no proposal for legislation can be advanced by any Minister without Government approval.  If that approval is forthcoming the most logical and sensible approach is for the Minister responsible to promote the legislation in question.  If Government agreement is not forthcoming even the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot promote the legislation in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred last week to the delays which can arise when other Departments decide on the priority to be attached to any legislation recommended by the commission.  The fact of the matter is that it is the Government who determine the priority for legislation.  Making one Department responsible for all the legislation which might arise from recommendations of the commission will not speed up their implementation.  Already my Department have a very heavy legislative workload.  Progress in that regard will not be helped by taking on the responsibilities of other Departments.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment however attractive it <Col N="2406" /> appears superficially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments advanced by the Minister do not stand up at all.  Let me deal with them in sequence. First, he said that this amendment could constitute a recipe for chaos.  Of course, that is not true because the amendment contains a provision for consultation with the Cabinet and other Minister in regard to this matter.  Under Cabinet procedure instructions, if the Minister were sponsoring an order, he would be required to consult with other Ministers, in writing, before that matter came to Cabinet.  A draft of the order with the memorandum would be circulated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to all the other Departments for observations, including the Departments directly affected.  The matter could not come to Cabinet until the observations of the other Departments had been provided thereon in writing for consideration of the Cabinet.  The Cabinet would decide on this matter after exactly the same level of consultation as would occur if the Minister directly concerned were sponsoring the matter. Therefore, the argument that it would be a recipe for chaos is unbelievable and is in direct conflict with what the Minister himself acknowledged to be safeguards built into this amendment in respect of consultation with other Ministers and the agreement of the Government being first required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister claimed also that his Department would not have the expertise to deal with the matter in question.  I might say, first, that this would be no ordinary matter with which they would be dealing.  They would be dealing with this matter on the basis of a recommendation from the Restrictive Practices Commission which would have published an exhaustive study on the subject. Therefore in drafting the order, there would be a published body of expertise on this matter available to the Minister. In any event the procedures under Cabinet instructions, whereby any such orders to be made would first have to be approved by the Government and, prior to that, would have been circulated for <Col N="2407" /> written observation to the Departments directly concerned &mdash; who might have the expertise that the Minister's Department would not have &mdash; would take care completely of any concerns in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister's third argument against this amendment was that the taking on of responsibility for making orders of this kind could conceivably interfere with the legislative programme of his Department. Of course this is manifest nonsense. As the Minister well knows the position is that, generally speaking, a draft order is provided with the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission. Therefore, the level of drafting required would be relatively minimal.  All his Department would be concerned with anyway would be the policy implications of the recommendation.  The drafting of the order is done by the draftsman's office and not by the Minister's Department, so there would be no interference whatever with the legislative programme of his Department.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Minister has no arguments against this amendment other than the fact that he has not bothered to consult with the Cabinet in the time available to seek approval for what would be a sensible amendment in the interests of consumer protection and of getting action on this matter.  Even at this stage the Minister ought to consider this matter further with a view to introducing amending legislation.  Unfortunately, there will be a long process to be gone through now that this opportunity has been passed up to deal with this matter in that new legislation &mdash; were it to be introduced &mdash; would have to take its place in a long queue.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Minister failed to deal with any of the arguments I advanced in regard to extending the scope of this legislation and the fact that, as a result thereof, the work of the Restrictive Practices Commission will be much more in areas where the principal legislation is the responsibility of other Ministers.  This problem of not being able to act on orders because it is the responsibility of other <Col N="2408" /> Minister will be much more acute in the future.</P>
    <P>I consider that the Minister has most unwisely lost an opportunity of dealing with a problem which will be an increasing source of frustration to consumers and I fear that action will not be taken on expensively-produced and widelypublicised reports.  It is my opinion that failure to act will do no good for the political process.  Furthermore, it is my belief that the Minister will serve to be reminded of his failure to avail of this opportunity.</P>

One does not go in on a fundamental issue of changing primary and secondary legislation and have a chat at the Cabinet table and expect to get a decision.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>18.&mdash;Section 18 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a copy of the report made by the Commission of every inquiry under section 5 or section 9 and of every special review under section 10 within four months of the receipt by him of such report.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to require the Minister to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas each report of an <Col N="2410" /> inquiry in a special review held by the Fair Trade Commission within four months of his receipt of the report.  The Restrictive Practices Commission, which will be renamed the Fair Trade Commission, have already been strengthened by the addition of a third full time member, and this Bill will further strengthened their powers.  I think it is fair to expect an improvement in the timescale in which inquiries are held and, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, evidence of such an improvement has already been seen with receipt of five reports from the commission in 15 months.</P>
    <P>In the light of this it is probably reasonable to put pressure also on the Minister in relation to the time he takes to publish the Fair Trade Commission reports. When a report is received from the commission the Minister has to have the report printed and he may have to consult with other Departments or other interested parties about the commission's recommendations before he can evaluate the recommendations and assess the report.  Bearing this in mind I feel that a period of four months should be accurate and consequently I am proposing the insertion of an amendment to this effect. The Deputy will probably go along with that.</P>

Provided the information is <Col N="2411" /> available I wonder if it needs to be formalised in the way suggested by the amendment, or if that in some way detracts from either attention to or resources for the main job of dealing with abuse, inquiries and so on.  In other words, I would not be too hung up about a formalised presentation of reports in the Library provided I can get the information by telephone call or a visit.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Section 26 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 is hereby amended by the deletion in subsection (4) (a) of `and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House' and the substitution therefor of `and the order shall not be made until the following provisions have been complied with:</P>
      <P>(i)  Dáil Éireann has not passed a resolution annulling the draft of the order within twenty-one sitting days of its having been laid before that House, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  Seanad Éireann has passed a resolution approving of the draft.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2412" /> Again this is a matter that has been discussed on Committee Stage.  There has been some delay in obtaining parliamentary time for the debate and approval of orders under the Consumer Information Act.  In particular, an order made last March in regard to the true rate of interest on consumer credit transactions was not put into effect until last month because of difficulties in obtaining time for its debate here in the Dáil. However, there was no difficulty in obtaining time for its debate in the Seanad.  My amendment would allow debates to continue in the Seanad where the legislative programme is less pressed but remove the requirement for an affirmative motive and debate on the orders here in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>My amendments differ from the Minister's in that his simply requires that the orders are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas without any required debate in either House.  My amendment would provide for debate in the Seanad.  I prefer my amendment because there is value in any consumer protection legislation getting a measure of publicity in the press and among legislators who are dealing with consumers as part of their work.  The debate in the Seanad, which my amendment would retain, would meet the publicity requirement while the removal of the requirement for a debate in the Dáil would speed up the making of the orders and avoid the type of delay which occurred in the recent case.  I hope the Minister can accept my amendments as I think they are preferable to his. However, I am not prepared to oppose his amendment in the event that he cannot accept mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On balance, I prefer the Minister's amendment.  First, the thrust of Deputy Bruton's amendment, to remove the need for an affirmative resolution but nevertheless allow the Seanad to debate and pass such a resolution, may be appropriate as of now in certain circumstances.  But we are passing legislation here for decades and there is no certainty that either the timescale of the <Col N="2413" /> Seanad or, if some parties had their way, the existence of the Seanad will continue.</P>
      <P>Second, there is something a little unhappy about a situation where what I would see as the principal legislative forum does not have the obligation to pass a resolution but it has to be, according to Deputy Bruton's amendment, passed in the Seanad.  I am not happy about that slightly anomalous juxta-position.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Minister's amendment, if I read it correctly and am interpreting it correctly, seems to say that he can get on with the job of making orders and that they shall be laid before the House as soon as possible unless there is an annulling resolution introduced here, and that seems sensible.  I argued earlier in the debate for freeing the Minister's hands to get on with the job without having to wait for a debate in this House on a thing like making an order which I see as a subsidiary element of the Minister's work.  I would be for giving the Minister greater freedom.  I am not sure if Deputy Bruton's undoubtedly well intentioned and well orientated amendment is not a little more circumscribing than what the Minister is proposing.  For that reason the Minister's is probably more correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton proposed two alternative amendments on Committee Stage.  The purpose of these amendments was to speed up the process for enacting orders under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. On Committee Stage I agreed to take on board the first of the amendments which would speed up enormously the enactment of these orders.  The amendment which I am now proposing provides that an order made under either the Consumer Information Act, 1978, or the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, would be laid before the Dáil and Seanad and that the order could be annulled by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days after the order had been so laid.</P>

    <P>The current procedure is that a draft <Col N="2414" /> of any proposed order must be approved by resolution of both Houses.  This arrangement has given rise to delays in making orders.  For instance, as pointed out on Committee Stage and referred to here by Deputy Bruton, the most recent such order relating to consumer credit was approved by the Dáil earlier this month, over 13 months after it had been first laid before this House.  Delays are caused by difficulties in finding time on the Order Paper for debates on these matters, which are generally straightforward and non-contentious.  The procedure which I am now proposing is a standard provision in many Acts, including some in the consumer protection area such as the Prices Act, 1958, and the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the object of approving orders by negative clearance is to speed up the process of enacting legislation and at the same time to give Deputies and Senators a chance to propose a motion to annul the provisions of an order if they feel that this is necessary The result of the amendment proposed by me is that when the Minister signs the order it will have effect from that date of signing and continue to have effect unless it is annulled by a motion in either House. Deputy Bruton's amendment proposed that a draft order should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this case the order would not have the effect of law until 21 sitting days had expired and a resolution approving the draft order had been passed by the Seanad. This arrangement would be almost as cumbersome and time-consuming as the present one.  For instance, if the Minister makes an order any time between midMay and July, it would be mid-December before 21 sitting days would have expired because the Dáil does not normally resume after the summer recess until about mid-October.  This would mean a delay of almost six months before the order would take effect.  Admittedly, it is better than what happened to the last order but still not as good as the amendments I propose.  I would stress again the this amendment will give immediate effect to a ministerial order, whereas <Col N="2415" /> Deputy Bruton's amendment could continue to prove cumbersome and delay introduction of these orders.</P>
    <P>It is important that Deputies and Senators he aware of all legislation being introduced.  I am satisfied that with regard to these orders this will be the case.  These orders must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Notice of intention to make an order under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, must be published two months in advance of making the order together with a statement summarising the effect of the order. Notice of the making of an order must be published in at least one daily newspaper and in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  There would also be a certain amount of press coverage relating to the introduction of such order and Deputies and Senators would have an opportunity to study the order and propose an annulment if necessary.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Bruton's proposal that orders should be debated only in the Seanad, as I have indicated on Committee Stage, I would not be entirely happy with that concept.  My Department have examined this question further in consultation with the Attorney General's Office and although the proposed amendment may not be expressly outlawed by the Constitution, there is no precedent in legislation for an arrangement such as this.  This is the primary House and if the matter is to be discussed it should be discussed in both Houses.  As regards publicity coming from the Seanad, unless the Seanad is sitting when the other House is not, it does not get much publicity. On balance, my more appropriate amendment would, it is hoped, meet the wishes of the House and Deputy Bruton in that we are all agreed that we are trying to speed up the procedure and get our business done properly in a more expeditious manner.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I am not going to press my amendments.  The case has been made on either side.  I <Col N="2416" /> prefer my approach, but I see merit in what the Minister has said also in favour of his amendment.  There is just one point that I should like to raise.  This speeds up the provisions for the making of orders under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and also the Consumer Information Act.  The order-making powers under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act have hardly been used at all.  In particular, it is necessary, for provisions in regard to the giving of a certificate of road worthiness for a motor vehicle that has been sold to take effect, that the Minister should make an order under that legislation.  I understand that the provisions of this 1980 Act are not effective in the absence of such an order having been made.  This matter was referred to in a recent publication on the subject of law and social policy.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that matter and see if there is a problem there.  It is hoped that this provision will allow him, if he makes such an order, to get it into effect more quickly.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Section 20 of the Act of 1980 is hereby amended by the insertion in the Table thereto of the following new section:</P>
      <P>35A.&mdash;(1) If the buyer&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  has the right to reject the goods by reason of a breach on the part of the seller that affects some or all of them, but</P>
      <P>(b)  accepts some of the goods, including, where there are any goods unaffected by the breach, all such goods,</P>
      <P>he does not by accepting them lose his right to reject the rest.</P>
      <P>(2) In the case of a buyer having the right to reject an instalment of goods, subsection (1) above applies as if references to the goods were references to the goods comprised in the instalment.</P>
      <P>(3)  For the purposes of subsection (1) above, goods are affected by a breach if by reason of the breach they are not in conformity with the contract.</P>
      <P>(4)  This section applies unless a contrary intention appears in, or is to be implied from, the contract.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  At the moment, if goods are not of merchantable <Col N="2418" /> quality the consumer is entitled, if he is acting as a consumer and buying the goods as distinct from acting in trade, to reject the goods and he is entitled to get his money back.  In practice, there are difficulties in enforcing this legislation because of the absence of a small claims court.  If a trader refuses to give the money back, the consumer is reduced to waving the Act at him if that consumer happens to know about the provisions therein, which in most cases he will not.  If he does know about them, he must go to a solicitor and initiate legal proceedings.  In practice, the legislative protections are not sufficiently effective.</P>
    <P>The most effective thing that a consumer can do to get his rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act is to make enough noise in the shop in the presence of other customers so that the shopkeeper will be obliged to do something about giving him his money back although that could lead the consumer into conflict with the law in other areas.  In practice, the protection contained in the Act is not very strong.  Most reputable businesses do abide by the law voluntarily.</P>
    <P>This amendment would improve the provisions as far as the consumer is concerned. At the moment, if the consumer accepts as of merchantable quality some of the goods that are part of a series of goods being supplied under the same transaction he must accept the rest. Under this amendment he would have the right of partial rejection.  If some of the goods were not up to standard he could reject those and accept others and pay the bill <i>pro rata</i>.  This is an improvement in the law that has been recommended by the Law Commission in Britain and the Scottish Law Commission. It amplifies and improves our existing protection and I hope that the Minister can accept it.  In case he has any worries about the drafting, it is based on the report of the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Commission in Britain.  It is not based on any feverish activity of my legal imagination.  While I am not sure which form of drafting the Minister would prefer, he might be safer <Col N="2419" /> with the recommendation of the Law Commission in Britain and I hope that he can accept this amendment, which would be a modest improvement on the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>

      <P>An amendment similar to this was tabled by Deputy Bruton and withdrawn by him on Committee Stage following debate.  In the course of that debate, I outlined the reasons for my not being disposed to accept this amendment. The amendment proposed the introduction of a right of partial rejection in relation to the sale of goods.  Where under existing law the buyer has a right to reject goods because of a breach of contract by the seller, he could under this amendment accept some of the goods but would not by so doing lose his right to reject the rest.  On Committee Stage I indicated that I felt there might be some merit in Deputy Bruton's suggestion. However, as it based on only one of several recommendations made in the United Kingdom recently by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, I suggest that it might be unwise to isolate this one recommendation from others which might be relevant. However, I suggested that the situation to which the amendment related might not in fact be a real problem in practice. I did, however, agree to look further at the suggestion before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of further examination of the matter it was noted that the UK Commission in their report emphasised that they do not intend that the buyer should have the right of partial rejection unless he would have been entitled to reject the whole.  They point out that the right to reject the whole may be lost by <Col N="2420" /> virtue of the rules on acceptance contained in their Sale of Goods Act.  It should be pointed out that those rules on acceptance differ from the law on acceptance here and obviously the implications of such a difference would have to be examined in greater depth.  Also, in discussions with the UK authorities they have indicated that it has been represented to them that there may be difficulties with the right of partial rejection in particular cases and those authorities are currently considering whether such a right as recommended by the Law Commission is appropriate.  In general, therefore, while there may be much merit in the Deputy's suggestion it warrants a much wider and fuller examination than has been possible in the time since the amendment was tabled.</P>
    <P>In practice what normally happens to a great extent is that if the buyer rejects only a part and if there is no agreement to take it back the seller will lose business as a result.  There would be no return orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies where dealing with traders but not so much when dealing with consumers in that they would not be interested in return orders as much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not go back to the same place again.  There may be exceptions but if you go into a high fashion store in Dublin and find that you have to return part of what you bought there and the store are not too interested in dealing with you you will not go back a second time.  In practice it can be different from what we are talking about and I have set out fairly and squarely the reasons.  This is only a recommendation which was not been implemented in the UK.  Our situation is different.  I think that is a fair response.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said about the difficulties in coming to a decision on the implications of this amendment in the light of the differences between the laws governing acceptance in the two jurisdictions. <Col N="2421" /> However, I point out to the Minister that the opportunity for introducing amendments of this kind will pass with the passing of this legislation because the Minister will face considerable difficulty in getting another Bill concerning the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act onto the list of Government priorities.</P>
      <P>The original set of amendments in regard to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act originated in the report of a commission set up by the National Prices Commission who reported in 1972. The actual legislation did not become law until 1980, eight years later.  The same type of delay is likely to arise in this case. It is a pity the Minister is unable to use this legislative vehicle to tidy up any difficulties there are in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act and in the Consumer Information Act rather than put the matter on the long finger, which could be a very long finger indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>All that I can say in response is that the matter will not be put on the long finger.  I am prepared to do the job but I want to be absolutely sure of what I am putting into legislation.  I remind the House that the UK commission had been considering their recommendations for eight years.  I accept what the Deputy has said, that this legislation gives us an opportunity of making changes but one should not rush headlong into making changes such as those without being fully aware of the consequences.  If one is amending the law one should do it in the proper manner.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 20, Second Schedule, Part I, third column, opposite &ldquo;Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983&rdquo;, to delete &ldquo;and 52 (1)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, 52 (1) and 88&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the section which this amendment seeks to repeal Telecom Éireann are exempt from the civil law in regard to any damage or loss caused by their failure to provide an adequate service.  Obviously, for such a claim to succeed the consumer would have to be able to show that Telecom Éireann were negligent in causing the loss or damage.  Therefore, removing the protection would not throw Telecom Éireann open to claims by consumers against them through their failure to provide services which genuinely were beyond their control but if Telecom Éireann had been negligent, or their servants acting under their direction had been negligent, and if as a result a consumer of the services provided by this statutory monopoly suffered a loss then the consumer should have the same access to the civil law for remedies and for damages as he would have if he had suffered a loss with some private, nonmonopoly supplier of services.  Given that Telecom Éireann's monopoly in this area is protected by law, they have a greater, not a lesser, responsibility to provide a good service and remedies for those who suffer a loss because of their deficiencies arising from negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a private enterprise provider of services, the consumer if he is not getting adequate satisfaction at least has the opportunity of going elsewhere and in the case of a private enterprise supplier there is perhaps a greater case for exempting the supplier from the full rigours of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  However where there is a statutory monopoly and the consumer has no options but to use the services provided by that statutory monopoly, there is a greater, not a lesser, case for ensuring that the consumer has full rights to claim against that statutory monopoly, Telecom Éireann in this case, for failing <Col N="2424" /> to provide a service through negligence, but only if that negligence can be demonstrated and if it causes actual loss.</P>
    <P>Under section 88 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act any failure or delay in providing, operating or maintaining a telecommunications service which causes loss to a consumer cannot be the subject or the basis for an action for damages no matter how negligent Telecom Éireann were in failing to provide, operate or maintain a service and no matter how great the loss suffered by the consumer as a result.  Likewise, if through negligence there is a failure, interruption, suspension or restriction of a telecommunications service which causes major loss to a consumer, he is not allowed to claim damages from Telecom Éireann because of section 88 of the legislation. Likewise if, by reason of section 88, a consumer suffers loss because through negligence Telecom Éireann make a false entry in a telephone directory containing information about that person's business, the private individual has no access to the civil law to claim damages against Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>In all of those cases there should be the normal access to the civil law.  We are not asking that any special or exceptional responsibilities be placed on Telecom Éireann just because they are a statutory monopoly.  We are simply asking that they be subject to the same legislation in regard to being sued for negligent activities on their part as would any other corner shopkeeper or small business person.  It is worth noting that section 88 (3) also exempts Telecom Éireann from the application of section 39 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act. That section states that anybody supplying a service in the course of business is presumed to have the ability to supply the service with due skill, care and diligence. If he is using materials &mdash; in the case of Telecom Éireann, telephone appliances &mdash; those materials should be sound and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required.  That applies to any person providing a service in the private sector.  I understand that it also <Col N="2425" /> applies to An Post and most State enterprises. They are open to be sued under section 39 if they fail to supply a service with due skill or with sound materials.</P>
    <P>However, Telecom Éireann, as far as I can see alone amongst the State companies &mdash; I am open to correction on that; I checked in regard to CIE and An Post and I could not find a similar exemption for those companies but that is not the main point &mdash; cannot be sued.  I do not see any reason why, if I can sue a small shopkeeper who is supplying me with a service if he does not exercise the necessary skill, if I can sue a barber who does not exercise the necessary skill and causes me an injury as a result of that failure, I should be prevented from suing Telecom Éireann if they fail to exercise the necessary skill in regard to any service they are providing.</P>
    <P>Why should Telecom Éireann, just because they are a Government monopoly, be exempt from the ordinary law that applies to other people?  I see no reason for that exemption.  It is not because the taxpayer has poured insufficient resources into Telecom Éireann. There has been a vast investment of public funds in Telecom Éireann and that company have not provided the State with any dividend as yet on that huge investment.  The company are not in a position to provide dividends or profits to the State which I understand An Post are in a position to provide although Telecom Éireann have absorbed huge quantities of capital.</P>
    <P>Telephone charges here &mdash; this was referred to by the Minister when dealing with the generally negative cost environment here &mdash; are 50 per cent or 100 per cent higher than they are in most continental European countries.  If Telecom Éireann were to say that they would have lower telephone charges than other countries if they were allowed to be exempt from the civil law because that would save them money, one could understand that as a fair deal.  However, our telephone service is charging a higher price and enjoying privileges in regard to exemption from the normal civil law in regard to damages that other services <Col N="2426" /> fail to enjoy.  I see no reason why that exemption should not be removed.  I should like to tell the Minister that my party will be making formal proposals on that subject in the near future.  Those proposals will have regard not just to this aspect of consumer protection concerning Telecom Éireann but also to other aspects.  This is a matter that will be the subject of considerable public pressure from my party in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In my view, there is a compelling case for the Minister to accept one or other of our amendments.  The first amendment seeks to remove all the exemptions from the normal civil law for negligence which Telecom Éireann presently enjoy.  The second amendment seeks to deal with the question of directory entries, with which the Minister indicated in an aside there might be less of a problem.  I accept that the Minister requires to consult with the Minister for Communications before accepting such amendments.  I hope he has been able to do so and is now in a position to accept one or other of those amendments.  If I had considered the matter as fully as I would have wished I would have also proposed an amendment to remove the exemption contained in section 88 (3) of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983.  That provision states that Section 39 shall not apply until the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism by order provides that it shall apply.  To my knowledge such an order has not been made.  If the Minister could indicate that he intends to make an order applying the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act to Telecom Éireann in the near future, in the next three months, that would go a considerable distance in the direction my amendments are seeking to go.  It would not remove all the problems because it would amount to a protection for people who are consumers.  It would not provide any similar legal protection to trade customers of Telecom Éireann.  It would be a step in the right direction and I hope the Minister can indicate that he is in a position to announce an order under that <Col N="2427" /> section in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly endorse Deputy Bruton's sentiments.  There is a fundamental principle involved in this issue, that is, the principle of natural justice that no area of the public or private sectors should be shut off from action by the citizen.  One consequence of this Bill becoming law would be that the statutory monopoly of our national communications network will remain where it has been, with BTE, while that company's subsidiary and ancillary services would be subject to open competition. That lack of any defective monitoring, independent ongoing assessment or regulator capacity to look at BTE's monopoly is deplorable.  It does not assist in assuring adequate performance of service, value for money and efficiency.  Abuse of monopoly power can arise.  What is being suggested is not necessarily that that be interfered with though some of us might wish to see a more open approach to it, but that there would be an assertion in law that there is no sweetheart arrangement between Government and areas of the public service providing essential services which shuts them off from access by the citizens in terms of pursuing their legal rights.  I have no doubt that instead of in any way encouraging people to higher standards or standards of excellence or unusual performance, the psychology of absolute security from redress can only assist in diminution in the quality of service, complacency in the context of any form of competition and an inferior deal for the consumer.  If a Bill which retains that inviolability for a body is to proceed there is an absolute obligation on the Minister to justify the reason for that being allowed to remain intact.  That should be cleared up, not because anyone does other than wish BTE well but because a sense of natural justice dictates that people should have at least the same redress against that large, monopolistic operation as they would have against their neighbour over the back garden wall.  It is just unthinkable that we should <Col N="2428" /> allow that situation to prevail, particularly where that organisation have a monopoly that effectively secures them against open competition and market forces which might themselves be an incentive to be very responsive to public need so on.</P>
      <P>Nobody wishes to cast aspersions or reflections of any kind on the job and the genuine improvements that have come about in BTE's performance recently. We are saying simply that the citizens whom we represent here should have a right of legal redress.  Deputy Bruton is seeking to obtain that and we support it as a principle to be embraced, we hope, by the Minister in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Give them a chance. They must creep before they can walk. We are leading to one of the best telecommunications services in Europe with more digital technology in our telecommunications infrastructure than any country in Europe except France.  If we had not that sort of foundation we would not even be talking about the establishment of a financial services centre in Dublin.  However, that is not to say that the consumer and the State are not entitled to value for money.  We have gone over this and I have subscribed to that they should be as efficient as possible. This was fully debated by the Oireachtas when the reorganisation took place in 1983 and the Oireachtas were <Col N="2429" /> firmly of the view that that this immunity should be extended for quite some time into the future, and I do not think the situation has changed all that much.</P>
      <P>However, in relation to directory entries, it is not an advertisement.  It is purely an alphabetical index for reference and no charge is involved in putting one in.  I would not like to think that this House would put not alone Telecom but any State agency in the position of being open to huge claims as a result of an insertion for which they do not charge in a telephone directory.  I have consulted with the Minister for Communications on the matter and he is firmly of the opinion that the repeal of section 88 would have major implications and that it ought to be considered only after full, careful and authoritive review of all aspects of the question.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have a statutory function in this area.  Under section 88 (3) (b) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, after consultation with the Minister for Communications, make an order applying the provisions of section 39 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, to the provision of telecommunications services within the State.  The effect of such an order would be that the implied terms set out in section 39 &mdash; mainly that a service will be supplied with due skill, care and diligence as Deputy Bruton said &mdash; would be implied in contracts between Telecom Éireann and their customers.  These implied terms would facilitate the taking of an action against Telecom by a customer dissatisfied with the company's service &mdash; for instance, the matter of directory entries mentioned by Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage which is also the subject of one of the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that the making of an order such as that described above, and here again today in the House by Deputy Bruton, would greatly enhance the protection available to the consumer while <Col N="2430" /> still safeguarding the competitive position of Telecom in relation to their international services.  It would be inappropriate to remove it on one and not on the other.  I am prepared, therefore, to examine fully the question of making an order as provided for in section 88 (3) (b) of the 1983 Act, in consultation with the Minister for Communications, as required by the Act and I will institute that consultation immediately.</P>

I take it from what he has said that while he is consulting about the matter he will be making this order within a reasonable time.  I welcome that.</P>

      <P>Section 1 is a section on definitions and I will not bore the House by going into the different Acts that are cited but I would make the point that in 1981 this House consolidated the social welfare legislation right back for many years before that.  Hundreds of Acts were brought together in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  I was Minister at the time and put a great deal of work into it.  I suggested that there should be a review of this consolidation legislation at regular intervals so that we would never again have to consult so many pieces of legislation.  It is time we had another look at our social welfare legislation. I suggested a five year interval might be appropriate for further consolidation but next year it will be seven years since we undertook such a review. Therefore it is appropriate that we look again at this legislation and we will undertake that task.  We have a lot of work on hand for early in the year and we hope <Col N="2432" /> to be able to get this consolidation review under way as the year progresses.  It is important to keep this legislation up to date.  It gives Deputies a chance to get an overview of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 26 to 28, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) A person who fails to comply with this section or regulations made <Col N="2433" /> hereunder shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or (at the discretion of the court) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or to both such fine and such imprisonment, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or (at the discretion of the court) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One area in which the Minister has moved very definitely is that of abuse, and he has my wholehearted support, but I do not believe enough has been done yet.  In a radio interview last Sunday the Minister admitted he was surprised by the extent of the abuse in the social welfare system which is unravelling.  I am not the least surprised because it is very evident and people have been saying it in the streets for years.  The situation has not got better; it has got worse.  At least now the problem is being tackled.  This was started by Deputy Hussey in her short term as Minister for Social Welfare and it is being continued by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot just rely on inspectors catching these people, because given the number of people in the social welfare system, even if there are hundreds of inspectors they will only be able to touch the tip of the iceberg.  We need to have effective penalties.  Take the £1,000 fine on an employer who fails to comply with sections 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 in this Bill, or parts of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  A fine of £1,000 is nothing, because the employer's social welfare contribution for a person on the average industrial wage of around £10,000 would be £1,230 a year.  Even if the maximum fine of £1,000 were imposed, it would be less than the employer's contribution for one employee on the average industrial wage. <Col N="2434" /> That is why I believe we must have stronger penalties.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some of these criminal employers put behind bars because with a few very well publicised examples there would be a very quick and major shake-up of the system.  We need a few Lester Piggots among the employers abusing the social welfare system.  A few people, no matter who their contacts are, what influence they have, or what money they have, should, like Lester Piggot, be hauled before the court.  There has been a big shake-up in the horse breeding industry in England so far as defrauding the revenue is concerned.  That is what we need, but that would not go down very well here because the prisons are only for gurriers, for the working classes. That is the way they are looked at.</P>
    <P>It is about time we put behind bars a few of these so called high-class criminals because they are not only defrauding the Revenue and the Department of Social Welfare, but they are defrauding ordinary workers.  They are also walking many workers into fraud with the result that a lot of money is being diverted from the poor.  I do not believe any public representative can be unaware of this fraud and there is a particular responsibility on us as legislators to legislate against in particular employers who seek to defraud the system.</P>
    <P>When tabling these amendments I considered deleting all reference to fines and mentioning only prison sentences to indicate to the courts that we in this House want to see employers who are defrauding the system behind bars.  However, I decided to put down an amendment to the Minister's proposal and to add to the £1,000 fine &mdash; the limit which the District Court can impose under the Constitution a 12 month sentence &mdash; the longest sentence the District Court can impose &mdash; or both.  I also decided to add a further paragraph which would have employers go before judge and jury and if convicted on indictment to be subject to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both.  That is a reasonable proposal.  I do <Col N="2435" /> not believe these penalties are too severe because of the amount of money of which these people are defrauding the Department of Social Welfare.  They are quite small figures and the only question is whether we should be more specific in relation to each case.  Should we take into consideration each employee, each time and each week that the system is defrauded?</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse put down three amendments which are more modest.  I urge him to withdraw them and to accept the amendments I am proposing because I have good reason to believe the Minister is not unhappy about them.  Similar amendments are tabled to sections 2, 3, 4 and 5&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A supplementary list has just been issued.  These amendments relate only to the provisions in the Bill before the House today.  I was looking through the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 &mdash; which is very complex legislation &mdash; and I ask the Minister to accept my amendments.  I acknowledge what he said about a total review of the 1981 Act after seven years but, in the context of the first Social Welfare Bill for 1988, he should update and increase penalties both in terms of fines and prison sentences in relation to other fraud in the social welfare system.  If we can make these amendments stick, we will be doing a very good day's work for the less well off in society.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister yesterday what it would cost to raise the basic social welfare payments to £45, £50 or £60 per week.  Even to raise such payments to £45 per week would cost about £60 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we must do something about people living on £35 per week.  Even £45 per week is a small amount and I know it would be very <Col N="2436" /> costly to implement but we must find the money.  We can do so by more effective pursuit of fraud throughout the system. On Second Stage yesterday, I made certain suggestions which I will be following up.  I hope the Minister will do the same and that a united message goes out from all sides of the House that, whatever our other disagreements, we are at one in condemning without reservation fraud in the social welfare system.  The most pernicious area of fraud is that perpetrated by employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As promised yesterday, I welcome the Minister's decision to extend temporary payments.  Naturally I am very pleased as I may have helped him along the road in that respect.  I assure him I will be watching him very closely coming up to March when I hope he will replace the payments with something more permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be supporting Deputy Mitchell's amendments in relation to the very important subject of fraud and the manner in which it should be dealt with. It is certainly much stronger than the amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats; a fine of £1,000 on an employer is not enough.  I recently heard where an employer walked away from a case where a sum of £90,000 in social welfare moneys was not returned to the Department.  People think that if a company goes into liquidation or receivership the money will eventually be repaid but very often there is nothing in the kitty for anybody.  That happens very frequently and when one considers the penalties that can be imposed on individuals for minor offences in relation to drawing benefits to which they are not entitled or where people are disqualified for lengthy periods because of breaches of regulations, it is obvious they must be matched by severe penalties on employers.  As I said yesterday, if there were no dishonest employers there would be very few, if any, dishonest employees.  The encouragement that social welfare recipients get from unscrupulous employers creates many of the existing problems.  This places emphasis on that subject and I <Col N="2437" /> hope the Minister will accept the amendment because it will correct many of the anomalies.</P>
    <P>The car disc insurance system was introduced during the term of the previous Government.  A notice must be affixed to the window of the car giving the name of the insurance company and the dates for which the car is insured. That effectively improved the situation in regard to the level of abuse of insurance in the motor industry.  Before the PRSI system came into operation an employee had a stamp inserted on a card every week, the stamps were bought in the post office and at the end of a year the employee could go to his employer and ask for his card which would then be returned to the employment exchange.  If the card was not returned the responsibility rested with the manager or the staff in the local employment exchange to visit the company concerned and insist on the cards being returned within a specified time.  The introduction of PRSI did away with that and also the policing of the system in regard to weekly contributions. The arrears accumulate and very often employers effectively use the money which should be returned to the Department as a cash flow.  The arrears become so huge that it is the lesser of two evils to close down or to go into liquidation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there should be a receipt systems which would not present major problems in so far as records are now computerised.  It should be possible for an employee to ask for and receive a receipt for the moneys that were supposed to have been returned on his behalf.  As I said yesterday the P60 is only a piece of paper.  It is not worth anything because anybody can make out a P60. The P60 is only effective when the moneys have been returned on behalf of the contributor.  Perhaps the Minister could introduce a regulation which would ensure that employers would be obliged to post on the company's notice board or other prominent place a receipt showing that the social welfare payments on behalf of the employees had been returned to the Department.  I do not think that would require an amendment to the <Col N="2438" /> Act.  I suggest this could be done under powers vested in the Minister in one or other of the Social Welfare Acts.  In conclusion I ask the Minister to consider those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to withdraw my amendment in favour of Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  I am well aware that abuse is being carried out by some employers, not all employers.  We have quite a number of cowboy type operators who impress upon their employees that they will be employed at £80 per week and that they can sign on for the dole for the other £80 or whatever they are entitled to.  This creates very unfair competition for honest to God employers.</P>
      <P>I believe that insurance companies have a very big part to play in the fight against abuse.  Around the country we have people, small builders and the like, employing people at £50 to £80 per week in the black economy.  I cannot understand how an insurance company could issue a policy that covers perhaps 20 people without having the names and addresses of the people insured. Insurance companies have a part to play in bringing to an end abuse by some employers.  If an insurance company is issuing a liability policy, they should know exactly the names and addresses of the people to be covered under the policy.  In this way insurance companies could help to eliminate abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is frustrating for the Minister to try to counteract abuse.  There are so many forms of abuse.  I recall some years ago going to the Minister's predecessor to complain about a company in the Cork area working for a State body who were part and parcel of this type of abuse. When we tried to check them out we discovered they had disappeared.  I know that this company were working for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the GPO in Cork and doing highly technical work.  They were employing people who were also in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I ask the Minister to consider involving the insurance companies <Col N="2439" /> in trying to track down and eliminate the awful abuse that exists and is being promoted by some employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The section which Deputy Mitchell's amendment refers to concerns the notification by employers of the commencement of employment.  That obviously relates to collusion between the employer and employee on the nondeduction and non-return of PRSI contributions and does not relate to the issue where an employer deducts the PRSI from the employee but fails to return it. That is a separate issue which we can deal with later on.  With regard to the issue of collusion between the employer and employee, there are a number of points that have to be kept in mind.  By and large an employee will agree to that type of arrangement with reluctance.  In the first place, the employees are deprived of the social welfare cover they would have if deductions were being made.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it has to be kept in mind that the broader effect of this abuse is that many companies who operate within the law, pay decent wages and return deductions are at a disadvantage and in many cases cannot compete.  I know, for instance, that is a particular problem for companies who operate in the security area.  I had occasion to raise this matter with Dublin Corporation.  Companies employed by Dublin Corporation were operating in that way and they took steps to rectify the situation.  The abuses have a wider effect than simply the non-return of money which the State is entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am not convinced that all of the money, whatever amount it may be, that is saved as a result of ending abuse of one kind or another will be retained in the social welfare system and used exclusively to assist those on social welfare.  We have to accept that this Government and previous Governments, where savings have been made, have tended to reduce the budget accordingly. This applies not only to social welfare but to local authorities, the health services and various other areas in which they <Col N="2440" /> have been forced to reduce their expenditure. The money saved has not been used to develop other aspects of the service but has been whipped off and used for other purposes.  I certainly am concerned that that may be the case with regard to social welfare.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of points on the amendment and the section.  The section does not refer to conviction on indictment. I wonder whether the section, in fact, excludes conviction on indictment and if this amendment is accepted will that be the case?  In addition may I ask if the summary conviction carries a fine of £1,000 is it possible to increase that amount beyond £1,000 or is there some limit which the District Court can apply in terms of fines?  If the reference to a fine was deleted what options would be open to a court?  Would the court be bound to find the person either guilty and send them to prison or not guilty because the judge felt the offence did not warrant prison and had not the option to impose a fine and therefore had to let them go. I would appreciate it if the Minister could clarify that.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask why is it that in section 2(1) the Minister takes the power where he &ldquo;may require an employer to notify him of the date&rdquo; rather than making it mandatory that he &ldquo;shall require an employer&rdquo;.  In relation to section 2(2) could the Minister explain what circumstances he has in mind where no notification may be required?  I said last night &mdash; and the Minister denied it &mdash; that the powers being taken in relation to abuse by employers were more apparent than real.  By using the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;small&rdquo; and by limiting the circumstances in which no notification may be required, which is clearly implied in this section, the section is not as strong as it is made out to be.  I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment but I am not entirely certain that prison is the answer for everything.  Imprisonment is used far too much in our courts.</P>

      <P>Exactly and it is used far too freely in relation to most of the people who come before our courts.

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two points on this section.  I support the amendment.  I see the objective of the section but I find it very hard to understand how the Department intend to police this.  The Minister will be aware of a very bad case where an inspector who was inspecting alleged misuse by somebody who was allegedly working and drawing at the same time misinformed the person of the source of her allegation.  How does the Minister intend to police this?  I will not go into this any further this morning because I have already made my protest on that point.</P>
      <P>The House should be very concerned about the fact that the Department of Social Welfare have one accountant only employed even though that Department have a turnover of £2.6 billion.  That is very worrying.  We can pass all the legislation we like to prevent collusion and everything else but if we do not have the staff to police and pursue this we will be in great difficulty.  On Saturday a man who is receiving £37 per week unemployment assistance &mdash; it may now be £42 &mdash; came to me.  He is living on his own and he is actually burning his sofa because he cannot get an entitlement to the free fuel scheme.  We can pass all the legislation we want but unless it is implemented, pursued and policed there is no point in passing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy for collusion to exist if one accountant only is employed by the Department.  The Comptroller and Auditor General drew the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts to the fact that approximately £750,000 has gone astray in internal fraud in the Minister's Department.  That is the amount that has been discovered to date and it is in addition to the fraud that goes on outside <Col N="2442" /> the Department.  If we are really concerned about cutting out fraud, collusion and rip-offs in the Department of Social Welfare, which is the biggest spending Department of State, then sufficient staff and resources should be allocated to the Department to police it.  It is nothing short of outrageous that a Department of State with an enormous turnover of £2.6 billion should employ one accountant only.  If I recall correctly, the reason one accountant is employed is because the Committee of Public Accounts drew the attention of the Accounting Officer of the Department to the fact that there had been none employed in the past.  The Minister needs to give his attention to this.  If we are serious about cutting out waste we should not ask the poor man who has to burn his sofa to do without his fuel.  We should look at the internal control within the Department where much waste, fraud and abuse could be cut out.  I ask the Minister to give his attention to this.</P>

      <P>Whatever the justification for more accountants in the Department, I want first to congratulate the Minister &mdash; and I may be unique on this side of the House in doing so &mdash; for the work he has obviously put into combating the abuse of social welfare. While I am very concerned about the abuse that is prevalent in this area, like everybody else I am concerned also that the people who are in genuine need of social welfare should have enough to live on.  I am not anti-anybody in the social welfare area but I am unashamedly antiabuse. I have to take a small bow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have to take a small bow for identifying the abuses which have been prevalent in this area.  I have no doubt that my friends on the loony left will attack me for my remarks but nevertheless <Col N="2443" /> I stand over them.  I want to congratulate the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> for the series of investigative articles they printed earlier this year which undoubtedly helped to focus the attention of the Department on the charade that exists in this country.  I have suggested that the abuse in the social welfare area is of the order of 10 per cent. Craig Gardner were commissioned to do a survey on the level of abuse and I understand from my source &mdash; which is fairly reliable &mdash; that fraud of the order of 9 per cent has been uncovered.  My source also suggests that the report is so damning it will not be published.  The survey found horrendous abuses in the area of social welfare, so much so that it focused the Minister's mind on stemming it and he has done so very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to contrast the recent disclosure that fraud of the order of £36 million has been discovered with the pathetic figures given by the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Barry Desmond and Deputy Gemma Hussey, who said very defensively that the abuse in the social welfare area amounted to £4 million.  How could any Minister and Department have been so much out of touch with reality?  Were they unaware of the abuses or did the Department put their heads in the sand and pretend it was not happening?  The dogs in the street knew it was happening. There are so many fiddlers in this country that we could have a national orchestra in every county.  The national emblem of the country is the harp and it should be changed to the fiddle.  I welcome the disclosure that the Department have very belatedly found out that this exists in the country.  I would also refer to their lack of knowledge.  I refer back to the disclosures in 1983-84 of the itinerant lady who was claiming for 83 children and who had 13 children's allowances books.  That lady came from my town and she was doing the same in England where she is currently arraigned on charges of defrauding the State of £250,000.  The Department were totally unaware of that situation until a young Garda stopped <Col N="2444" /> her in Bray.  That was how they became aware of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what plans he has for increasing the special investigation unit, or has he any plans to disband it early in the New Year.  The special investigation unit have been the source of embarrassment to the Department and have been instrumental in unearthening many large scale frauds particularly in the area of cross-Border fraud which is prevalent.  Despite measures taken last year to cope with that problem, the level of cross-Border fraud in my own town of Dundalk continues to run at £200,000 per annum.  This is money taken by North of Ireland bandits off the backs of the PAYE workers.  Jail is too good for people who rip money off the Irish economy and the over-burdened PAYE workers.  I fear for the continuation of the special investigation unit. Apparently, there is a reluctance to acknowledge the work these people do within the Department of Social Welfare. They have been downgraded.  What is needed is the involvement of more special investigation unit workers in every county if we are really sincere about stopping the abuses of working and signing. The abuses are currently running in excess of £200 million at a time when we are closing hospitals, when we cannot give old people a hospital bed in which to die with dignity, when we are closing schools and seriously curtailing the national school programme.  Surely the way to find money is to wipe out all the abuses that are prevalent in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister when will the report by Craig Gardner be published. When will he increase the special investigation unit and how many jobs will be created in that area?  I also want him to look at the position of people who are living in England and who are also claiming social welfare in this country.  If £36 million has been saved, it is only the tip of the iceberg.  How much more can be saved by continued surveillance which can only be given &mdash; if the Minister is sincere in his efforts to curb social welfare &mdash; by increasing the special investigation <Col N="2445" /> unit?  The figures announced recently are very revealing.</P>
    <P>A figure of 18,000 people had their dole stopped as a result of interviews and 11,445 voluntarily stopped signing.  That is horrifying.  In Dublin City Council we had 29 employees sacked for signing and working and yet in Dublin city and county we have only ten special investigation unit officers investigating dole frauds. What we need is an army of special investigation unit officers if we are serious about stopping this abuse.  I call on the Minister to continue to support the special investigation unit and to upgrade them within the Department in order to cope with the appalling problem of social welfare abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points.  I will be very brief because the sections on which I want to make a contribution at this stage are sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 16.  In relation to the basic thrust of the sections we are discussing and the amendments I would like to make a few brief points.</P>
      <P>First, the entire country is being done a grave disservice by speeches like the one we have just heard.  I am afraid I cannot join in congratulating those sections of the media to which the Deputy has just referred who produced what can only be described as phoney figures.  In that respect I will be very explicit.  I understood that when these articles referred to were put under scrutiny by others &mdash; and I was one of the people who discussed them on radio &mdash; the only source was an authoritative source within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much believe in the freedom of information and I remember requesting the Minister of the day to state explicitly on whose authority the interviews were given and if the interviews were accurate. A person within the employment of the Department of Social Welfare leaked irresponsibly a number of figures to a journalist which were not available for scrutiny and examination by elected Members of this House.  I want to be fair to the Minister.  I do not believe he said that there was a figure of £36 million in <Col N="2446" /> fraud.  I would find it equally interesting to know &mdash; perhaps because we are approaching Christmas &mdash; why the figure of £200 million has been used.</P>
    <P>The Minister is under an obligation to those who are in genuine need, and in receipt of social welfare benefits of one kind or another, to publish not only the recommendations of the Craig Gardner report but to publish the report in full except where it makes individual cases identifiable.  The reason this should be done is that in every country in the European Community where they have studied the operation of social welfare, social welfare fraud has been identified as being in the very sophisticated category.  This is a very tiny proportion of the total sums that are transferred.  We are entitled to see the report to identify the model cases which can be addressed by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I support those Deputies who are asking for heavier penalties and disincentives for collusion between employers and employees in abusing the Social Welfare Acts.  It is very interesting that there is a deafening silence from what I might call the loony right about a far more dangerous activity that is going on.  For example, this Bill deals with fraud in the earlier sections.  It goes on to deal with invalidity, disability and the changed qualification for maternity benefit in the same context as fraud, which I think is unfortunate.  It is singularly silent on the relationship between employers and the State.  My question to those on the right is this: what of the moneys that were deducted from the wages of employees and were not handed over to the State?  When will we see action on that?</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there are people facing into Christmas who are in the gravest difficulties because their contributions were not paid over to the State. To tell those people that they can apply for supplementary welfare allowance is not the answer.  The money was deducted from their wages and the employers who did not hand it over to the State behaved not only illegally but callously towards people who were working for them.  I <Col N="2447" /> cannot see why a Bill such as this could not have addressed this question of the employers' relationship to the State, although I accept it deals with the employer who is involved in collusion.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a company that was in difficulties in relation to liquidity and was advised by a State agency to delay paying over the contributions and Government taxes.  The Government agency was asking the company if they had thought about holding the money back so as to stay viable for a while.  There will be a very dangerous confrontation in this country if people say that abuses are taking place disparately across the system among all social welfare recipients.  I know that is not what Deputy McGahon said; he said he is in favour of genuine people.  Nevertheless the stigma is falling on everybody.  We need to be able to identify sources of sophisticated fraud.  I am talking about fraud in all its senses because there is other fraud which is not identified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out to the Minister that the World Health Organisation and a number of other bodies have drawn attention to the increasing amount of illness that is stemming from long-term structural unemployment.  Studies have been carried out, for example, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne which clearly show the longer a person is unemployed &mdash; say, after two years &mdash; the probability of their being involved in sickness and different kinds of incapacity very significantly increases.  When discussing this Bill we should bear in mind that a certain amount of the increase in the number of people who are drawing benefits is due to the hopelessness and absence of morale that is created by long-term endemic unemployment and poverty in society.  We have to realise that the Members of this Dáil have failed abjectly to provide those people with employment and an organised planned economy that could give them some prospects of employment. They are forced into receiving social welfare. They will now have to suffer the burden of an additional stigma which is being directed against them, and I am <Col N="2448" /> sure every well-meaning person in this House would not want that to happen.</P>
    <P>When we are addressing these problems we should concentrate on the ones we are aware of, on where the money is being collected and not being returned to the State.  The Minister should tell the House how much is held back every week from the State by people who do not hand over their contributions.  If we knew that, we would have a far less emotive debate. Deputy Mitchell is correct in speaking about the lack of sanction in low level disincentives for collusion.  I share the view of Deputy De Rossa with regard to prisons.  Middle-class people are more terrified of prison than those we have been sending indiscriminately to prison for years.  Perhaps those people need to be frightened.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider another range of options beyond this Bill, in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I ask this House is it correct for the State to continue giving grants, incentives, loan subsidies, depreciation allowances and training allowances to companies that it knows are not paying over their contributions to the State?  Is it not an effective disincentive to say that any company that does not pay over to the State the money it has collected from workers' wages by way of contribution shall not be entitled for ten years to any benefit from the State out of the £1.245 billion that is transferred from public taxation every year for our industrial policy?  Is it not proper to say that if you have not even the basic morality and respect for the State to pay over what you are collecting from your workers, you have no right to come back with your begging bowl to the panoply of agencies that exist and to squander the taxpayers' money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard very wideranging views in this debate, all of which are very relevant to this section.  We are taking a number of amendments together.  The section is designed to discourage collusion between employers and employees in cases of suspected <Col N="2449" /> fraud.  Section 2(1) enables the Minister for Social Welfare to require employers to notify him of the commencement of employment of each new employee.  The wording in the Bill is that he may be required to do so.  Deputy De Rossa asked why the wording is &ldquo;he may be required&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;he shall be required.&rdquo;  The reason is that there is a large number of employers who are honest, who return the contributions regularly and consistently, with whom we have no problem and to whose companies the inspectors have free access.  We do not want to create an expansion of bureaucracy.  On the other hand, if there is a very simple system which could apply right across the board, then that is another matter.  We could work out the detail of the matter by regulation.  The reason the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is inserted is that there will be some flexibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>From what Deputies have said there are various ways in which this can be done, some of which may be administratively more efficient and more effective than others.  The feeling of the House generally is that something should be done about this matter and Deputies would welcome the most efficient way of doing it because it will cost the taxpayer less.</P>
      <P>If an employer receives a P.45 when a person comes from another employment it is clear that the person has been in another employment, immediately beforehand.  If he does not receive that form then there is a greater need to introduce some measure such as, for instance, a requirement to notify the employment exchange that somebody has been taken on.  That may be adequate.  I am not saying what is the best method but my officials are at present working on the matter and when we have this enabling power we will then be able to come up with the appropriate regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also provides that employers who fail to provide such notification shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000.  Deputy Mitchell's amendments relate to this <Col N="2450" /> matter.  A number of Deputies have suggested that there be as many options as possible.  It was even hinted that the proposal of a heavy prison sentence is not adequate because the courts do not tend to impose it and, therefore, we should propose a heavy fine also.  I accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment and I think it has the agreement of the House. I recognise that Deputy Wyse has withdrawn his amendment on the grounds that he will accept the level of penalty which is proposed in Deputy Mitchell's amendment.</P>
    <P>This whole area refers to the penalties which exist at present.  These amendments are designed to close loopholes so that the other powers can come into being.  As an example, Section 114 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, states:</P>
    <P>If any person (a) wilfully delays or obstructs an inspector in the exercise of any power under this section or, (b) refuses or neglects to answer any question or to furnish any information or to produce any document when required to do so under the section, or (e) conceals or prevents or attempts to conceal or prevent any person from appearing before or being examined by a person appointed under the section, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable (i) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both such fines and such imprisonment, or (ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £2,000 or (at the discretion of the court) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such imprisonment,</P>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy De Rossa said, £1,000 is the limit for the District Court and that is the reason for its use in this connection.  These are existing penalties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment proposes imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years, which is one year more than is provided for in other parts <Col N="2451" /> of the legislation, and a fine on conviction on indictment not exceeding £10,000.  I propose in the next Social Welfare Bill early in the New Year to bring in a similar level of penalty in those different areas. I will accept the amendment now and will register it by further amendments in the Social Welfare Bill.  I agree entirely with the sentiments which have been so eloquently expressed by many Deputies this morning.</P>
    <P>Section 115 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act deals with offences, including offences relating to bodies corporate. Subsection (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>If any person, for the purpose of obtaining any benefit or other payment under this Part, whether for himself or some other person, or for any purpose connected with this Part&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  knowingly makes any false statement or false representation or knowingly conceals any material fact, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  produces or furnishes, or causes or knowingly allows to be produced or furnished, any document or information which he knows to be false in a material particular,</P>
    <P>he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 114(1)(c) that an employer or any servant or agent of an employer who aids, abets, counsels or procures an employee in the employment of that employer to commit any offence under paragraph (a) or (b) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that a person found guilty of an offence shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or a year in prison and on conviction on indictment £3,000 or two years imprisonment.  Similar penalties are also provided for in respect of offences where any employer fails to pay at or within a prescribed time any employment contributions which he is liable to pay.</P>
    <P>In relation to fraudulent claims for <Col N="2452" /> unemployment assistance, the appointment and duties of social welfare officers in relation to claims for unemployment assistance are dealt with in section 143(1)(a) of the Consolidation Act.  This section is the equivalent of section 114 which covers unemployment benefit. Similar offences are specified in this section and the penalties provided are the same as those in section 114.</P>
    <P>Section 144 deals with false statements and offences.  Subsection (1) provides that if, for the purpose of obtaining for himself or any other person a qualification certificate or any payment of unemployment assistance, a person makes a false or misleading statement or representation, then that person commits an offence.  The section also provides that an employer or servant or agent of an employer who aids, abets, counsels or procures an employee in the employment of that employer to commit an offence under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.  The penalties are similar to those I mentioned earlier, that is, £1,000 and one year and £3,000 and two years.</P>
    <P>The current position is that in investigating cases of suspected fraud, officers of the inspection branch visit employers to inspect wages records to obtain evidence. In the absence of such evidence a formal statement is sought from the employer which includes information in relation to payments made to the employee.  Where the employer co-operates in the investigation no direct action is taken against him or her.  If the employer refuses to co-operate and there are no wages records available, further action can only be taken if the social welfare inspector has actually seen the employee at work, although evidence of this nature is difficult to obtain.  In the absence of such evidence no further action is possible. Where evidence is available, however, and the investigation is frustrated by a lack of co-operation on the employer's part, procedures are considered variously on other grounds such as obstruction, failure to provide relevant documentation on request, giving false or misleading information or whatever other grounds prove feasible in the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2453" /> Deputy Higgins mentioned a case in Galway concerning a person who was employed but whose employer did not pay the money.  I can assure the Deputy that once there is reasonable evidence that this person was in employment he will get the full benefits due.  I accept that there may be a short term problem but that is the procedure.  In that sense the employee is protected but obviously there is initial inconvenience because there must be at least some evidence of the fact that the person was working in that employment for a period.  If the Deputy will give me the details I will be glad to follow it up as a matter or urgency, particularly in view of the fact that Christmas is approaching.</P>
    <P>Further action is possible where the employer has failed to make payment of appropriate amounts of PRSI contributions to the Revenue Commissioners. In all such cases, regardless of whether co-operation is given, the details of the case are provided to the local district inspector of taxes.  In addition to pursuit of arrears, the Commissioners are then in a position to proceed with prosecutions for failure to make payment and, where applicable, for failure to submit the end of year return form, P.35.  Successful prosecution results in the employer being included in the annual list of tax defaulters published by the Commissioners under the 1983 Finance Act.  In approximately half the fraud cases which come to light, employers are found to have operated PRSI correctly.  This provides a further means of detection in that a computer check is made to detect overlap between details on the employer's end of year return and the records of unemployment payments made by the Department.</P>
    <P>That is the general background against which we are proposing these new measures to plug the loopholes which we have found to exist.  Deputies have raised various questions which I will attempt to answer as well as I can.  Deputy Mitchell talked about the desirability of putting people behind bars, saying that we need a few Lester Piggotts to scare people off. Public perceptions and attitudes to fraud <Col N="2454" /> and abuse are very important.  Perhaps we are getting to the stage where there is a somewhat clearer definition.</P>
    <P>It is good that Members should consider these different elements.  We have been talking about the sum of £36 million which I express as savings.  I cannot say how much is due to people who suddenly decided they wanted to go back to work and how much is due to other factors.  A very high proportion of it relates to abuse of some sort and unwarranted claiming. There is a certain hard core element, as well as abuse of the scheme by long-term malingering.  Then there is the question of providing opportunities which may result in savings to us.  We would not regard that as fraud.  There is a need for a major shift in public thinking in relation to fraud.  We have to get it across that it is the taxpayers' money at the end of the day.  If everybody could get that clear in their minds we would have a better attitude to it.  We want to give resources to the people who need them.  Everybody agrees with that.  We have to try to ensure that waste, abuse and fraud are reduced to the smallest amount possible.  We vote the moneys generally for the elderly, the sick, the infirm and the unemployed and those are the categories to which the money should go.  The money for these people is being bled away by people abusing the system.  We must tackle that problem vigorously and we must be seen to be tackling it.  If I seek money for other things, it must be obvious that our house is in order in that respect.  The people who cheat are defrauding the sick, the elderly and the infirm and this in turn creates a heavy burden on the taxpayer. To contain expenditure on social welfare we must curtail abuses so that we will have the money to give assistance to those who need it.  There is not a bottomless pit of money and the bulk of the £2.6 million comes from the PAYE sector.  I mentioned the question of the public attitude to fraud because in the consultants' survey it was shown that a quarter of the people surveyed claimed to know instances where people were abusing the system but did not report them.  Nowadays, people are more <Col N="2455" /> inclined to report instances of abuse.  Perhaps it is a sign of our maturity that we are prepared to recognise and stamp out abuse and to alleviate hardship.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contributions of Deputies on this issue.  It is perhaps because this is my second time as Minister in this Department and because computerisation has progressed in the interim, that I can now tackle things more vigorously than was the case heretofore.  I accept the amendments Deputy Mitchell has put down.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Bell for mentioning the £10 and £20 alleviating payments, although I am a little disappointed that the media did not highlight that as much as they highlight abuses.  The £10 and £20 alleviating payments will continue to be made.  These cater for specific areas of hardship and I am pleased to be able to continue them.  I assure the Deputy that I will do my best in this area in the budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell also mentioned the card disc and its value and how much good it has done in helping to reduce abuse in that area.  The Deputy pointed to the fact that under the old system the employee could see the card, and that it was a big advantage to be able to see the card with the stamps on it.  However, this was a very expensive and inefficient system in many other respects.  I agree with Deputy Bell that there is a need for the employee to have some control over it.  The Deputy mentioned a sort of receipt system for employees just to show that the money had been paid in and he suggested that this kind of thing might be done by regulation. I will certainly have a look at that idea.</P>
    <P>I do not know if insurance companies would be willing to pass information on to me as suggested by Deputy Wyse.  The Deputy gave, as an example, a company providing services in the GPO in Cork and employing people in receipt of unemployment payments.  This has been a fairly widespread practice.  It has been widespread in semi-State bodies, local authorities and public bodies generally but we will have to stamp it out.  We will <Col N="2456" /> give special attention to public bodies with a view to this.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned a case of which I was aware and I was very glad to see action being taken there.  What is the point of the Dáil doing work in this respect if management and public service bodies are prepared to collude in cheating the system?  These measures will apply equally to people in public service bodies, so they had better get their house in order.  The stronger penalties agreed by all sides of the House will apply and nobody will be prosecuted quicker than a public service employer found to be in breach of the rules.  The example should come from the public service and it does not in many instances.  We will give a lot of attention to that area.  Even since the debate here last night, Deputies would be surprised at the numbers of people who have contacted the Department alleging abuses.  In practice, at least one in three of such allegations turns out to be valid.  In some cases, a person may have an arrangement with the Department about which the informer does not know, but it is extraordinary what publicity can do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse says he will withdraw his amendment in favour of the stronger amendment.  Deputy De Rossa mentioned that the section relates particularly to collusion and highlighted the fact that employees are deprived of cover as a result of this kind of collusion and that very often they do not realise it.  That is how we sometimes discover cases of fraud.  I remember the case of a solicitor recently who was prosecuted.  It came to light that an employee fell ill.  He went seeking disability benefit and discovered there was no record at all of his having paid contributions.  The inspectors went out to check on the matter.  Of course, in such circumstances, the individual tends to become irate immediately, feeling that he should have his benefit paid immediately. The inspectors followed the matter up quickly.  They went to check the place of business and the home of the person concerned which was also a farm. The man was there and, from the reports given to me, it appears he said: &ldquo;Not only <Col N="2457" /> am I here but I have been here for the past five years, I have been here all this time and, if you want me to prove it I will get my brother who is on the farm. He has been here for the same length of time.&rdquo;  Of course it transpired that his brother did not figure on the records either.  That was a case that arose in court recently and is just one example.  There are other cases of people who would not be due any benefit subsequently because they might have been in collusion.  This is something about which Deputy De Rossa spoke.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned security companies.  Undoubtedly, they present a special problem and we will be devoting a great deal of attention to them.  There are cases where this cheating and fraud is fairly extensive.  I know the industry generally is very anxious to see something done about it because, at the end of the day, it does not make a decent job for anybody; it involves cheating of taxpayers, of the individual and of competitors.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the question of options.  There are options.  Under the provisions of this Bill the court would have an option of providing community service orders as well.  Perhaps more should be done in that respect.  Probably Deputy Mitchell wants to see people behind bars for a start anyway &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, yes, but thereafter perhaps they should do some work for the community.  I remember in 1984 when I was in Finland and engaged in agricultural research, seeing a bank manager painting the railings of the airport on foot of a community service order. Ever since I have been very keen to see the implementation of community service orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGahon might be surprised yet.  As people have said here, when a person is jailed, again it is the State that pays.  I agree with Deputy <Col N="2458" /> Mitchell that there is a need to make examples of some people.  The implementation of the community service order represents another option which might be considered.  At present there are imprisonment, fines and community service orders.  What is now needed is to have some people engage in community work on foot of such community service orders.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the usage of the words &ldquo;may require an employer.&rdquo; I have explained what I have in mind there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell asked how this would be policed and mentioned one bad experience he had had which, to the best of my knowledge, was an isolated incident. I followed it up for the Deputy at the time.  I agree with him that it should not have happened, it did, but represented an isolated incident.  The Deputy also raised the question of the accountant.  We have only one qualified accountant and he has been with us for the past few months only.  I agree that it is important to have the services of a qualified accountant.  On the other hand, I might add that we have people very experienced in operating controls, computer systems and so on.  We will bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind.  As I have said, we acquired the services of one qualified accountant recently and we will bear in mind the further need in so far as such may obtain.</P>

    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell talked about the method of policing.  One simple method is to be obliged to inform the exchange if one does not have the other documentation. Having said that, there are other things needed to be done.  There is need for a closer link between our work and that of the Revenue Commissioners in this area.  We are working on that aspect.  There is a joint study being undertaken in that area particularly in relation to RSI numbers.  Our experience has been that people can have two or three RSI numbers.  Obviously if one can have two RSI numbers, one can use one while one is at work and the other while drawing unemployment benefit.  That does happen, we are finding that it is happening <Col N="2459" /> at present, and we are anxious to get it under control.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy McGahon for his congratulations on the work done to date.  I must be careful not to delve too deeply into the abuse area.  I want to keep within the context that it constitutes work we have to do.  At the same time our main task is to cater for bona fide applicants.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon raised a number of points and had been suggesting a figure of 10 per cent abuse.  Following on the report of the consultants he thought that figure might be of the order of 9 per cent, claiming that he had some sort of inside information to that effect.</P>

      <P>He would need to bet each way.  The report of the surveys undertaken, which related to the greater Dublin area, showed that there was approximately 2 per cent hard core fraud. The Deputy may be getting his 9 per cent figure from a 7 per cent suspect figure mentioned.  They could not verify whether they were substantiated but they represented suspect claims.</P>

      <P>They ascertained that from examination of individual cases which would then be followed up in so far as we would have information on them.  This arose from their examinations, surveys or discussions with people.  The difficulty of an officer in the employment exchange is that an individual may walk into the exchange claiming that he or she is not working.  The officer may be suspicious of certain people and not at all suspicious of others but he is unable to go out and follow such persons to ascertain where they go.  I imagine that is the type of thing <Col N="2460" /> Deputies have in mind, that they would suspect certain claimants.</P>

      <P>The very difficult budgetary situation has necessitated widespread cuts in public expenditure and these have had to apply to the grant to CBF which in recent years has represented about a third of the body's income.  Its income for 1988 is estimated at £2.5 million compared with about £3 million in 1987.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no area exempt from cuts in public expenditure. I want to say very clearly and definitely to all sectors, including those who might be less sympathetic to farmers than others, that in all my discussions with farming organisations and publicly here in the House I have indicated that no area, particularly the one for which I am responsible, will be exempt from public expenditure adjustments.  I see it as particularly important, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, that I should be <Col N="2468" /> consistent.  When the benefits apply to the farmers I am not going to make special pleading on their behalf.</P>

      <P>Before the Dublin Circuit Court case mentioned in the Deputy's question came to hearing, a full investigation was carried out by my Department and by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Arising from that investigation no export refund payments were made to the company concerned on foot of the exports in relation to which its employee was subsequently convicted of uttering forged documents.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that where irregularities or other breaches of regulations involving fraudulent claims on national or EC funds are discovered by my Department, no effort will be spared to secure convictions in the courts of the companies and/or individuals responsible for such frauds and to recover any sums that may have been wrongfully obtained.</P>

My Department supply information as a consequence of information that comes to them from their investigations.

      <P>Because of the circumstances of the investigation by my Department, information emerged which eventually meant that no moneys were paid, that no refunds were made available. That is the primary consideration of the Department and myself.  I have no evidence of any kind in relation to collaboration.  In view of the importance of this whole area to which the Deputy has drawn attention, in terms of the amount of export refunds, it is my determination and that of my Department to ensure that nothing will be put at risk. Last year, for instance, the total amount of our export refunds in relation to trade with third countries was of the order of £315 million.  Similarly, in relation to payment under the European Guidance and Guarantee Funds it was of the order of £245 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indications are this year that those figures will be increased and, because of the importance of those figures to this economy, I want to assure the Deputy <Col N="2470" /> and the House that the European Commission need have no doubts about our diligence and determination to protect that allocation in the interests of the economy.  I assure the House further that the European Commission have no such doubts.  They are perfectly satisfied with the Government's approach to this matter.</P>

      <P>(1)  Under EC premium schemes, £36.80 per cow is paid in all suckler herds; in addition £7.60 per calf is paid on all calves at six months of age and £15.20 per male bovine at least nine months of age, subject to a maximum of 50 male animals.</P>

    <P>(2)  In the more severely handicapped areas, headage grants on beef cows are £70 on each of the first eight livestock units and £66 on each of the <Col N="2471" /> next 22 and on other cattle £32 and £28 each, respectively, subject to a limit of 30 livestock units and a maximum payment of £2,012.</P>

I have been pursuing diligently with the Commission the question of the extension of the EC disadvantaged area schemes and also that of reclassification.

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the present incentives seem to be ineffective, having particular regard to the fact that 20,000 calves were exported from this country in the 12 months ending 31 October last?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me just put on the record, in view of the questions now being asked, the increase in the value of the scheme this year over last year.  The 1987 suckler cow premium is £9.76 greater than the 1986 one of £27.04.  It is now £37, or to be precise £36.80.  That is considerably more than last year.  The 1987 calf premium has increased by about 25p over last year.  The value of that scheme is £12 million and the value of the first scheme mentioned is £16 million. The 1987 EC special beef premium has <Col N="2473" /> been £15.20 since 11 July of this year. Before that it was £14.72 and the value of that scheme is £21 million.  There is another reality and that is that what we are seeing here are increased grants and premia on all fronts.  The House should recognise that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask a two part supplementary question.  The first part relates to the Minister's comments on the reclassification proposals.  In relation to the modification of the reclassification proposal which was lodged by the Minister on 4 November, will he confirm or deny that the proposal as at present framed excludes dairy cows in the areas proposed to be reclassified?  Secondly, in relation to the suckler cow herds, will the Minister accept that we are facing a national emergency in regard to the drop in cow numbers, projected at 180,000 over the next few years?  Despite the defensive position which the Minister has adopted, will he accept that there is now a need for a major comprehensive programme in an effort to arrest that trend at this late stage which could involve not only the suckler cow herd but a whole variety of areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how relevant that is to the question but if there is an emergency, which I do not accept there is, it has existed for the past five years.  It is a little inconsistent for Deputies opposite to make complaints when action is being proposed when they had nothing at all to say when nothing was being done.</P>

      <P>As we all know, the Treaty of Rome espoused the aspiration that we should concentrate production in areas of greatest natural advantage.  Given that fact, together with our excessive milk production and our under production of beef at present, would the Minister agree that the grants structure generally for the production of beef is imbalanced in that the grasslands are on the east coast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>The matter which the Deputy has addressed may be relevant having regard to the purposes of the Common Agricultural Policy which are both social and economic.  I hope we are getting the balance right.  It is clearly evident that if we were only to go for economic return we would not concentrate as much support in the disadvantaged areas but that is not the only purpose of Government in this area.  We have to maintain a level of family farm income right throughout the country and that is why these schemes are so extensive.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that this problem has not arisen suddenly, even though Deputy O'Keeffe has only suddenly become aware of it, but rather over many years?  Regardless of what incentives he may give will the Minister ask the IFA and the ICMSA in his negotiations with them what incentives they intend to offer their own members to stop the export of 20,000 calves and to create the jobs which are so badly needed in this country?</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said with his usual degree of conviction is something which I would reflect, although not by way of criticism of the organisations.  Action is required by way of decisions and discipline from all concerned and it is clear that those involved, and the organisations recognise this, should encourage farmers to become more conscious of the consequences of cow slaughtering.  The good news is, and I am glad to be able to say it in this House, that cow slaughterings over recent months are much less than had been feared.  Perhaps the farming organisations and the farmers themselves are acting in a very disciplined fashion.</P>

Can the Minister tell us whether he has submitted that application? The Minister has asked for an increase in the level of grants which will be made available.  Instead of recouping 50 per cent of the amount of money which we spend, the Minister is looking to recoup 70 per cent.  Does the Minister not think this will interfere with the application and that it will result in it being left on the bench for quite some time because the Commission will not adhere to that proposal?  Secondly, the Minister indicated that there has been an increase in the level of grants payable this year over last year.  Even though we give credit where credit is due, I hope the Minister will not come into this House and take credit for the excellent work which was done by the previous Minister in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Against the background of heavily over-supplied markets in the Community and worldwide, the current proposals on sugar by the EC Commission do not provide for any changes in member states' production quotas and the negotiations to date would suggest that this will be the likely outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in view of the restriction on the production of milk and the interest in beet production shown by the farming community, in particular by the members of Macra na Feirme, there is a case for seeking an increase in Irish sugar quotas from the EC?  Is the Minister aware of the increased efficiency of sugar plants such as Mallow which has a throughput of £7,000 per day and of the great potential for creating jobs producing by-products of sugar beet?  Is the Minister prepared to make a case for an increased quota?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a case and it is reflected in the Commission's proposals in respect of levies for overproduction which I referred to and which will have little effect on Irish sugar production. Those proposals will have a major effect on other countries.  There will be a 2 per cent levy on &ldquo;A&rdquo; sugar which is the total of what we have, 182,000 tonnes, and 37 per cent levy on &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  The Deputy will be aware that we have not filled our &ldquo;A&rdquo; quota.  Other countries are complaining bitterly that the Commission's proposals will impose very heavy penalties on them.  The proposals, to say the least, are reflecting the Commission's response to our negotiations to the extent that we can get special treatment.  However, we have not, over the last couple of years, filled the existing quotas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that restrictions have been imposed on the production of beet by the decision to refuse contracts?  Macra na Feirme made a submission to the Department in regard to that and I should like to know if that is the reason we are not in a position to fill our sugar quota.  Is there any restriction on the production of sugar beet?</P>

The indications are that this year we will exceed our quota.  If the Deputy has any evidence of the refusal of contracts I would be glad if he would communicate it to me so that I can take the matter up with the sugar company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to supply, any projects that have been grant-aided are not dependent on increased supply. As I said in the course of my reply on 9 December, and earlier today, it is not possible to increase numbers overnight. There is a natural gestation period and after several years of decline it will ake some time to increase numbers.  The IDA grant aids relate to modernising the industry so that we will be internationally competitive and increase the degree of added value.  The whole thrust of the policy is to get the fundamentals beyond the farm gate and into processing, packaging and presentation in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed my point.  I am referring to the condition in the letter of sanction relating to the grant which would put some onus on the grantee to be involved, financially and otherwise, in efforts to improve the supply of raw material.  Otherwise, as is hinted in the question, the money may be wasted.  Is there an onus put on the grantee to contribute towards a solution of the problem of shortage of raw materials?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Projects which are grant-aided are grant-aided on the basis of current supplies of raw materials and not on increased supply.  To get an increase in numbers, the meat industry are involved with the financial institutions and the farming organisations in preparing a suitable package.  That is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we <Col N="2482" /> have adequate processing facilities.  For many years we put a lot of emphasis on increased production and what we are doing now is modernising the processing end of the industry.  We want to correct the weakness there.

      <P>I did not say there was an over capacity.  I said there was an inadequate and less than modern processing industry in the country and that I believe the important place to start is at the market place, that having modernised the processing and marketing part of the industry, the confidence that will result will ensure that we will have increased numbers at production level.  For years we had been trying the other way round, to increase production while leaving a weakness in the processing and marketing end of the industry.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  It is one of the matters in which producer nations like us and the EC collectively have a major responsibility to address.  For that reason I have proposed to my colleagues in the EC Council of Agriculture Ministers that we address the problems of the world market while maintaining a level of adequate price for our producers, at the same time ensuring adequate supplies for the countries in need.  I can tell the Deputy, whose concern I share, that we are reducing in many areas, for instance in skim milk powder of which we have hardly any intervention stocks at all now, that we are supplying areas of need in a balanced way to meet their needs while at the same time maintaining reasonable prices for ourselves. The Deputy's question is well based and I will continue to pursue it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 25 September I presented proposals for a new management structure for the bovine tuberculosis scheme to farmer and veterinary representatives.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if the farm organisations and the veterinary interests concerned asked me specifically for time to let them consult so that they could at least agree on the action I would take, that is what I should do, and what I have been doing. I am expecting to hear from them very shortly but I do not want to anticipate the outcome of those discussions.  Even before the new management framework is introduced, the results under the old scheme were very encouraging.  We have committed adequate financing this year and we will do the same next year and the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the House what I hope will be reassuring information.  More than 134,000 herd tests had been completed at the end of November and we found no major flare-up of disease.  Some 5,200 herds are restricted.  The number of animals now reacting is below three per 1,000 and the number of reactors is down in expectations.  There are fewer than 50 herds infected with brucellosis.  Even <Col N="2489" /> pending the introduction of a new management structure, considerable progress has been made and the Government and I are determined to provide adequate finance for this programme over the years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if he will agree to meet representatives of the Irish Farmers' Potato Co-operative in order to discuss (1) the payment of moneys due to the co-operative from his Department; (2) the future financing of the co-operative and (3) the steps which will be taken to overcome the serious problems encountered by the co-operative due to the withdrawal of Kinsealy Farms, County Dublin, from the marketing arrangements with the co-operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 86 on 28 October in which I indicated that the co-operative had already received £107,000 in aid from my Department.  I explained that, as the co-operative had failed to meet the conditions prescribed for further aid, I had no option but to refuse such aid from public funds.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, a meeting with representatives of the co-operative would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Since that question was put down, we have had a breakdown of the trade agreement, the marketing arrangement between the co-operative and Kinsealy Farms.  This was their sole link with the marketing scene.  Would the Minister, even at this late stage, reconditure <Col N="2491" /> sider the position of this co-operative?  I am appealing to him because we have had a lot of talk from the Minister about producer groups.  Here we have a producer group.  Would he at least offer to meet them to see if anything could be done to salvage what was a very brave effort, which was doing reasonably well until the marketing arrangement, through no fault of theirs, fell through when Kinsealy Farms pulled out and left them high and dry?  Surely, it would be right for the Minister to meet these people to see if some other arrangement could be made and if they could be adequately financed in the interim period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to point out that the Department were not privy to the particular arrangement the potato co-operative had with Kinsealy Farms.  In 1984-85, they paid £107,000 but unfortunately the conditions laid down were that substantial progress would have to be made and that there would be significant non-Exchequer funding for the effort. Regrettably, on both counts, the arrangements have been less than satisfactory.</P>

When these are finalised I will submit my proposals regarding the future of the sector to the Government. In the meantime the winding up of the affairs of Bord Na gCapall is proceeding.

      <P>Would the Minister assure the House that he is taking as a matter of urgency, the major difficulties that exist in the half-bred industry?  I support the proposal to abolish Bord na gCapall but we need to put in place structures to provide for this vital flagship industry, particularly as the registration of foals is not getting sufficient attention.  Would the Minister comment on his plans in this area?  Does he intend charging £15 to register a foal?  Does he realise that £15 will also have to be spent on a vet filling in a marketing certificate and that £30 <Col N="2493" /> per half-bred foal would effectively put most people out of the area of registering their foals, which defeats the purpose?  Is he looking at the major insurance problems in this industry and can he give assurances on this point?  Will the future of the Irish draught mares be part of his plans?  The future of the Connemara Pony Breeders' Society, which is an extremely important establishment protecting our only native pony, is in perilous financial condition.  The half-bred breeder is almost extinct apart altogether from the threat to the animal.  We need immediately, urgent and detailed plans from the Minister to protect this vital industry.  When can we expect them?</P>

      <P>It is not appropriate to come to a direct conclusion in relation to the difference between the funding of a new Authority and existing different authorities.  Neither is it appropriate to reach conclusions from adding the funding available for the two existing authorities, comparing it with the new Authority and coming to the conclusion that, therefore, you lose £X million and so many jobs.  It is not appropriate because the new Authority under the new <Col N="2495" /> directorate will have particular priorities and a revenue earning capacity which was not part of the priorities of the two existing Authorities.  A whole range of things can and will be done under the new Authority which change the whole funding analysis presented in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>Farmers who can pay for professional consultancy services should pay for services instead of the taxpayer paying for them.  If they are getting expert advice there is a case in justice and commercially for them to pay. Indeed, they acknowledged that themselves because they have paid much more to ACOT this year for professional services than anyone expected.  The choice is that either the people benefiting from the service pay for it, to some extent, or other taxpayers who are not involved will be asked to pay for it.  Given that choice, it is reasonable to say that those who benefit should pay for it.</P>

      <P>That has been trotted out very often.  I gave figures here today of the amount of money being transferred to this country under European Community funding in 1986 when my distinguished colleague, Deputy Deasy, was in office.  They were considerable sums of money and it involves people negotiating for it and ensuring that it is properly spent.  Far too many people are running away with the notion that the money flows through open channels and it is time that idea was nailed.  The total amount of money coming from the European Community this year is of the order of £1,500 million and that must be properly <Col N="2496" /> implemented.  The Deputies should not give the impression that you can cut down on the numbers involved in handling the money.</P>

      <P>The National Food Centre is to be operated as an integral part of the amalgamated AFT-ACOT joint research, <Col N="2497" /> training and advisory authority, the legislation for which is being introduced shortly.  The funding, staffing and other operating aspects for the food centre are matters for decision by AFT and later by the new body.  In line with the Government's intentions for the food industry in general and for the new body in particular, the food centre will be operated on market-led commercial criteria.  In the 1988 Estimates, under grants for the IIRS, provision has been made for the staff engaged in food research and development proposed to be transferred to the new authority.  The technical details of the move are currently being finalised with the organisations concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and arising from his reply, which I find unsatisfactory because he does not have the information I require, could I ask him if the original provision of £3 million, half of which will be earned by fees, will still be available to the National Food Centre in view of the position arising from the Book of Estimates?</P>
      <P>Could I also ask him if the original decision of last May that there will be 16 IIRS staff and 30 AFT staff, which gives a total of 46, will make up the staff of the National Food Centre?  In view of the take-up of redundancy in the AFT area can the Minister indicate whether this original package, as indicated in May is still viable?  There are no guidelines set down for the National Food Centre and it is very important that the commercial market orientation, originally seen and as agreed to by the AFT-IIRS boards would continue to be the basis of the criteria laid down for this new body.  I want to ask the Minister if that is so and if he is aware that it was on this basis that both the staff and boards involved in the original organisations agreed to the May proposal.</P>

      <P>In July of this year agreement in principle was reached between An Foras Talúntais and the Institute for Industrial Research and <Col N="2498" /> Standards on the establishment of a National Food Centre at Dunsinea.  The centre will integrate the research and development food programmes of both organisations and this should result in an improved range of cost-effective services being made available to the food industry. The detailed administration of the centre, including funding, staffing and operation, is a matter for decision by the new joint authority.  Some of the organisational details, including funding, involving the transfer to the new body of relevant IIRS staff engaged in food research and development are presently being worked out between the Department of Agriculture and Food, the two organisations concerned and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In the Bill, as published today, food is a specific priority area for the new authority.</P>

      <P>The new food centre will service the technical and marketing needs of the commercial industry and will provide technological consultancy services, sub-contracting of technological expertise, particularly to small firms, and expert advice on franchise and licensing arrangements to firms throughout the country.  It is envisaged that commercial scale testing of new food products will be conducted either at the centre or in the factories of smaller firms who do not have in-house R &amp; D facilities.  The graduates at the centre will go out to the factories and do their research and development work on the production line.  This will provide a stimulus towards innovation, adaptation and improved efficiency within the industry, so there will be no question of the new centre spending a great deal of their time on basic and sometimes irrevelant research <Col N="2499" /> work.  It will have a totally commercial focus.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon raised some very relevant points in the course of his contribution on this section and, in particular, he questioned the extent of abuse.  I think I have indicated as clearly as I could the nature and extent of fraudulent claiming, abuse and unwarranted claiming and tried to put them into context. He asked me very specifically what the position would be in relation to the special investigation unit.  I can assure him that the activities of the unit will continue and be intensified and we will review their position in relation to the forthcoming budgetary figures and targets. The Estimates are prepared well in advance of the end of the year and published in October.  Of course, that means that included in the Estimates are those figures which we could estimate at that <Col N="2542" /> time &mdash; at the latest in September.  Obviously we have some further knowledge of the outcome of the various investigations and activities which we were engaged in towards the end of the year and they have turned out to be somewhat more productive than anticipated.  For that reason we will look again, particularly in the context of the budget, at the activities of this unit and the possible returns from them.  I take the point raised by Deputy McGahon that the special investigation unit have an important part to play.  They will continue to operate and we will be looking at their intensification.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGahon mentioned a figure in excess of £200 million in terms of potential savings from fraud and abuse. This is a complete misconception of the position.  If one talks about a level of fraud of even 5 per cent, or whatever the percentage might be at the end of the day, one can only apply that to the work that is being done in relation to unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit.  Any figures that might apply to other schemes such as old age pensions or widows' pensions would of course be very small by comparison. You cannot just take the total expenditure and apply a percentage such as that to it.  The other matter one must take into consideration is the fact that these percentages apply to people who, at some stage of their claims, are guilty of an abuse of the system or of defrauding the system.  It does not mean that each person has been defrauding the system for the whole year and therefore the amounts of money saved are consequently much less than one would think. Nevertheless they are substantial.  They are greater this year than at any time previously as a result of the various activities and we will certainly be giving every attention to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked me a very interesting question, that of the continuing benefit of the savings for this year.  I would have to let Deputy Mitchell meet with some of the economists in the Department of Finance to work that out between themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>He is right in the sense that there is a continuing benefit but how to quantify it is another matter.  The continuing benefit is largely taken into consideration in the Estimates for 1988.  I say &ldquo;largely&rdquo; because, as I have said, towards the end of the year it turned out that the savings were somewhat greater than estimated earlier but there would be an element of further consideration given the outcome at the end of the year.  In other words you reach a new plane. Savings of approximately £1.25 million per week have accrued from the Jobsearch scheme and every additional week at this stage means an extra £1.24 million, £1.25 million or £1.26 million.  At the end of the year we draw a line because that money related to this year's Estimat and activities.  From 1 January we will start afresh.  Obviously there is a Jobsearch programme planned for next year and the Estimates for 1988 include a figure of £8 million to £8.5 million for that programme.  A greater emphasis will be placed on the savings that will accure from people availing of opportunities as a result of this scheme.  The figures are taken into consideration in global terms. We will start the year on a different plane and will start calculating from the beginning of the year for spending for next year.  There is some additional element to this matter to which we will give further consideration.</P>
      <P>Various activities will take place next year including the external control unit. I am quite certain that the figures in the Estimates for next year for the external control unit can be increased.  That became clear from the outcome of the activity of the external control unit as the year came to a close and particularly in the last quarter of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this legislation we will be intensifying our activities in regard to employers.  We expect to have greater savings from that area next year and we will be considering that matter in relation to the figures for the coming year.  As the Deputy knows, the question of statutory <Col N="2544" /> sick pay and the effect it may have also arises.  It will take some time before that scheme will come into operation because it is a very major undertaking.  I think I have dealt with most of the questions that have been raised.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins said that the £200 million is ridiculous and I agree with him on that.  I have dealt with most of the other matters he has raised.  He emphasised in particular that there is no proposal in this Bill to get money back from employers.  That is being dealt with separately through the surveys and the other activities I mentioned.  Finally, he mentioned the question of the psychological effects and the effects on the health of people who are long term unemployed and who are anxious to be in employment.  I agree entirely with him that that is a problem.  I hope to do more next year in relation to the part time job allowance scheme, the educational opportunities scheme and the voluntary organisations schemes.  I will be considering those matters during the short recess at Christmas to try to organise something in that regard for next year.  I assure the Deputy I have quite an interest in that aspect and I will be pursuing it further.  He also talked about the wider options in regard to prisons.  I would agree with him on that.  I have pleasure in accepting the amendment put forward by Deputy Mitchell to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given an extremely extensive reply and many points arise which are of considerable interest.  The contributions from all sides of the House so far in this debate have been singularly in harmony, except for perhaps the prodding from the loony left to the loony right which Deputy Mc Gahan and Deputy Higgins engaged in. <Col N="2545" /> However, Deputy Higgins' contribution was an extremely lucid and valuable one.</P>
      <P>The consensus which has emerged clearly in the House in relation to social welfare fraud is not something that was always evident in the House.  In my experience, especially in Government &mdash; and I say this with respect for my former colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond &mdash; any proposals put forward in relation to tackling fraud were always open to the suggestion that really what we were tackling was the whole idea of social welfare. It is important to emphasise that the consensus in the House in relation to fraud is a consensus based on a united commitment to a good, progressive social welfare system, a system that above all else eliminates poverty in our midst.  In attacking fraud I am motivated, and I am sure the same applies to everyone who has spoken, by the desire not to allow the social welfare system to fall into disrepute and to try to release resources so that more money can be given to the less well off.  I will never tire of highlighting the fact that we ask, and expect, many thousands of people to live on £35 or £36 a week, particularly the long term unemployed living alone and single women over 58 years of age living alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may wish to play down the amount of savings made.  He has admitted to saving £36 million this year as a result of the clampdown on fraud but when spread over a full year that amount will be much more than £36 million.  This vindicates something that I have been pressing both in and out of Government for the last five years.  I want to make a special plea to the Minister to ensure that at least half the resources saved are redirected towards the most needy groups in the area of social welfare so that we can make progress in achieving some of the objectives set out by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Minister told me yesterday in the Dáil that in a full year it would cost £60 million merely to increase unemployment assistance to a minimum of £45 a week. However, I expect that at least to happen <Col N="2546" /> in the forthcoming budget.  Notwithstanding the constraints on the public finances no one could begrudge those in receipt of unemployment assistance that sort of increase and it would be only a first step.  The social welfare commission suggested that the payment should be somewhere in the region of £50 to £60 a week but it is clear that such an increase would cost a huge amount of money.</P>
    <P>Before the lunch break the Minister said that the additional weekly savings arising from Jobsearch is £1.25 million, that is, £65 million in a year.  Even if this figure cannot be annualised and even if it is not £65 million, there is a substantial figure involved.  The Minister told us in the debate yesterday and in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate last week about his success in reducing the numbers on disability benefit from 82,000 to 72,000, a reduction of 12½ per cent.  The measures to make disability benefit payment by employers if introduced halfheartedly or in an ill-considered way would be prone to abuse and there could be collusion between employers and employees.  If the measures are applied intelligently they could lead to further savings in the area of disability benefit. There is no doubt that at the moment many people feel bound to go out sick especially at this time of the year because they are going into the higher tax bands and they feel it is not worth their while to work for 40p in the pound.  They go out sick and get tax rebates and disability benefit and they are better off.  That situation will be resolved by the Minister's measure which will make employers pay disability benefit.  This move is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for Deputy Desmond who was Minister for Health and Social Welfare but he, like Deputy Woods and Deputy Haughey, apart from having responsibility for the Department of Health had responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare and, consequently, the Department of Social Welfare did not get the attention it deserved.  These are two enormous spending Departments and until they <Col N="2547" /> were separated last year by Deputy FitzGerald the Department of Social Welfare did not get the attention it deserved as the Minister was always too busy.  Dr. FitzGerald appointed Deputy Gemma Hussey as Minister for Social Welfare and now the benefits of having a separate Minister are beginning to show.  It was Deputy Gemma Hussey who as Minister introduced the Jobsearch scheme which is being continued by the present Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point because this is something about which I am very concerned and which makes me angry.  We have not been able to find resources to give reasonably good basic payments to people and yet we have <Col N="2548" /> allowed extensive abuse to develop in the social welfare system.  The appointment of a separate Minister for Social Welfare is only now showing results.  Never again should two such big spending Departments be put together.  It is too much for any Minister and it could have costly implications.</P>
      <P>The Minister is obviously very careful not to quantify the amount of abuse suspected in the system.  We have addressed the abuses in unemployment benefit and assistance and we have referred to abuses in the disability benefit system but we have not looked at other areas of abuse, for instance, in unmarried mother's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, free electricity, free telephone rental, free television licence and so on.  Even that is not the end of it.  Neither have we addressed areas in which we are directing resources towards people who are well off in greater proportion than we are to poorer people as, for instance, in child benefit and as in the case of the Christmas bonus where the bigger one's pension or benefit, the bigger the bonus.  That must be changed.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for accepting this amendment.  It was gracious of him to accept it.  I thank the Deputies from the other parties, Deputy Wyse for withdrawing his amendment and for accepting mine, and Deputy Bell for agreeing to support it.  I hope that these amendments will prove effective and will be applied with vigour by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins stressed the lack of reference to employers who fail to pay the money deducted from employees.  Such employers are not dealt with in this Bill but are dealt with elsewhere in social welfare legislation.  I agree with Deputy Higgins' point that in any review of legislation we should expect more effective proposals from the Minister in relation to employers who default in transmitting payments stopped from employees.  There must be action in this area.  I want to see a few Lester Piggotts in jail.  A few high profile people in jail would stop these abuses, it would save the Minister a lot of hassle and the State <Col N="2549" /> a lot of money and it would release resources for the poor.</P>
    <P>If this legislation now being agreed is to be implemented, all public representatives will have representations to prevent prosecutions.  I am sorry I did not think of it on Committee Stage but in future social welfare legislation we might take a leaf out of the legislation setting up the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and indeed the Extradition Bill which forbade any representations by public representatives in relation to prosecutions and forbid all representations in relation to social welfare fraud.  I can see the sort of pressure which Deputies and Ministers could come under if there were not that prohibition.  It should be considered.  I hope we have done a good day's work in agreeing these amendments and I am glad to have been the author of them.</P>

      <P>I have noted what the Deputy has said about the priority areas for next year.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have so many matters to look after, the alleviating payments being just one area.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.  Regarding the Jobsearch scheme I accept that the pilot study was carried out last year and then examined.  Six hundred people had been involved in Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght.  There were many debates about the indications coming from this pilot scheme.  In March the incoming Government decided they would do something substantial on the basis of the pilot study.  I set up a model based on 6,000 people and said that if we had the resources we could extend the project ten <Col N="2550" /> times over to cover 60,000 people.  The Government then gave us the resources to cater for 150,000 people.  The resources became available through the reallocations of people within the Civil Service generally.  This involved a major redirection of resources towards the longterm unemployed.  It was a huge undertaking for AnCO, Manpower and the Department of Social Welfare and I paid tribute to the work they put into it.  We must look at other pilot studies and ask ourselves how far we can go with them. That is the kind of thing I will be trying to do.</P>
      <P>The figures for fraud were based on surveys carried out in the Dublin area. The external control unit are convinced that the extent of the fraud is greater in rural areas, partly because of the availability of casual work of various kinds. Consequently we will have to give that matter more attention.</P>

      <P>It is provided in section 3 that an employer &ldquo;shall&rdquo; furnish, whereas in section 2 it is stated that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; require.  This was raised earlier by another Deputy in the context of section 2.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of making it mandatory for employers to notify him automatically when new people are employed.  This would be a matter for a future Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We agreed earlier to discuss the amendments together and they <Col N="2552" /> were to be taken in the sections as we came to them.  We can look at Deputy Mitchell's suggestion in the future but I am inclined to think that it would be unduly restrictive.  I believe it will be possible to achieve what we want without changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and making it mandatory.  The reason is that so many employers co-operate very fully with the officials.  People generally accept that we need the regulations in order to deal with the exceptions.  Nevertheless, if it transpires that it is not feasible, I would not hesitate to come back to the House, as Deputy Mitchell has suggested.</P>
      <P>Section 3 imposes an obligation on employers in respect of claimants who benefit to provide such particulars as may be required to enable a proper determination or review of a claim to be carried out.  The section also provides that regulations may be made specifying the details which must be furnished and that employers who fail to furnish the required particulars shall be guilty of an offence.  The Department regularly ask employers to confirm periods of absence from work for disability benefit purposes and periods of employment for unemployment payment purposes so as to permit claims to benefit to be verified. Most employers co-operate but some sanctions against those who fail consistently to assist the Department in these necessary investigations is required.  The co-operation of employers is essential if abuse of the system is to be effectively dealt with.  Random checks on claims to disability benefit, for instance, have proved to be extremely effective in detecting abuse.  For example, 14,000 such inquiries initiated this year brought to light 1,100 cases of possible abuse from which overpayments of £460,000 have been detected to date.  Following the success of these random checks a more effective system of follow-up was introduced this year involving the targeting of particular industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best example of the effectiveness of these procedures is that of Arigna collieries. In that case 117 of 180 employees were found to have lodged fraudulent claims to disability benefit involving over <Col N="2553" /> payments in the region of £90,000.  Proceeding are pending in nine cases, court action is planned in a further 92 cases, making 101 in total.</P>
    <P>Cases of fraud were also detected in two other mines in the same region, in one case involving 22 of the 25 employees and 35 out of the 40 in the other.  Fortyseven of these cases have already been referred for proceedings.  These cases indicate the importance of the co-operation we receive from employers in relation to inquiries we initiate.  I might add that the amounts of money in these cases are substantial.  In some cases the amounts range from £6,900 plus to £3,486, £3,280, £2,662 to £2,486.  Obviously cases like the first one I mentioned &mdash; involving £6,900 &mdash; necessitated investigation over quite a long period.  It appears that after some time more people became involved and, later still, even more.  There were quite a number of cases involving overpayments in the region of £900, £600, £500, £400, a whole range of different amounts.  That indicates that it had been allowed run on, becoming something of a habit, some people having led the way earlier on. They are included in the larger amounts I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is another company in the northeast in respect of which further investigations of a fairly extensive nature were carried out between the months of July and September 1987.  Out of a total workforce of 130 some 106 persons were identified as claiming for periods varying from a few days to 230 days.  The evidence in these cases is being assembled.  It is expected that they will be referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office as early as possible in the New Year.  Again, this was an example of the response to our inquiries of employers.  In one case in which there was a response to our inquiries it became clear &mdash; in the mines case &mdash; that the individual concerned was not out on disability benefit at that time but was claiming disability benefit and working at the same time.  Under the new approach we adopted, what was done was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there are to be sanctions imposed on people in order to give these provisions more teeth &mdash; as would be required by Deputy Mitchell, the reasons for which he set out yesterday and with which he dealt again today &mdash; I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the House to the kind advice given to the Minister for Finance last week by Deputy Crotty in relation to the noncriminalisation of employers through the arbitrary imposition of heavy sanctions. When dealing with the implementation of the provisions of these sections I would implore the Minister that whatever sanctions would be available to him be imposed only after a thorough investigation of the tendency of the particular sector to abuse the regulations.  I understand that to be the case, that the Minister is contemplating sanctions in respect of particular sections of employment.  The Opposition are quite right to tease out the possibilities there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even when the regulations in respect of the provision of sanctions are applied to a particular sector I should like to think that they would be applied by the <Col N="2556" /> Department on a consensus basis, in consultation with the sector concerned, so that the accusation often laid against officialdom &mdash; when dealing with the bureaucracy attached to the taking of people into employment &mdash; is not labelled as a criminalisation of employers.  There is a nice balance to be struck between the head-down prosecution of people who break the rules technically and the prosecution of people who cannot be got to adhere to the rules under any circumstances. In the first instance I hope the Department will pursue those who go ahead heedless of the rules, who are determined not to keep them, who abuse their position as employers and gain really competitive advantage over other employers who pay their proper PRSI contributions, employ properly unionised labour and adhere to all the industrial relations rules and employment regulations in other areas.  I say that in the knowledge that there are many in the twilight zone between sheer rogues and thoroughly responsible employers who very often are in a position where they could benefit from a bit of advice from Department officials.  I say this because many of my constituents come to me from time to time and complain that employers have been criminalised in the past, that there are all sorts of incentives, grants, encouragement, exhortations to set up in business, that young people especially are subjected to these, but that as soon as they set up in business the tax man is there.</P>

It is not this House that will criminalise employers.  It is the employers who will criminalise themselves if they break the law.  The law should be applied.  Deputy Abbott is a distinguished barrister and he will know more than most that the people who end up in gaol in the courts of this land are rarely other than working class people.  There is this nice respectable family syndrome and people will say &ldquo;do not put him in gaol&rdquo;.  He should be put in gaol if he is breaking the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just a point I would like to make in relation to this section. The fact is there does not seem to be any power on the part of the Minister to mitigate the more onerous sanction of imprisonment, or even the very large maximum fine that can be imposed under this legislation.  I would just like to make the point that there is no mitigation and it should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point here is that the courts have a maximum of £10,000 on indictment.  It is not a large sum.  The employers contribution on one employed person on the average industrial wage for a year is about £1,200, so £10,000 would only cover seven or eight employees on the average wage.  Second, in relation to mitigating prison sentences, the Minister for Justice already has extensive powers in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked about people giving false information. That is already covered in section 115 of <Col N="2560" /> the Consolidation Act which says that anyone who makes any false statement or false representation or knowingly conceals any material or fact shall be guilty of an offence.  That at present carries, on indictment, a two-year prison sentence.  Deputy Mitchell is right in relation to the power to mitigate resting with the Minister for Justice in relation to fines in particular.</P>
      <P>There is a question of balance.  Where small amounts are involved, it is not the custom of the Department to press for a prosecution.  That is one of the elements of decisions taken by officials at that level because in some cases there may be an amount of £56 and one cannot say &ldquo;£56 is £56 and it is an offence and that is it&rdquo;. Those matters are taken into consideration at the first level in relation to the frequency of the offence and at the next level by the Chief State Solicitor's office in considering the cases which they would decide to proceed with in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on amendment No. 3 in relation to the option to be convicted on indictment.  As I see it here, although I have not had that much time to consider it, there seems to be an option on the part of every person who is being prosecuted to go forward on indictment.  This type of provision has been put into the legislation affecting joyriders. Formerly the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle was a summary offence punishable summarily in the District Court and a few years ago in one of the Criminal Justice Acts the type of option to be convicted on indictment was given in respect of these offences.  At the time that legislation was proposed allowing for the indictable aspect of the offence I had reservations on it and I think these reservations have been borne out by the experience of the long suffering public in relation to joyriding.  I do not want to divert into joyriding for any considerable period of time but I am just instancing it as a parallel involving the same type of legislation.  The incidence of joyriding has not declined one bit since making the offence of unlawful taking of a motor <Col N="2561" /> vehicle a more serious offence punishable on indictment.</P>
      <P>All the indications tend to show that by giving to the person accused of such offence and, indeed, to one accused of an offence under section 4, that option of going before the Circuit Court for a jury trial on indictment one gives a very advantageous time-buying opportunity to that person.  The experience in the joyriding area is that very often while persons are awaiting trial before the Circuit Court similar offences are committed.  I can see situations where, in the absence of any tighter company legislation being passed, unscrupulous operators of limited companies would buy the time available through opting for a Circuit Court trial to go on to commit further offences. They would thus avoid a heavy penalty and possible detection by trading their company out of assets and possibly running from the jurisdiction by the time the company are left without assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would bow to the Minister's overall view of the amendment, I would voice my personal misgivings and warnings in relation to the section as it might be amended by the proposed amendment No. 3, in so far as it gives that option to the unscrupulous, unco-operative person in a commercial context who is already guilty and has no intention of contrition but, on the contrary, intends to go on to commit these offences, to defraud the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners of revenue by availing of this device of the court which necessarily involves a delay through awaiting trial on an indictable offence. The proliferation of indictable offences created both by this House in the last few years, especially in the joyriding area, and through the increase of crime, has left the criminal courts, especially in the Dublin area, very much choc-a-bloc. Those involved have had fairly long delays before trial in recent years.  The option in subsection 3 (b) of the proposed amendment gives a loophole to the very persons whom it is intended to block by Deputy Mitchell's amendment, to evade the justice which Deputy Mitchell would <Col N="2562" /> seek to impose on them.  That must be of concern to us.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of the record, what we are doing is this.  Under the existing provisions in section 114 (3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act of 1981 employers may be required <Col N="2564" /> to furnish all such information and produce all such documents as the social welfare inspector may reasonably require.  Section 5 provides that such records as may be required by social welfare inspectors for the purpose of investigating such welfare claims must be produced by employers at their registered address or principal place of business. It also gives the powers to impose the amended sanctions that we have mentioned and that have been approved by the House.  Sometimes it happens that employers delay inspectors in the examination of the required records by claiming that they are held by their agents who, in turn, may say that they only hold a portion of them.  Section 5 is designed to counter these evasive actions.  The provision will be particularly effective in the campaign against fraud and abuse as it is only by examination of employers' records that cases of non-compliance can be detected.</P>

      <P>I am obliged for the Minister's explanation as to why he accepts the amendment.  He is entitled to put on the record of the House why he does so. It would be quite surprising if matters were agreed in this House without a formal record as to the reasons for doing so on the part of Government.  I shall not repeat what I said in relation to the previous amendment on conviction on indictment.  I am glad to hear that the Minister will be dealing with the situation early next year with regard to penalties generally.  I take this opportunity to ask him to bear in mind my submissions in relation to the last amendment.  It would not be fair or reasonable to put the Minsiter or members of the Opposition on the spot in that regard.  I would ask them to look at the experience in relation to joyriders on the imposition of trial on indictment.  It is the trial on indictment which is the connecting factor and no other but it is a matter which should be considered by all Members of this House, just to see if they are doing right or just putting into the record of the House and into legislation a gallant and fine sounding provision which mentions conviction <Col N="2565" /> on indictment but actually takes from the effectiveness of the legislation.</P>

      <P>In relation to inspection of records at the registered office, this is something about which I have slight misgivings.  There is no limit in this section as to the time when these records are to be made available.  It can happen that the records are not readily available. I appreciate that the inspector will go to great lengths before he recommends that this section be implemented against the defaulting employer.  I do not know whether we could consider it at this late stage but the fact that there is no time limit provided for is slightly disquieting. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is covered by the fact that an inspector may require a person to produce records within a reasonable time.  One may ask what does &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; mean but at least we have a &ldquo;reasonable place&rdquo; now which will either be the registered office or the place of business.  That nails that matter down. There is no time limit outlined in the Bill but a person will be required to produce records within a reasonable time.  That has worked reasonably well in regard to the other sections in the Consolidation Acts which apply to these matters.  I am happy enough with that for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing provisions contained in section 15 (5) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 employers may be required by regulations to keep such records as may be prescribed in relation to the earnings and periods of employment of their employees.  Section 6, as now amended, requires that details of earnings and the periods to which they refer be recorded by employers at or before the time of payment of wages.  Most reputable employers keep their records updated but others fail to maintain any records or perhaps do so long after the event.  This makes it impossible to determine the true position in relation to such matters as the number of persons employed, the period of employment, whether correct deductions of social welfare insurance have been made and whether any other aspects of the social insurance scheme are being neglected or abused by the employer or any of his employees.</P>
      <P>It also serves to prevent detection of cases of employees who may also be concurrently signing for unemployement payments. Failure to record the prescribed particulars on time also means that if and when the records are eventually compiled they may not reflect the true position. This can be done for a variety of reasons such as to thwart an inquiry, to lessen the employer's liability or to cloak irregularities either by the employer or his employees.</P>

I understood a point which was made by, I think, Deputy Higgins this morning in regard to the contributions paid by employees but not passed on alluded to that heading.

      <P>All I ask of the Minister in the implementation of this section is to try to ensure that the format of the tax card of each individual which is kept by the employer for PAYE and PRSI deductions be adhered to as much as possible and avoid duplication as much as possible and in so far as is feasible, in the keeping of records.  While I accept that the Minister must adhere to the special requirements of the Department of Social Welfare, we should not miss an opportunity in this House to ask him to be mindful of the cost implications of too many forms and book entries having to be kept, particularly by small employers. Many small employers rely very often on an untrained or inexperienced member of the staff to acquire the skill of keeping tax cards and making the deductions.  To impose on such employers a necessity to train staff to do that work would amount to a great imposition on them.  There would be the question of the amount of time involved, for instance.  Matters should be kept as simple as possible.  The trade union movement and the employers' side have often complained in the past about the multiplicity of documentation involved.  In the customs area great efforts have been made to simplify documentation.  In the implementation of this legislation the Department should not lose sight of the need to keep costs and complications at a minimum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 7, to insert the following new section:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;Where an offence under section 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Act is committed by a body corporate or an officer of the body corporate, every person who, at the time of the commission of the offence was a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, or was purporting to act in any such capacity, shall also be guilty of that offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to say that the wording of the amendment before us is borrowed directly from section 17 (b) of the Social Welfare Act, 1983.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that where a company is found guilty of any offence under the Bill &mdash; I accept that it will not be possible to jail a company although it is possible to impose a fine &mdash; the term of imprisonment will apply to the personnel responsible in that company.  Is it possible to extend the remit of the amendment throughout the social welfare code?</P>

      <P>I have some worries about the amendment in that it seems to be very wide-ranging.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response to it.  Where companies are found guilty of offences the personnel responsible should be brought before a court but it is draconian to make everybody in the company, at managerial, secretarial or director level, guilty of the same offence. Will the Minister indicate how the powers in section 7 will be effected?  The section states that the premises and places liable to inspection are any premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any persons are or have been employed or self-employed and any premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any documents relating to employed persons or to self-employed persons are kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2570" /> That is a wide-ranging provision and I should like to know what rights an inspector will have to enter a premises.  Will a court order be required if access is refused or will an inspector have a right to enter without a court order?  Regardless of what we think of the offences, and the offenders, we have to maintain the rights of individuals to privacy, particularly in their own homes.  That section may be applied if an inspector believes that a director, a manager or some other employee, has taken records from a business premises and brought them home. It appears that in such a case an inspector has a right to visit the home of that employee.</P>

      <P>I agree, to a certain extent, with the description by Deputy De Rossa of the wide-ranging nature of the amendment.  I was surprised to see that section 17 (b) of the 1983 Act was so extensive.  I would have thought that the legislation would have specified an officer, or particular officers, rather than every officer.  I do not want to render the amendments we have agreed so far nonoperative in relation to companies by not <Col N="2571" /> being able to jail the directors, senior managers or those responsible in a company. I took advice on this from the Bills Office and they referred me to section 17 of the 1983 Act.</P>

That provision already exists in the legislation&mdash;section 115 for social insurance benefits and section 144, as amended by section 19 of the 1983 Act, for unemployment assistance.  Those sections will apply to the new offences being provided for in the Bill and, therefore, the amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>In deference to what Deputy Mitchell said on Second Stage about moneylenders I am asking the Combat Poverty Agency, in relation to my functions, to look at the question of the impact of moneylenders on the people who are affected by them.  I am asking them to carry out some research in that area.  When that has been completed we will see what can be done.  The <Col N="2572" /> Deputy will be aware that the question is one for the Minister for justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  I must point out that I tabled that amendment as a means of having this urgent problem discussed in the House. I have been endeavouring to raise the matter on the Adjournment for several weeks without success.  Moneylending affects almost exclusively the worse off people in our society who are forced to seek loans on which they must pay huge interest rates.  Many of those people are afraid to disclose the extent of those loans to their husbands or anybody else.  They do not want people to know that they are involved with moneylenders.  Many people have been threatened by moneylenders that if they disclose the name they will not get any further loans.</P>
      <P>I have come across cases where the position was so bad that community welfare officers took the initiative and approached the moneylenders&mdash;I commend them for that initiative&mdash;and asked them to ease off and cut the interest in half.  Those officers undertook to pay the outstanding amount and, in most cases, reached an agreement with the moneylenders.  The person involved was expected to pay back that reduced amount to the community welfare officer. However, when the community welfare officers sought sanction for that from the Department it was refused on the basis that such an arrangement was not covered by law.  I am not advocating that as a general panacea but it is an acceptable fire brigade action to help people who are in desperate need, people who are drowning under the weight of worry about money borrowed from moneylenders at huge interest rates.  In some cases the annualised interest rate is 50 per cent and more.  I am grateful to the Minister.  I would be grateful also if he would consider doing something with the community welfare service to see if they could help out to relieve this awful problem which is at its most acute at Christmas time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the section in <Col N="2573" /> general, Deputy De Rossa asked how the powers would be affected under it.  In effect, the section is extending to this area, provisions that are already there in relation to employers generally.  These provisions would entitle the inspectors to enter premises at reasonable times to see the records or whatever.  They do not apply in the area of sub-contractors and in relation to the self-employed.  There is nothing draconian about them.  Again it is a loophole we propose to fill in through the section.</P>
      <P>Under the existing provisions in section 143A (7) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 as amended by the Social Welfare Acts, 1985 and 1986, social welfare inspectors are empowered for unemployment assistance purposes to enter premises where there are kept records relating to persons, including self-employed people who are or have been employed, or were engaged in occupations and to make such investigations and inquiries as provided for in legislation. Section 7 of the Bill extends the powers of the social welfare inspectors for unemployment benefit purposes to enter premises where self-employed persons are or were engaged in their occupations. This brings the provisions for unemployment benefit into line with those for unemployment assistance. Unemployment assistance already has that power extended to cover those areas, but not unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing provisions refer only to premises where records relating to persons in insurable employment are kept.  In recent years, there has been a significant move towards contracting out work which up to now was performed by employees. This section is designed to help counter abuses such as employees being represented as subcontractors so as to avoid payment of social insurance contributions and concurrent working and signing by subcontractors.  A similar amendment was introduced in the case of employment assistance by way of the 1986 Social Welfare Bill.  The purpose of the section <Col N="2574" /> is just to extend the powers to the inspectors in relation particularly to the area of subcontractors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As is probably clear, I have no wish to prevent the enactment of this section or the closing of a loophole in this matter.  The section states: &ldquo;... and any premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any documents relating to employed persons or self-employed persons are kept.&rdquo;  Is that a straight lift from previous legislation? Does it apply to other benefits already referred to by the Minister?  A self-employed person may take records home with him.  Does that apply to the home of that self-employed person?  If that is the case, in what way is that power exercised? We put an obligation on the Garda to get a search warrant if a garda wants to search someone's home and that is reasonable because more people than the employer would be living in the house. His wife, children and so forth would reside there.  I have no wish to enable a person who wants to prevent social welfare people examining records taking those records home and thereby preventing a social welfare officer from seeing them, but here a social welfare inspector would appear to have the right to walk into a home and search it.  That is not the kind of power we should be giving to social welfare inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in line with other provisions the Deputy asked about.  I accept that once you bring self-employed and subcontractors into it, their homes can become involved, but the part of the home concerned is normally designated as the office part, even for tax purposes. If you look at tax records, you will find that those parts of those homes are defined as parts for tax purposes because there are tax allowances for them, apart from anything else.  There might be a side office or whatever which is used in such cases.  I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  It would not be normal to enter homes in the normal sense, but <Col N="2575" /> once you get into the area of the self-employed, then quite often a part which from the outside one might regard as the home is classed as the office and is tax allowable as the office.  It might be an extension, a room, or whatever.  I presume it would be a normal procedure in any event to meet the person and examine the records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is very short. What the Minister is saying does not really allay my concern in this matter. Obviously where part of a home is designated as an office, I have no great problem, but if the social welfare officer wants to enter a normal home which is not designated as an office or in any obvious way involved with the business that is being investigated, how will that officer pursue that inquiry or search?  Will he or she need an order of the court to enter the home?  What powers will that inspector have when he enters the home to search or for questioning or whatever?  Perhaps it can be covered by regulations which the Minister may bring in.  Despite the fact that it already exists in law, the Minister said it is now being applied to an area it was not previously applied to, that of the self-employed.  It is a loophole. We are trying to close loopholes but at the same time we should be careful about infringing on people's privacy and civil rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be no great problem with this in practice.  The Deputy is becoming, not alarmed, but concerned unnecessarily.  Section 264 (6) and (7) of the 1981 Act is the reference to the authority which is used.  The inspector produces his or her authority showing that he or she has authority to come into the office if the office happens to be an office at home.  Otherwise under these provisions we are making the inspector can be asked to produce the authority at the registered office or place of business, whichever it is.  The main thing is that there must be some place where inspectors have to produce the authority.  The difficulty is that people keep going around in circles and the Deputy will <Col N="2576" /> appreciate that.  This will provide the necessary powers in relation to the self-employed and subcontractors.  It is just making all the arrangements comprehensive.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless, Deputy De Rossa made a point.  Should some consideration not be given to more protection, especially to a person's home? Would the Minister like to reflect on possible protection that might be built into the legislation, perhaps in the next Bill, to meet the point raised by Deputy De Rossa which I think reasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mitchell I had misgivings about this section but having looked at the relevant section in the Consolidation Act which sets out exactly what powers they have&mdash;to enter at all reasonable times but having to produce a certificate &mdash;I am happy with the section.  I know a number of self-employed people take their records home at night or over the weekend and it would be unreasonable to expect that they could be visited by social welfare inspectors and asked for those records at those times.  As I said, the section sets out exactly the powers of the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards inspectors observing the inviolability of the home, like Deputy de Rossa I agree with the principle and trust the inspectors would behave with restraint when moving into people's homes.  The Minister should watch very carefully to ensure that no abuses occur in that area.  I am a little dismayed about the possible effectiveness of the proposed substituted subsection. Section 264 (6) of the Consolidation Act of 1981 relates to the powers of inspectors and provides that no one shall be required under this section to answer any question or give any evidence tending to incriminate himself.  Section 264 (4) provides that any employed <Col N="2577" /> person shall furnish to an inspector all records, books, etc. as the inspector may reasonably require.</P>
      <P>What happens if the records are inaccurate or constitute evidence which might tend to incriminate the holders of those books and records?  This might be too simplistic, but nevertheless the point should be made.  Could it be a defence that anyone who had kept books inaccurately or fraudulently had not allowed the inspector in because of fear of incrimination?  Surely that would leave them open to more serious charges at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Courts being courts and lawyers being lawyers, these technical defences very often allow people, at the last minute, to get off summonses before the courts or to delay people being brought before the justice of the courts, and almost to scandalise the law.  When considering the working of this amendment, I ask the Minister to consider the effect of section 6 in relation to an ingenious and fraudulent holder of records, and to work out the relationship of subsection (6) which it is proposed will substitute section 114 (6) and section 264 (6) of the Consolidation Act, 1981.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 8 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 provides for an increase in the number of paid contributions required for extended duration of disability benefit, that is, beyond 12 months.  The increase is from 208 contribution weeks, four years, to 260 contributions, five years.  It is, in fact, a more realistic contribution requirement for entitlement to a benefit which can last for over 40 years.  This proposal was included in the 1987 budget proposals of the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first contribution condition for receipt of disability benefit is that a person must have 39 contributions paid since entry into insurance.  The second contribution condition requires a claimant to have at least 39 weeks of contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Both of these contribution requirements were increased from 26 to 39 under section 8 (1) of the Social Welfare Act, 1987, with effect from 6 April 1987.  Under existing legislation 208 paid contributions are required for extended duration disability benefit which entitles a claimant to the benefit for as long as he remains incapable of work and under 66 years. This requirement was increased from 156 to 208 paid contributions from 6 April <Col N="2579" /> 1987 and is now being increased further to 260 paid contributions with effect from 4 January 1988.</P>
    <P>The general principle in the section is that the change in the contribution conditions should apply to new cases. Section 8 (2) provides, therefore, that anybody who on 4 January 1988 is already on extended duration disability benefit will not be affected by the change.  Otherwise you might have the situation where people on extended disability benefit at present but who have less than 260 contributions paid would lose their entitlements.</P>
    <P>This is an important saver clause. However, it is intended for people who are on extended disability benefit already and who remain on benefit.  Where people go off benefit and come back again the revised contribution conditions should apply.  Subsection (2) provides that existing recipients are protected. Under that subsection even if such a person goes off disability benefit after 4 January 1988 and comes back again within 13 weeks he would still be in the same period of entitlement and would still be able to qualify on the basis of the 208 contributions.  For practical purposes, however, it is necessary to put some limit on the degree to which people could be going off and coming back on and still qualifying on the basis of the 208 contributions.  Subsection (3), therefore, provides that anyone who commences a fresh period of entitlement to disability benefit after 4 July 1988, even if they were on disability benefit within the previous 13 weeks, will have to satisfy the new contribution conditions.  This is a reasonable provision.  We have ensured that the people who need to be protected by the saver clause, i.e., those who are on long-term disability benefit already and will remain so, are being protected.</P>
    <P>The number of persons on extended duration disability benefit at 31 December, 1986 and who will, therefore, be continuing totals 21,450 males and 23,390 females, a total of 44,840.  Of those, 15,000 have been on benefit for five years or more, 5,690 are males and 9,480 are <Col N="2580" /> females.  It is not usual to pay disability benefit for the length of time that we pay it, our scheme goes on for a very long time and, consequently, there should be a reasonable contribution requirement for that benefit.  It applies only to extended disability benefit beyond the period of 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not tackling the basic problem.  His reference to the length of payment of disability benefit is correct.  For instance, in the UK disability benefit lasts for 28 weeks but the difference is that people can then apply for invalidity benefit as it is called there.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the minimum contribution record will be required but if someone is genuinely disabled there is a very strong case for ensuring that they should have some access to social welfare payments or the equivalent to the United Kingdom's invalidity benefit.  It is absurd that people with less than a few years contributions can &mdash; and do &mdash; claim disability benefit for many years which gives rise to anomalies and abuses.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not cite statistics in relation to the extent of disability claims here compared to other countries and he did not give relative figures for men and women, single persons and married persons. The claim rate among married women is six times or thereabouts what it is among single women and men so there is evident abuse of disability benefit. However, many of those people are not fit for work and have been genuinely ill for a long time.  They should not be totally excluded from an invalidity-sickness type payment.  In that context and looking ahead to the provisions for next year, the Minister should consider further reform in the disability-invalidity area because people will still be able to claim for ten, 20, 30 and 40 years in respect of disability benefit whereas in other countries the period is six months or perhaps one year.  Thereafter, a long-term payment becomes available, such as the invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody should <Col N="2581" /> claim disability benefit for much more than one year because if they are sick that long they should be thinking in terms of the invalidity pension.  I know that at present a person who is on disability benefit for one year may apply for an invalidity pension but, of course, they may not get it.  This is an area which deserves more reform than that proposed here today.  It will remove some anomalies but it will also create unfairness towards the genuinely long-term sick who are not able to work.  Will the Minister give a commitment that in looking ahead to next year's social welfare legislation he will consider the point I made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a few brief points as other Members wish to contribute.  I strongly protest at the length of time made available to discuss this very important Bill and the manner in which the whole debate has taken place.  It is very clear from the Minister's figures that the Bill is about reducing the numbers on social welfare benefits.  This will have a very severe effect on invalidity and disability benefits and in many cases it will affect young people who will find it more difficult to qualify to benefit.  It is obvious that the figure of 9,000 women on disability benefit out of a total of 15,000 over five years is an attempt to get at women.  This applies to other sections in the Bill, particularly sections 9, 11 and 16, which we have not had time to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many people will suffer as a result of this, one must take into consideration that people do exist on long-term disability benefit and have never been transferred to invalidity benefit.  In some cases, this has gone on for as long as 20 years and many Deputies come across cases like this quite regularly simply because these people are not advised of their entitlements.  Instead of putting this draconian measure into the Bill, there should be a section which makes it easier for people to automatically transfer from disability benefit to invalidity pension when they have been claiming for five years.  The minimum qualification period is 12 months but effectively from January there will be two <Col N="2582" /> different periods for qualification and two different sets of rules governing the same benefit.  This will create bigger problems than it will solve.  The main objective of this sections is to simply cut back further under this heading.  I want to again place on the record that this is not the first cutback under this heading; it is the second in one year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to voice my objection to this section.  The Minister has told us that this Bill has two main purposes.  The first purpose, which we debated up to section 8, deals mainly with the strengthening of provisions to prevent fraud and to prevent the people who are not entitled to benefit from getting benefit. Under this section the Minister wants to take unto himself powers to prevent people who are entitled to benefit from getting that benefit.  He wants to prevent people who fulfill all the medical and health conditions from getting benefit. He cannot deprive them of benefit other than by changing the law and making it impossible for them to get benefit, irrespective of their state of invalidity or health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fraud of the State in taking benefits from people who are entitled to them is a greater fraud then the fraud that has been discussed in the social welfare context on this Bill.  It brings the social welfare code into disrepute when the State can take powers by changing the rules. The Minister admits that people can be on benefit for up to 40 years.  These are people who are unable to work and who have been adjudicated to be incapable of working by possibly up to 100 medical referees' examinations; because the Minister thinks this is wrong, not alone has he taken away their medical cards, free medicine and hospital beds but he is now going to take their benefit.  This section should be totally opposed because it makes a joke of the insurance welfare system.  Thousands of workers have been paying into the insurance fund for 40 years and have never drawn a penny out of it.  Yet this section seeks to be designed to take benefit from the people who are condemned to a life of misery and bad <Col N="2583" /> health.  This section is an attack on those people.  It is the biggest social welfare fraud of the lot for the Minister, by way of legalised fraud, as it were, to take benefit from people who are entitled to it as the law stands.</P>
    <P>Young people cannot get the required level of contribution because there is so much unemployment it will be more difficult for people to accumulate five years' contributions.  They may well be 30 or 40 years of age before they have five years contributions.  The Minister should think again about this.  I do not condone the kind of fraud that has come to light but the fraud that is contained in this section and the following section which prevents people from getting an invalidity pension, irrespective of their state of health, is a further attack on that section of the community.  We are talking about people who are very sick and who will be permanently sick.  We are not talking about people who will be better this year or the year after but people who, the Minister said, will be sick for the next 40 years. They are the ones who are targeted in this section from getting their entitlements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Pattison referred to this section as a fraud on the Minister's part.  I hope the Deputy is not equating that alleged fraud with the fraud in relation to the sanctions against employers we were discussing before he came into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take up a point that was made by Deputy Mitchell in relation to the area between disability benefit and invalidity benefit.  I am aware of a number of cases where relatively young people have applied for invalidity benefit.  They had genuine reasons for applying for it, having been on disability benefit for over 12 months.  Even though there may be reasonable grounds for giving them an invalidity pension for the rest of their lives, because they are under 50, the Department officials seem to be reluctant to give invalidity benefit to them on the basis that they are young and may appear healthy and strong.  People over 60 years <Col N="2584" /> of age are frequently granted invalidity benefit but there is a reluctance to give such benefit to people under, say, 55 years.  I agreed with Deputy Mitchell and other speakers when they said that people can remain on disability benefit for extensive periods.  Obviously that is not what disability benefit was first intended for; it was intended as a short term benefit for people who are genuinely sick.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unreasonable to expect that people who apply for disability benefit have a reasonable history of contributions during the previous period.  Obviously, to get disability benefit people have to have a strong attachment to the workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now almost spilling over into the matters raised in section 9.  One cannot dispose of the objections that have been made already by Deputies Bell and Pattison against section 8 by shifting the concentration from disability benefit to invalidity benefit. The plain fact of the matter is that there will be a longer period for qualification, that people will be required to have five years' continuous work at a time when five years' continuous work is disappearing as a reality.  This will affect younger workers more than most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another underlying trend which I find particularly objectionable.  It relates to the notion that workers would have to demonstrate a period of time in the workforce before their disability benefit would take effect.  I have not seen any legislation coming before this House which would shift employers liability, for example, which would make an employer liable, if the State is not liable, in the early stages of disability.  That would be very interesting.  This is not contained in the Bill.  There is another side to this. If there is, as I detected, an underlying suggestion that some people are qualifying for disability who are not really disabled why is the concentrated attention not addressed to the medical profession? Why should it be addressed to the workers?  Why does the Minister's Department not turn to the medical profession if he feels that the figures are <Col N="2585" /> inflated?  It is there that the attention should be directed.  If the Minister looks at the statistics produced by his own Department &mdash; for example, table 51 which shows the different categories in which people are drawing disability benefit &mdash; he will see some frightening figures. In relation to women, for example, 19.92 per cent qualified for this benefit under nervous disorders, 5.34 per cent under heart conditions and so on.  Are these figures real or not?  Is there not an obligation to turn to the medical profession and ask them do they stand by their diagnoses and their recommendations? Instead we are witnessing a rather cheap administrative ploy by the Government in thinking that they can expand the conditions for qualification and in that way save money irrespective of the health of the workers involved.  I strongly support what Deputy Bell and Deputy Pattison have been saying.  The Government's approach is particularly damaging to young workers who have declining prospects of getting the continuous employment that is required to qualify for those benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my views on this matter on the record last night during Second Stage debate but I wish to make one or two points which may have a bearing on this discussion.  Reference has been made to the fact that people remain on disability benefit for long periods of time and that is true.  Quite a number of people whom I have come across have done so even though they could have transferred to invalidity pension.  I understand if they were to go on to invalidity benefit their income could fall because of other income coming into the house and it would be taken into account for tax purposes and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a more significant point in relation to disability benefit which may diffuse the notion that there are thousands of people claiming disability who should not be doing so.  In the statistical information on social welfare services for 1986, table 50 very clearly shows that of the 212,000 claims which were terminated <Col N="2586" /> during 1986 only 8 per cent, or about 16,000 were for more than a year.  Clearly there has not been a massive abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 and other amendments in relation to maternity benefit and so on are introduced as a sneaky clawback of benefits which people have built up over the years, at a time when perhaps the trade union movement was a little stronger than it is now and when we were able to fight a little better for our rights and for our share of the resources from the State.  It is unfortunate that the Minister, who had a reasonably good record in the Department of Social Welfare in previous times, should be engaged in this kind of exercise.  It is on that basis that I oppose the section and will be opposing the Bill when it goes to a vote today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's reply last night he said that approximately 2,000 people out of a total of 220,000 would be affected by the provision of this section. Can the Minister say how this figure is arrived at?  Were all the records examined? For example, do the Department know how many people have more than 260 contributions or how many have less than 260 contributions?  I would like to have this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is done by sampling and it is a very accurate system.  We talked about the need for chartered accountants and I accept what Deputy Mitchell has said about that matter.  We should recognise that the Department of Social Welfare are particularly accurate in their estimations and I think people on both sides of the House will accept that from their experience.  While we talk about the number of people affected in the year as being in the order of 2,000, we must remember that is out of a total number of 1.2 million contributors.  The number the Deputy referred to is the number of claimants for disability benefit on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer very briefly to a number of points that have been made.  Deputy De Rossa raised a question similar to that raised by Deputy Mitchell and I will refer <Col N="2587" /> to it later.  Deputy Higgins raised the question of the 19.92 per cent of women who are out of work because of nervous disorders.  The medical profession decide when people should stay away from work.  I recognise that this matter is out of our hands but people have different attitudes towards it.  It might be better for some people to go to work and they might get over their nervous problem but that is a medical decision.  We will certainly be asking questions of the medical personnel, of the doctors involved in the Arigna area where a number of people have been out of work for quite some time.  We intend to examine the certificates that were given to those people and the basis on which they were given to establish what precautions were taken and what the medical understanding was at the time.  The broader case the Deputy speaks about is in the hands of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised a very relevant and interesting point.  Deputy Pattison&mdash; whether he picked up the wrong end of the stick I do not know&mdash;was presenting the wrong end of the stick because basically the benefits remain, but the qualifying conditions to get those benefits are greater.  Deputy Mitchell has raised a more fundamental point in relation to the situation generally, that in other countries people do not receive disability benefit after 12 months.  That is a quite common practice and we have to be realistic about this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>A person has the right to get sick for a week, a month, six months or whatever and if he has the established contribution conditions he has a right to claim benefit for a long period thereafter. Deputy Mitchell's point is a very relevant one.  We need to reconsider the whole arrangement of disability and invalidity benefits and how they are operated.  It is probably true to say that it is somewhat more difficult to transfer to invalidity benefit here than it is in other countries and that is something we might consider. There could also be a gap between the two benefits.  Perhaps there is a need for disability assistance which applies in other countries where people who have not reached the contribution conditions come within the full benefit which continues thereafter irrespective of income. That is a matter to which I will give consideration.  It highlights the fact that we need to look at our systems generally, to review them and to ensure that we can maintain their operation.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputies that the fund we are talking about this year is £401 million short, even taking account of the moneys that we are saving on fraud in the current year.  We have to be realistic about what we can do with the money from that fund.  Because we are short of money we are not able to do some of the things suggested by Deputy Mitchell.  The most poverty-stricken categories need to be supported and I will certainly do what I can in that regard.  We are short £401 million and that means going back to the taxpayers and looking for another £401 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reality.  We have to be realistic.  If a marginal change for approximately 2,000 people will help us to maintain the benefits we have, then it is a relatively small sacrifice to make to maintain those benefits.  I will certainly look very closely at the questions raised by Deputy Mitchell because we will have to address ourselves to that area, but I find myself as Minister faced with a panoply of systems which have developed over the years and which are <Col N="2589" /> now in difficulties because we cannot continue to maintain them in the same way and some of the people who need them most are not getting the benefit.  This is something to which we can all turn our minds in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have decided that trout and coarse fish anglers who benefit from substantial State expenditure on the development and protection of our trout and coarse fish fisheries should contribute towards the cost of such development and protection. However, I wish to add by way of reassurance for those anglers and the general public at large, that substantial State expenditure on developing and protecting our inland fisheries will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the only form of angling requiring a licence is salmon angling.  The licensing of trout and coarse fish angling was proposed by the Inland Fisheries <Col N="2592" /> Commission in the mid-seventies.  As some Deputies will no doubt recall, the provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1980, are based on the commission's report.</P>
    <P>Prior to the enactment of the 1980 Fisheries Act the Government of the day decided not to implement the trout and coarse fish licensing recommendation but to introduce instead a voluntary system of registration for trout, coarse fish and sea anglers in order to raise revenue for the development and protection of the fisheries.  The fee for such registration was set at £5 per annum up to 1985 and at £9.50 since then.  It entitles them to fish for trout and coarse fish in any waters owned or occupied by the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries board with which an angler is registered.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that there are 100,000 trout anglers and 10,000 coarse fish anglers in Ireland as well as an additional 10,000 and 33,000 tourists anglers, respectively, for each category.  If this is so, then the numbers registering in the trout and coarse fish categories of the Register of Trout, Coarse Fish and Sea Anglers have been very disappointing indeed as about 4,000 of them only have registered.</P>
    <P>On the introduction of the proposed licensing system for trout and coarse fish anglers, the present voluntary register of such anglers will no longer be necessary. I am, however, retaining the voluntary system of registration for sea anglers.  I have accordingly provided in the Bill to change the name of the register to the &ldquo;Register of Sea Anglers&rdquo;.  In this connection I want to address myself to sea anglers and to encourage them to continue to pay their voluntary contributions to the Register of Sea Anglers.</P>
    <P>Life members of the former Inland Fisheries Trust are entitled to fish for trout and coarse fish without payment of a permit fee in fisheries boards' waters. With the introduction of the proposed legislation these members will require a licence to fish for trout or coarse fish but will retain their right to fish without having to pay for a permit.  Of course those people who have reached their 66th birthday will not be required to hold a <Col N="2593" /> licence.  This is provided for in the Bill.  I am proposing to introduce separate licences for trout and coarse fish angling which can be used countrywide.  Licences will be available for a period of 21 days or for a full season.  The fee will be £10 for the trout licence, £5 for the coarse fish licence for 21 days.  The licence fee for trout angling for a full season nationwide will be £15 and for coarse fish angling for a full season nationwide £10.</P>
    <P>I also propose to rationalise the licensing system for salmon angling.  This will be achieved by a reduction in the number of classes of salmon angling licences.  I propose that, in lieu of the existing five classes of licences, there should be two, a 21-day salmon licence costing £21 and a full season licence for salmon fishing in all areas of the State for £25.  These will be nationwide licences covering holders in any region of the State.  I might add that this rationalisation has been long overdue, particularly bearing in mind the position that has obtained in which there was a multiplicity of licences for different areas and regions.  It will be possible now to obtain one licence nationwide for trout or salmon fishing, one for 21 days costing £21 and another covering every part of the State for a full season costing £25.</P>
    <P>In the case of anglers who engage in all types of rod fishing there is provision in the Bill for an annual composite licence costing £40 which will entitle the holder to fish for salmon, trout and coarse fish. What I am saying is that one can obtain a salmon licence only if one wishes to fish for salmon only, a trout licence alone if one wishes to fish for trout only or a coarse fish licence alone if one wishes to fish for coarse fish only.  If one wants a combination of the three, then one can obtain a composite licence covering the three species for £40.  I consider that to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill I have not overlooked the special needs of our young citizens or indeed of our senior citizens. Members will have observed that, under section 4 (2) persons under 18 and over 66 years of age are exempted from the obligation of having a licence when fishing <Col N="2594" /> for trout and coarse fish.  At present salmon anglers of all ages are required to hold a licence.  This stipulation has not been changed under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to require those people engaging in sea angling to hold a licence.  But I would encourage them to register with the new Register of Sea Anglers, making a contribution to the development of sea angling which has enormous potential, and which has been relatively under-exploited.  A small contribution would help us develop that further.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate how many trout and coarse fish angling licences will be sold in the first year following the introduction of the new licensing system. However, a figure of 50,000 licensed trout and coarse fish anglers would yield an annual income in the region of £500,000 in any one year.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputies who are concerned about this that the income derived from the sale of the new licences will be retained by the relevant fisheries boards or authorities for the protection, development and conservation of fisheries and for pollution control.  The fear was expressed by many people that the money would not be put back into the relevant regions.  I am giving the House a solemn assurance that this money will be collected locally and used locally for the protection, development and conservation of fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House has been requested by the Central Fisheries Board on which all the regional fisheries boards are represented.  It also has the support of the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland and the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland.  Naturally some organisations, groups or individuals will object, on principle, to the introduction of licences for trout and coarse fish angling. Others will complain that it may harm the tourist industry.  I do not accept that contention, particularly at a time when more revenue is needed for the development of these areas, where there is a huge volume of goodwill and support &mdash; provided it is clearly seen that this money <Col N="2595" /> is invested or spent on the development of the various fisheries involved.</P>
    <P>I accept that visiting coarse fish anglers outnumber native coarse fish anglers by approximately 33,000 to 10,000. However, native trout anglers far outnumber visiting trout anglers by approximately 100,000 to 10,000.  For that reason the bulk of the revenue to be collected from the licence fees will emanate from native anglers.  Furthermore, it is my belief that few visiting anglers will object to paying what amounts to a small contribution toward the conservation and development of these most important fisheries.  It is my belief that the fees from coarse fish and trout angling licences represent a very small amount of the overall cost of holidays.  It is my further belief that tourists who pay substantial sums to come here on fishing holidays are most unlikely to change their plans because they are required to pay such a small or nominal fee.  It has been my personal experience in fisheries over many years that visiting coarse fish and trout anglers are always interested in further development of such fisheries and, in some cases, in their conservation.  I have found them more than willing to make a contribution. Indeed I have found them to be amazed that we have not been imposing fees or charges for engagement in such activity. It has been my experience &mdash; having spoken to many visiting coarse fish anglers who have come to my county &mdash; that they are more than willing to pay a contribution towards the overall development of this very important fisheries activity.</P>
    <P>Trout and coarse fish anglers, be they native or tourist, can no longer expect our taxpayers to continue to fund completely the development and protection of their angling waters.  What we are seeking here is a small contribution by the people who will substantially benefit, who will enjoy these recreational amenities we provide, thereby easing the overall burden on our taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that licensing constitutes the minimum amount of inconvenience to our own, or visiting <Col N="2596" /> anglers.  While the arrangements for the distribution and sale of licences will be primarily a matter for the fisheries boards, it will be organised in the simplest possible manner.  Licences, as at present, will be sold by the fisheries boards through their own offices and some field staff and through outlets countrywide &mdash; shops, hotels and offices of regional tourism organisations and other outlets.  The feasibility of extending on-the-spot sales of licences by fisheries field staff is being examined.  If we could organise an effective system here we would be far more successful in collecting contributions from anglers.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will be aware that a restructuring of the fisheries boards is currently being considered.  No firm decisions have yet been made, however, as to what the future structure will be. There are many references to the fisheries board in the text of the Bill.  This is necessary in view of the fact that responsibility for inland fisheries currently lies with the fisheries boards.  I have had discussions with the central fishing authorities, the regional fisheries boards, the anglers' associations and many others, and at this time I am preparing final proposals to restructure the whole administration of our inland fisheries which is long overdue.  I will be proceeding with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish again to state that the objective of this Bill is to provide a more equitable way by which funds for the future development and protection of our inland fisheries will be available.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before us this evening is to introduce a licensing system for trout and coarse fish angling.  Behind that simple sentence which perhaps is a reasonable enough objective on the face of it &mdash; I will go deeper into that later on &mdash; lies a way of life for thousands of people, young and old.  Free fishing has been part of our culture for generations.  Our free fishing here has been a major sales pitch and <Col N="2597" /> tourist attraction both at home and abroad for years.</P>
      <P>It is such no longer.  Salmon anglers have been paying a licence which is now to be increased at a time when the salmon numbers are declining due to overfishing at sea and pollution in our rivers.  We have 153,000 trout and coarse fish anglers, 100,000 being trout anglers and 10,000 coarse fish anglers.  There are 10,000 tourist anglers for trout fishing visiting our shores per annum and 33,000 coarse fishermen from overseas, a total of 43,000 overseas visitors.  When we consider that the total number of fresh water anglers in the world is estimated at 43 million and that we attract 43,000 to this country, which is perhaps the best inland fishing area left in western Europe or even in the world, we certainly are not getting our share of what is out there.</P>
      <P>I understand that the licences are intended to raise £500,000 per annum. There are many unanswered questions in the Bill.  How does the Minister intend to enforce this legislation?  I am conscious of the fact that the Minister has just returned home from a futile and perhaps rather fruitless overnight session in Brussels in relation to our quotas, so we will be reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been badly advised about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are serious issues that we have to get to grips with in relation to this Bill before any decisions in relation to how I or my party will be able to support it can be reached.  How will the Minister enforce this legislation? We need a thorough explanation of this to the House, as any more legislation without enforcement will bring the system into further disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will assure us that the fisheries boards will issue the licences and enforce the legislation. Ignoring for the moment the fact that the Minister is about to announce the abolition of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards and their replacement with Bord Iascaigh Intíre or Bord Intíre Iascaigh, whatever name the Minister <Col N="2598" /> finally comes up with, the 1988 Estimate provisions for the boards as we now know them for non-paid provisions will be reduced from between 25 and 35 per cent depending on the different regions of the already much depleted 1987 levels. With a tragic summer of one fish kill after another just behind us, the fisheries officers have no money for diesel for their mobile patrols or for petrol for their cars.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously asking us to believe that with less money in 1988 there will be increased enforcement of the law in this new Bill when it is enacted?  There is, at the very least, an economy of truth in the picture that has been painted, and if the Government are serious about one of our most important natural resources, our inland waters, we must in this House be absolutely frank and upfront with one another, which I fear we are not being. Will it be left to the voluntary bodies, the angling clubs, the tourist organisations and the like yet again in 1988 to keep our fishery protection officers mobile, or is it the Government's intention to pay them to sit in their offices unable to perform the duties they are only too willing and able to do?</P>
    <P>The farce of 1987 has cost our country and our tourist image dearly.  Is the Minister going to control what is going on? Will the Minister and his Government sit idly by as our wild salmon stocks are plundered at sea and not allowed up our rivers to spawn?  Will the Minister and the Government continue to sit idly by and allow poaching, pollution and neglect of our rivers and lakes, ignoring the enormous potential for our gross national product from the proper development of angling as a special interest holiday or sport for our own people and for visitors?</P>
    <P>There is something disquieting in discussing a Bill here this evening knowing that an announcement in a matter of weeks from the very Minister who has just addressed us on this Bill will make 15 of the 21 sections in the Bill irrelevant, or at best in need of further amendment. Any reference to the principal Act as amended by the Act of 1980 will have to be amended when the legislation to abolish the central and regional boards is <Col N="2599" /> before the House.  I do not have to tell the Minister that apart from the acute lack of current finances being suffered by the boards, the officers themselves are totally demoralised by the Minister's frequent references to his intended reconstruction with, as yet, no clear indication as to the Minister's intentions.  The prevarication will have to stop.  The Minister must, this evening, declare his intentions in relation to the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards as it is an essential part of the Bill and the enforcement in putting into law of the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to draw on the much used Russian analogy of the present time and to say that in relation to the development of inland fisheries and to the Minister's hinted at and leaked, if that is a fair word &mdash; he has mentioned it openly on several occasions on visits around the country &mdash; reconstruction of the fisheries board and the fisheries protection system generally, we have plenty of <i>perestroika</i> without any of the <i>glasnost</i>.  We do not really know what the Minister wants to do except that it will be reconstruction of some sort.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister put his cards on the table this evening and tell us what he is doing with the central and regional fisheries boards and let the prevarication stop once and for all.  We need to know what is on the Minister's mind, what are the Government's intentions, and we need to know fully, frankly and fast. Before I can indicate my conditional support for this Bill I must have an unequivocal commitment from the Minister that whatever moneys are raised by way of the new licensing provisions will be invested in the inland fisheries for development, conservation and the pollution control.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's speech where, in three lines, he alludes to his views in this area.  The Minister said he would like to stress that all the income derived from the sale of the new licences will be retained by the fisheries boards for protection, development and conservation of fisheries and pollution control.  What fisheries <Col N="2600" /> boards are we talking about?  We all know, except the Minister has not said it officially, that there will not be fisheries boards, that the Minister's intention is to have one fisheries board.  Does the Minister mean by that statement that he intends to leave the regional managers <i>in situ,</i> to strip away the management boards and administration they now have around them?  Does he mean he will allow any moneys derived from these licences to be left with the regional managers or whatever advisory group he will build around them, for investment in the local inland fisheries in the particular area concerned? Can he assure us that whatever money is raised in each of the different regions will be left as an own resource to that region and will not be taken into account when each year's Estimates are being scrutinised?</P>
    <P>I fear that the temptation, in the difficult budgetary times in which we live, will be to deduct from what otherwise might have been the Exchequer contribution to the different regions or boards the amount in Appropriations-inAid from the own resource of their licence money.  This money coming from the sector itself as a tax on the sport can only be justified if it is invested over and above the normal Exchequer funding for the future development of pollution control and conservation of our inland waters generally.  Without any equivocation or prevarication the Minister must make a clear statement of his intent that that will be so, that this licence money will be over and above the normal Exchequer funding that can reasonably be expected to be given to the different areas or regions. Certainly, there will be a manager of some sort <i>in situ</i> and he will have an area under him.</P>
    <P>Over the past few days there have been many meetings of fisheries boards and reports coming through to me indicate that while there is disquiet and concern about abandoning our traditional rights to free fishing most anglers accept the principle of a licence provided that all the money will be reinvested in the industry. The North-Western Regional Fisheries Board take this view, as do the western <Col N="2601" /> region.  In Munster opinion is very divided, but the majority opinion supports it.  There is a very vocal minority down there who are none too pleased.  In Leinster there is a generally supportive view of this provision, provided it means extra investment in the industry and not just extra money in the coffers of the Exchequer with futher neglect of the industry.</P>
    <P>The angling clubs and federations in each board area may have their own views and even differing views from their respective boards, but all recognise the need for investment in and protection of a much valued industry.  In the absence of Government investment this proposal before us tonight represents perhaps the only realistic option being offered.  There will have to be a hard sell of the provisions of the Bill.  The concept of free fishing has sold coarse fishing in Cavan, far and wide.  It has also been an important factor with the wild brown trout of Loughs Corrib, Mask and Conn.  We can all add our list, depending on what part of the country we come from.  Many trout anglers feel betrayed that they were not consulted through their national federation and allowed an input into the decisions, especially as to how the money will be spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That would take about 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishing generally has been very bad this year and the clubs are understandably angry about the timing of this legislation.  An essential ingredient for success will be local co-operation and this can and will only be achieved on the basis of licensing having a positive benefit for the sport itself and, as I have reiterated and will continue to reiterate, a guarantee that the moneys from the licences, as at present with salmon fishing licences, will become an own resource of the boards or whatever will supersede the boards in the proposed reconstruction. In other words, in case I have not made myself abundantly clear, my bottom line and that of the Fine Gael Party is that there should be a net increase in funding <Col N="2602" /> of inland fisheries by the amount accrued from the licences.  I shall not and cannot, for the sake of this vital industry, compromise on that point.</P>
      <P>I turn briefly to the different sections of the Bill.  We note the redefinition of coarse fishing to exclude rainbow trout and char.  This follows logically from the different type of licences we are bringing in and I have no difficulties at all with that, also the reduction in the number and types of the five classes of salmon licences to two licences, one costing £21 for 21 days or an annual licence for £25. Twenty five pounds for a salmon licence represents over a 300 per cent increase in some cases where the present licence is only £8.  Is this acceptable or even reasonable, despite the hunger for money?  Will the Minister also explain why there is so little in price between the two salmon licences, one for three weeks and the other for 52 weeks?  Is such a small difference worth having two tiers, administratively? I suggest with respect that it is not.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider accepting one salmon licence costing £21 for any period in the year.  If there were a real difference in the price of the two licences it might be worth the administrative difficulty of bringing in a two-tier salmon licensing system.  Given that there is over a 300 per cent increase in some licences, perhaps he would reduce the amount from £25 to £21, with one licence?  It would please all sectors, the administrators and those looking for the licences.  I hope to put down an amendment on Committee Stage along these lines and perhaps the Minister would bear this in mind as his acceptance of it would indicate that we could perhaps agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall also be proposing that the composite licence which is now £40 should be reduced to £30 in the interest of equity. This is the licence generally needed for rod angling for coarse fishing, trout or salmon.  The one licence gives blanket cover for any type of angling.  It is the type of licence needed by people who traditionally fish with a rod for no expenditure. To introduce it at £40 bringing in coarse fish and trout for the first time is <Col N="2603" /> very steep for the ordinary worker on the factory floor, the unemployed and the average family man who has other pressures on his disposable income but has a great love of the environment and fishing and wants to bring up his children in that tradition.</P>
    <P>The three trout licences are pitched at perhaps a reasonable enough level, although some people have already expressed the view that £15 for the annual trout licence is too high.  Perhaps the Minister might explain what the position will be if a trout angler, who has his annual trout licence, fishing on Lough Corrib catches a pike.  Will the trout licence cover coarse fishing in these circumstances as the coarse fishing licence is cheaper?  We need an element of commonsense here.  The Minister will tell me that the composite licence is what the fisherman should have gone after in the beginning, but he is by nature a trout angler and belongs to the local trout angling club.  He is not actually after coarse fish but is as likely to catch coarse fish as trout.  Fears have been expressed as to how that situation will be handled.</P>
    <P>On page 8 of the Bill the particular position of the Foyle area is dealt with. The Foyle Fisheries Commission are the joint North-South body for the Foyle catchment area, covering parts of Donegal, Tyrone and Derry.  The people there already have a game licence for trout and salmon and the Minister is proposing to allow them a reduced rate for the trout and salmon licence proposed to be introduced but not for the coarse fishing.  I am not quite sure what the thinking behind all this is and whether it is in the total spirit of the North-South operation existing there at present.  I would be pleased to hear the Minister's views and the thinking behind the Department's or the parliamentary draftsman's inclusion of this section.  If there must be a licence to bring these people into order with what may in time be legislation to be allowed a reduced rate sounds reasonable enough as they already have a game licence from the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>What is the position in the areas that <Col N="2604" /> already need permits for certain public and private fisheries?  As I interpret it, the people involved will also need licences for different types of angling, as will the members of the former inland fisheries clubs who have had free fishing on central and regional board waters for some time now.  Perhaps we could also have the Minister's views on the rights of the former members of the Inland Fisheries Trust when the Minister abolishes the central and regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill exempting those under 18 and those over 66 years of age from licensing requirements. I agree that it is essential that angling as a sport and recreation should be freely available to our young and elderly and to those who generally have more leisure time, be it enforced or by choice.  I ask the Minister to consider an amendment to this section to the effect that in regard to exempting those under 18 he will also exempt all bona fide student cardholders.  This is an area that would be easy to control.  Many of our students are over 18 years of age and the student card system allows them to be identified.  When I was a student a student card always contained a photograph of the holder and therefore did not lend itself to too much trickery or roguery.  I presume that is still the case.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the confusion and difficulty which has arisen in regard to the pollution committee which was recently set up.  This committee includes the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for the Marine and they apparently decided that all farms be surveyed as possible sources of pollution and that a task force be set up in each county under the county engineer. Initial reports are to be submitted to the Department of the Environment before 20 December.  It was decided that ACOT and AFT were to locate and report on potential sources of pollution to our inland waters.  A questionnaire containing between 40 and 50 questions was circulated but it was quickly revised due to the unacceptable nature of many of the questions.  The current position is <Col N="2605" /> that ACOT and AFT will have nothing to do with it as they do not see it as their particular role to be policing authorities.  Perhaps, the Minister could enlighten us as to where the task force is now going and what results he expects from them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, An Bord Iascaigh Intíre should be announced before this Bill is enacted.  The Minister's timing, if I may say so, is appalling.  This is essential if, as the Minister has indicated, he has decided to abolish the present boards.  I mentioned morale among our fisheries protection officers with the threat hanging over their heads of the abolition of the management boards to which they are answerable.  We do not have to remind ourselves of what the role of the fisheries boards is and why they were put <i>in situ</i> in 1980.  Their statutory function was one of management, conservation, protection, development and promotion of our inland and sea angling resources as far as a 12 mile limit.  The fact that our fisheries protection officers have not been in a position to carry out their statutory function is in no way any fault of theirs.</P>
    <P>We cannot leave hanging around any longer the uncertainty in relation to the Minister's intentions, his proposed changes and the reasons he feels change will improve the situation.  Change without further investment from the Exchequer will do nothing but cause further demoralisation in this most vital area.  I do not agree that the Minister is proceeding correctly but at the very least we should be told the full story.  He owes it to this House to be frank with us in relation to his intentions in regard to his proposed plans.</P>
    <P>Our inland surface water of 350,000 acres of lakes and 8,600 miles of main channel rivers comprises a far greater percentage of our total area than, for example, is the case in England or any of the continental countries.  Our inland fisheries are an extremely valuable self renewing resource when exploited rationally and sensitively.  This industry does not depend on imported raw material. Most anglers at the end of the day will be prepared to pay a reasonable sum for the <Col N="2606" /> sport as they, above all, realise that the protection of our natural environment does in fact pay.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the Minister's response to the different points that have been made and I hope he understands that until he spells out without equivocation what will happen the money which will be raised by way of licence fees we will have to hold our position as to whether we can support this Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response and to the contributions of other Members on this most vital part of our environment.  Any investment in inland fisheries is an investment in the environment. It is an investment in our heritage and it is a further step down the road of civilising us as a nation.  We receive our environment in trust from the previous generation.  We are only custodians and we have to pass it on to the next generation in as good, if not a better condition, than we received it.  That is what this Bill is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about this Bill.  The principle of licensing is not necessarily a bad or a wrong one but, quite frankly, I wonder about the timing of this Bill from several points of view.  If we look at it from the point of view of the average angler he may well say that the Bill could not have been introduced at a worse time.  Some anglers will use the emotional argument that the waters of Ireland belong to the people of Ireland and that therefore they will not pay any licence fee but most anglers are willing to pay such a fee on the strict understanding that the money will be put directly back into the protection and development of our waters.</P>

    <P>In this connection, I have looked at the Estimates for 1988 where there is no less than a 29 per cent reduction under one heading, a 15 per cent reduction under the main heading for inland fisheries and the wiping out of a third heading.  It seems that the proposals in this Bill are designed to make up the shortfall in expenditure and that, therefore, at very best, the overall expenditure will not be any more <Col N="2607" /> than it is this year.  Given the size of the reductions and the estimate of the likely revenue to be raised from this licence fee the Minister has given, it will not even make up the shortfall.  Therefore, from the anglers' point of view the situation is particularly unsatisfactory in that these fees are being introduced for the first time in so far as trout and coarse angling is concerned while the overall expenditure will be less than it was even in the current year.</P>
    <P>We are aware of how inadequate the expenditure was this year because of the inability of the staff of the fisheries boards to protect the various fisheries and waters.  It seems that it is a bit doubtful to be charging a fee as high as £40 for salmon and trout angling when the attitude of the authorities towards our inland salmon fisheries is very doubtful to say the least of it.  In this connection I will not give any descriptions of my own, or of any individual anglers, but I will quote briefly from the 1985 annual report of the Central Fisheries Board, the latest report available.  Part of the report deals with the Shannon region, an area not unknown to the Minister and myself, and although it relates to 1985 the position was not greatly different in 1986 and, perhaps, in 1987.  The report states:</P>
    <P>From 7 June a number of vessels, from other regions, were observed illegally fishing off the Clare coast and appeared to be catching salmon. Weather conditions then disimproved and very few boats were seen during the second week of June.  The board's 32' GRP protection vessell, <i>m.v. Thomond</i> put out to sea and encountered 11 large vessels fishing illegally south of Kilkee.</P>
    <P>Determined efforts were made to take their nets but <i>m. v. Thomond</i> was forced to withdraw due to attempted ramming by groups of vessels of 45' upwards in length.  Some of these attempted rammings were filmed by RTE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2608" /> On 18 June, when the <i>m. v. Thomond</i> was at sea, the Navy patrol vessel <i>L. E. Fola</i> arrived on the coast and encountered the <i>Marita Ann</i> which resisted all attempts to board her by resorting to the use of chains, iron bars and slash hooks.</P>
    <P>The <i>m. v. Thomond</i> resumed sea and estuary patrols towards the end of June during which an unsuccessful attempt was made to board a vessel from Skibbereen. Early in July a joint sortie by Shannon and western board staff was made in the north Clare area at sea. Firearms were brandished from a Kerry boat and the staff, a mile or more from land in vulnerable inflatables, were forced to retreat as their lives were endangered.</P>
    <P>That is the real root of the trouble in regard to salmon fishing.  The report relates to 1985 but I understand that one could write a similar scenario for the subsequent years.  It is interesting to see that some of the boats were named and that the one that was particularly named was called the <i>Marita Ann,</i> a name that has other connotations.  Indeed, I cannot understand why the <i>L. E. Fola,</i> after being treated in that way, apparently backed off and left the crew of the <i>Marita Ann</i> to continue their activities.  If I had been the captain of the <i>L. E. Fola,</i> provided the rules of engagement allowed it, I would have given the crew five minutes to get off the <i>Marita Ann</i> and if they did not I would have sunk that boat in five minutes.  It would have saved the country a lot of trouble if that had been done on that occasion and I think the captain was entitled to do that in view of the way his crew were assaulted, abused and obstructed.</P>
    <P>There has been toleration of that kind of conduct off many parts of our coast for quite a while and it is time we put a stop to it.  It does not matter what moneys are being charged, or not being charged, for salmon or other fisheries, we will not have salmon in our rivers and we will not have salmon angling in the future if that type of conduct continues to be tolerated, as it is at the moment.  If the trawler, the <Col N="2609" /><i>Marita Ann,</i> and some of those Kerry trawlers, had been sunk we would not have a repetition of this trouble.  In the enforcement of the law the captain concerned would have been entitled to do what I have suggested.  It is interesting that the mentality of those who engage in this activity is such that it is not just in a breach of the fishery laws that they connive; they are prepared, as we can see, to break more serious and fundamental laws in this State.  That boat attempted, happily unsuccessfully, to import what we thought at the time was a very large quantity of arms &mdash; it was between 10 and 15 tonnes &mdash; into this country until she was stopped by the Naval Service.  That is indicative of the mentality of those concerned.</P>
    <P>I can recall about 12 years ago looking at the Butler Pool in Waterville, County Kerry, and at the narrow passageway from the sea up to the lake, and seeing so many salmon in that narrow channel that the water was virtually black.  Three or four years later I revisited that area and I was told that in an entire season 30 salmon were caught in that pool.  I asked where the rest of them were and I was told that they were all caught at sea illegally.  They were caught not miles out to sea but in Ballinskellig Bay, in the view of the fishery protection staff who, unfortunately, did not have the facilities to stop them.  That fishery, which could be one of the great fisheries of the world, is now almost denuded of salmon, as are most of our inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>As we have seen from the Estimates all the fishery boards are in a bad financial state and with a huge reduction again next year the position will be worse.  The prospect of enforcing these licences through the courts in a meaningful way is not realistic because some of the boards cannot afford to go to court to prosecute those they find fishing illegally or without licences.  I wonder if there is any way of introducing some form of on-the-spot fine to be collected by fishery staff rather than having long drawn out court proceedings of people prosecuted for breaches of the fishery laws.  This Bill, which is only proposing <Col N="2610" /> to introduce a few fees in relation to coarse and trout fishing and to increase the fees in relation to salmon fishing, runs to 16 pages, 23 sections and a schedule. I am aware, because I used to deal with this in previous days, that the 1959 Fisheries (Consolidation) Act runs to 400 or 500 sections.  The 1980 amendment Act, which was supposed to simplify things, is another enormous tome.  Our fishery laws are archaic, even though they were consolidated as recently as 1959.  When one sees the complicated provisions that have to go into a Bill the size of the one we are debating and takes into consideration that it runs to 16 full pages, one can realise how archaic our fishery laws are. Some simplified system of enforcement like on-the-spot fines should be introduced, particularly when the staff are not in a position to spend much time on the ground.</P>
    <P>The last few years have seen a reduction in the services of the central and regional boards.  We have seen a considerable growth, unfortunately, in pollution and in illegal fishing.  Judging by the board's budget for next year, things will be worse.  The attitude of many anglers is, understandably, why should they pay more for a service that is getting worse?  Like Deputy Doyle I regret that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity today to outline whatever plans he has to reorganise the central and regional boards.  The feeling of grievance on the part of many anglers might not be quite as great if that was done and if they knew what was going to happen.  We are entitled to ask the Minister to outline what will be done, at least in general terms if not in detail.  Salmon anglers have paid licence fees for years and have seen salmon numbers drop year after year while the Government are doing little or nothing to stop illegal drift netting at sea. Trout anglers, who have not been paying a State licence, have had a good service over the years but now when their fisheries are being polluted and run down, they are being asked for the first time to pay.  Coarse anglers have had little to complain about as in the past few years more work has been carried out on coarse <Col N="2611" /> fishing waters.</P>
    <P>Why are sea anglers in some respects not included in the licensing system?  Is the reason that the work carried out by the Central Fisheries Board and the other boards for sea anglers will not be stopped?  That would seem the logical conclusion to be drawn.  Sea angling, which is not subject to the difficulties of fresh water angling or pollution and other problems, has tremendous potential.  I had a pleasant day this summer with two French people fishing off Inishturk and in the course of one day's fishing, we caught no fewer than then different species. We caught a great deal of fish which the French insisted on bringing home to put in their freezer in order to bring it back to Paris, which I did not altogether approve of, but they were able to tell me, for example, that the possibility of getting ten species of fish off the Atlantic coast in France in one day was nil, that you would be lucky if you fished every day for a whole season and caught ten species. Of course, fishing in the Mediterranean is a waste of time.  We have a most valuable resource and asset in that respect and I am afraid we have not marketed it nor have we provided the appropriate facilities.</P>
    <P>All the advice that Board Fáilte have got in more recent years and all the various reports commissioned have indicated that the two growth areas that above all else should be sold in this country are golf and angling.  The potential of both is vast.  Our efforts to sell angling in both sea and fresh water are very limited. That is regrettable.  It seems pointless to try to collect money in licence fees and to try to develop inland fisheries if the sort of conduct I have described as happening off the mouth of the Shannon and off the Clare coast is allowed to continue. There is a tolerance towards these people.  They are looked on as &ldquo;the lads&rdquo; in the sense that &ldquo;the lads&rdquo; are looked on in the Border areas.  It is the same kind of tolerance of people who are doing incredible damage to our country.  When I was Minister for Tourism five or six years ago, I got Bord Fáilte to do a study <Col N="2612" /> of the value to the Irish economy of one single salmon caught by a foreign angler. At that time, I think 1981, the value of one salmon to the Irish economy if it was caught by a foreign angler was £250.  I venture to think that the value to the Irish economy of one salmon caught by a foreign angler today would be not less than £400 and perhaps more.  I think that figure would not be disputed, yet we allow hundreds of thousands of salmon to be taken illegally all around our coast and we frighten away anglers who would otherwise come here.  We deprive our own people who obey the laws and have angled all their life of the right to catch Irish salmon in Irish waters because these Provos and thugs carry on in this fashion off our coasts.  That is perhaps the most important aspect of the matter at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister would find a high degree of willingness to accept and pay the proposed licence fees if anglers here could see enforcement of the laws particularly off our coasts and against polluters, particularly the major polluters who more often than not in the case of rivers are local authorities who, are supposed to enforce pollution laws.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious value of inland fisheries for angling and tourism, I want to refer to a type of inland fish which has great commercial value but which, unfortunately, is not encouraged to any great extent here; I refer to eels.  Our total output of eels two years ago, the last year that I can find, was approximately 85 tonnes.  The output of eels in Northern Ireland was seven times as great even though their area is very much smaller. Out of Lough Neagh alone they got something like 800 tonnes.  These are very valuable; lb. for lb. or kg. for kg. they are the same value as salmon.  I am aware of processors in this country who have unlimited markets abroad for smoked and other processed eels who simply cannot get the raw material here.  The boards should be encouraged and the ESB should be required to increase the production of eels here enormously. They have every opportunity and facility on the Shannon.  The Shannon lakes in particular were major producers of eels <Col N="2613" /> in the pre-Ardnacrusha days and there is a statutory obligation on the ESB to try to overcome the problems that have been created for fishing as a result of the construction of the Shannon scheme at Ardnacrusha. There is a limit to what they can do in relation to salmon.  I will say for them that they have made fair efforts with their hatcheries at Parteen, near Birdhill and elsewhere, but what they have done in relation to eels is very limited. The potential is vast and we are very foolish that we do not seek to avail of it. On other lakes such as the Corrib and on many other rivers there is equal potential for the production of eels for which there is an unlimited market abroad and to which a fair degree of value can be added here before they are exported.</P>
    <P>I do not object in principle to the Bill but I object to bringing in a Bill like this with all kinds of new licences and regulations and so on if they cannot be enforced.  I have a great fear that this provision, like so much of Irish law, will simply be ignored and will make even greater the contempt for the unenforceable laws of this country.  This thing will probably become something like pirate radio stations.  We have staff, the staff are being paid but the staff are literally being prevented from leaving their own offices.  They feel frustrated.  They are men of commitment.  It is very unsatisfactory for them and for all of us.  Even if the fisheries boards were to get the entire £500,000 that the Minister predicts hopefully in his opening speech, it will not go remotely near making up what was cut in the Estimates.  Therefore, on the face of it, the chances of proper enforcement do not look very good and I wonder how wise it is to bring a law that we virtually know in advance will be futile.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to see inland and sea angling facilities developed in the way they should be.  That can only be done if the law is enforced and if people are prepared to co-operate.  The co-operation of ordinary people off our coasts does not seem to arise.  That is where the boards should be given greater facilities. In particular, when the Navy are called in they should have no compunction in <Col N="2614" /> sinking some of these people who are operating off the Clare coast and at the mouth of the Shannon.  If they had sunk that boat to which I referred earlier, in 1985, as they would have been entitled to, the country would be better off, not just in respect of fishing but in respect of other situations as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the consensus that is apparent in the House in relation to the conservation of stocks. About six years ago when fisheries was part of my spokesmanship &mdash; it is not now &mdash; I was concerned about the disinterest that prevailed about general aspects of fisheries.</P>
      <P>I know you will forgive me, Sir, if I make one historical reference to that.  In the seventies when we were campaigning on Ireland's entry to the European Community I found myself developing an opinion that suggested that our general fisheries needed the specific protection of a protocol to our Treaty of Accession.  I found few takers for that argument and I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of Deputies who found any reluctance in exchanging benefits in terms of milk for possible protection in terms of fish.  However, from 1974 to 1981 there was a certain evolution in thinking about fish.  In 1981, an argument was developing that we had been through an argument about the potential of our fishing industry.  However, in the last six years there have been some very welcome developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House and in Seanad Éireann &mdash; where I spoke before on these issues &mdash; there has been a growing acceptance of the need for conservation.  Everyone agrees now that the basic co-principles of an adequate fisheries policy are ones in terms of adequate capital provision, the possible projection and development of stocks, the development of education in training, marketing and so on.  Among those criteria there is more support for conservation.  The present Minister, six years go, strongly backed unpopular conservation measures.  I appreciated it at that time and commended him on it. Now, in 1987, after an appalling year <Col N="2615" /> when we saw so much pollution, I very much support his very strong language directed against those who pollute our waterways.  I do not really have to do that because that is supported on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in an impossible situation in many respects.  For example, he suffers the disability of the general reduction in public finances allocated for his Department&mdash;a reduction of 13 per cent.  In relation to the amount allocated for inland fisheries development the reduction is 15 per cent and in relation to the Salmon Research Trust the reduction is 29 per cent.  Naturally, the Minister will incur the suspicion that any suggestions of raising revenue through introducing a licensing system for what was previously a free activity is simply an attempt to raise substituting finance for what was the State provision.  The more general point is a very important one.</P>
    <P>In the historic document the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> or revigoration or resuscitation, the crux of the matter is that there is a curious figure in it for 3,500 jobs in tourism.  I do not have to be the jaundiced cynic I am to ask where these jobs are coming from.  If I am looking for development in the tourist industry, I would not contradict any of the previous speakers who see an enormous contribution coming from angling and other forms of recreational activity but they are all based on a sound ecologically sensitive approach towards the future development of our country.  This means we will be whistling in the wind if we allow pollution to continue.  There is no point in pulling jobs in their thousands out of the air if we have destroyed the environment.  We are in a extraordinary position in that regard.</P>
    <P>Recently I met a member of the Europen Parliament from the Dutch Labour Party in Holland and the first question he asked me was what had happened to An Foras Forbartha.  He did not pronounce it like that; he had his own pronunciation. He was asking if we were really serious about the environment when we abolished the major body which looked after <Col N="2616" /> the quality of our environment.  There is no point glossing over the incredible damage that has been done to our potential for retaining that kind of ecological base and that set of possibilities for the fine development we might have looked forward to in years ahead.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha produced one report after another about the impact of waste, the need for sensitive monitoring of the environment, the establishment of standards, their experts visiting other bodies involved in similar work so on. An Foras were an independent statutory authority.  I am a member of one local authority now but from 1974 until the eighties I was a member of two local authorities.  I remember clearly the independence of that body when they criticised local authorities as being involved in pollution.  The list of polluters in some of their surveys showed that after agriculture and certain kinds of heavy industry local authorities were major perpetrators of pollution.  I have seen a terrible erosion of our commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>I want to be even-handed in my criticism. I believe it was absolutely disastrous to give local authorities the single and sole responsibility for monitoring pollution in 1985.  That was followed by the abolition of An Foras Forbartha and still the Government say they are expecting to create an enormous number of jobs in tourism.  The Government followed that by cutting the Estimate for the Department, and that was followed by an announcement of an increase in office machinery and other office supplies of 218 per cent, admittedly only from £45,000 to £143,000.  To cut back on the two areas directed at environmental protection within fisheries &mdash; the Vote for inland fisheries development and the Vote for Salmon Research Trust &mdash; makes an extraordinary mishmash and shows an absence of sense.  I am not blaming the Minister in particular for this.  I am simply saying it is an unfortunate flow in Government approaches that legislation is coming before us without having a coherent place in planning. If they say they are going to plan to develop the tourist industry and they <Col N="2617" /> identify a strong environmental capacity to create those jobs, they must then look at the institutional infrastructure that makes that possible, and at the estimates and expenditure of money required to fund that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>The previous speakers, particularly Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Doyle, referred to the public and social attitudes that prevail at present.  Our attitude is totally supportive of Deputy Doyle who said that we are responsible for the environment of future generations.  Would that that were widely accepted.  I am an optimist in one regard; the present number of young children going through the school system are far more sensitive and aware of ecological responsibility than their parents and the people who went before them.  As somebody who was reared in rural Ireland and now lives in a city, I have been a little more than appalled at the highly privatised view that people have of their world.  It is always someone else who is polluting, never you or your neighbour.  There is very little concept of the social irresponsibility involved in acts of pollution.  One incident I will mention illustrates this dramatically to me.  About 12 or 13 years ago I spent a holiday near Lough Sheelin and I watched the lake coming back from a stagnant pool caused by the people who had dumped pig slurry into it for years and years.  It recovered but last year people living on the edge of the lake told us that it is now dead again.  Many people involved in that pollution would call themselves Republicans, Nationalists and all sorts of other &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  They are behaving, not only in an irresponsible way but in a traitorous way towards future generations and to people in a county who rely on an inland fisheries base for tourism, employment in the future and for the possibilities for living there for so many families.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be an integrated approach towards this problem. In this regard, as someone who supported the establishment of Roinn na Mara, I was always afraid that conceptions would arise in the new Department that people would think that from the title, the <Col N="2618" /> Department of the Marine, somehow or other inland fisheries had got lost.  That is not so, it is possible and appropriate &mdash; and I know the Minister holds this view &mdash; that there is no need for any less concern about inland fisheries under a new, integrated Department.  The case for an integrated Department in our aspects of fisheries was an overwhelming one to reduce the bureaucratic structures and obstacles which stood in the way of those who were interested in fisheries.</P>
    <P>However, the issues that arise in terms of trying to make progress cause one almost to despair that voluntary appeals to people to protect the environment do not work any more.  The sanctions and penalties imposed for violations of the environment are totally insufficient.  I suggested that there was need for an integrated approach but nobody can talk about salmon without thinking in terms of the whole contribution towards the lessening of salmon stocks by the different component parts, such as trawlermen, inshore fishermen and people who use fixed nets and so on.  If we want an example of double thinking and evasion why are there outlets and agents for monofilament nets when we know that they are a major threat to different species? We cannot have it both ways.  Every single person who is involved in causing havoc to fish stocks will always say that they needed the catch to save them from destitution or starvation.  I am sure that is true in some cases but I am certain that the social and public attitudes needed in relation to the support of conservation need to be strengthened by a full panoply of sections and penalties which must be imposed if the generation following us will not have a missing species.</P>
    <P>There are countries where a species has completely disappeared and if one looks at the cost of restoring such a species to a particular place and the enormous effect that has, one can see that no measures should be spared in trying to make sure that we do not suffer the same fate.  As previous speakers said, the Minister needs to satisfy Deputies in relation to the question of funding.  The Minister said that trout and coarse fish anglers who <Col N="2619" /> benefit from substantial State expenditure on the development and protection of our trout and coarse fish fisheries should contribute towards the cost of such development and protection.  The public have a reasonable expectation of fishing free for trout and coarse fish, the area that traditionally has been the popular, non-elitist one in fishing.  Indeed, the mind boggles as to whether it is the purpose of the people who would implement these new provisions to chase young men and women to ask them if they are 18 or 19 years of age and &mdash; to use an unfortunate phrase &mdash; seize the rods from them, confiscate them and then get involved in the maze of law which would be necessary.  Remember, if we had adequately funded fisheries protection, development and monitoring from public funds, as we have in terms of stocks that have now come to this point, we should have been able to avoid charges.  The question arises &mdash; I am asking it rhetorically &mdash; does the concept of charges not limit access to something that was generally provided?  It is a reasonable question.  In an ideal world, in which people had a strong commitment, one would like to think that those who had enjoyed fishing and who can afford to pay for it would have voluntarily come forward, registered and paid money to create funds and trusts which would have enabled all sorts of conservation and so forth to take place.  However, that has not happened so do we now have to collect it from them if they are not willing to give it?  In doing so, will we exclude some categories of people?</P>
    <P>The Minister was anxious to assure the House that those over 66 years of age and under 18 years will not be excluded but I think of others whom I should not like to see prevented from fishing.  In Galway city, which escaped the early days of the recession but which is now feeling it in terms of the registered unemployed, there is a tradition of coarse fishing among the unemployed.  I would not like to see an unemployed or low income person excluded simply by the charge. Fishing, as a basic activity, is passed on <Col N="2620" /> from one member of a family to another and there is a strong and convincing case to be made for a family licence which would perhaps be administratively difficult but in terms of justice would recommend itself.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the report from around the country by Deputy Doyle about the attitude towards the question of licence charges.  She mentioned the strength of feeling among the people who believe in free fishing.  That is not unconnected with a further correct sense of rage that has often existed in this country by people who are excluded from fisheries in estates which were acquired under the most dubious circumstances. In terms of the waterways which belong to the people of Ireland, when we hauled down one flag and put up another and changed the colour and paint of the pillar boxes we left an awful lot of private proprietorial landlords' rights intact on a most suspect basis.  I am not arguing that they should be despoiled or that people should blackguard these resources, I am simply saying that they should be part of the managed resource of inland fisheries available to the public.  It is high time that we moved in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise those involved in fishing for their lack of commitment to conservation.  The best arguments I have heard for conservation have come from those involved in sea fishing and inland fisheries.  The people who have inherited the capacity to make a living, perhaps from several generations, are precisely those who know who is abusing the system.  It is they who will ask you, as a legislator, to do something before the whole lot is gone and we come to a point of no return.</P>
    <P>We had hoped for the development of the tourist industry.  Does it ever strike anyone as strange that there seems to be an endless market available for illegally caught salmon?  If these fish were rotting because of the lack of a sales outlet I doubt that so many people would be getting involved in such extraordinary adventures to break the law.  It is an activity that is rewarded by many people who are only too willing to purchase these <Col N="2621" /> fish without asking questions.  Those people are often involved in the tourist industry and they are participating in the destruction of their own industry as certain as I am standing here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been asked what this money is for.  He assured the House that it will be spent on protection and conservation. He can develop that but there is another question which is really the one people were preparing for when this short Bill came in.  That question relates to who will spend the money.  I have been intrigued by the extraordinary new creation, An Bord Iascaigh Intíre.</P>
    <P>Obviously we are going to hear more about it.  There is another shadow hanging over this legislation in relation to the significance of the sum of money involved.  If £550,000 is the projected figure, one has to ask what administrative cost is involved is seeking to yield this money.  If it is a net yield one has also to ask if it would have been easier to include that money in relation to making general provisions.  That would have been my approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he is going to reorganise the regional fisheries boards and the Central Fisheries Board.  That argument should have been thrashed out in advance of this legislation.  Basic questions have to be asked; is centralisation necessarily good; and, to take the most petty question, do the savings involved make it convincing?  Set against that are the costings of the regional fisheries boards.  The central and regional boards we have at present are not spending an enormous amount of money.  If one said that they were spending a lot of money and that the projected figure for pay and non-pay in 1987 was £5.7 million, another argument immediately arises.  There has been a reduction from 1982 to 1987 in the figure for the non-pay component which has sunk from 61 per cent to 19 per cent. Is it because enough non-pay provision has not been made that we are not getting the efficacy the people who work in the boards want to deliver in the interests of fisheries?  What do the people who work in the service want?  I would be guided <Col N="2622" /> by what they say.</P>
    <P>In making the case for regionalism <i>versus</i> centralism the fact is that whatever their resources the regionalised fisheries boards have been very good and courageous at calling our attention to major pollution events.  They have alerted us very often, even when the local authorities have failed to do so.  I want to lay my cards completely on the table in this regard.  I am not in favour of local authorities being the monitoring institution of pollution.  There is too much of a collision of responsibility.  I want to give an example of this.  If the highly centralised system of looking after fisheries was the responsibility of the Minister at Roinn na Mara and the local authorities were supposed to report major incidents of pollution one would be talking about two centralised bodies and two Ministers exchanging views.  There would be no incentive for one to draw the uncomfortable facts that would embarrass the other.  I am sure the regional boards will have made the argument to the Minister that they at least have highlighted the problems of pollution and they have a fairly decent record of prosecutions, often against hostile social and public attitudes. They will have probably pointed out as well that it is their work that has made possible the increased attention given to the dangers of the salmon stock and molluscs.  They have pointed out also the importance of democratic local involvement.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the Central Fisheries Board's activities in relation to films.  I would like to see that work continued. The two films they made drew a great deal of very favourable comment. They were shown abroad and if they were linked to an educational programme in second level schools they could lead to the very natural introduction of people into a healthy activity.  I would like to refer to licence charges and fees.  We are trying to encourage people, through the national lottery, to become involved in sport and, on the other hand, we are charging people because they have become involved in angling.  There seems to be a logical contradiction involved <Col N="2623" /> there.</P>
    <P>I have made these points to try to ensure that what emerges is something that will be responsible, that will draw the activities of local communities, will help turn around attitudes and give us an attitude towards the environment which will enable the maximum involvement. My criticisms of the Bill were expressed as very serious worries that we would exclude anybody on grounds of low income or that they are unemployed from participating in what has been a traditional free activity in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder where the Minister got the figure of 153,000 coarse and trout anglers.  Was that a figure that was plucked from the sky?  I doubt if there are that many anglers in this country.  I would like to know on what basis the Minister put that figure together.  I would like to ask the Minister who are the faceless men behind the Bill.  Is it the Minister for Finance?  Has he told the Department of the Marine that he has no more money for them, that they must get it somewhere else and get it fast?  If this Bill is passed, trout fishing could become an elitist exercise for some people.  If there is a £10 charge imposed this year there is nothing to stop the Minister introducing amending legislation to push the charge up to £20, £30, £40 and eventually £50.  I am giving a grassroot view tonight for free fishing.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that the Minister for the Marine who has a rural background would be more abreast of the situation.  I wonder what vested interest outside the Department of the Marine has got to him.  This legislation has been introduced in a hurry.  It seems it is being stampeded through the House.  There was an inspired leak in the newspapers last week saying that this legislation was to be introduced and that trout fishermen would have to pay from now on.  Second Stage of the Bill is to be completed tonight and the remaining Stages are to be completed some time tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister aware that <Col N="2624" /> there are over 250,000 people unemployed in this country.  He should give a concession to those people because they deserve it.  Is the Minister trying, by a back door method, to prohibit these people, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins has said, from the only recreation they have?  Will we ever again see a father and his children fishing on the banks of the canal trying to catch a few &ldquo;pinkeens&rdquo; or will he be afraid to go fishing in a small river near his back door after a couple of days' rain?  Is the Minister going back to the Victorian times when it was a crime to catch a trout or a salmon and the local landlord would probably have you deported or you would serve a few days in jail for illegal fishing?  The Minister should consider that aspect very closely.</P>
    <P>One would have thought the Minister and the Government would encourage young people to take up fishing as a recreation. It is the only recreation for many of the unemployed and, God knows, it keeps some of them sane.  Surely the Minister must be aware of people in his own constituency who leave in the morning with a flask of soup and two sandwiches and start out for a day's fishing. That is the only thing that is keeping those people sane.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider on Committee Stage giving a concession to the long term unemployed because many of them do not have the £10 which the Minister is proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows the regional fisheries boards are experiencing difficulties.  It is about time some of them were done away with and I certainly would not shed any tears.  They are aloof bodies who speak from lofty heights.  Some fishermen never even heard of them.  The only time people have contact with them is once a year when they apply for a drift net licence. Their officers are as scarce as snow in Manhattan.  The boards are non-existent and their profile is non-existent.  The Minister would be right to give them the chop and to put some other body in their place which would be more active and more vibrant and which the people would respect.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with what Deputy <Col N="2625" /> O'Malley has said in regard to drift nets. I am sorry he is not in the House now. He spoke about the Kerry fishermen who, he said, fish illegally off the mouth of the Shannon.  If he had his way he would instruct the Corvette to shoot to kill or to sink them; in his eyes they are only Kerrymen.  That is the kind of emotive language that Deputy O'Malley used tonight.  The man must be on cloud nine.  He should know there are many legal drift net fishermen in this country. He mentioned one particular boat but he did not dare mention other trawlers because the Progressive Democrats have a vested interest in some of them.  What Deputy O'Malley has said, that for the sake of a salmon a boat should be sunk and all lives go down with it, is very emotive and he should be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>I wonder in what circles does Deputy O'Malley travel.  Does he associate with members of a club who meet at 6 p.m. after a round of golf?  Those people do not think of the poor fishermen who have to get up at 4 a.m., who do not arrive home until 8 p.m. and barely make enough money to pay for the diesel oil for the day.  They are legal drift net fishermen. I have no respect for cowboy fishermen.  If Deputy O'Malley or the Central Fisheries Board know the names of the trawlers that are fishing illegally there is nothing to stop them from notifying the Garda so that they could get the names of the crew when they land and prosecute them if they deserve prosecution, particularly if they brandish firearms.  Deputy O'Malley must be on cloud nine and I have sympathy for him. The sooner he takes a dose of cop-on tablets the better.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of illegal coarse fishing in this country at present and the penalties should be dramatically increased.  Recent newspaper reports indicated that this is a very serious problem. I congratulate the Minister on bringing in the legislation if it will put an end to that illegal fishing.  Coarse fishing is a very important tourist attraction and <Col N="2626" /> something should be done about the matter.</P>
    <P>When the Minister framed this Bill I wonder did he contact Bord Fáilte.  They have issued brochures all over the world stating quite clearly that there is free fishing in this country.  For example, a Dutchman visiting Ireland does not realise it is illegal to fish until a bailiff taps him on the shoulder and asks him for his licence, in spite of the fact that the Bord Fáilte brochure states there is free fishing in this country.  There is a lack of communication somewhere.  There is no way the Minister can have this legislation in law for 1988.  Some visitors will have been misled that there is free fishing available. The Minister should consider that aspect of the matter very closely.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister not to make trout fishing a yuppie exercise because it appears that could very well by the case.  I met some angling clubs this afternoon and each one told me that at least onethird of their members are unemployed. I appeal to the Minister, if he must introduce a charge for fishing to make it a nominal charge.  I know that when a charge is in existence there will be more appreciation for the opportunity to fish but £10 is too much to charge the long term unemployed.  The most they should be charged is £2 or £3.  It will be possible to get £3 from these prople but there is no hope of getting £10.  I appeal to the Minister to look again at that aspect and reduce the charge to £3.</P>
    <P>In the new fishery boards to be set up by the Minister there should be fishermen's representatives.  Even on the old boards the members were elected by a kind of caucus group, if the truth were known.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a licensing system for trout and coarse fishing.  This would be welcome in itself but unfortunately, we cannot get away from the fact that the main purpose of the Bill is to raise additional funds.  It is, in other words, a new form of taxation.  This is most objectionable and most anglers would strongly object to this proposal particularly now when there are so many problems and the Minister cannot make moneys available to deal with those problems. Regrettably, the summer of 1987 will go down in the history books as the summer when inland waterways were under continuous attack from industrial and farm pollution.  We have first-hand experience of what can happen when regulations are not imposed and when polluters are allowed to go unchecked. More significantly, we know what can happen when we withdraw resources and staff from the monitoring agencies.  While I would normally welcome a measure to bring more finance into this important industry, I cannot welcome this method of raising finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finance is urgently needed.  The Minister has the responsibility if he succeeds in getting this legislation through, to ensure that stocks are replenished, that waters are kept clean and that there are appropriate staffing levels to undertake the responsibilities involved.  Imposing licence fees, establishing registers and imposing fines of up to £500 will not of themselves guarantee either the finance or compliance with the law.  This is just <Col N="2628" /> window dressing.  Other Government and ministerial initiatives will have to accompany the legislation.  The imposition of licences and of regulations has not prevented the widescale abuse in the fishing industry along our coasts.  The last report produced by the central and regional fisheries boards referred to an impossible situation at sea and said that the boards were particularly concerned about illegal fishing at sea where over 80 per cent of the total catch is taken and where the authorities were least equipped to deal with such fishing.  While the regional boards can control the estuaries and sheltered waters with their small patrol boats, only one of the seven regional boards possesses a seagoing patrol boat. The same report refers to the inadequacy of staff levels to monitor pollution in the regional boards and to cope with the growing numbers if fish kills from silage effluent.  The concern expressed in the 1985 report was borne out last summer. It is regrettable that the Minister with responsibility for marine matters did not anticipate the problems.</P>
    <P>What is more disturbing is the proposal to reduce the finance and responsibility of the regional fisheries boards.  The abolition or restructuring of these boards will be a loss to the country in terms of the tourist industry.  It is rather ironic that just a few weeks after the Government's loudly heralded <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, part of which included the provision of thousands of new jobs in tourism, we should get a Bill of this kind which contradicts the content of that programme. This Bill undermines the efforts being made by Bord Fáilte and regional tourist boards to promote angling as a major attraction.  This Bill will impede the creation of much needed employment in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The proposal to place the monitoring of pollution in the hands of local authorities is not acceptable.  We all know that the major cutbacks decided on by local authorities all seem to be in the area of refuse collection.  This will lead to pollution in the streams which lead into our rivers.  To expect that the local authorities will take a higher profile on water <Col N="2629" /> pollution is just not on.  All the evidence points to the opposite being the case.  If the Minister's proposals are to be properly implemented it will involve greater financing and staffing in the boards so as to minimise illegal fishing.  Applications for licences will have to be examined to ensure that the abuse of waterways is not intended.  The stocks and waterways will have to be monitored by highly trained committed individuals.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that a number of the regional boards have people who are unable to do their jobs simply because they have not enough money to go out on patrol.  It is also ironic that if an offender is brought to the notice of some regional boards, the boards have not the money to take legal action.  It is crazy that the boards are so bereft of funding that they cannot even in cases of blatant law breaking, take legal action.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been recognised internationally since the last century as a centre for trout angling.  We have the finest brown trout in Europe and our fishing waters stand apart for quality and beauty.  The same could be said for our large and smaller lakes.  The Trout Anglers Federation have been doing considerable work for the past 30 years to ensure a proper management programme for the waterways, and to guarantee stocks.  In view of the increased charges which go from 300 per cent to 500 per cent, the Minister has a renewed responsibility to all these organisations and to the various clubs concerned with fishing in our lakes and rivers.  There will be a greater onus on the Minister to ensure that the waters are clean, that stocks are plentiful and that the issue of licences proves to be a progressive rather than a regressive measure.  If the provisions of this Bill are to meet with any success, the Minister will have to show that he is prepared to make much greater financial resources available to the regional boards to enable them to carry out their basic duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill is being rushed through the House. It is a very important Bill which is concerned <Col N="2630" /> with a major industry, namely, fishing and tourism.  Coming from a county which can boast 365 lakes, one for every day of the year, I have a particular interest in contributing to this debate.  I have mixed feelings about this Bill.  I do not think it can be implemented because there are not enough people on the ground to implement the existing legislation.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I tabled a question to the Minister for the Marine regarding abuses by tourists taking large stocks of fish out of our lakes and rivers.  Is the Minister aware that they are blackmailing guesthouses into stockpiling these fish for them in deep freezers?  Is he aware that if they arrive at a guesthouse where this facility is not available they will move on to another guesthouse which is in a position to offer it?  This practice can be stamped out quite simply.  It is a matter of checking the equipment, cars and caravans of these people when they are leaving the country.  Large stockpiles of pike and eel will be discovered which are very valuable on the Continent.  Our stocks are being depleted because of this abuse. These people are more than welcome to come here but it must be remembered that fishing is a sport and a recreation.  It is not a commercial enterprise in which people can employ ten or 20 rods.  I have often seen fishermen going to our lakes and rivers with ten rods and numerous set lines.  No effort is being made to stop this practice.</P>
      <P>The people who will be penalised by this legislation are those who have enjoyed the relaxation of an afternoon's fishing, something which was taken for granted for generations.  This recreation was freely available to people who had time on their hands and it is especially important now when so many people are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who have rivers, streams and lakes adjacent to their lands have fished these waters for generations and they should feel free to do so.  They also allowed others to come across their lands to fish these lakes and rivers.  If when these licences are introduced a farmer cannot engage in some fishing after a hard <Col N="2631" /> day's work he will close the gate against other people coming in to fish.  He will have every right to do so because this was a facility which he allowed without question.  There must be some recognition of the fact that farmers made this facility available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to Lough Sheelin, one of the finest lakes in the country or in Europe.  He mentioned a lot of &ldquo;isms&rdquo; with regard to the farmers who live around that lake.  Nobody is more concerned than those farmers about the problem of Lough Sheelin and nobody has made a greater effort to clean up the problem which evolved there due to the expansion of the pig industry. Deputy Higgins is totally misinformed and he is welcome to visit the area and examine the farmyards to see for himself what those people have done.  If there is a problem there now, it is not due to the farmers.  It is more widespread.  Unless grants are made available people cannot rectify the problems of farm pollution. They expanded and developed over the years in line with guidelines laid down by the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>As a founder member of the Lough Mask Anglers' Association I should like to express my concern at the proposed legislation.  Like some other speakers, I have some mixed feelings about it.  I would regard myself as a dedicated trout angler.  I am not a particularly successful one but I like the pleasure of the environment and the ambience of the company.  Fishermen are a good and genuine breed of people&mdash;I am talking about the native species.  They have asked me to express their concern, particularly the members of the Lough Mask Anglers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boylan mentioned Lough Sheelin, a lake I used to fish many years ago.  It is, as he says, a wonderful lake. The problem is that the lake was almost killed, but I hope it is rising from the <Col N="2632" /> dead.  Slurry effluent from pig farming caused much damage to the lake.  As Deputy Boylan said, the farmers did not get enough support to gather up the slurry and it was allowed to get into various rivulets and rivers feeding Lough Sheelin. That was where the damage occurred.  I hope it is a fact that this precious lake is now regenerating itself.</P>
    <P>Fishing is not just a matter of bringing along a rod and dipping it into a lake. It must be considered in terms of the economic advantages it brings to these areas.  There are many beautiful guesthouses in the area of Lough Mask from which people make a living during the fishing season which runs from 15 March to the end of September.  It is a very important economic factor for the local people.</P>
    <P>We are speaking here about proposed increases for fishing licences.  I have no objection to the imposition of these charges if, at the end of the day, the Minister will assure the House that some of these moneys will be utilised in a way that will ensure our lakes are pollution-free not alone for this but for future generations. That is what we should be talking about. Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would outline in greater detail what these moneys will be used for.  We are just coming to the end of the European year of the Environment.  I understand the object of the celebration of that year was that we would ensure we had pure air, pollution-free rivers and lakes.  Instead what did we do this year?  We polluted our rivers and lakes.  There were so many incidents of pollution during the summer that one wonders if they constitute our tribute to the European year of the Environment.</P>

      <P>I might express my appreciation of the constructive, worthwhile and generally supportive comments which have been made this evening in relation to this Bill. Anybody listening to such comments will appreciate, as I do, that this is a complex area, with very many aspects and on which people have widely differing views and opinions.</P>
      <P>Let me first reassure the House that the moneys which will be collected by way of revenue from the charges and licences we are introducing will be paid directly to the fisheries authorities in the different regions to be used solely for the purpose of protection, conservation and development of our inland fisheries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new measure, the revenue from which will be used solely for the protection, development and conservation of our inland fisheries.  I want to mention development because, as everybody here knows &mdash; and this has emerged clearly from the contributions made &mdash; regardless of how we may feel about the existing structures, the Central Fisheries Board, the regional fisheries boards, the inland fisheries trusts we had before, the old boards of conservators &mdash; whatever administrative arrangements have obtained over the last 50 or 60 years have not operated satisfactorily.  Therefore, is it any wonder that we have had some of the comments we have heard this evening?  I find it extremely difficult to defend a system of administration which leaves our inland fisheries in their present horrible state.  If there is any one reason we need to examine this and take urgent action to deal with it, it is the problem of pollution.  Do not let anybody contend that this is something which occurred last <Col N="2634" /> summer only.  Pollution has been a problem for over 30 years.  Other Members have more eloquently advanced reasons that some of these things have been allowed to happen.  We must try to create an awareness of our environment.  If we cannot do so here, where else?  We have, in our inland fisheries, a huge natural resource capable of exploitation and development if properly managed and organised which could transform our whole economy.  It poses a challenge for us here, to examine the whole system to ascertain how it can be operated effectively and successfully.</P>
      <P>For whatever length I remain in office it will be my intention to work with the many people interested and concerned in this area to put in place a system which will work successfully, doing what we need to do, above all, bearing in mind that this represents a community resource.  Regardless of how budgets may be framed in ensuing years we must ensure more community involvement and investment in the development of this resource.  I believe the necessary goodwill and money is there but people have not been prepared to invest under the present arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could have come to the House much earlier with proposals for the reconstruction of our inland fisheries administration had I not taken into account the views of the various interests involved countrywide.  The delay has been occasioned by the fact that I have taken time to discuss the arrangements with the existing Central Fisheries Board &mdash; which had been abolished by a decision of the previous Government without any provision having been made for the continuance of the work in which they had engaged or dealing with the activities of personnel involved.  I examined the whole area ascertaining what new arrangements were necessary to ensure the success of our inland fisheries all of us would like to see.  Of course there are differing views and opinions about that.  Indeed a debate like this serves a useful purpose in that it indicates how Members of the Oireachtas would view the administrative arrangements <Col N="2635" /> being put in place in regard to our inland fisheries.  The fact that I wanted to consult all of the interested groups has meant that I have not until now put proposals before the House for discussion.  Any such proposals will involve major legislative changes.  Members will see, on examining the Bill, the number of amendments of existing legislation, which obtained even before the inception of the State.  It is an extremely involved and complicated area.  Any new structural proposals calling for decision will be debated here, when Members will be afforded an opportunity to express their views.</P>
    <P>If we approach this Bill from the purely negative viewpoint, that its provisions will not work, are not capable of being administered, then we are going down the wrong road.  I believe that the provisions of this Bill are capable of being implemented successfully but, in order to ensure their implementation, we need a measure of agreement on the part of local bodies and organisations.  Even though there may be differences of opinion expressed in different areas I am aware that there is an overwhelming volume of support, from within the regional fisheries boards, the existing Central Fisheries Board, on the part of some angling organisations in addition to many important and very vocal members of those organisations.  There is an overwhelming volume of support in favour of the introduction of a system of charges for services in this area which will lead to the overall development and benefit of the industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>The question of protection has been the subject of debate on numerous occasions.  It is an area in which current legislation is inadequate.  We have established a ministerial subcommittee. <Col N="2636" /> They have already made certain recommendations which have been referred to already this evening.  Resulting from discussions, we have identified a number of key areas warranting attention.  In addition I believe there is a necessity for substantial changes in legislation along the lines I have indicated already.  These will be proceeded with as speedily as possible. When such legislation is introduced Members will have an opportunity of expressing their views.</P>
      <P>I must insist on one principle, that is in relation to the whole area of conservation. I support fully what Deputy Michael Higgins said this evening.  This is not the first occasion on which I have spoken of this.  In the whole area of fisheries conservation we have to change the attitude we have had in the past number of years, particularly in relation to our very valuable salmon fisheries.  If we allow the indiscriminate illegal activities that have been taking place in the salmon fishing industry to continue, especially in the offshore areas, then there will not be a salmon fishing industry in the future. One of the areas of priority for any new fisheries authority, be it national or local, will be to tackle the indiscriminate illegal activity in the salmon fishing area which is decimating our salmon stocks, putting the future of our salmon fisheries in jeopardy and threatening its whole viability. We cannot allow that to happen.  There must be law and order in what is a key area: otherwise, the salmon fisheries industry as we know it will be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first section where the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is used.  I have some reservations about the use of this word to describe the new body which is being set up.  Previously, the word &ldquo;institute&rdquo; which is a very dignified word and the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; were used.  The word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is used to describe some kind of office or business such as a newsagents or an insurance agency but I do not think it will reflect the research work which Eolas will carry out or the kind of innovatory activities which the Minister of State rightly expects it to carry out. Perhaps, people will refer to it generally in short as Eolas but they may also refer to it as an agency.  I wonder what the thinking was behind the decision to chose this particular word rather than to use the word &ldquo;institute&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;board&rdquo;. Perhaps it is not unusual nowadays to use the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; to describe a body of this sort but broadly speaking, I do not think it was an inspired choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The name of the agency was raised during the Second Stage and it was suggested to the Minister at that time that although the word &ldquo;Eolas&rdquo;<Col N="2640" /> would be well understood in Ireland it would not have a clear understanding in the international arena.  It was suggested to the Minister that he might consider using some other name which, while, perhaps, retaining the Irish name would have some English equivalent which would be clearly understood.  The same &ldquo;Technology Ireland&rdquo; was suggested to him at that time.  The name of this agency's counterpart in France is Technova which is internationally recognisable.  The name &ldquo;The Irish Science and Technology Agency&rdquo; would be a better name to use because of the large amount of contact which will be made with international bodies.  The word &ldquo;Eolas&rdquo; will clearly not be understood in the international arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that we still feel very deeply and rightly so that our heritage and language should be recognised.  The word &ldquo;Eolas&rdquo; is as good as any to describe a body which would incorporate a great degree of knowledge and learning but recognising the point which Deputy Stagg and Deputy Nealon made it was felt because we would be dealing with many multinational companies internationally it should be made very clear to them that this was the Irish science and technology agency or body which reflected the views of the country in regard to progress in science and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Nealon's point I can assure him that we looked at all possible alternatives.  We looked at all types and forms of words including the words &ldquo;institute&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; and we came to the decision which was not taken very lightly that the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is a word which reflects activity whereas the word &ldquo;institute&rdquo; reflects a more studious body which may not have an active industrial base.  It is our intention that this body should be a very active and progressive one and an agent of change.  In deciding on the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; it was our intention that this body would be a real agent of change and would reflect what we all want, which is, that we should have more science and technology and more <Col N="2641" /> research and development in our indigenous industries putting us on a par with every other country in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's very positive reply and I strongly suggest that the initials for The Irish Science and Technology Agency should not be used because it will cause absolute chaos. Whatever chance the word &ldquo;Eolas&rdquo; has of being understood the initials TISTA will have no chance.  A similar difficulty arose in that regard with the old IIRS. Even though more ink will be required, and paper and so on the full name should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I care relatively little about what this new agency will be called; secondly, I am much more concerned about the quality of the work for which presumably it will become known, and, thirdly, no matter what we decide here this body will be known as and from its establishment as the ISTA &mdash; I do not think people will use the first &ldquo;T&rdquo;&mdash; just as other bodies are known by their initials, for example, the IIRS, NBST, CIE and a whole clutter of such bodies.  This Bill comprises of 29 sections and many serious amendments have been tabled and therefore we should not delay too long over this.  The point has been made and the Minister of State is not going to change the name of the agency. With respect to my colleagues I suggest that we should proceed.  I would be much happier if we could between us try to ensure that the agency is facilitated in carrying out work of high excellence.  We can call it what we like as far as I am concerned.</P>

Presentation is in the name and I go along with the point made by Deputy Stagg in <Col N="2642" /> regard to that.  I hope that the publicity will be heavy on the use of the word &ldquo;Eolas&rdquo; rather than initials.  I know that the people involved in science and technology get high on initials and I believe they will try to get an initial designation for the new board.  I had my reservations about the word &ldquo;Eolas&rdquo; but it is my view now that we should concentrate on using that word.  By strong direction in the early stages we could get that word established here, whatever about internationally, as the title.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the Deputies that I would be very concerned if the abbreviated version was used. When I was appointed to this post I was amazed at the plethora of abbreviations starting with IIRS, NBST and so on, all conceived to confuse John Citizen.  For as long as I am in control I will try to ensure that the abbreviated version is not used.  We are all aware that the use of abbreviations is not confined to organisations. Many prominent people are known by their initials, even in this House.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a1:</P>
      <P>a1.  In page 5, subsection (2), line 3, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and a statement of such additional undertakings shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the laying-down by the Minister of the conditions attaching to that undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This comprehensive section outlines the duties and general functions heretofore assigned to the NBST and now being transferred to Eolas.  When I looked at this section I wondered about paragraph 8 (1) (h) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(h) to promote the development of <Col N="2643" /> natural resources through the application of science and technology.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there is some inherent unhappiness in the juxtaposition of the development of natural resources side by side with an agency which I expect will be largely concerned with technological advances.  I accept that they are compatible but by definition natural resources represent a slightly different area of development.  I wonder why the capital intensive, modern, high tech training attitude, discipline and professional area of expertise is some how different to the area of the development of natural resources. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>(2) The Agency may, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, do all such other things as arise out of or are consequential on the functions assigned to it by or under this Act.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to add to that, &ldquo;and a statement of such additional undertakings shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the laying down by the Minister of the conditions attaching to that undertaking.&rdquo;  Is there any point, as I think there is, in going through a Bill like this establishing an agency, giving it a clarity of focus in terms of the job it should be doing, discussing the relative merits and demerits of the various activities in which it should be engaged, coming to a consensus and a decision about what it should be doing but including in the Bill a very general and somewhat vague suggestion that the agency may, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, do all such other things as arise out of or are consequential on the functions assigned to it by or under this Act?  That is a broad canvas.  Essentially it boils down to the Minister being able to decide, without reference to the House, to assign to the agency a function which has a very remote and, perhaps, peripheral area of interest to the agency.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to suggest that <Col N="2644" /> if there is such a conditional undertaking, bearing in mind that the ambit is very wide, that additional undertaking should be laid before the House within 21 sitting days of the laying down of that by the Minister.  We would then know how the Bill was being broadened.  Obviously, the purpose of the discussion is to get a clarity of focus on the legislation. If, however, there are out clauses in it to allow for grey areas of nebulous development which may be specific in the Minister's mind but are not recorded anywhere for the House to consider in any form then we may not be doing what we should.  I am for clarity.  People should be able to point to a document and say, &ldquo;That is what we asked the agency to do and they are the reasons for that request.&rdquo;  We would then have an opportunity of taking up the matter by way of question or otherwise.  If that amendment is not inserted there is little point in us discussing paragraphs (a) to (i).  If there is a general undertaking will the Minister let us have a copy of it so that we can judge how the agency is performing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the meat of the Bill.  I will be as brief as possible because we are all anxious to go through each section.  Paragraphs (a) to (i) are couched in general phraseology.  They are saying that as far as science and technology are concerned we are in favour of all sorts of virtue and are against the opposite to virtue in science and technology.  I do not know if that general terminology is used in other legislation but in my view paragraph (g) which refers to the promotion of the application of science and technology to economic and social development covers everything.  However, I am sure that after a good deal of thought it was considered necessary to cover virtually everything in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2), which deals with the method of protecting inventors, is very important.  I understand that universities in the United States have their own system of protection of their inventions. I accept that ours are not large enough for that and that the agency is the best concern to cover that aspect at national <Col N="2645" /> level.  We have had several examples of excellent inventions in countries as sophisticated as Britain being used in countries like the United States, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.  I am glad to see that industrial and commercial design is covered in that section.  I understand that design can be a major factor when deciding on two superb products.  Overall the Minister has done a good job in presenting all of these, but I do not know whether it is usual in Bills of this nature to be so vague in covering virtually everything or in attempting to cover everything. However, there is no part of it that I can object to seriously.  I just wonder if the drafting might be done more tightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain briefly what the other amendments are about, then other speakers may want to comment on them.  Amendment No. b1 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a), line 7, after &ldquo;any new institution&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or the dissolution of any existing institution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It refers to the desirability of the agency advising the Government on the need for the establishment of any new institution or for revising the functions of any existing institution and on the nature or format of such institution.</P>
      <P>In a country that has an excessive number of agencies and institutions relative to its size, I would like to see at least equal weighting given to the need for the agency to consider the suggested possibility of dismantling, dissolving or disbanding some institutions and the desirability of the same agency suggesting that agencies might also be established. Otherwise the agency might arguably be inhibited from saying they think an institution has outlived its time and should be wound up or something else should be put in its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis of that amendment is that of a form of exponential growth in agencies, bodies and corporate institutions. I do not think the amendment is controversial.  It should cause the Minister no problems.  It seeks to add the words &ldquo;or the dissolution of any existing institution&rdquo; simply to give a sense of balance, so that the agency does not just come to the Government and ask them to set up, say, three more institutions. They might also want to be able to tell <Col N="2647" /> the Government that such and such an institution is no longer necessary.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment. Amendment No. c1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (g), line 20, to delete &ldquo;(where appropriate after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs)&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (g) contains an unusual subclause as follows: &ldquo;(where approppriate after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs)&rdquo;.  Here again is a suggestion about the agency having the function of engaging &ldquo;(where appropriate after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs) in international activities in science and technology, including where appropriate, representation of the State at conferences, meetings and seminars,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues in the House in elected positions at national and local level who are always in the eye of the storm whenever there is a suggestion that one goes anywhere trying to broaden one's knowledge, I am very sensitive to the need for restraint in representation abroad by everybody, and I include public officials in that.  It is not unreasonable, and I am not attempting to whittle that away, simply to say that we should remove the brackets from that clause, and clean up the phrase &ldquo;where approriate&rdquo; which does not mean a great deal; presumably it means appropriate in the judgment of those who are going to participate in those seminars, meetings and so on.  I have no doubt that will mean it will be normal, that engaging in international activities will not have to be brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that is the normal, understanding and human thing to do. My amendment would then mean that if people are going to represent us abroad or be involved internationally, particularly in view of the kind of implication in such participation, we simply state &ldquo;after <Col N="2648" /> consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs&rdquo;; in other words, we clear up the doubt and ambiguity.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. d1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (i), line 32, after &ldquo;studies on manpower,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the Department of Labour and relevant State agencies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that excellent and commonsense. I did a little work on this when I was Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure and I found a fair number of agencies involved in considering elements like this.  They were bodies like the YEA.  AnCO had a certain role as had the Department of Labour in that respect.  There are massive tomes of research papers in our third level colleges and RTCs on this central area in economic development.  We do not want another agency re-inventing the wheel on work that may already have been done. The spirit of what I am trying to achieve here is that if the agency decide to engage in studies on manpower at least they consult first with the Department of Labour or any other relevant State agencies such as I have just mentioned, to ascertain whether the work they are about to initiate at public expense has already been carried out.  Even if that obligation is not written in, I suppose common sense would dictate that they do that, but we must assist the agency to do their work clinically and efficiently.  Thus, it is not unreasonable to say to them that they must consult, see if the work they are going to do has been done and if it has been done do something else.  That is what that proposed amendment is designed to do.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. e1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 6, lines 12 to 15, to delete subsection (6).</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) seems tautological or repetitious. I might even conflict to some extent with previous sections.  I am not in the business of giving English, legal or any lectures here, but I submit that that subsection adds nothing to the Bill, or in <Col N="2649" /> so far as it adds anything it is a dimension of vagueness.  It provides that the Minister may by order assign additional functions to the agency after consultation with the Minister for Finance and with any other Minister of the Government appearing to be the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>Having gone through the full list, having discussed it, considered it, drafted and re-drafted it, you then add in this kind of safe, comfy, cosy, big, grey, nebulous rider which provides that if by any chance at any time we want this agency to do something else or perhaps want some other agency to do something which they cannot do and this one could do, the Minister may by order &mdash; not even to be laid before the Dáil &mdash; assign functions to the agency after consultation with a colleague and the agency then would be deemed to have that as an appropriate power.</P>
    <P>Does that in effect put aside much of what has already been done?  If so, I am not sure it is in the interest of good legislation.  It is a soft option.  I can envisage no additional function which the agency could be asked to do which is not already embraced in the comprehensive list coming before them in section 8 or of such fundamental importance as would warrant at least some discussion in this House.  If there is some serious error I am not aware of perhaps subsection (6) is justified.  If not, it should not be in.  I do not like that kind of grey area.  It tends to defeat the whole purpose of parliamentary debate and accountability in this House, and we should have accountability.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I offer on section 8 out of a genuine sense of support for the Bill in the belief that what I have offered &mdash; regardless of how well or inadequately it may be drafted; if there is a better form of words I will be quite happy about that &mdash; is a cleaner, tidier, tighter, more sharply defined Bill with proper standards of accountability.  That is the thrust of the five amendments I have pleasure in discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8, as I see it, restates the functions under the 1981 Act <Col N="2650" /> and adds to it.  This is to be welcomed because we are well aware of the restrictions placed on many public agencies in what they can and cannot do.  The broadening of the functions of the agency under this section is to be welcomed.  Like the former speaker, I am concerned about subsection (6).  This might have a negative effect.  The Minister might elaborate on the reasons for this subsection in his reply.  It seems to be an attempt not to cut across any other Government Department in any functions the agency might be carrying out.  This might have a very stultifying effect on their activities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nealon expressed concern about a number of elements that were contained in section 8 and suggested that they were broad and vague and might involve the agency in nebulous functions.  I can assure him there is absolutely no intention of that. What we wanted was to put down in as comprehensive a manner as we could the types of functions we envisaged in a broad way that this agency would have to engage in not just now but in the future.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (6) gives the power to assign additional functions.  Section 8 is completely unchanged from the National Board of Science and Technology Act, 1977.  That worked quite well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating's amendment a1 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 3, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and a statement of such additional undertakings shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the laying-down by the Minister of the conditions attaching to that undertaking.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section as drafted, is in standard form and there is no change from the 1977 Act.  This amendment in our opinion is unnecessary and inappropriate and in my view could be unworkable.  The section has been in existence in the old Act since 1977 and no problems have arisen.  For that reason I cannot see any reason to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating was also concerned <Col N="2651" /> about section 8 (1) (h).  The purpose of this is to promote the development of natural resources through the application of science and technology.  Science and technology in research and development has become a very broad expansive field and is not just confined to items like computers.  It is related to every developmental area.  One of the purposes of my office and the agency would be to coalesce with developmental bodies such as the new office of horticulture, the new office of food, the new office of forestry, the Department of the Marine and the Department of Energy.  In any area where developmental progress can be achieved by the use of, or the introduction of, new technology, it is appropriate that this agency and the office of science and technology should advise on the use of technology to make the best use of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating's amendment No. b1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a), line 7, after &ldquo;any new institution&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or the dissolution of any existing institution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have examined this amendment and we see no reason why we cannot accept it. I think it will be a help.  Deputy Keating's amendment c1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (g), line 20, to delete &ldquo;(where appropriate after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs)&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affaris&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have examined this amendment very carefully.  Our interpretation is that the effect of this amendment would make it obligatory upon the agency to consult with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the case of all international activities in science and technology.  This simply would not be feasible in all activities.  It would involve consultation with Foreign Affairs in the case of an enormous range of technical committees and subcommittees of international organisations which are serviced regularly.  As <Col N="2652" /> the Deputy is aware, in 1977 when this section was written into the 1977 Act, Foreign Affairs agreed that they need not be consulted about minor day to day interaction with international organisations. As the Deputy is aware there is regular consultation with Foreign Affairs through my Department in the case of major activities, such as ministerial councils, international agreements and bilateral co-operation agreements with third countries.  That will explain the situation more clearly to Deputy Keating.  I feel this amendment is inappropriate and I cannot accept it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating's amendment No. d1 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (i), line 32, after &ldquo;studies on manpower,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the Department of Labour and relevant State agencies&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>We have considered this amendment very carefully and deemed that it is unnecessary and should not be accepted. The Manpower studies which are envisaged relate to science and technology activities.  They are simply studies, and in practice, extensive consultation takes place with all interested parties.  The section already provides for consultation with appropriate institutions.  Section 8 (2) states that the agency may, subject to such conditions as the Minister may prescribe, do all such other things as arise out of or are consequential on the functions assigned to it by or under this Act and Deputy Keating was under the impression that this was a cosy and comfortable arrangement that gave a broad power to the agency.  There is no intention to do that.  We are trying to ensure that all eventualities will be covered and that the agency will have the powers which we expect them to have.</P>

      <P>This is one of the problems in regard to taking amendments together.  The amendment is to delete this subsection and the section empowers <Col N="2653" /> the Minister, after consultation, to assign additional functions to the agency.  I consider this to be a useful and appropriate provision.  Deputy Stagg was also concerned about this and maybe in the future because of the progress of rationalisation, or for other reasons, it may be appropriate to assign new functions to the agency.  It is necessary to have the power to do so.  A good example of what I have in mind might be necessary action which, for example, could arise from advice which the agency might give the Government arising from their function under section 8 (3) (a).  If the Government decided, on the basis of the advice of the agency, to revise the functions of an existing institution or to dissolve an existing institution, they might well decide to pass certain functions to Eolas.  In this situation, the power provided in this subsection would be absolutely essential and, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Before taking a decision on this section, I should like to make a brief comment on section 8 (7) which says that the National Board for Science and Technology is hereby dissolved.  That is really the death notice of the National Board for Science and Technology and it would be wrong of the House to let it go without at least an obituary notice. During their limited period of existence, they did a very good job with limited resources.  They were an instrument for change, always pushing forward in a very fast changing area and focusing our attention on the need for policies and activities in this area.  I hope the Minister of State can give us an assurance that they will not become subservient or swamped by the larger IIRS with which they will be joined and that their functions will be strongly maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Nealon raised that subject.  We all recognise that the National Board for Science and Technology have worked very well since their formation in 1977 and, of course, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have worked <Col N="2654" /> very well since 1961.  In view of the fact that the Government decided that a new impetus must be given to science and technology research and development, we felt it was appropriate that a single agency would be more effective than two which might cause duplication of activities. One single, strong agency will be more effective than two.</P>
      <P>In relation to the preparation of this Bill, the advice given to us by the Attorney General was that this was the simplest and easiest way of doing it.  I assure Deputies on all sides of the House that it is my intention to ensure that we have one single new agency encompassing and incorporating all the activities previously undertaken by the two existing ones.  The fact that the IIRS had more personnel than the National Board for Science and Technology and that personnel from the NBST from 1 January 1988 will be located in Glasnevin should not be interpreted as implying that the previously larger IIRS will gobble up the National Board for Science and Technology or <i>vice versa</i>.  There is no intention that either agency will take over the other.  This is a new agency incorporating the abilities and capacities which existed in the previous agencies.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the festive season got to the Minister.  He made the point that the first amendment was inappropriate but all I was asking was that a <Col N="2655" /> copy of whatever changes which would be made in terms of the functions of the agency would be laid before the House. I do not know if &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; is the correct word for that amendment because we have a right to know if we are doing something fundamental in terms of changing the agency's functions.  Otherwise, there is no point in listing the functions. We could simply have set up an agency to do what we wished them to do at any given time.  I agree with the Minister's response to my third amendment, the one about consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  With hindsight, he is right because nobody wants to have every tittle tattle of work which the agency do being the basis of consultation.  I had in mind simply the areas of representation abroad.  I would not include just ministerial conferences, I am talking about official travel where there is need for some degree of restraint and moderation and where there has been in the case of public representatives, controversy and, in some cases, abuse. That stricture might apply right across the board and I do not see anything wrong with the Minister for Foreign Affairs being acquainted of the fact that three or four officials are going abroad.  However, the Minister does not feel the amendment is acceptable and I do not intend to press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the power he is looking for in subsection (6) is essential. I cannot see how any new power will arise which is not already embraced in the explicit list in the previous page and a half.  Any action that the agency might need to take arising out of new knowledge is almost certainly involved.  The difficulty with subsection (6) is that there is no restriction on the assignation of additional functions.  Theoretically speaking, they could be in any area, not just in science and technology, to which there is no reference in that subsection. This is a new agency and if everything had worked properly in the previous arrangements we would not be having this debate tonight.  The people involved worked very hard and I want to ensure <Col N="2656" /> that those who are embarking on the new agency will have a clarity of remit which is not demonstrable or evident in many State agencies where there are no clear targets or goals and which often have lists of vague, ambiguous and ambivalent aspirations put before them which are very difficult to manage.  Anything that adds to that lack of focus is detrimental to the wellbeing of the agency.  That is the spirit in which I wanted that removed. I am grateful to the Minister for accepting what I propose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a look through the various powers which are devolved on the agency under section 8.  It is a fairly comprehensive list.  However, one aspect of the section gives me some concern. There does not seem to be a relationship between the new agency and members of the public.  After all, it is the members of the public who fund and provide for the agency but the powers are rather removed from members of the public.  Under section 8 the agency may advise the Government, act under the Minister, advise the Minister and promote research but the section does not state that they should assist a member of the public who may have a difficulty or problem in a matter of technology or science.  A citizen should be entitled to go to this agency and seek their assistance <Col N="2657" /> if he needs scientific expertise in connection with his factory, his business or a court case he might be involved in. He should be in a position to go to the national board set up for this purpose.  Is there a deliberate exclusion of access to members of the public?  It is fine that the Minister and the Government should have an agency available to advise and assist them but what about the man on the street?  On occasion he might need some professional guidance on a matter of technology or science.  Is he, the person who ultimately foots the bill, to be denied the right of basic access?  Admittedly this does not arise very often but on occasion he might need this facility.  This is a State agency set up at no small expense and funded by the taxpayer and why is there not a clear statement that members of the public should have access to it in some form?  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the drafting of the Bill which puzzles me slightly.  Section 8 purports to limit the functions and powers of this agency and purports to be as comprehensive as necessary.  Why was it considered necessary to have a separate section, namely section 12, isolating one particular power in relation to research? That puzzles me and I am curious to know why the power to research was considered to be appropriate for a separate section rather than including it as one of the subsections in section 8 as a function of this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My query relates to the drafting of the Bill.  Line 20 of section 8 states: &ldquo;The Agency shall, in addition to any functions assigned to it by or under the Act of 1961, have the following general functions...&rdquo;  The definition section of the Bill says: &ldquo;The Agency means Eolas &mdash; The Irish Science and Technology Agency&rdquo;.  Obviously the new agency was not the one referred to in the 1961 Act.  Is there any confusion or problem in relation to that?  The new agency is to have functions which were assigned to &ldquo;it&rdquo;, whatever &ldquo;it&rdquo; is.  I presume &ldquo;it&rdquo; in this case is the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards but if <Col N="2658" /> that is the case that is not what section 8 says.  That needs to be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the problem with section 12 which is worrying Deputy Taylor, the position is that this was a power which the NBST had and the wording is taken absolutely unchanged from the National Board for Science and Technology Act, 1977.  It is basically a gap filling function to be exercised only with the approval of the Minister in order to ensure that it will be operated only as a function of last resort.  The purpose of this is to ensure that an over ambitious agency will not be likely to embark on work which might be carried out by the other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor is concerned also about section 8 because there is no reference to the public.  Section 8 (1) (f) states that one of the general functions assigned to the board is &ldquo;to promote research&rdquo;, I hope that that would deal with the public and companies who seek advice regarding the development of technology and research and grant aiding and that the new agency would work very closely with the public. The functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards under the 1961 Act will continue in existence. Under those functions the services of the agency are available to the public.  We are all aware that one source of income for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is providing contract work for companies.  This agency will act under the Minister as the body responsible for the furtherance of science and technology in Ireland and, as a consequence of being under the direction of the Minister, they will be accountable not just to the Minister and to the Government of the day but to the Members of this House also. That should ensure that the public interest in every sphere will be catered for whether it is in relation to advice, the types of research and technology they should have, grant aid or in the provision of contract work which was one of the functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards heretofore. Under section 3 the name of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is <Col N="2659" /> being changed to Eolas.  Therefore the word &ldquo;it&rdquo; in section 8 (1) refers to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I am entirely satisfied with the Minister's reply.  I am sure the intent is there but I do not see it in the wording.  The Minister referred me to section 8 (1) (f) which is the function to promote research.  I cannot see that that in any way meets the point I was making about access of the public to a particular scientific or technological problem.  This would be a specific item with which he would need help and which he would want this agency to deal with. That would not be a matter of promoting research which is a kind of generality.  I appreciate the point that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are involved and it is right and proper that they should be.  That is why when the merger takes place I would have thought that provision would have been made for a similar situation of openness and access for the members of the public.  That is a very important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to have this vagueness and generality but as far as the citizen is concerned he would have a right of access on one of the original functions that was vested under the old Industrial Research and Standards Act.  I do not think that means that the powers that the body have under the Industrial Research and Standards Act are being transported to the new agency that will devolve from the merger of the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I have not tabled an amendment on this matter and I do not want to press the matter unduly.  I would be satisfied if the Minister were to put on the record of the House that it is his intention and the Government's intention, and that he will so request the board of this agency, to ensure that every possible facility and co-operation will be given to members of the public when they approach the agency for assistance on matters in the area of science or technology.  The Minister <Col N="2660" /> should make it clear to the House that if such a request is made the citizen will be favourably received and that every possible facility will be given to provide the expertise a person might need in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points which Deputy Taylor makes.  It is certainly not my intention or the intention of the Government to preclude the public in any way from having the best possible information that this new agency will be able to supply to them.  The purpose of section 8 (1) (g) is to promote the application of science and technology to economic and social development.  That is one of the main purposes incorporated in that subsection.  Section 8 (3) (f) proposes to disseminate and promote the dissemination of literature and information relating to science and technology.  I would like to allay any worries that Deputy Taylor or anyone else may have that the public would not get the best possible service.  It is only right to put on the record of the House that I intend to ensure that the agency will co-operate with the public and with companies in every possible way in introducing new technologies and will facilitate them in relation to information on the availability of grants or any other matter that would enhance their development and progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment matters relating to the alleged Government decision to abolish the refund of drugs scheme with effect from 1 January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me this evening as this is a matter of great public importance. I also thank the Minister for being in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this issue is being discussed here tonight is that the Minister for Health revealed a week or so ago that he has identified a total of £11 million in <Col N="2664" /> savings in the community drugs schemes operated by the health boards.  Having done this, the Minister today issued a statement in which he had the neck to deplore the anxiety caused to patients all around the country because we made that information public.  That statement was out after 24 hours of scratching around for a response.  The Taoiseach, the Minister, his Private Secretary and the Government Press Secretary had opportunities in that 24 hour period to defuse anxiety and each was asked to comment in the last 24 hours since I raised this matter in the House yesterday morning. Despite these opportunities they declined to say anything about the matter until the Minister today rather feebly made the statement issued just before the 1.30 news today.</P>
    <P>If anxiety was caused by this news, the source of that anxiety was the decision by the Government to cut 73 per cent off the allocation for these two schemes.  The delay in issuing a statement about the cuts merely compounded the anxiety which was already there.  What makes things worse is that the Minister's statement today, rather than clearing up the situation, merely confirmed the worst fears which we in the Labour Party expressed on this matter in the last 48 hours.  It is now obvious that the Government intend to reduce these schemes to a point where they will provide no assistance to persons in need who are already suffering from the trauma of serious illness.</P>
    <P>Since this issue arose, I established that on 27 October last, the Department of Health wrote to each health board setting out the allocations for 1988 and the letter stated that the allocation notified took account of a proposed restructuring of the community drugs scheme, that details of this restructuring would be notified to the health boards shortly and that in the meantime provision should be made in the health board budgets for a reduction of £x million on these schemes in 1988. That means that health boards have already been instructed to make the cuts. I have verified the impact of this on four <Col N="2665" /> health boards on this very day.  The Eastern Health Board will have spent £6.7 million in 1987 and only £1.5 million will be available in 1988.  The North Eastern Health Board will have spent £1.3 million and next year only £0.5 million will be available.  The South Eastern Health Board will have spent £1.8 million this year and only £0.8 million will be available next year.  The Southern Health Board will have spent £3 million in 1987 and only £1.3 million will be available in 1988.</P>
    <P>The true picture is worse.  There is a two month lag in meeting claims under the refund of drugs scheme.  That means that all the money available to health boards in the first couple of months of next year will be used to pay claims which arise now and which will arise between now and the end of December 1987.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases, as a result of decisions already made and communicated to the health boards, they will have no money available to meet any claims which arise in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain his actions in this regard?  This is a scandalous decision, no matter what kind of picture the Minister tries to put before this House.  We now know that this despicable cut has been in train since October last and that it is only now that the Minister has been forced to come clean on the issue.  The Minister does not deserve to be taken seriously by this House no matter how he tries to extricate himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised the restructuring of the health boards &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, and having made that promise he has now put the health boards in a position in which they will simply have to refuse to pay any claims after Christmas.  The money has not been provided in the 1988 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I question, the restructuring of the schemes.  I worry about the expression &ldquo;restructuring of schemes&rdquo;.  What will it entail?  It is a bureaucratic description of a major detrimental cut in the schemes. The Government have decided that the schemes can provide, in terms of their requirement for cash, rich pickings.  The reason for that is simple.  Obviously, little <Col N="2666" /> if any imagination is required to save money in this way.  It does not need better management as it can be done at the stroke of a pen.  This is the sort of cut that bureaucrats and politicians ruled by bureaucrats like best but unfortunately, cuts like these will always have consequences. This cut of all the cuts we have seen and of all the cuts about which we are warned by the Taoiseach in a speech last Thursday evening at a Fianna Fáil function in Dublin, is probably the cut that will hurt beyond description.  Ordinary people will suffer most.  There is probably no Deputy in this House who would not have encountered people in their constituencies over the last couple of months who are in jobs on very low incomes but in a position where they do not qualify for medical cards.  Many of these people have illnesses in their families and expensive drug requirements. They are feeling the pinch.  There is very little relief available to them from the State agencies and the health boards.  The Minister obviously has a good knowledge of his constituency due to his experience as a medical practitioner.  He is a very solid rural Deputy, if I may say so.  He must know from his experience the number of people who will be affected, people who are trying to carve out a living against enormous pressures on very low incomes.  We are dishing out further harsh treatment and making them suffer even more.</P>
    <P>Under the first of the schemes which are now being threatened non-medical card holders are entitled to claim back expenditure on prescribed drugs in excess of £28 per month.  In recent years up to 25,000 families per annum were able to get some assistance under the scheme. One of the most common examples is that of the family where there are children suffering from asthma.  Unfortunately this is a very prevalent medical condition in this country, perhaps by reason of our climate.  This scheme, ironically, was introduced by the present Taoiseach when Minister for Health and we should not underestimate the invaluable assistance it has provided to families who cannot afford membership of the VHI. <Col N="2667" /> The present threshold of £28 per month has been at that level since 1984.  It would be obscene in terms of the pressures on families throughout Ireland if this scheme were to be abolished, as I detect from the allocations to the health boards it will be.</P>
    <P>The second scheme is designed to cater for nearly 40,000 non-medical card families with members suffering from longterm illnesses.  Under this scheme drugs prescribed to relieve the symptoms of these illnesses are supplied totally free. That is as it should be.  Most Members of this House will have been involved at various stages in dealing with health boards on behalf of such families and will be aware of the pressures and strains built up among them.  We should be doing everything possible and practical to assist these families, particularly in difficult economic times.  I do not want to labour the latter point.</P>
    <P>This scheme was designed very carefully following much consideration by the officials of the Department of Health, in consultation with medical officers of the health boards and practitioners.  Much thought was put into the scheme in order to protect people who are among the most vulnerable in our society.  It is designed specifically to cover a range of conditions which are as follows; mental handicap, mental illness in children, PKU, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. All of these illnesses are of themselves major problems for families which have to cope with them.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to consider the options open to him in the five weeks before the budget of 1988.  We appreciate the tremendous economic pressures on the Government but as a medical practitioner the Minister obviously has first hand knowledge of these conditions and their prevalence.  I put it to him that he should give this House a categorical assurance that no person suffering from any of these conditions will be charged for necessary drugs.  We have heard much about abuses of various schemes but this <Col N="2668" /> is an area where people have genuinely serious medical conditions and have no option but to avail of drugs on a regular and permanent basis.  The Minister must be able with the assistance of his officials and the health board administrators to ensure that these people will continue to benefit from this enlightened scheme.  I find it hard to believe that the Minister would allow a situation to come about where people suffering from the conditions I have outlined would be required to pay for drugs necessary to allow them some basic level of comfort in coping with their problems.</P>
    <P>I am asking for assurances from the Minister on two fronts.  In the first place I am asking for an assurance that no family will have to pay more than £28 per month for drugs.  His statement, rather meekly put at 1.30 p.m. today, was to the effect that I was misleading and alarming people due to my concern in this matter. My concern is a genuine one relating to the problems which people will be facing from 1 January or 1 March.  Obviously money will be available until 1 March. At this stage in my career I can read Estimates as well as anybody and it appears that the money provided for the various health boards will not suffice to ensure the continuation of these schemes.  I should like to be corrected by the Minister, if he is in a position to give the assurances I seek which will have been a good day's work on his part.  I hope the Minister will not treat us to a departmental script telling us about the restructuring of schemes, or that he is seeking cost effectiveness or efficiencies. We are talking about a very serious problem. I believe that unless the Government reverse this decision the consequences will be disastrous.  I am asking, therefore, that this be done.</P>

      <P>In addition I have now provided that the priority categories of farmers to be covered in the arrangements for both the restructuring scheme which I negotiated as part of this year's price package, and the distribution of flexi milk, will include producers affected by animal disease in the years 1978-83.  I consider that these are the best arrangements I can make for this category of producers within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have in recent months been conducting a survey of the radioactivity levels in sheep and lambs grazing on heather in upland areas of the country including Counties Donegal, Sligo and Mayo.  With a view to getting this survey completed as quickly as <Col N="2505" /> possible field staff from my Department were assigned to assist the NEB from an early stage.</P>
    <P>The levels discovered in the course of this survey, which is expected to be completed shortly, have in some instances, for example in upland pockets in Counties Donegal and Sligo and in a small area of North Mayo, been higher than the levels discovered in the meat of sheep and lambs which were grazed or finished off on the lowlands, samples of which have been taken and tested regularly on a countrywide basis for well over a year past.  I can, however, assure the House and the public at large on the basis of the expert advice available to me that the higher levels of radioactivity found in these upland sheep do not pose a threat to the health of the consumer.  These levels drop dramatically when the animals are brought down from the upland to lowland pastures for finishing off before marketing which is the normal procedure adopted by the bulk of upland sheep farmers.  When the survey is completed I will be reviewing the position to see what action, if any, is called for to give any further reassurance to all concerned.</P>

      <P>The scheme for the supply of food from intervention stocks to the most deprived persons in the Community was approved by the Agriculture Council on Thursday last.  The scheme is optional but it is expected that almost all member states will implement it.  The global allocation for the scheme in 1988 is about IR£84 million.  I would have preferred a higher allocation but, unfortunately, this could not be agreed because of the current budget difficulties.  Some member states pressed for a distribution of the <Col N="2506" /> allocation based on population but I insisted on a distribution which took account of the relative position of member states.  I am pleased that the Commission took the latter approach and with only about 1 per cent of the Community's population Ireland will receive IR£2 million which represents 2.5 per cent of the allocation.  If some member states decide not to operate the scheme their allocation will be redistributed.</P>
      <P>Consultations are now taking place between my Department and a number of official and voluntary organisations with a view to implementing the scheme and I am hopeful that the scheme will be in operation early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The licence recently granted to the Town of Monaghan Co-operative under section 32 of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) (Amendment) Act, 1941, should have no effect on prices, costs or the level of service to customers.  The co-operative had already been supplying milk in the Dublin Milk Board area.  The licence merely means that they can now supply the very limited volume of milk involved from their producers resident outside the Dublin area rather than being confined to producers registered with the board as hitherto.  Otherwise the co-op are required to meet the same conditions as other co-operatives and dairies registered with the Dublin board.  Producers within the Dublin or Cork board areas are not prevented from selling their milk in any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>I decided to grant the licence as an interim measure pending the outcome of the negotiations concerning a new national milk arrangement which we are having with the EC Commission.  I am hopeful that these negotiations will be concluded in the near future.</P>

The corresponding figure for 1987 is 9,000.  This reduction will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage, career breaks and the scheme of voluntary redundancy.</P>

      <P>The projected savings on the 1987 Exchequer pay and pensions bill mentioned in Dáil Éireann on 9 December 1987 were identified by Departments in their monthly expenditure returns.  As a result, issues from the Exchequer will be lower than originally estimated.  This reduction is separate from departmental balances carried into 1987 from the end of 1986.  Given that the funds will not be issued from the Exchequer in 1987, the savings will not be available to Departments as balances in 1988.</P>

      <P>Where there is a total loss, an insurance company will pay out to the value of the sum insured; however, if there is under-insurance the policyholder will not recover the full value of the economic loss suffered.</P>
      <P>If a home is insured for less than its full value, most insurance companies apply the principle of average.  This means that any claims will be scaled down by the degree of under-insurance &mdash; so if a home is insured for only half the amount it should be insured for, the insurance company will pay out only half the cost of repairs.  This makes sense because to do otherwise would require the assumption that the loss occurred only in the insured areas of the home.  It is a matter for policyholders to make certain that they have an adequate level of cover in respect of risks insured by them.</P>

    <P>No claims have been made under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 but if the employees consider that they have entitlements under this Act they should make application on the appropriate <Col N="2528" /> claim forms which are available from my Department.</P>
    <P>If the employees concerned obtain favourable decisions from the tribunal in respect of their statutory redundancy claims, they should then request payment of their lump sums from the employer.

The necessary forms are available on request.</P>
    <P>It is matter for the employer in the first instance to pay a minimum notice award determined by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in favour of an employee but if the employer fails to pay, the employee should contact the Conditions of Employment Section of my Department which will take the appropriate action under the Act to secure payment for the employee.  If, however, the employer's failure to pay is because of insolvency, application can be made to my Department for payment from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  Such applications must, in the case of employees of an insolvent company, be submitted to my Department through the liquidator or receiver, as appropriate, of that company.</P>

A final decision by CCETSW on their future involvement in Ireland has not been made and accordingly it is too early to say what legislation, if any, will be introduced here pending the outcome of these discussions.</P>

I note the Deputy's reference to conditions in this school, and have asked my Department's primary buildings branch to investigate the matter.  If it be found that overcrowding is a problem, my Department's professional advisers will make recommendations as to what assistance could be offered to the school in this matter by way of short-term relief.</P>
