      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 8, 15, 16 and 1.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 5.30 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 9 p.m.  It is further proposed that Nos. 7 and 8 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 15 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 2.30 p.m. and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce shall be called on to conclude not later than 2.10 p.m.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 16 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 5 p.m. and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture shall be called on to conclude not later than 4.45 p.m.  It is further proposed that the Second Stage of No. 1 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 9 p.m. and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine shall be called on to conclude the debate not later than 8.40 p.m.  It is further proposed that the Dáil shall meet at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow and shall adjourn not later than 5 p.m. and business shall be confined to Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <P>There are questions on the Order Paper today in respect of that matter.  Question No. 4 relates to it and, from memory, I would say that Questions Nos. 38 and 39 also relate to that subject matter.  In the circumstances, is it fair that they should be dealt with now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that but the Taoiseach agreed some time ago in the House that the Minister for Justice would, at an appropriate time, give the House a full report, that is separately from answering these questions.  It would be appropriate if the Taoiseach could simply indicate to us when that might be.  It does not in any way prejudice the questions that are down for today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disorderly but I cannot see how an indication by the Taoiseach of when the Minister for Justice might give a complete report would in any way interfere with the right of Members of the House to get answers to their questions today.  I am not asking the Taoiseach to say anything about the search; I am simply asking him to say when the Minister will give a report.</P>

      <P>I am aware that Deputies are anxious to have such a report and indeed it has been a matter of concern to me that we have not been able to report yet to the House because I recognise the right of the House to a full report at the earliest possible moment.  The Minister <Col N="1657" /> for Justice is in Copenhagen at present attending a Council meeting but I can give the House an assurance that a full statement will be made before the House adjourns next week for Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to combine, in one body, the functions which have up to now been carried out by two organisations, the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is intended that the new body will be called &ldquo;Eolas &mdash; the Irish Science and Technology Agency&rdquo; and that it will come into being on 1 January 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government consider that this Bill is of major importance.  It reflects, not only, the Government's determination to make the best use of scarce resources and to deploy public funds more effectively, but, also, and most importantly, the Government view that a strong and welldeveloped scientific and technical base, integrated with industry, is essential, if Ireland is to prosper in today's keenly competitive high-technology world.  The bringing together of the IIRS and the NBST is an essential step towards providing <Col N="1662" /> that base.  It will result in a unified support mechanism for science and technology development in industry and services and in the higher education sector.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Estimates provide for a grant-in-aid of £9,777,000 to the agency. This compares with a grant-in-aid, in 1987, of £7,927,000 to the IIRS and a grant-in-aid of £3,349,000 to the NBST, a combined total of £11,276,000.  The saving involved therefore is £1,499,000 and this saving will be achieved through a reduction in staff numbers, a reduction in overhead and administration costs and an increase in own resources generated by the new organistion.</P>
    <P>The Government have also provided for funds for the continuation of the science and technology development programme in 1988 at least at the same level as in 1987 &mdash; £3,100,000.  I will refer in more detail to this programme later; suffice it to say, at this point, that the creation of the programme, at this time of severe budgetary constraints, is evidence of the Government commitment to a positive, and effective, science and technology policy.  The establishment of my own office &mdash; the Office of Science and Technology &mdash; is further evidence of that commitment and the Bill before us today is an integral part of the development of that policy.</P>
    <P>The close relationship between science and technology, and between the two elements together and economic and social development is an accepted fact. The countries which are most advanced in science and technology are the countries which are the wealthiest and have the highest living standards.  It is only logical, therefore, to aspire to take a leading place in this high technology world. To do so, we must have proper national policies and we must have the most effective mechanisms in place for carrying through these policies.  We are now well placed to do so.  At a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in 1984 the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>We must in future listen more to people who can make things happen, who can design new products, plan new processes, research new opportunities, <Col N="1663" /> apply science and technology to new areas of development.  The development-minded section of our scientific and technological community must be brought into the centre of things where the decisions are made and have an input into those decisions.</P>
    <P>Government policy for science and technology can now be described as having the following broad objectives: co-ordinated management of programmes and planning; raising the overall level and quality of science and technology; intensifying the application of modern technologies in indigenous industry; and increasing industrial innovation.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House aims at creating the proper and most effective framework in which these elements can be pursued and worthwhile results can be achieved.  The two organisations being combined are the major State support services for scientific and technological development of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The role and the functions up to now assigned to the IIRS can be summarised as follows: supporting industry through process improvements, testing, analysis and the dissemination of technical information; specifying standards and marks for commodities and processes, and encouraging and monitoring standards; promotion and utilisation of national resources through research and development; and assisting the development and exploitation of inventions which are in the public interest.</P>
    <P>By contrast, the NBST have been concerned with technology development policies, strategies and assessments at a national level.  In particular, they have been involved in developing and co-ordinating national programmes for science and technology and in fostering the emergence of scientific and technological infrastructure attuned to industrial and economic needs.</P>
    <P>The new agency, Eolas, will combine both these sets of functions and will have as its prime objective the development and expansion of industry in particular, <Col N="1664" /> and of economic and social development in general, through science and technology. It will set out to achieve this by undertaking the following precise actions: promoting national investment in science and technology; providing and administering grants for science and technology projects; optimising EC funding for science and technology; co-ordinating science and technology funding between development agencies, third-level institutions and industry; providing a national technical information service; providing technical, consulting and testing services; monitoring industrial research and development projects; and operating the national quality and standards programme. It will undertake these actions under the general direction of the Office of Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>Eolas will be a vital element of our growing technological infrastructure and will exercise a much needed directional and co-ordinating role for State-support services in this area.  A co-ordinated science and technology input is crucial for a successful industrial development policy and should be closely integrated into that policy.  The direct input, by entrepeneurs through in-house research and development, and the indirect input, through the State science and technology infrastructure, are major elements of industrial strategy.  They are just as important as management competence and financial resources.  This fact will be reflected in this Government's approach to industrial development and industrial planning. This approach is being facilitated by bringing together, under one roof, responsibility for advising the Government on science and technology policy, together with responsibility for providing support services for the technical development for Irish manufacturing.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the new Science and Technology Development Programme which was set in train in 1987. This programme followed the Government's commitment in their policy document on science and technology.  An allocation of £3.1 million was made in the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote in 1987 to initiate immediate and <Col N="1665" /> indeed long overdue action in a number of key areas including: biotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology, microelectronics, a re-equipment programme for the IIRS, a technology innovation programme, and a teaching companies programme.</P>
    <P>The common theme running through all the actions funded in this programme is the transfer of new scientific and technical knowledge to Irish industry to enable it to compete and develop new jobs.  These programmes, which will be continued and extended in 1988, are now up and running.  Many of them are under the management of the National Board for Science and Technology or are being carried out with the full co-operation of both the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology.  The new agency, Eolas, will be responsible for the management and execution of these programmes.</P>
    <P>In legislative terms, the Bill is relatively simple.  The mechanism being proposed to effect the merger is as follows. Section 3 of the Bill provides that the name of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will be changed to &ldquo;Eolas &mdash; the Irish Science and Technology Agency&rdquo;.  The Government consider it appropriate that the new agency should have an Irish title and that Eolas is suitable given the nature of the body involved.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the repeal of the National Board for Science and Technology Act, 1977, and for the repeal of certain redundant provisions of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the dissolution of the National Board for Science and Technology and assigns the functions of that board to the new agency, in addition to the functions assigned to it by the Industrial Research and Standards Act of 1961.  The functions are listed in sections 8, 9 and 10.  They are the same as the functions which were specified in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the NBST Act of 1977.  The Government consider that the resultant functions which will now be assigned to the new <Col N="1666" /> agency are suitably worded to enable the agency to fulfil the role expected of it.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it could be argued that there are certain similarities between the functions listed in the 1977 Act and those in the 1961 Act.  This was unavoidable since the stimulation, co-ordination, funding and advisory functions of the NBST were exercisable in respect of areas and activities of national interest where, necessarily, an operational body like IIRS would have operational programmes. But any such similarities in the combined functions will not result in any practical difficulties given that one agency will be responsible.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (6) provides that the Minister may by order assign additional functions to the agency.  This power is considered necessary in the event that it be decided in the future that some further functions might appropriately be performed by the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 43 (5) of the Industrial Research and Standards Act which deals with expenditure by the agency on the development and exploitation of inventions.  The limitation on expenditure, £5,000, is considered no longer appropriate, given the passage of time, and the amendment will give the Minister the power, by order, to set a more suitable limitation.</P>
    <P>I would like to give notice to Deputies at this stage that I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to section 23 of the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment will be to delete from the Bill section 23 (4).  This particular subsection, which provides that &ldquo;the Agency may, at any time, remove any officer or servant of the agency from being its officer or servant&rdquo;, was taken unchanged from the 1977 National Board for Science and Technology Act.  On further consideration, I consider it was inadvertently included here.  While it may have been considered acceptable in 1977, my view is that it is now inappropriate.  I am advised that the question of dismissal of staff members is a question which should be dealt with in the context of a staff member's contract of employment and, I understand, is so dealt with in so far as <Col N="1667" /> the staff of the NBST and the IIRS are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go into the detail of the other provisions of the Bill, which could be regarded as relatively standard provisions.  I might perhaps draw attention to section 27 which provides for the transfer of the staff of the National Board for Science and Technology to the new agency on terms and conditions no less favourable than those they currently enjoy.  It would, I think, be appropriate, at this point, to express the Government's appreciation of the work carried out over the years both by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology.  Both organisations, their respective staffs and board members, have served this country well.  They have performed valuable work right across the scientific spectrum and have laid the basis for the tasks which I hope, will now, be successfully undertaken by the new agency.</P>
    <P>The creation of Eolas &mdash; the amalgamation of the IIRS and the NBST &mdash; and the close co-ordination of their activities with those of the other developmental agencies and the third level institutions will result in a real synergy. The ambition must be to utilise the application of science and technology to create worthwhile new opportunities for industrial activity and long-lasting employment. I might stress that the academic world has a vitally important and practical role to play in realising this ambition. I am confident that the new agency will provide the proper framework for successful implementation of Government policy on science and technology.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say to the House that the idea to amalgamate the IIRS and the NBST is not a totally new one.  The suggestion was discussed a number of times in recent years.  Indeed, Deputy Desmond mentioned during the course of a debate in this House on 28 May last that he viewed this amalgamation as a logical step and that in 1981, when he was a junior Minister at the Department of Finance, he had attempted to bring it <Col N="1668" /> about.  I must also give due credit to the previous Government, and to Deputy John Bruton in particular, who was seriously considering the amalgamation during his term of office as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Indeed, as a step towards this amalgamation, Deputy Bruton, recognising the common bond between the IIRS and the NBST, appointed board members who were common to both boards.</P>
    <P>The Official Report will show that Deputies from the other side of the House made very supportive statements in relation to the amalgamation of State agencies related to industry such as the IIRS and the NBST.  In particular, I refer to remarks of many Opposition Deputies during the course of the debate in this House last May on the Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce. The vast majority of Deputies realise that this proposal is logical.  Indeed, I have no doubt the amalgamation proposed finds almost universal favour with the general public.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by expressing the hope that all parties in the House will support this Bill to amalgamate the IIRS and the NBST as from 1 January 1988.  It is my fervent wish that the body, Eolas, should be in operation at the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I welcome this Bill.  The amalgamation of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology has many positive aspects.  As the Minister of State has just said, this amalgamation was contemplated by successive Governments.  It is a good and promising kind of marriage, if I might be permitted to use that terminology, but I have the gravest reservations about the circumstances in which the match was made and indeed about the whole motivation behind it at present.  We must remember when we first heard of this, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce first made his announcement was during the Dáil summer recess.  That was during the <Col N="1669" /> Rambo days of the Government when there were Ministers going around in all directions seeking to chop down virtually anything that moved.  Fair play to them, they had a number of important victims. One of them was An Foras Forbartha. Who would contend now that that was a well thought-out move?  Another of their victims was the National Social Service Board.  In the House recently, in a rare display of unity, all the Opposition parties, joined together, by way of a decree of this House, to show that that was a foolish move, a major blunder.  There was also another casualty of the period, the Curriculum and Examinations Board and the amalgamation of ACOT and An Foras Talúntais, not a total casualty but, if you like, half slain in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observers outside would have to reach the conclusion that at that time Ministers were involved in some sort of perverse competition as to who would wreak the most destruction within the shortest possible time, if you like, working against the clock.  That was the kind of atmosphere prevailing when this announcement was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the amalgamation of the NBST and the IIRS.  Therefore, the House will understand why I am suspicious about it.  I believe this amalgamation was perceived by the Government primarily as a cost-cutting exercise and that any of the positive elements &mdash; and there were many demonstrated and accepted down the years &mdash; were fortuitous by-products.  This has been borne out by subsequent events. For instance, the Minister of State in his Press briefing on the Bill, listed two Government commitments in relation to this amalgamation: first, to ensure that Government funds are used in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible and second, to establish here a strong and vibrant science and technology base. There is absolutely nothing wrong with either of those objectives.  They are fine and noble, but surely the order in which the Minister of State gave them at that time was wrong.  Surely the emphasis should have been first on establishing a strong and vibrant science and technology <Col N="1670" /> base?</P>
    <P>All of this clearly indicates that the main concern of the Government, even in this vital expanding area &mdash; its great potential having been just outlined by the Minister in his remarks &mdash; was for cutbacks and not the harnessing of this great potential about which we have just heard.  If we pursue that argument into the practical arena we find that the same obtains because whatever policy one adopts it is often only as good as the resources deployed in its implementation. The Government have cut the grant-in-aid for the combined agencies &mdash; as the Minister of State has just said &mdash; by a total of £1.499 million for 1988.</P>
    <P>Surely if the Government believe in their fine words and aspirations about science and technology there was a case for utilising the savings being effected in many of the hard-pressed areas within this service?  Even if it were used in this fashion, savings have to be made, but the savings made in this way could still be described as conforming to one of the major objectives outlined by the Minister of State using the money in a cost efficient manner.  This is an area of enormous potential and of vital importance for the future wellbeing of the country in the creation of industrial wealth and jobs.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to argue for a new departure when the first thing one sees is a cut in the budget with none of the savings being put back directly into this area, even in very hard economic times. There has been a serious run down in the provision of resources, especially in regard to scientific equipment for the IIRS.  We must keep our facilities and equipment up to date in a fast-changing area.  Now the combined agencies have considerably less money than they had last year, despite inflation and despite other factors.</P>
    <P>These are my reservations, but despite them I welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  There is little to be faulted in the structure of the Bill.  I am glad to see that the Minister of State has alerted his officials to the rather draconian measure already proposed in section 23 (4).</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of activity in science and <Col N="1671" /> technology is vitally important if a small country such as Ireland is to reap the greatest possible benefit from investment in this field.  Because of the very nature of our economy, our investment has to be limited by comparison with the great economies and the world leaders in this respect, Whatever the attitude of certain people, we still need the big multinationals, more now than ever.  If we do not have a strong science and technology base, those industries we are seeking to attract here will relate more readily to countries that have.</P>
    <P>If this amalgamation is handled properly by the Minister of State, his Department, the new board and the chief executive, it can be very important in portraying Ireland's image abroad as a serious, developed economy and nation. It has real potential for providing a planning and co-ordination focus for science and technology in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The National Board for Science and Technology was the State-sponsored body responsible for the overall development and co-ordination of science and technology in Ireland, and that is the board which is technically to disappear. The change will have the effect of bringing the National Board for Science and Technology element closer to what could be described as the operational coalface of interaction with industry, and this is extremely valuable.  In the context of the amalgamation, we must make sure to emphasise the role now exercised by the NBST and its relevance, as there is always a danger that it could become subservient to or swallowed up by the much larger IIRS operation.  The new agency must be careful to ensure that this does not happen, that there is no eclipse of the functions now carried out by the NBST There has to be a proper balance in all of this.  We must be able to transfer the work of the universities, the institutions and the researchers on to industry.  That is what it is all about.  But if we go overboard on this we could neglect the whole area of seed ideas to our long term detriment. We must not lose sight of our ability to generate new ideas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> Small countries such as ours spend large sums of money on basic research, but by comparison with the larger economies this can be only minuscule.  We must accept that we cannot compete with the larger economies in regard to the kind of investment we put into science and technology.  What we do here must be extremely well directed.  The main concentration should be in areas that can be applied to our own indigenous industries and bio-technology is one of the obvious examples and one of great potential.</P>
    <P>In this respect perhaps the Minister of State would tell us what role he envisages for the new body in the area of food.  This is now totally with the Department of Agriculture and Food and with the new agency they have there.  There is the possibility of petty jealousies between the Departments which sometimes inhibit overall development.  AFT have done a very good job of basic research on primary products up as far as the farm gate, but supplying technological skill to the food industry is a very different matter. Perhaps the Minister of State could say if all of that area of activity is to be confined within the Department of Agriculture and Food or if the new agency will have a role to play.</P>
    <P>The initial success or otherwise of this whole operation will depend on getting the right man or woman for the job of chief executive, whether coming from within the existing operation or recruited from outside.  The chief executive will need to be a person who can command the confidence and respect of all branches of science and technology.  Bringing together the IIRS, the NBST, the various universities and institutions and the various downstream activities will be a major task and a key factor over the initial period.  I would like some clarification as to the role and powers of the Minister and the Minister for Finance in this appointment.  The Minister of State said in his press release that section 50 provides for the appointment of the chief executive of the board with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  That is not my reading of the section.  It says that the board of the <Col N="1673" /> agency shall appoint a person to be chief executive of the agency under a contract of service on such terms and conditions as may be agreed by the board with the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>That would indicate that what has to be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance is not the appointment but the terms of contract agreed to by the board.  I would like clarification on that because if it is the appointment and not the terms of contract, what on earth is the Minister for Finance doing there? The Minister of State might also tell us his intentions as to the length of contract. I elaborate on this because it is vitally important to get the right person there. It is of great importance to the Minister, the incoming board and to the whole future of science and technology in the initial period when this formative work is going on.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister's views on staffing the agency.  I suppose with cost saving, the first thing involved is redundancy.  I would like to know how many of the staff of the NBST are under the age of 30.  I believe that there are very few people, indeed, with scientific and technological qualifications in these two institutions at the moment.  There is a need to allow the new boy access to the market place, a need to recruit young people.  Otherwise in this very quickly changing area how can it become what we are asking it to be, the cutting edge at the coal face?  The agency should have access to the market place notwithstanding that, presumably, one of the first tasks will be consideration of the question of redundancy and this has been outlined in the Minister of State's introductory statement.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear that Minister on his policy for keeping the very best of our graduates at home.  I am not asking him single-handed to try to stem the flow of emigration.  As he knows himself, at present many of the very best of our graduates, even before they finish their final examinations are recruited by foreign industries and lured away.  Having put so much investment into the whole <Col N="1674" /> area of science and technology &mdash; although there should be more investment here &mdash; and having put so much investment, also, into the education of these people, the board should apply themselves to devising some schemes or incentives to try to keep these people at home.</P>
    <P>With many of these young people, as we all know, it is not so much a question of the money factor but of the opportunities to apply their skills and knowledge. Very often this has more to do with whether people go abroad or stay at home than has the question of money. Industry has a major role to play and it has not been sufficiently imaginative in the use to which the best and brightest students in the scientific and technological area are put.  The board should get down to creating a policy in this area, which could be done without enormous cost and with close liaison with industry. A plan is necessary so that we can attract the very brightest to remain in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the new body take a special interest in the work of the Standards Authority.  Everyone will accept that a great job has been done here in the whole area of standards.  However, preparation and promulgation and everything to do with standards are very expensive and, apparently, the recovery of money is not very good.  It is important in these difficult times of stringency when the Government are looking for cuts in all areas that they should resist the temptation to curtail funds for this part of the operation.  Quality assurance and industrial standards are vital elements in our industrial programme.  Quality underpinning of our goods is the key area as far as our ability to sell abroad is concerned. I hope there will be no downgrading in that respect.</P>
    <P>Without attempting to digress into what would be a Committee Stage debate, I shall deal with a number of more detailed items in general.  Section 8 (3) gives a whole list of activities.  The function related to invention and patents is very useful, indeed, since inventors will not usually have the skill or awareness <Col N="1675" /> necessary to register and protect their inventions.  Most of the research universities in the United States, as the Minister of State will know, have an office specifically devoted to this function.  Our universities are not large enough and cannot be expected to have such a facility.  It makes very good sense for this agency to provide such a service to university inventors and to inventors generally. That is dealt with in a general way in section 8 (3) (m).  One could recommend to Eolas that these matters and the related issue of intellectual property rights should be looked at as a priority.</P>
    <P>The protection of the profits arising from studies made in Ireland so that the rights to such profits remain in Ireland is important.  Areas such as biochemistry, for instance, are capable of producing products and processes which have a colossal earning potential.  I have visited a number of third level institutions and have been filled in in my research work into this area of science and technology and am staggered at the potential in some of these areas but, of course, that potential must be protected.  We must ascertain that the development of the biotechnology centres of excellence at UCC, in NIHE, Dublin and UCG will be successful. The protection of the product arising from the work of these centres is of significance and that is something to which the board should apply themselves vigorously.</P>
    <P>It is still assumed by most people, very frequently anyhow, that the scientist, technologist, or inventor has a commercially successful product when it performs a new task more cost effectively or using a new innovatory approach, but the recent history of what has happened with British scientists and technologists is full of examples where marvellous inventions made in Britain have fallen subsequently to the United States, Japan and other economies to exploit commercially.  We must learn from this history.  It must be emphasised to the new agency that however superb inventions may be, scientifically or otherwise, they are only of value when exploited commercially and <Col N="1676" /> quickly with the minimum of fuss and the minimum of bureaucratic procedure.  The agency has the scope for this work under the provisions in section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The reference to industrial and commercial designing is also quite important. The added value of products of many kinds is critically related to design.  This is of particular importance in microelectronic and computer equipment design.  This is an aspect of the work which I commend to the agency.  There is also the question of so many national and international schemes available for the support of research and many will find it quite a horrendous challenge &mdash; to use the favourite words of Deputy Power &mdash; to keep up to date with even the titles of these schemes.  There is no way in which one can have time to even sift through them.  The information gathering and dissemination role of the agency which is also provided for must be emphasised. So much literature is produced by bodies such as the European Commission that going through them is a job for a full time researcher within an industry.  The agency's role must be encouraged here and specific attention given to devising an efficient and effective means by which this information is conveyed to active researchers.  It is very complex and I make this plea that there should be no new newsletter.  There is a proliferation of such already.  Why not use new technologies because all these people have micro-computers and terminals?  The new scientific equipment should be used for the transmission of information in this area in particular.</P>
    <P>I am rather intrigued at the title which has been given, of Eolas.  I have nothing against the Irish word; I am assuming that it is the Irish for knowledge and that it is not another combination of initials which somebody has worked out in some abstruse fashion.  I am glad to see a little imagination in this respect.  However, I wonder if it is an appropriate title for an agency where the emphasis is on discovering, finding out, breaking new frontiers, seeking out knowledge.  Eolas, or knowledge, means the result or condition of knowing.  That would be a great name <Col N="1677" /> for some agency involving grey-bearded scholars pouring over medieval manuscripts, perhaps for the Irish Manuscript Commission, before the Government have got rid of that body as well.  Does it not suggest a certain smugness or complacency, that the agency knows it all already &mdash; an agency which is supposed to be there for research and for pushing the parameters abroad?  My objections to this Bill do not go all that deep.  I just question whether it is the appropriate title for it.  At least, it is a nice sounding name.  As I say, my objections are not all that deep and not deep rooted enough to precipitate an election before the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the new agency taking on a vigorous developmental role in respect of the central issue which is help for indigenous industries and the application of technology in small and medium sized firms.  This is a crucial issue and what is just as important and which should not be neglected is basic research. I would also like to see the agency taking on a vigorous role in mobilising the third level institutions and their resources for effective implementation of a regionally based science and technology policy.  We must concentrate on the development of technology parts and the regional advantages which can flow from that.  It needs a motivated set-up to get down to a long term, relatively flexible development plan, doing what we are good at and making maximum use of human capital.</P>
    <P>Science and technology is not an end in itself, the end of all of this is economic development, the creation of new wealth and the creation of new jobs.  What we do must be directly relevant to Irish industry.  We must play to our strengths and develop technology not otherwise available in the marketplace.  The amalgamation of the NBST and the IIRS into one body to be known as Eolas presents us with an opportunity to co-ordinate our activity in science and technology and bring in a new focus on this.  I was glad to see the Government set up a new section within the Department to be headed by the Minister of State to deal with this matter.  I wish the new board <Col N="1678" /> well whenever it is set up, as I anticipate it will be on the time schedule asked for by the Minister of State, and I also wish the Minister of State well on his first and happily, as far as we are concerned, noncontroversial Bill in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At short notice I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate on a Bill which proposes to amalgamate the functions carried out by the NBST and the IIRS into one new agency to be known as Eolas.  At the outset I would like to say that I do not have any of the hang ups which Deputy Nealon seems to have about the name of the new agency.  It is a perfectly valid name and, as he said, its translation is &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; and it is appropriate that the name should reflect knowledge in the proposed new agency.  The important issue is what will the functions of the agency be and we should address ourselves to that.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Nealon I welcome the principle behind the Bill which ostensibly sets out to eliminate the duplication of services provided by agencies in the public sector and to create a more efficient structure through the amalgamation of compatible agencies.  The only reservation I have about the proposed amalgamation is that the two existing agencies may not be totally compatible.  As I say I have some reservations which I will outline in greater detail later on.  On a general basis, the Progressive Democrats are committed to this type of reform and there are many instances of waste and duplication of services which one could draw attention to. For example, in the industrial sector which is the sector to which this Bill is appropriate there are a multiplicity of agencies which an industrialist may have to consult with before he ultimately decides to go ahead with a project.  Anything which can be done to lessen that and to provide a more integrated and rational service is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the industrial sector, as I have said, there are many State bodies which one may have to consult with before getting a project off the ground or before <Col N="1679" /> expanding or maintaining a particular industry in operation.  Examples include agencies such as the IDA, CTT, Fóir Teoranta, ICC, the IIRS, NBST, An Foras Forbartha, the Department of Industry and Commerce, and indeed local authorities.  Therefore, there is a long list of agencies who operate in this sector and if we can draw together the functions they perform and have fewer agencies it will be beneficial all around.</P>
    <P>Apart from making the task of the end user of these services easier and thereby enhancing the prospects of providing a better service to industry there could be significant financial savings by having fewer agencies providing a better, more comprehensive, rationalised and fully integrated service.  There is a great need to reduce the number of such agencies and to co-ordinate their functions in order to minimise the present degree of duplication.  This process might best begin with the Government Departments as they often seem to be unaware of each other's relevance.  They perceive themselves as being separate administrations instead of being integral parts of the one system.  At worst some of them have atrophied and become inert while others go about solving many of the same problems in different ways.  Consequently, it is necessary to integrate many of the functions in vital areas of the economy such as the inter-relationship between industry and agriculture, between education and industry and between labour and social welfare.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there could be resistance to bringing about these changes because of the conflicting administrative interests of various Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies but it is the function of Government to override these objections and make the necessary changes.  I assure the Minister that any Bill which comes before this House which has those objectives in mind will have the full support of my party, the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The cause of these problems is not always found within the public service. Governments in the past have readily <Col N="1680" /> expanded and developed services in the industrial and social sectors with little regard for the cost of administering them quite apart from the problems of funding the services themselves.  Services within the public sector should be made more cost-effective and there will have to be an ongoing radical examination of the functions of the various Departments and State agencies.  If we do not do that there will be a continuation of the situation where many schemes and services which are subsidised by the State have failed to achieve the desired results.  One spectacular example of this is the bovine TB and tubercullosis eradication scheme which has continued for over 30 years while not improving the situation in regard to that problem.  One could also ask questions in regard to job creation in that various employment schemes have been cynically expanded during the past several years at a heavy cost to the taxpayer without any real improvement in the level of unemployment being brought about.</P>
    <P>It is against that background of waste and duplication that I welcome, as I said at the outset, the principle behind this Bill.  However, in any merger there must be rationalisation.  We do not want to abolish or merge agencies just on the basis that it saves money as that would not be adequate.  Other factors have to be taken into consideration.  I am thinking of agencies like the National Social Service Board and the Office of the Ombudsman who provide independent and very valuable services to society and it is not appropriate to axe them or reduce their effectiveness on the basis of saving money alone.  The approach to merging agencies or integrating the services they provide should be done on a rational basis as distinct from just using the blunt instrument of trying to save money.</P>
    <P>One has to ask whether the combining of the functions of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology are truly compatible and whether it might have been more appropriate to look at other agencies in the science and <Col N="1681" /> technology area such as An Foras Forbartha and see whether some of the functions they carried out would be more compatible with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards rather than the NBST.  I understand that when An Foras Forbartha are abolished some of the functions they carry out, particularly in the area of monitoring and control of environmental pollution &mdash; and we had a lot of that last summer when the rivers in Ireland were subjected to very heavy pollution &mdash; will be taken over by the local authorities.  It will be regrettable if that happens because the local authorities are one of the biggest polluters in this country and often times they have been found responsible for an awful lot of damage to fish life.  It is inappropriate to have the monitoring of pollution in the control of the actual polluters themselves. The Minister should consider attaching to this new agency the responsibility for monitoring pollution and establishing pollution controls.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to make to the Minister.  I understand that in the Department there is a section which deals with biotechnology programmes and has an allocation to it of something in the order of £2 million.  I am curious why that section should exist in the Department now that there is a new science and technology agency.  It appears it would be much more appropriate if they were attached to it.  The Minister might enlighten me on that in the course of his reply.</P>
    <P>The National Board for Science and Technology is a developmental organisation serving many sectors of science and technology in Ireland.  On the other hand, the IIRS are a laboratory-based operational agency whose main job is to provide technical services direct to industry. The IIRS compete with other agencies for research and development contracts from industry, the Government and the EC.  The agencies which the IIRS are in competition with have up to now availed of the services of the NBST.  One of the difficulties which the proposed merger gives rise to is whether other <Col N="1682" /> agencies in the science and technology sector can accept that the new institute, the Irish science and technology agency, Eolas will operate on an impartial basis.  It appears the dominant role in this new agency is going to be that of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards as the NBST are being abolished and their services are just being tagged onto the services provided by the IIRS.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the role played by the NBST, as Deputy Nealon has said, is not reduced in any way in the new organisation and that the wide range of participants in programmes operated by the NBST see the new organisation as a truly independent, non-competing agency.  It is important that the Minister ensures that the NBST will continue to be seen in the role of an honest broker as distinct from a competitor.  This is one of the problems I see with the proposed merger and it has to be addressed.  It is important that the new agency carry forward the same kind of developmental function with respect to the national science and technology requirements of the nineties as the NBST did in the seventies and eighties.</P>
    <P>The merger will mean that the new agency has two basic functions and, as I said before, these are not necessarily compatible.  On the one hand the work formerly undertaken by the NBST with their medium to long-term perspectives must be continued while, at the same time, the agency will have to respond to the urgent short-term needs and demands of industry for technical service support. While the new agency will have to develop and expand their fee earning services, they will also have to ensure that industrial and other research development contracts are channelled to the nation's most appropriate and competent institutions and organisations and do not just come to the new agency by virtue of the fact that the IIRS now play a dominant role in the organisation.  That is a very important point.  In particular, the new agency must ensure that the linkage between higher education and industry is maintained and is not going to be <Col N="1683" /> inhibited by the technical consultancy service the new agency have available to them.</P>
    <P>We welcome the principle of the Bill and, subject to the provisos I mentioned, we will support it on Second Stage.  The creation of this new agency poses a challenge which is to ensure that the new body will be more dynamic and cost effective than the sum of its constituent parts. The organisation and management structures will need to be carefully designed to ensure the smooth and successful integration into the new body of the functions currently exercised by the two existing agencies.  It is more appropriate that those aspects of the Bill should be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party but to do so with reservations.  There are a number of concerns arising out of this new legislation I would like to raise with the Minister.</P>
      <P>While the Labour Party are not opposed to the merger of the NBST and the IIRS under the new proposed body, no such merger has taken place yet.  The arrangements proposed under the new body undermine much of the thrust of the NBST's work and treats the IIRS workers inequitably.  The Minister in his speech dealt somewhat with some points I want to raise and which I will develop later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has assured several interested parties that there is no question of one agency taking over the other one.  However, one cannot but think that a process of submersion has occurred with the NBST being specifically dissolved in the legislation.  It is unacceptable that the NBST be dissolved and their functions grafted onto the larger body of the IIRS.  That is effectively what is occurring.  A more equitable and effective solution would have been to dissolve both bodies and create a new agency from the merger of the two bodies.  There is a precedent for this approach in the Labour Services Bill relating to AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service.  This line of <Col N="1684" /> action could more effectively have been pursued.  This is not just an academic point.  The NBST were established to pursue public interest and economic and social development type goals.  This type of activity would include, for example, the analysis and co-ordination of the overall science and technology system and its impact on education, industry, agriculture, employment, the environment, etc.  They were not established to earn fees from individual firms in the private sector.  That is not their role.</P>
    <P>The Act establishing the NBST was based on a coherent, well thought out strategic approach to the research and application of technology in Ireland.  It was based on a OECD examinationreview which combined Irish needs with international experience.  This is quite a contrast with the arrangements with which we are dealing today.  The Labour Party may be seeking amendments to the Bill to ensure that the submersion of one body does not take place.  To further ensure that the NBST activities which are not geared towards earning fees are insulated from the fee-earning activities of the IIRS we will also be seeking that the non-application of the fee-earning provisions of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, to the NBST type activities be explicitly stated in this Bill. This would be reinforced if a statutory basis was given to the designation of a specific budget, under a separate subhead &mdash; development &mdash; that is non-fee earning activities in budgeted expenditures for the new body.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are concerned that employment conditions and the public interest are not adequately protected. That occurs in a number of areas.  Unlike the 1961 Act establishing the IIRS, there is no provision in the Bill before us that appointments to the staff of the new body be made by public competition.  That would be detrimental to the public interest and open to abuse or, at least, the suspicion of abuse.  That is especially so when one considers the provisions for the employment of consultants on a short term contract.  Unlike the Act setting up the IIRS there is a new provision providing for the dismissal of staff.  Dismissal <Col N="1685" /> of staff from the IIRS is covered under the conditions of service which all staff members accept when taking up employment. Such a blanket provision in the Bill would be a clear alteration in the terms of employment of the existing staff of the IIRS.  I welcome the Minister's statement of his intention to remove that section from the Bill.</P>
    <P>For some time considerable effort has gone into developing sub-board participative structures in the IIRS.  In fact, since 1980 a joint participation council made up of management nominees and elected staff members has been operating. The original Worker Participation Act, 1977, and subsequent extensions, have not covered the IIRS despite efforts by the IIRS staff to secure worker participation at board level.  This is an excellent opportunity to establish democracy in the new body by providing for worker participation on the board and building on the experience gained by the workers in the IIRS and the NBST.</P>
    <P>The Government party have a policy position in the area of science and technology which is second to none.  That may sound a strange admission by an Opposition Deputy but it is true.  I have been interested in that area for a long time and I can say that the policy position of Fianna Fáil has been A1.  I see the measure before us as a putting into effect of their policy position.  Much more needs to be done and there is a great opportunity for the new Minister to put his party's policy into practice.  There is no point in having excellent policies on shelves, they must be put into practice.  While I have reservations about some aspects of the Bill I appeal to the Minister to look at them and try to reach agreement with us on the measure.  It represents a step in the right direction.  It will mean that the public sector will create the climate and the private sector create the wealth and the jobs, the type of mixture that should emerge.  I hope the Minister gives positive consideration to the minor changes I have suggested so that all sides can agree to the adoption of the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members I <Col N="1686" /> welcome the Bill.  It is one that can be welcomed without any reservation.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to state a single reason why two such compatible organisations such as the National Board for Science and Technology and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards should not be merged as one. Science, with its essentially theoretical framework, and technology which is the application of the fundamental principles of science are so inter-dependent that the dovetailing of those two eminently successful bodies had a certain timescaled inevitability inherent in them from their separate establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of science and technology in the shaping of our country's destiny is of paramount importance.  The re-shaping of our economy, and all that that entails and means in fiscal, sociological and the applied economics sense, demands that we should look at each and every board, body and committee that exists under the aegis of the State.  We must do this with the twin aims of cost effectiveness and the progressive elimination of duplicated functions.  Even in the case of bodies like the NBST and the IIRS we have to apply the principles of rationalisation. This does not imply that either body is unsound, unworthy or ineffectual.  In this case it means that we are fortunate to have within the compass of the State two bodies that have such qualities and aims in common that their dovetailing virtually cries out for implementation.  Both bodies are staffed by persons foremost in their professional disciplines by way of academic standing and experience at the highest level in their fields of competence. That is why it is so pleasing that this merger will not disrupt the careers of these people nor the very important work they have been engaged in, in their respective bodies up to this time.  Retirement and voluntary redundancy will ensure that the personnel aspects of this merger will be accomplished in a most amicable way.  It will be the task of the new board to ensure that the absorption of all staff into the new framework will be facilitated in <Col N="1687" /> every way and that whatever mechanisms or practices are required to ensure this will be readily available.  It is imperative that no irritants in the field of personnel administration should break the cycle of applied research and project work currently in train.</P>
    <P>The importance of this merger is best exemplified by reference to the fact that research and development in Ireland is at the lowest level in the European Community. It has been pointed out before and it is no harm to reiterate that those countries which have invested heavily in education and in research and development are world leaders.  They are not in all cases major economies as smaller countries have also won for their citizens the benefits of research and development. We, as a small nation, competing in world markets need a sharp competitive edge.  Look for example at Denmark and Norway.  Those two countries invest twice the amount per head of population that we do here in Ireland.  The significance of this merger must be weighed against telling facts like this.</P>
    <P>Historically we can point to the fact that we are a small economy that until recent years had a predominant dependence on agriculture.  On the credit side we can point to a not inconsiderable growth and to the restructuring of the economy which has taken place.  We can point to the healthy balance of trade figures and to the part played by the new technology in achieving this trade surplus. We must then look into the role played by the two bodies which are the subject of this Bill and acknowledge their respective significant contribution to our success.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this revamping of the organisation is that more and more we must seek to establish a secure autonomous indigenous technological base.  We have the population structure, such as none of our European neighbours have, and we have superb technological faculties in our third level institutions.  When this Bill comes into effect in January 1988 we will have a focal centre for science and technology with <Col N="1688" /> the capacity for research and innovation that is essential if we are to drive forward and get into a self-perpetuating growth model.  All around this country there are people with ideas for manufacturing and service enterprises.  In most cases they never emerge from the cocoon of thought because these people say that there is too much hassle attached to the development of bright ideas.  Might I suggest to the Minister that he give some consideration to the setting up of a voluntary corps of scientific or technological advisers who would be available in each parish, village, town or community to deal with ideas people on a friendly informal level. I have no doubt that this would be a fertile field for enterprise very much in keeping with the agency's role in the development and exploitation of inventions. A few years ago when the new technology or information technology as we know it today was first introduced here we saw a rush of external investment, principally from the USA and Japan.  It was said at that time that the technological revolution would in a short few years pale into insignificance compared with the biotechnological revolution which was even then on its way. The impact of biotechnology has not occurred on this scale.  It is a realm of science and technology which has great potential.  It is a field of scientific technological development in which a small nation like ours could play a major role.</P>
    <P>Even in recent days we have heard how, through the application of biomass technology, we could satisfy 10 per cent of our energy needs by the year 2000 AD. Our dependence on external sources for our energy requirements has been a major contributor to the economic ills we have experienced.  Attention to alternative energy sources is imperative and when one considers the easily grown crops that are entirely suitable to our soil and climate and are very suitable for biomass conversion, we would be very remiss if we did not have a concentrated programme to exploit the energy potential of timber, grass, sugar beet, kale, etc. To be successful we must have a singleminded approach.  We must vest the programme <Col N="1689" /> in a single central source.  We must finance this programme generously. This is where the combined effects of Eolas, the science and technology agency, and the science budget will produce optimum action.  It is not only in the area of biomass that biotechnology has applications of immeasurable value which would benefit the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Scientists have come to recognise that living organisms can produce valuable substances such as food, fuel and medicines. By applying analytical scientific methods to the processes whereby living cells manufacture these substances man has been able to revolutionise traditional industries like food processing and fermentation. The importance of this approach to a country like ours hardly needs to be stressed.  The value of applied research and development in this field is without limit.  While other nations with their immense wealth can afford the luxury of satellite programmes our aims must be more modest.  We can, however, be world leaders and world beaters in areas like biotechnology and this form of exploitation should be a primary and preferential aim of the new board.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that under the terms of this Bill, the agency will promote the application of Science and Technology to the development and improvement of industrial and commercial design.  This is most important.  We have, as a nation, often been guilty of producing goods for either home or foreign consumption which were shoddy in their design.  Good design is not merely a matter of aesthetics.  A good product should combine both aesthetic and technological excellence in its design.  To achieve the required standard of excellence in this field is not just a matter of good taste.  It is a matter of survival in the harsh competitive climate of world markets. Anything the agency can do in this regard will repay us handsomely in regard to competitiveness and the rewards that flow from it.</P>
    <P>We all tend to associate technology with hardware like machines, computers, etc.  Technology also includes processing <Col N="1690" /> of every kind including chemical and food processing.  We are the clean, green tip of Europe, an island with a climate that is temperate and a soil that is the cleanest in any developed nation.  We can grow the finest food and rear the best of beef. What we do not do enough of is use these excellent natural products to establish a food processing network to harness and exploit the fruits of our land and our seas.  This is an application of a highly specialised technology.  This is science applied in the most exciting and rewarding way.  This is a road we must go down and, if we fail to do so, we will have lost the greatest God-given advantage that this country enjoys.  That is why we must support Eolas in every way so that science and technology are translated into national wealth and secure employment.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we read the good news of the IDA announcing up to 5,000 new jobs in the food industry.  A glance down the list of where these jobs are expected to be will reveal that, through the application of science and technology into our natural resources, one must see some hope for the future.  In passing let me mention my constituency and the great resources we have in vegetables and grain which we grow there and the fish we catch along the coast.  I hope that, in the not too distant future, the IDA or some private investment will come into the north county to maximise the resources there. I would like to see some Larry Goodman arrive for the fish industry in particular. In the past two years in Skerries port and Loughshinney the catch of prawns and white fish has had a major impact.  If the right investment is put in place linked with technology applied to that, we can only go from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>We are talking about food and the Government have already shown their commitment this year to applying science to the food industry in announcing the establishment of the food centre in Dunsinea which Deputy Nealon mentioned this morning.  I hope the food section in the IIRS will be linked in some way with that and that we do not have more duplication there.</P>
    <P>I never think of science without being <Col N="1691" /> mindful of the imbalance in the teaching of science that places girls at such a disadvantage. I would like the agency to take this problem into account in their function under section 8 (1) (i), that is &ldquo;to promote appreciation of the value of science and technology&rdquo;.  The promotion of gender equality in the teaching of science and technology in our post-primary schools will not alone be advantageous for the principle of gender equality but for science and technology as well.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the functions and areas of expertise which the IIRS and the NBST have developed respectively in a special way, it would be appropriate that a corporate skills audit from which a Manpower skills audit might be derived should be made a priority task of Eolas. This would ensure that no valuable function was lost or reduced in impact and that all the skills and experience of the total staff would be a matter of record to ensure cost effective utilisation of staff as they come to be deployed in the new agency.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we tend to become preoccupied with ideas on a grand scale and so miss out on opportunities of lesser scale but yet of great value.  Let me give an example.  I would contend that there are millions of pounds worth of waste materials buried in the local authority tip-heads throughout the country. These are imported commodities which in their time reflected negatively in our balance of trade figures.  These materials could have been recovered or recycled and returned to the productive cycle.  The processing and re-cycling of waste materials is a primary focus for science and technology.  It does not smack of grandeur but it has the hard-nosed practicality that our country badly needs at this time.</P>
    <P>The merger of the IIRS and the NBST in the manner outlined in this Bill is not the only step taken by this Government in the furtherance of science and technology. The Taoiseach has long been a champion of matters scientific and technological and this interest is demonstrated in the most concrete and <Col N="1692" /> effective way by the appointment of Deputy Seán McCarthy as the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology.  The Minister has, in turn, demonstrated his constructive approach to his Ministerial brief by the provision of £2.5 million to augument the science budget for 1987.  This additional funding to cover areas like biotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology, technology transfer, and R and D goes some way to respond to the needs in these areas as expressed by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  The Bill now before the House has also won the approval of the CII.  The confederation spokesperson on industrial policy, Dr. Aidan O'Boyle, has stressed the importance of the new body, Eolas, in the retention of a strategic commitment to the development of excellence in science and technology in third level institutions and in the fostering of university-industry cooperation as an effective enabling mechanism for developing and commercialising new products.</P>
    <P>The council of the Confederation of Irish Industry and all related interest groups should feel assured on this point as this Bill is a positive signal of the Government's intent to promote science and technology in a most practical and cost effective manner with the objective of expanding the economy and creating employment for our young and educated workforce in technological home-based enterprises.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brian Brown of the NBST, in his statement as chairman prefacing the board's concluding statement, has welcomed the establishment of the ministerial office for science and technology and expresses the view that science and technology should have a strong interface across all sections in Government.  I agree fully with this sentiment and that is why I feel so positivley towards this Bill.</P>
    <P>Eolas, the Irish Science and Technology Agency, will, through the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, be able to mediate all influences and findings and services right across the total spectrum of industry, commerce, education and the <Col N="1693" /> international arena as well.  It deserves the fullest support of this House both in inauguration and fulfilment.</P>
    <P>It was pleasing this morning to hear various speakers from the other parties giving their support to the Government and the Minister on this Bill.  I recommend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. D. Fitzpatrick Dr. D. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. Reading the Minister's speech I noticed there were no references to the manpower implications of Eolas.  I am speaking of the effects of the research and development element in the Eolas board. We all know that the effects of the IDA grants over the years have been, in many cases, to reduce employment prospects rather than increase them.  I know we cannot stop research and development and I do not want to speak as a Luddite, or to give this impression, but when Eolas are organised, when they bring the third level institutions, manufacturing companies and the agricultural sector together, and before they start funding research and development, they should ask what effect these programmes will have on employment prospects.  Will they enhance them or decrease them?</P>
      <P>We grew up in an era where factories received grants and carried out research and development programmes, the effect of which was to put people out of work. I have seen this in my own area recently where a State board gave a grant to a company.  It increased manufacturing capacity, but it put more than 70 people, mainly people supporting families, out of work.  I repeat, when Eolas get going, I hope this will not happen.</P>
      <P>I recommend the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it to our attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who expressed their support for this Bill.  I will try to allay any doubt they may have by explaining the Bill in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commenced my Second Stage speech by outlining the Bill's purposes and the effect of the provisions put forward in it. I outlined what this Bill purports to do <Col N="1694" /> and I would like to commence my reply to the debate by saying quite clearly what the Bill does not purport to do.  This Bill does not submerge the policy role of the National Board for Science and Technology. It grafts it on to a new organisation which has many inherent strengths.  This Bill will not result in any involuntary redundancies.  This Bill will not result in any enforced transfer of functions or personnel in the science and technology area either to the Department of Industry and Commerce or to any other Government Department.  This Bill will not lead to any reduction in the level of scientific and technical activity in the country, rather the opposite.  I am very concerned that the staff of the two organisations concerned are reassured on these points.  Indeed, the provisions of Part IV of the Bill bear out what I have said.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to answer the specific points made by Deputies &mdash; for which I thank them &mdash; I would like to stress some of the other positive developments in the scientific and technological field which are very much part of the drive towards cohesion which is taking place in this area.</P>
    <P>I did, in the course of my opening speech, refer, rather briefly to the establishment, this year, of the science and technology development fund and to the provision of £3.1 million in respect of it. The establishment of the fund is a good indication of the thrust of Government policy on science and technology &mdash; of which this Bill is an integral part &mdash; and of the Government view that there is a need for focused investment in key areas of science and technology.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline for the House some of the ways in which the science and technology fund moneys have been used.  The national biotechnology programme was established in June this year. The programme has as its objectives: to encourage research activity in Ireland by both home based and overseas companies in order to develop the biotechnology industry in Ireland; and to establish a significant reputation for Irish biotechnology research and thus help attract overseas companies to locate in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> These objectives will be achieved by establishing, equipping and staffing centres of biotechnology research expertise in the universities.  These centres are being developed around research topics in which there is existing Irish expertise, and which are of relevance to Irish industry. Three such centres were nominated in 1987, in University College Galway, University College Cork and the NIHE, Dublin.  I propose to expand the programme in 1988 to encompass other university activities.</P>
    <P>An advanced manufacturing technology programme has also been established under the fund to help industry cope with the rapid advances in manufacturing technology.  Four advanced manufacturing technology applied research units have been established in colleges of higher education &mdash; Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, NIHE, Limerick and University College Galway.  The programme aims to direct the high calibre engineering skills in these centres towards meeting the needs of industry.  Specifically the research units will provide research and development support to industry involved in both the use and provision of advanced manufacturing technology. Each of the four units is involved in complementary aspects of advanced manufacturing technology.</P>
    <P>Other programmes which have, or are being developed, are the teaching companies programme, which subsidises the placement of highly qualified graduates in science and engineering fields in Irish industries; and the south-east region pilot programme in technology development, which seeks to co-ordinate the representatives of all the State technology and development agencies and the higher education-research institutes in the south-east region with a view to developing an integrated technology based plan for the development of the region.</P>
    <P>Moneys are also being expended under the fund for the replacement and upgrading of equipment in the new agency.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some other aspects of the functions of the new <Col N="1696" /> agency.  As I mentioned earlier, one of its key roles will be in the co-ordination of State efforts in the development of the science and technology area.  As Deputies are aware, there are a number of smaller agencies involved in the area, for example, the Software Centre, the NMRC, the Innovation Centre and the Microelectronics Applications Centre. The work of these bodies is tied in a general way with the work the new agency will be undertaking and I will be expecting the new agency to advise me, in consultation with these bodies, on the most effective way in which all their efforts can be co-ordinated in order to achieve the most beneficial results.</P>
    <P>With regard to specific points made by a number of Deputies, for which I am grateful, Deputy Nealon suggested that when we announced the merger of these two bodies, we had our priorities wrong, that our first concern should be to strengthen science and technological development and that we should use moneys in a more cost-effective manner.  In June last year, I introduced our new science and technological development programme and I then looked at the question of rationalisation.  We did not put the cart before the horse, we took things in proper rotation and the programme we established earlier this year is indicative of that.</P>
    <P>Deputies Nealon, O'Malley and Stagg were concerned about the possibility that the NBST would be submerged in the new amalgamation.  I assure them that there is no question of the NBST being swallowed by the IIRS or <i>vice versa</i>.  It can be seen from section 8 of the Bill that Eolas are being given all the legislative functions which had been carried out by the NBST and the key functions will be fully maintained by the new agency, in particular the honest broker role which the NBST have played very effectively for years.  The higher education industrial linkage fostered by them will be maintained and there will be no conflict between the fee earning activities and the science and technological developments. There is no inherent reason for such a conflict to arise and the management and <Col N="1697" /> structure of the new agency will be so designed as to ensure that none will occur.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon was also concerned about the chief executive of the new agency.  I will clarify the position for him. The appointment of the chief executive will be a matter for the board of the agency.  Section 15 of the Bill clearly provides for the appointment of the chief executive by the board under a contract of service on terms and conditions agreed by the Minister and the Minister for Finance. The Minister and the Minister for Finance will have nothing to do with the appointment of the chief executive, the board will decide that but the Ministers will be concerned with the contract and the terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon also expressed concern about keeping graduates in the country. I realise that it is a very important and vital objective to keep highly intelligent and highly educated young people here. Unfortunately, the position is that many have had to emigrate and one of our objectives in developing our science and technological programme is to try to ensure that jobs will be provided in this country.  That is our ultimate objective. Under the teaching companies programme, 30 graduates have been placed in industry and 20 graduates are employed in the new advance manufacturing technology programme.  There are also 18 graduates employed in the biotechnology programme.  These are all new vital measures and I will ensure that Eolas gives very close consideration to increasing employment of graduates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon mentioned the relationship between this agency and the food industry.  It is intended that the existing food activity of the IIRS will be transferred to the new amalgamated AFT-ACOT. Within this new agency, a national food technology centre will be established which will bring together the necessary State support services for food from the farm gate to the supermarket shelf.  This new agency for the development of science will have an interest in the application of science and technology in all areas and we intend to ensure that <Col N="1698" /> there will be co-operation, collaboration and cohesion between our agency and the Departments of Food, Horticulture, the Marine and Forestry, so that there will be high technology in every developmental area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon also expressed the very correct view that we should fully exploit inventions and patents to ensure that they are used to full commercial effect.  These objectives will be very high on our list of priorities and we are keenly aware of the need to commercialise results of research.  I hope, by using the extra funds given to this area, to provide the release mechanism to channel the results of all the scientific knowledge stored in our higher educational institutes towards future economic development.  A major objective of our agency will be to exploit all our scientific potential in relation to inventions or patents to their full commercial usage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon was concerned about the name of the agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Eolas is the name the Government wish to give the new agency.  It is based, as the Deputy said, on the Irish for &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;; the Government consider it the most appropriate name and I hope it will become well known.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pat O'Malley wondered why the programme for science and technology was under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The position is that the funding is provided within the Department's Vote.  However, the administration and implementation of the programmes will be done by Eolas. The staff of the NBST and the IIRS are already involved in this and arrangements are in train to relocate the national biotechnology programme at the headquarters of the IIRS which will be the headquarters of Eolas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley queried, as a result of the abolition of An Foras Forbartha, whether the new agency would take over some of their functions.  Certainly the agency will be available to undertake <Col N="1699" /> work which was previously carried out by An Foras Forbartha in relation to building defects, construction quality and energy matters.  The work will be carried out on a full cost recovery basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon was concerned about the number of staff under 30 years of age in professional and technical grades.  The figures supplied to me show that there are two such people in the NBST and that in the IIRS, there are eight professional staff, 25 technicians and 55 clerical staff under that age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure is eight. Deputy Stagg asked when the board of the agency will be appointed and who will be on the board.  Professor Wrixon will be the chairman of Eolas and the Government have not yet made any further appointments.  It is likely that these appointments will be made following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  A board of not more than nine members will be permissible under legislation.  The provisions of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, will apply to the board and the procedures of the board.  Representation of staff on the board of the agency is not excluded under legislation but neither is it specifically provided for and this is appropriate.</P>

    <P>Deputy Stagg was concerned about the IIRS taking over the NBST.  I have already dealt with that matter.  The Deputy wondered why the provision <Col N="1700" /> regarding recruitment by public competition was not included in the Science and Technology Bill, 1987, as it was included in section 34 (1) of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961.  The reason is that while this provision was considered desirable in 1961 it is not considered appropriate for the agency in 1987.  There is no corresponding provision in the recent IDA and FÁS Acts. It is considered that flexible recruitment policies are necessary to attract high calibre science and technology experts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wright suggested the concept of introducing more technologies into companies.  That is something we will have to strive more for.  Indigenous industry needs to upgrade its technology and we will have to use every means at our disposal to try to ensure this because it is vital that there is research and development so that new products can be produced. He suggested the setting up of a voluntary corps of scientists in local areas.  Obviously we have taken the first step towards that viewpoint in designating the south eastern region as a pilot area for the introduction of new technologies. I would like to see science and technology growing from the grass roots up.  It is not something that should be imposed from the top downwards.  It is very important that in all areas of the country we should try to combine the expertise and the knowledge available so that they can be used to the best advantage. That is what I have done on an initial basis in the south eastern region. We have brought all the various State agencies, the third level colleges and industry together to see if we can undertake a cohesive programme and we hope to extend that all over the country in due course.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to putting science to work.  Ireland must harness science to the task of creating economic growth. We must have more Irish manufacturers involved in research and development, either in-house or by contracting out the work to centres of excellence in our research institutes and colleges of higher education.  We must commit the same <Col N="1701" /> level of resources, to technology as other small countries do and we must seek out niches to suit Irish talents and resources. We must exploit scientific progress to create new and improved products.</P>
    <P>The creation of the new agency, Eolas, is a major step forward.  I am confident that Eolas will be a key agent in the identification of neglected opportunities, consolidation of talent and direction of our scientific and technological resources into the creation of a prosperous economy. Higher priority for science and technology will better equip our industries to adapt to the change which is essential to their survival.  Even more important, it will create new sources of wealth and will lay the foundation for a high technology, high income economy. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Abattoirs Bill, 1987    [Seanad]:    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The main aim of the Bill is to meet the need for a comprehensive and uniform set of standards in a national sense for meat slaughtered for the home market.  With the increased awareness of consumers, existing legislation needed to be updated and this Bill will go a long way in doing that.  Some criticism has been expressed by those involved in the meat business that the conditions of abattoirs slaughtering for the home market are of a much lower standard than those which operate for the export market.  I understand that a survey of 854 local <Col N="1702" /> abattoirs which was conducted by the Department of Agriculture in 1982 indicated that while high standards applied to many premises some of them were found to be old and in some cases insanitary. They were difficult to keep clean and it was noted that they fell far short of the standards necessary for any food premises.</P>
      <P>Local abattoirs are supervised by veterinary inspectors employed by the local sanitary authorities.  One major problem is that outside of the main cities veterinary inspectors are employed on a part time basis only.  Out of 160 employees, only 24 are full time veterinary inspectors and these 24 are concentrated in only nine local authority areas.  Contrast this with the situation in the export trade. Factories involved in the export trade have modern equipment and they operate under the full time supervision of officers from the Department of Agriculture and Food with an approximate staff of 250, including 64 veterinary officers.  They also have a back up of part time veterinary staff around the country. The cost of this supervision is met from the fees on each animal slaughtered and the factories have to comply with stringent EC, Third World and national requirements relating to premises, equipment, hygiene and slaughtering standards. This Bill will not make local abattoirs into export factories but some areas, in particular the hygiene area, will mirror the controls applicable to the export factory.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the licensing of factories by the Department of Agriculture and Food and veterinary control of the premises, including all slaughterings, is to vested in the 27 county councils and the five borough corporations. After an initial period, licensing could be returned to the local authorities if it is found desirable to do so and enforcement of the new veterinary controls can continue at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major local authorities will be required to employ sufficient veterinary officers to ensure that the standards are being implemented.  Ante-mortem and post-mortem veterinary inspections will <Col N="1703" /> be carried out by veterinary inspectors and, therefore, all meat for human consumption will be stamped.  This will become the quality mark for meat.  It will give an assurance to people that the meat is of the highest standard, prepared under strict hygiene conditions.</P>
    <P>In order that no undue hardship is brought to bear on existing slaughterhouse owners the Bill provides for a transition period of five years.  A permit system will come into operation for a specific time to allow owners to bring their premises to the required standard. The permit will have the same validity as a licence, including fees, and will indicate the improvements required.  A permit will not be given where it is considered that a premises is incapable of being brought up to the required standard.  The permit will apply only to those currently operating in premises which are capable of being brought up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>The veterinary inspector is empowered to direct in writing the closure of any premises or part of a premises, or to stop slaughtering where there is a public health risk arising from activities on the premises, or from the manner in which slaughtering is being conducted.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with knackeries. These will be inspected regularly. Section 22 of the Bill imposes an absolute prohibition on the sale of meat from a knackery for human consumption.  This is welcome.  Occasionally in the past, meat of doubtful origin was available on the market for human consumption and this gave rise to complaints and to action being taken by certain local authorities.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 to 46 deal with the payment of veterinary fees for inspection, which are payable on each animal slaughtered at an abattoir.  These fees are the same as those which apply in export meat plants and they will be payable by the licence holder to the local authority.  The licence fees that will be paid are expected to amount to £40,000 annually and this should cover licensing costs.  The veterinary inspection fees paid to the local <Col N="1704" /> authority are expected to amount of £1.4 million and this money will be used by the local authorities to fund the employment of staff necessary to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>At the moment the penalty for failure to license an abattoir or for violation of slaughtering by-laws is no more than £5 under the Town Improvement Clauses Act, 1847.  The by-laws will be abolished under section 62 of this Bill.  Because of the low level of fine it was often profitable for owners of abattoirs to ignore the law and continue trading.  Section 56 of this Bill imposes high penalties, a maximum of £1,000 or six months in prison or both on summary conviction, and £10,000 or three years in prison, or both on indictment. This will certainly be a deterrent to would-be offenders.  The Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935, governs the humane treatment of animals being slaughtered and the licensing of slaughterhouses.  This Act is operated by the sanitary authorities and its provisions are equally applicable to the meat export trade.</P>
    <P>Section 47 amends the 1935 Act by providing for the transfer of its administration to the major local authorities in tandem with a similar transfer under this Bill and it provides for fines under the Act, increased from £5 to £500.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  It is long over due and it will have a major impact on the operation of meat plants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I appreciate the Minister's acknowledgement. Everybody agrees that this is a welcome Bill.  As we are an agricultural country very much involved in the meat business, it is essential that we maintain the highest standards possible in relation <Col N="1705" /> to the production, slaughtering, transport and marketing of this product.  It is timely that this Bill should be before the House now for a variety of reasons.  The public are much more conscious nowadays about the need for a high standard of hygiene in the slaughtering of animals. People are concerned, and what was permissible and acceptable 30 years ago is no longer acceptable.</P>
      <P>If one had looked at a television programme during the summer one would have perceived one of the very real reasons for the introduction of this legislation at this time.  In that programme people saw the kind of things that can happen, although legislation was already available whereby measures could be taken to ensure that high standards would prevail and would be seen to prevail. Notwithstanding all that, there were obviously areas where for one reason or another it was not possible to enforce the usual high standards and, as a result, unscrupulous people took advantage of that situation for their own selfish ends. Their activities as portrayed in that programme could do nothing to enhance our image as a meat producing country which applies high standards of hygiene. Neither could it help the peace of mind of consumers here or of possible customers abroad.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the small family butcher who has given the Irish consumer a great service through the years.  The consumer is usually on personal terms with the person from whom the meat is purchased.  The average housewife knows her family butcher very well and if she is not satisfied she will quickly make her feelings known to him. Family butchers have always striven to achieve very high standards and it is to their credit that they have achieved that degree of rapport with their customers.  I believe they will continue to give a great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the different standards applicable to slaughterhouses providing meat for the home market and those supplying the export market.  It is not really true that the home consumer has been getting second best. <Col N="1706" /> It is just that in many cases, and for obvious reasons, greater emphasis has been placed on the export market and probably this has been to the detriment of the home consumer.  In order to ensure the highest possible volume of exports of the highest standard, second place was probably given to the home market in a number of areas, for instance, in the standards laid down and the availability of funding.</P>
    <P>IDA grant-aid and FEOGA grant-aid is not available to the same extent to the individual who processes solely for the home market.  This can have very serious effects on the ability of those people to provide themselves with the right environment to process a product to the standards now required.  For instance, in relation to the disposal of offal or waste from a slaughterhouse, no grant-aid whatever is available if the plant caters only for the home market, despite the fact that its counterpart catering for the export market can have ready access to considerable amounts of grant aid.  One of the downstream effects of this disparity is that there is not the same pressure to compete.  Since the person catering for the home market was aware that he would not qualify for grant aid the impression was created that a lesser standard would do for the home market.  That is quite wrong and quite misleading.  The same standards must be applied everywhere. The problem was that the person running the small slaughterhouse had to become involved in heavy expenditure in order to meet the standards obtaining in the slaughterhouses catering for the export market.  I know it can be said that a person who sets up in business should be expected to provide all the ancillary facilities at his own expense.  I accept that point but it must be admitted that the exporter has a decided advantage.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider opening up the financial avenues to those catering for the home industry.  If we are to apply standards which we all accept are necessary we should also understand and accept that the people who are to be asked to meet those standards should have access on an equal basis to the <Col N="1707" /> finances available to others.  I accept that a great deal of extra expenditure will probably be entailed even within the ambit of this Bill in bringing up many premises to the standards required.  We must not continue to treat the small slaughterhouse owner or processor in a fashion which is not helpful to the home industry.  The Minister might consider making finance available to fund the provision of offal disposal facilities, sewerage facilities, etc.  This is very important from the point of view of local authorities who often have recourse to legal action in these cases.  If we set standards they should apply universally and the same financial aids should be available across the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to introduce strict controls in relation to knackeries.  The television programme to which I referred gave a very valuable insight into what goes on in some of those places.  It is important to ensure that there is no possibility of dead or worn-out animals being conveyed to illegal slaughterhouses or knackeries.  I do not want to give knackeries a bad name but the activities going on in some of these places, as outlined in the television programme, would certainly tend to create a very bad impression.  We must be absolutely certain that, in no way, can any animal such as the kind ordinarily sent to a knackery find its way onto the domestic food market.  Obviously the regulations obtaining heretofore were not sufficiently rigid to ensure that some very odd things did not happen.  That was borne out also in the course of that food programme.  In times of financial stringency people are inclined to go for what appears to be a good deal.  But, from what we have observed, anything like a good deal emanating from those places was eroded by the health risks involved.  Even a superficial inspection of the slaughtering arrangements would be a sufficient warning to anybody to keep well away from such places.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the quality mark which is very important although it may <Col N="1708" /> be difficult enough to enforce.  I think it was Deputy J. O'Keeffe who inquired whether it would be possible to apply a quality mark to each chop or steak.  Of course, that is not possible.  Once a slaughterhouse has been adapted to meet the high standards now required it should be possible to follow the product along the line through all its retail outlets. When there is any breach in the compliance with those standards, under the provisions of this Bill the relevant licence may be withdrawn.  That stricture should extend to the retail outlets as well.  The provisions of the Bill do not ensure that that would be the case in the sense in which I should like to see it obtain.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of the Bill are to be successful then there must be a rigid check kept on the animal from the time of slaughter &mdash; obviously it will have been examined and deemed to be fit for slaughter anyway &mdash; through the transport process right to the retailer.  Any housewife or consumer should be able to rest assured that the product they buy from a butcher represents part of an animal slaughtered under the highest possible standards and that the quality mark applies.  They should be able to rest assured that any meat product sold at that retail outlet meets the standards laid down under that quality mark.  The success or failure of the provisions of this Bill will be dependent on the ability to follow up any breach of those standards right along the line.  If a difficulty or complaint arises following the purchase of meat at a retail outlet it should be possible to check right along the line to establish where the relevant animal had been slaughtered, whether that was done in compliance with the regulations.  It will be seen that the quality mark will be of immense importance, provided that it applies to the slaughterhouse and all other outlets after slaughtering.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the transportation of meat and meat products modern technology has led to the production of efficient freezer units readily adaptable to the transportation of fresh meat products even in extreme weather conditions. <Col N="1709" /> However, occasionally one observes methods or systems of transport that scarcely meet the relevant requirements. There can be the highest possible standards applicable at the slaughterhouse, at the retail outlets but, if the link in the chain between is not as good, the whole purpose of the provisions of the Bill is defeated.  I would ask that particular attention be devoted to the transport of meat and meat products, ensuring that the same high standards apply in the course of transport.</P>
    <P>The employment or involvement of veterinary inspectors is covered under the terms of the Bill also.  They are at present involved in export outlets.  I hope their involvement will not become administratively burdensome at a later stage.  It constitutes an essential element of the Bill, ensuring that the highest possible standards are maintained, in turn assuring the consumer that the same standards prevail at the relevant slaughterhouses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to issue permits prior to the adaptation of the various premises.  That will afford any operator of a slaughterhouse sufficient time to modernise his premises, allowing for a smooth transition from the present to the new system.  During the five year period within which owners of slaughterhouses will have to bring their premises up to the required standard there will be an obvious need for extra funding.  There is no question of looking for handouts or anything like that.  Rather it is a question of giving the slaughterhouses involved the same rights as those involved in the export market, thereby ensuring that the Irish consumer can be certain that investment in the application of high standards of production and hygiene apply equally to the sources of their products as to those for export.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind high technology and its relevance to the food industry it will be readily appreciated that very small outlets can now generate a considerable volume of business in offal and downstream meat products.  Quite rightly that was the subject of some unfavourable comment in the media in the not too <Col N="1710" /> distant past.  In this respect the manufacture, processing and handling of such products are important, as is a rigid inspection of what goes into them.  It is most important that people be sure that the product they buy has not been contaminated in any way, that it has been subjected to the usually acceptable high standards of hygiene and production techniques so that they need have no health fears.  However, I can recall a newspaper headline I read during the summer which suggested that people would be shocked if they knew some of the products utilised by way of animal by-products.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will be responsible for implementing this legislation. That element of the proposal has negative and positive elements, the positive elements being that the local authorities know their country well so that they should be able to pinpoint, in a short space of time, all the slaughterhouses and knackeries within their administrative area and build up a relationship with the people involved over a number of years, thereby making it easier to monitor what happens in these places.  On the negative side, I have to say that most of the legislation passed in this House which the local authorities have to implement usually has a sting in the tail; what appears to be a system intended to finance the local authority falls down after a few years, and the local authority finds itself implementing legislation that has nothing to do with it, and eventually grinding to a halt as a result of a plethora of legislation over which is has no control but has an obligation to implement and enforce. There are about 300 Acts local authorities have to implement in most cases with no recompense from the Exchequer. We all know the condition of the finances of most of our local authorities at present &mdash; I am not making a political point, I am stating a fact &mdash; and this position will not improve unless we do something about it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the use of the quality mark and the need to ensure that the same high standards apply right through from preslaughtering, through slaughtering, and <Col N="1711" /> on to the retail outlet.  There is EC legislation on product liability which eventually will affect us all and that is another reason for rigidly applying the quality mark.</P>
    <P>Section 13 as amended in the Seanad allows a representative to continue to operate for a period of two months or to the end of the year in the event of the death of the licence holder.  That section might well be amended further, because the two-month period may not be sufficient to allow for the various administrative requirements to be met.  It might be possible to extend the period.  If the death of the principal occurred in February or March the licence would run to the end of the year but if it occurred in October there would only be two months grace to ensure that the licence was in order, that the premises met the standards required, etc.  Therefore, it would be no harm if the Minister looked at that area again to see if it covers all eventualities.  I am not so sure it does. It is a bit ambiguous; it could give an advantage in some cases and in other cases no advantage at all.</P>
    <P>Relevant to the whole field of animal health is the question of knackeries and the disposal of offal.  Animal health certainly did not feature very high in the priorities of some of the establishments shown on that famous television programme. The Bill will have a major impact in this area.  Heretofore it was probably felt it was not necessary to apply very high standards in knackeries and maybe it was not but there are serious implications from the point of view of animal health and disease eradication. We have all heard stories about animals' ears disappearing, and we all know the reasons.  In this area stricter regulations and stricter supervision could do a great deal to enhance the cause of animal health and disease eradication and that is made possible by this Bill.  Standards of hygiene in the transportation of meat etc. is covered by the food hygiene regulations but I would still like to underscore the point I made earlier in relation to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> The last point I want to make is that it seems to have become acceptable to transport animal offal, and some very distressing types of offal, in open trucks around the country.  Perhaps things may change with the introduction of this legislation but this practice causes a great deal of disturbance and annoyance in many of the towns and villages through which these trucks travel.  It is not at all uncommon when driving in one's motor car to be assailed by the most offensive odour, and one might find that the vehicle had passed through the village or town maybe half an hour or more before that.  That may be all right in winter time but in summer time it can be extremely offensive. This should be dealt with.  I understood that all such offal was supposed to be transported in covered vehicles.  I understood that regulations made a few years ago would ensure that that took place, but it is not taking place, and the degree of offence created is aggravated in some cases by the blatant manner in which operators repeat offences with impunity.  I would like to see more attention being given to this matter because there is no necessity for it in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that where an abattoir is considered by an authorised officer to pose a serious threat to public health he may, in writing, require its immediate closure and require that the slaughter of animals or the preparation of meat therein cease forthwith pending resolution of the offending matter.  That will solve many of the problems.  First, it will give the public an assurance that if standards are not being complied with and regulations are not being implemented in a slaughterhouse, the State has a right to move in, and quickly.  Secondly, the public &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; will know that repeated violations of the regulations will not be to the advantage of the operator and this is important, acceptable and welcome.</P>
    <P>In relation to the presence of residues and contaminants, here also is an area where home consumers as well as foreign consumers will know that the means of <Col N="1713" /> inspection and supervision are available to them which will ensure that the products arriving on their tables are absolutely free of contaminants or residues of any description.  There should be no excuse for any violation of that sort nowadays. There is plenty of information available to everybody showing that a violation will result in action.  It is only reasonable that we should set a very high standard at home as well as for the export market. Anything less than that would be an insult to our people.  That important element in the Bill will have far reaching consequences and will do a great deal to enhance the whole meat industry.</P>
    <P>People often refer to regulations as impediments to an industry.  They are also a very important element of reassurance to the consumer who ultimately is the supporter of any industry.  That being the case, any action taken to ensure that the consumer is assured at all times of the quality of the product must mean the continued production, sale and market outlets for the finished product, which is important.</P>
    <P>I know other speakers are anxious to become involved in the debate.  Perhaps the Minister might give me the chance to have a personal chat with him in relation to some of the other items which might need some modification.  We may bring in some amendments &mdash; I am not sure of that &mdash; subject to discussion with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy, also, to welcome this legislation.  It is long overdue. Back in 1981-82 I was a member of a very strong lobby here in Dublin to get something done about the state of our abattoirs.  Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, set up a hygiene committee specifically to examine such questions as the conditions of our abattoirs in response to the work of a fine organisation of people deeply concerned about the lack of hygiene.  As Members of the House know, once this Bill has been passed abattoir owners whose standards are not what they should be will have five years to bring their abattoirs up to the proper standard.  This is too long a time, <Col N="1714" /> but I understand that, because of the size of the works needed to be performed in some of these slaughterhouses, to put a limit of less than five years might put the owners out of business.  Weighing against that is the health of the community.  It is something which the Minister should examine on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Many of our Dublin abattoirs have been in an appalling condition.  Down in the Liberties, much spoken about, an abattoir was built with a view to killing perhaps 50 or 60 animals a week but it was processing over 600 animals a week. It had not accommodation for such numbers and, as the laws were and are ridiculous in relation to fines, the owner faced the possibility of a ridiculously low fine of £5, these laws having been passed in the last century.  Such people could afford to break the law every day of the week.</P>
      <P>We are living in a modern age and I often wonder how many more vegetarians there might have been by now if people had realised the condition of some of the meat they bought, and it was not necessarily because of the state of the animals.  Many of these carcases were dragged through premises which were overcrowded, catering for far too many animals, with carcases lying in all sort of filth, faeces and urine, and there were grave difficulties for the veterinarians examining under these conditions.  The Chief Veterinarian of Dublin Corporation had a large input into advising on the changes which are contained in this Bill and Ministers of a former Government as well as of the present one also had an input here.  This legislation is the result of a combination of work done by a series of Governments.  We are not claiming credit for bringing in this Bill.  It is the result of many years' work and very careful study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the regulations will be enforced on the cowboy operators to whom the Minister referred on Second Stage, who give the trade a very bad name.  There are reputable butchers in Dublin and throughout the country but there are also, as in any profession, disreputable <Col N="1715" /> ones and we must protect the consumers from them.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns has been in relation to the transport of carcases.  It is all very well having cattle slaughtered under hygienic conditions in abattoirs which measure up to the expected standards, but these must not be transported in below standard transport, in dirty containers. I am glad the Department of Health are working at the moment on updating the provisions of the food hygiene regulations in relation to the transport of meat and the aim is to twin those updated regulations with the commencement of this Bill's controls on abattoirs. One without the other is no good. We must have the two operating together.</P>
    <P>It is shocking to find that at the moment only 70 per cent of abattoirs are licensed. The Minister, the local authorities and also the courts must take a very hard line where breaches of hygiene regulations are found, particularly in contravention of this Bill when it becomes law.  The courts should be setting the headlines by hitting offenders with the maximum fines, not the minimum.  The new and very welcome fines are from £5 up to £500 and from £100 up to £1,000.  However, if only a £10 or £20 fine is imposed by the local district justice, that will not have any effect.  It must be shown straight off that the health of our people is paramount. People are entitled to know that the meat which they are buying at a very high price is fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>It is important that the size of a slaughterhouse should be measured to the number of animals killed there.  I believe the legislation includes the provision that there should be only so many animals at one time in a slaughtering area.  Once the warehouse is full, slaughtering must be brought to a standstill until such time as it is cleared out and the carcases loaded into containers.  There must be a flow. There cannot be allowed, as is happening at present, a collection of carcases awaiting loading while more animals are being slaughtered with literally nowhere to store the carcases.  The meat is thus in <Col N="1716" /> great danger of being contaminated.  It is all very well for the veterinary inspector to approve the animals and put a stamp of health on them but, after the animals have been slaughtered, they must not be left lying in filthy conditions.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm if from time to time people looked inside the trucks which carry meat to their local butcher's shop.  If they do that and consider that the container is not clean they should tell their butcher that they are not going to buy meat from him again.  That is the best advice I can give people.  People get the standards they demand and if they do not demand better standards they will not get them.  They should remember that some meat is contaminated.  The animal is not contaminated when it is brought to the abattoir but because of the conditions at the abattoir it may become contaminated or it may even be in good condition until the time it is loaded on to a dirty container. This is a matter which affects us all.  We do not eat that much meat in this country but those of us who do expect it to be of a very high standard.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Durkan in relation to the carriage of offal to various places where it is disposed of or turned into dog food or cat food is very important. The windscreen of my car was hit by a set of lungs falling off the back of one of these big containers.  It is very important that containers used for this purpose are properly covered and washed down.  Even the very sight of the offal is offensive.</P>
    <P>There should be something in the legislation which would prevent a person who loses his licence because of a breach of the new hygiene laws from having his licence renewed.  At some stage, possibly after an offence has been repeated, the courts will have to say no to those who will not pay any attention to the new laws.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 to 46 of the Bill deal with the payment of veterinary inspection fees.  These will be payable for each animal slaughtered at the following rates per head: cattle, £3.25; pigs, 75p and sheep. 55p.  It is very important that the numbers be properly monitored.  Again, <Col N="1717" /> unscrupulous abattoir owners might try to slip in a few extra cattle, sheep or pigs in order to lower the cost of the veterinary inspection.  This service should be self financing and in the interests of the public it is important that we do not hear the complaint that there are not enough vets because we do not have the funds to pay them.  The fees collected for the inspection of slaughtered animals should cover their salaries.  The Minister should constantly monitor these fees and they should rise in accordance with increases in salaries.  We need to make sure that the local authorities do not claim that they cannot examine abattoirs because they are not able to afford to take on extra veterinarians or because veterinarians are not available.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this is a very good Bill and I will be following its progress with interest on Committee Stage.  I do not want to delay its passage through the House any more than anyone else does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This is one of the most important Bills to have come before us since I entered this House last Spring.  It relates to the agricultural industry, one of our major industries.  It is amazing that although one needs a licence before one can export meat no such licence is necessary to sell meat on the home market.  The consumer has always had the impression that the attitude was that anything would do for the home market whereas only top quality would do for the export market.  What we export should be top quality but, likewise, what we sell on the home market should be of equal quality.  For that reason alone I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, who undertook the survey, which was published by our present spokesman, Deputy O'Keeffe, and who published the heads of the Bill.  I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, for bringing the Bill before the House.  I hope it will be brought into law some time during this session.  That would be a very welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> The last thing we should do in discussing this Bill is to give the impression that the manner in which we handle meat products is not of a high standard.  That is not true.  Just because a place is not licensed does not mean that it is not up to licensing standards.  The local health inspectors pay regular visits to slaughterhouses and abattoirs in order to ensure that they are complying with the hygiene regulations as laid down by the local authorities. This ensures that a certain standard is maintained.  These people would not be qualified to examine a carcase to see if it was in a healthy condition but the veterinary inspectors will ensure that what the consumer buys from their butcher or in the supermarket, be it beef or pork, is of top quality.</P>
    <P>Our competitors in the agricultural area regularly try to run us down.  The recent announcement of an outbreak of a disease in turkeys in County Monaghan was both wrong and unjustified and it caused much annoyance and harm to the industry in my constituency of CavanMonaghan, where it is a major industry. The allegation was unfounded.  We need to be very careful of what we put into print on what happened there.  It is not unusual for fowl or for animals to have a chill but that does not mean that once they are over that chill, they are unfit for human consumption.  There was an announcement last night in regard to hormones which are being injected into a large number of cattle.  I would like to say that it is not a farmer who is involved in this but a commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>Farmers are very discerning and they are very careful in what they do.  They have families and are well aware of the consequences and dangers of such abuse. There are cowboys in every business and in every walk of life and every effort must be made to put them out of business.  If this Bill helps to stop the small number of cowboy operators who are in the slaughtering business, I am all for it.</P>
    <P>Most butchers' shops are family run businesses and the people who run them have pride in the job they do.  The yardstick I would use are the butchers in my own area who take pride in their shops <Col N="1719" /> and the manner in which they present their meat.  I have visited some of their abattoirs and I have absolutely no doubt that they also take pride in the manner in which those premises are kept.  However, there are some people who take shortcuts and make do with any type of premises. Those are the people we should and will, go after.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to say the least that licensed premises had to pay veterinary fees and the unlicensed premises did not.  In County Monaghan, which is part of my constituency, this partly led to the closing down of a long established family business by the name of Samuel Grahams. There was competition in that area from an unlicensed pork butcher who slaughtered up to 3,000 pigs per week with a net saving of £300,000 per annum.  That is the type of money that is involved. That family business could not compete with that.  That was not the only reason that business closed down but it was one of the reasons.  I hope that the Minister, after listening to me and other Deputies from my constituency who have spoken on this matter, will make an effort to have that business revived.  It was a well established family business with a great name in the export and home market. All of the grant-aiding that took place in this country did not go to improving premises.  It is common knowledge that an amount of that money filtered its way out to increase the price of pigs over and above their value or what could be paid by the factories that slaughtered them so that they would get a reasonable return. Unfortunately the Samuel Graham firm in Monaghan tried to follow that market and they suffered the consequences. Wiser people knew they could not pay that sort of money.  They reduced their slaughterings and they have survived.</P>
    <P>The announcement made last night by the IDA that there is going to be closer scrutiny of grants paid is to be welcomed. I would like to put it on the record that I am totally opposed to the sponsoring of multiples to take over the industry. Putting the industry in the hands of a few people will not be in the best interests of <Col N="1720" /> the industry.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Goodman group were seen to be making every effort to take over many bacon factories.  Putting that business into the hands of one or two groups like that who would have a controlling interest will have an adverse effect on the price of cattle and pigs in the years to come.  I am amazed that the farm organisations have not been louder in their disapproval of this development because it does not serve the industry. This is apart from the matters with which the Bill deals.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with licensing and tidying up the law.  It also deals with the problem of knackeries to which dead or worn-out animals are brought.  There are a number of questions to be raised about the activities of those who are involved in that.  I believe that in some ways this could contribute to the spread of disease. We must be very diligent about the operation of these premises.  It is amazing to see in provincial newspapers and farming journals the advertisements that appear regularly for dead or worn-out animals. The question must be asked as to why these people are so anxious to get these animals.  I would like if there was a tightening up of the law to ensure that there are no other outlets other than the meat and bonemeal factories.  There has to be a question mark over that.</P>
    <P>I do not have any great disagreement with regard to the sections of the Bill. Section 13 states that the licence shall not transfer if the holder of the licence dies while the licence is in effect.  I find that rather unusual.  In the case of licensed premises, when the licensee dies, the licence does not die with the owner.  It transfers and I wonder why that cannot happen in regard to abattoirs.</P>
    <P>I do not think the licence fees are in any way prohibitive.  They are reasonable as long as they stay at that.  I would not like to see small family businesses being put out of operation as a result of severe increases in the cost of licences.  I hope that some regulation will be laid down so that they cannot be automatically increased if it is seen that sufficient revenue is coming in from them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> With regard to veterinary fees, it must be remembered &mdash; and Deputy Briscoe referred to this &mdash; that it is the producer who will pay these fees.  These fees are substantial.  Once they are introduced I suppose it will only take a stroke of a pen to increase them.  Whether they will be sufficient to pay the inspectors is another question that I cannot see being answered in the Bill.  It may be possible that two local authorities may be able to come together to provide a veterinary inspector. I believe that will have to be the case because as we all know at present local authorities are short of cash and are finding it difficult to get by without the added burden of having to fund a veterinary inspector.  I doubt if sufficient fees would be collected in some of the smaller countries to pay for a veterinary inspector. I do not think it should all be placed on the back of the producer because it is also of benefit to the consumer.  If it is not a direct tax then the local authorities should be subsidised through indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to again welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue.  Many people said to me that in this House we would not have the will to bring in this Bill and I am glad now to be able to show that we have.  I compliment everybody who was involved in it.  It is a step in the right direction.  It can only enhance the great name we have for producing some of the finest foodstuffs in the world.  The home market is our shop window.  The tourism industry in this country is growing and the people who come here and sample Irish beef or Irish pork which is properly presented will be customers when they go back to their own countries.  The Bill is vitally important in that context also.  Over and above everything else, our own people are equally as important as the consumers in the export market.  I am delighted to see that they are now going to be properly protected and that they will have no doubts in their minds when they shop that they are getting the highest quality products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very <Col N="1722" /> important Bill which is before the House today.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing it forward and also to thank the previous Government for initiating it originally.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation, comprising seven different Acts including one dating back to 1847, places responsibility for control of slaughterhouses and knackery yards on sanitary authorities.  Our present problems are as much due to our antiquated laws as to the discretionary powers they give to sanitary authorities to administer them.  Some local authorities have not adopted meat inspection by-laws and the licensing of premises is quite lax in most of the country.  As a result there were varying standards and the penalties imposed were small and outdated and did not really present a sufficient deterrent.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan that it is vitally important that we preserve a clean image in regard to our food.  It is important that consumers have confidence in the quality of the food they eat.  Recent trends and practices have militated against that clean image and in that sense the Bill before us is timely.  I enjoy eating meat but I have not been eating as much lately because of the question marks about certain practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that a function that is so important to the lives of our people will remain the responsibility of local authorities. Local accountability will be involved when problems arise and that is the best way to deal with this matter.  It is important that there should be local knowledge involved.  I accept that a problem may arise due to lack of finance but if the fees are reasonable and are collected, it will be possible to surmount that problem.  In Kerry we have had a county veterinary officer since 1979 and in the country wide survey carried out by the Department of Agriculture in 1982 the county fared very well.  Of the 49 slaughterhouses inspected in Kerry 30 were found suitable, eight were described as suitable with minor modifications, seven suitable with medium modifications and four with major modifications. However, none of the <Col N="1723" /> slaughterhouses inspected was found to be unsuitable.  When one looks at the figures for the rest of the country one will see that Kerry ranks among the top, if not the best.  That high standard has been achieved by the appointment of a county veterinary officer.  I should like to compliment the county manager, and the veterinary inspector, on the work they have done down the years.  That survey showed that butchers in Kerry maintain high standards in their slaughterhouses.  However, it is clear that the legislation in this area needs to be updated if our standards must meet international modern hygiene criteria. Our standard of inspection must be sufficient to protect our population from food poisoning, organisms and residues of known or perceived danger.  We must retain the hygienic and psychological confidence of the consumer in red meat products.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly unfair if small butchers who have spent a lot of money and generations of family care in the building up of a business, had to compete against cowboys who operate under low standards and choose locations least likely to be supervised.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill to deal with that problem. The element of unfair competition from export plants has been dealt with by other speakers.  Over the years they have received massive grants to bring their plants up to export standards while premises slaughtering for the home market have been renovated and modernised at the expense of the owners.  It should be possible to have the carrot and the stick under the new Bill and to give grant assistance to slaughterhouses catering for the home market.  In my view those grants should be confined to licensed premises.  It is a mistake to give them to bad operators.</P>
    <P>The <i>Master Butcher</i>, in its November issue, stated:</P>
    <P>It would appear from that, that companies which are being grant-aided should not be competing on the home market.  However, we know from our experience that the restaurant/hotel <Col N="1724" /> trade is increasingly being taken over by the &ldquo;export&rdquo; meat plants.  The meat products being supplied to this trade are not ones which have to compete with significant imports or, indeed, with any imports.</P>
    <P>The IDA, in its policy of job creation, offers funding to the meat industry, or rather to part of the meat industry, to the tune of £9,000 per job created on average.  In some cases the cost per job can be several times this figure.  The cost of a major project announced during the summer comes to over £30,000 per job created.  Given that the firm concerned here competes on the home market, there is a danger that some of the jobs created will merely displace existing jobs in the home market trade.</P>
    <P>Small butchers are concerned that they may be put out of business by that type of unfair competition.  The Minister should see to it that that practice ceases.  It is unfair to give grants to exporters only and people who receive such grants should confine their activities to the export market.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Kerry veterinary officer devotes a great deal of his time to the home market meat trade, the liquid milk trade and to sheep scab control.  I have no doubt that there is a need for similar inspections in other counties. Ante- and post-mortem inspection of slaughtering procedures should be the main element of a health programme dealing with slaughterhouses.  Antemortem inspection is necessary to prevent the slaughtering of unhealthy animals. Slaughtering procedures must be good to prevent cruelty at slaughtering and the contamination of meat or meat products by bacteria arising from the bowel content of the animal or contaminated equipment.  The standard maintained in the slaughtering premises I visited leaves nothing to be desired. Post-mortem inspections and sampling are necessary to establish the absence of TB, parasites, abscesses or other visually identifiable diseases.  Many diseases and residues are not detectable in a post-mortem <Col N="1725" /> examination and it is necessary therefore to have a comprehensive sampling service which will assure consumers that meat or meat products are safe.</P>
    <P>We should have a designated laboratory with sufficient staff and equipment to examine samples from each county.  The laboratory need not necessarily be sited in the county.  The results of the samples from each county should be published by the Department, in conjunction with their own results, and all unsatisfactory results should be notified to the veterinary inspector of the county and the director of community care.  We are all aware of how successful the campaign against the use of antibiotics in cows was and that it resulted in the removal of such residues from milk offered for sale.  In many instances consumer pressure proves more effective than legislation.  The publication of laboratory results would lead to an improvement in standards.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is little or no danger from most hormonal growth promoters but it is also clear that consumers do not have any confidence in meat from implanted animals.  The consumer does not want anything in his or her food in the nature of hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, insecticides, &ldquo;E&rdquo; numbers and so on.  Consumers do not understand and are frightened by modern agri practices. We hear on the radio and TV every day about the number of people who are turning to natural products or organic food.  That is just the reaction we are experiencing at the moment against the amount of additives in the various foods.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935 ensure that slaughtering in slaughterhouses is by the most humane methods known.  Inspection procedures will ensure that these methods are used in these premises.  Section 2 of the Bill should be amended to ensure that only licensed slaughtermen using approved methods are employed in the slaughter of pigs and emergency slaughtering as envisaged in section 2 (1) in the interests of the welfare of these animals. I have memories of seeing in my yard at <Col N="1726" /> home pigs being stuck with a butcher's knife, as we used to say, and when I look back on it now it does not appear to have been a very humane practice.  If a qualified slaughterman was carrying out these duties such things would not occur. The fee for a slaughterman's licence should be in the region of £10 and the conditions he would have to comply with should be laid out in the regulations.</P>
    <P>I would like to see section 64 (2) used to communicate to the director of community care and the county MO notification of the issue of a licence to a premises, the withdrawal of a licence or the initiation of proceedings to withdraw a licence.  I would like the county MO to be able to direct the temporary closure of a slaughterhouse if, in his opinion, meat from such a slaughterhouse is associated with an outbreak of food poisoning.  He should be able to order its closure until such an inspection is carried out by the county veterinary officer and a certificate of fitness and report are issued by him to the county MO. Recently I was speaking to the county MO in Kerry who was quite concerned about the fact that there is no mention of his role in this Bill &mdash; unless I am mistaken or he is mistaken.  He would like that to be considered.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that county councils have sufficient funds to run their services. Previous speakers have said it is fine to give county councils responsibility but the problem is when it comes to collecting the fees to ensure that the service will not take money from existing services.  For example, work on county roads is the usual beneficiary of such money.  In the case of the Dogs Act the scheme has been self-financing and very successful and I see no reason why the scheme we are discussing could not be run on the same lines and be as successful.  An inspection fee for a licensing visit should be the same for all premises.  There is little justification for three separate scales as implied in this Bill.  Repeat visits should be charged for in premises which fail to meet the required standard.  There should be a repeat fee on each occasion an inspector goes back.  Different scales <Col N="1727" /> based on the throughput will add unnecessary complications.  It would be better to achieve the moneys through visit inspection fees which would add to the cost of not having premises up to standard in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Inspection fees are realistic as regards pigs and sheep but in relation to cattle the combined effect of veterinary inspection fees, disease levy and CBF levy is to add substantially to the costs which are passed on to the consumer.  Deputy Briscoe explored this aspect.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that all charges be kept to a minimum and as cost effective as is compatible with providing an inspection service to all premises having a licence. Let me refer here to the overall cost of an animal taken from a farm, sold to the mart and taken to the butcher.  In order to sell an animal the herd must be tested and that costs £15.  To transport an animal to a mart on average costs £8 and it could be more in some cases.  The levy at the mart for the butcher is about £2, to transport the animal home, it costs about £3 and to have a qualified slaughterman slaughter the animal costs about £7.  Then the Government levy and the CBF levy amount to about £10, all coming on average to about £45.  The unfortunate consumer will have to foot the bill for that, not the butcher nor the farmer to whom it is added cost.  These fees should be kept to a minimum and there should be no desire to make profit in order to use the money in another area.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling among butchers &mdash; in this case I mean small operators &mdash; that there is an attempt to squeeze them out of existence and that the idea behind this Bill is to force them into taking their cattle to larger abattoirs for ease of inspection and so forth and for maintaining standards, and that they close down their own premises.  Those butchers in Kerry where very good slaughtering conditions obtain at the moment would be very reluctant to do that.  They feel that the intention should not be to push them into large regional abattoirs operating for a number of butchers in an area.  I say to the Minister that we should ensure <Col N="1728" /> that the small butcher is interfered with as little as possible and that the business which he and his family before him have had for a long time in a village or an area is retained.</P>
    <P>Knackers' yards are very important in my county because it is from knackers' yards that most greyhound men get their meat and so forth, and in north Kerry the greyhound business is very big.  I am glad there are some controls in relation to knackers' yards under the new legislation and to see the provision ensuring that none of the meat provided or produced in these premises reaches human consumers. This point was explored by Deputy Boylan when he referred to instances that he had experience of in Monaghan and that we all know about. The people employed to kill in knackers' yards should be licensed slaughtermen. This is important in order to maintain humane practices in slaughtering animals. However, I have some reservations as regards the operations of these premises where the animals reaching them may have died from notifiable diseases such as anthrax or have been infected with zoonotic diseases and the meat is then sold without heat treatment to feed dogs.  This may subsequently contaminate human handlers, the people who are dealing with the meat and with the dogs.  Zoonotic diseases are diseases which can be transferred from animal to man.  The Minister might consider this in his reply.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to marts where beef is sold.  This Bill makes very little mention of marts.  I know the Minister has first hand knowledge of handling marts.  The practice at marts of seeing handlers subjecting unfortunate beef cattle to what we in Kerry call belting &mdash; using shovel handles, ash butts or whatever &mdash; must be eliminated because this belting must affect the meat.  It is the same principle as a muscle bruise &mdash; a contusion appears and there is bleeding into the tissue. When the unfortunate butcher is cutting the carcase he will see this bruising and if an inspector is there he will ask the butcher what happened.  That practice should be eliminated and another way of <Col N="1729" /> getting cattle from lorries to pens and finally into the ring should be devised. The practice of subjecting these unfortunate animals to such beatings should be discontinued.  Perhaps the Minister could refer briefly to this.</P>
    <P>There are latches and broken bars sticking out of the pens where the cattle are kept at marts.  When the cattle are crushed in these pens they can get injured or bruised.  We should make regulations for the control of marts.  The sanitary and hygienic conditions in marts should also be looked at.  I am very glad to say this does not relate to our local mart in Listowel which is very well run.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had this opportunity to speak on this Bill and the Minister may be interested in some of my suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to the debate and the last speaker in particular who reassured us that they do things better in Kerry than in any other county.  The only problem they have is using those shovel handles. <Col N="1730" /> Maybe if they used hurleys they might get around to a hurling game.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying that the Bill has been so well received.  The positive response and goodwill towards the Bill must be capitalised on and the best way to do that is to implement its provisions as soon as possible and as fully as possible.  As I mentioned earlier, various groups were consulted in the Bill's formulation and it is appropriate to thank the Irish Domestic Meat Traders Association, the Irish Master Butchers Federation, the Irish Meat Wholesalers Association, Córas Beostoic agus Feola, the Irish Bacon Curers Society, the Federation of Irish Renderers, the County and City Managers Association, the Irish Society of Medical Officers of Health, the Local Government and Public Services Union, the Irish Veterinary Association, the Local Authority Veterinary Officers Association, the Irish Veterinary Union and the Veterinary Officers Association, for giving of their time and for their ongoing interest and work in helping to raise standards on the home meat market.  We had very wide-ranging consultations with all those organisations and associations and their views are reflected in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad where the Bill was introduced, Senators on all sides of the House acknowledged the need for fresh legislation in this area and welcomed the overall thrust of the proposed measures.  The Bill was extensively debated there and amendments were accepted.  I want to put on record and acknowledge the contribution of the previous Minister and everybody concerned in the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>In this House, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was concerned about the possible duplication which could result from the proposed licensing of premises by the Department of Agriculture and Food as opposed to local authorities who will be exercising day-to-day controls on slaughterings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licensing of abattoirs by the Department is a key element in helping to secure higher standards.  First, while current responsibility for licensing rests with local authorities, the fact remains that only <Col N="1731" /> about 70 per cent of premises are licensed.  Secondly, the officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food who will conduct the licensing inspection will be drawn, in the main, from the meat export plants and they will be the best people to ensure that the standards at local level will be brought up to the high export standards on a uniform and nationwide basis.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the recommendation of the local authority officers engaged in the day-to-day control of premises will be an important consideration in determining whether a licence should issue. That is why I have made specific provision in the Bill for consultation with the local authority when it comes to licensing. There is, of course, provision in the Bill for the devolution of licensing to local authorities at some stage in the future should the situation warrant.</P>
    <P>In a related contribution, Deputy McCoy was concerned that there may be a divergence of standards between the home and export plants having regard to the dual system of controlling authorities. I can assure the Deputy that this will not be the case.  This Bill and the regulations to be made thereunder will ensure that all slaughterings for the home market will be conducted to the same high standard as obtains in the export plants.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the hygienic preparation of meat, and control and inspection arrangements by the local authorities will be considerably tightened up through an augmented corps of full time veterinary inspectors.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe inquired about progress made since the 1982 survey of abattoirs and knackers conducted by the Department of Agriculture and Food. Following the survey, the Department communicated their results to each county manager with a view towards improvements being made.  Simultaneously, the Department of Health circulated the health boards and asked them to liaise with local authorities with a view to taking concerted action in the matter.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1732" /> and Food prepared model sets of abattoir and meat inspection by-laws and these were circulated to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>From the reports on progress received by the Department, some areas responded positively and, for instance, 20 sanitary authorities, who up to then had no abattoir by-laws in operation, adopted same.  Improvements were made to many premises and some closures resulted.  As I mentioned in my speech, however, the national picture remained bad and many areas claimed that archaic legislation and the derisory fines system impeded more meaningful progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCoy wanted to see greater controls on knackers.  This has been alluded to by a number of other Deputies as well.  The only existing controls on knackers are contained in the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, and to a lesser extent, the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1935.  In addition some local authorities who have in operation by-laws on offensive trades may claim an involvement. What is clear, however, is that none of the existing provision is adequate or modern enough to properly address the activities on these premises.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a structured and updated approach to premises handling dead or disabled animals or meat for nonhuman consumption.  It will ensure that both public and animal health will be protected against any ill-effect that contact with animals or meat handled at these premises could cause.  In this Year of the Environment, the controls will also act to prevent our countryside from being spoiled in any way by these necessary but nevertheless unsightly and unclean operations.  Many Members referred to the environment and our image as a clean and unpolluted area for the production of high quality food.  I hope the regulations which will be made under this Bill ensure that the reality measures up to the image.</P>
    <P>The information which Deputy McCoy said should be made available by proprietors of these premises is covered by regulations to be made under section 34 of the Bill.  I do not agree with his proposal that they should have a stamp of <Col N="1733" /> their own as such a provision would only undermine the health marking arrangement for meat at abattoirs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg was worried about controls on the meat after it had left the abattoir.  This Bill will guarantee the products leaving our abattoirs and what happens after that will be a matter for the food hygiene regulations.  Along with environmental health officers, local authority veterinary inspectors are also authorised officers under these regulations. When this Bill goes through, it is the intention to issue directions to local authorities and health authorities on the exercise of their powers in relation to the inspection of meat at processing, cutting up and retail levels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe inquired why the standards for premises were not specified in the Bill.  The answer is straightforward. The Bill is enabling legislation providing for quite a number of regulations to be made in relation to various matters.  To spell out all the minute details of these regulations would make for an inordinately bulky and cumbersome document and, as we are so near Christmas, it would be invidious to suggest that we could go through a document of that size. Drafts of the proposed regulations on premises will shortly be furnished to the trade and their views will be sought on the matter as we have been in consultation with them since the beginning of this legislation.  Officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food have already met the trade and discussed the outlines of the regulations to be made under this Bill with them.  It is fair to say that the trade did not foresee any major problems with the requirements in the regulations.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were concerned about the permit provisions contained in section 17 of the Bill.  Deputy Briscoe referred to the fact that five years was an inordinately long period of time.  Despite progress made in relation to the upgrading of abattoirs since 1982, the likelihood is that there are still a large number of premises where improvements will be <Col N="1734" /> necessary.  This section will meet the situation by allowing proprietors a transitional period of up to five years to bring their premises up to licensing standard. A permit will not be issued for a period of five years as may have been interpreted by some Deputies.  The permit will be granted for a specified duration, say six months, which will have regard to the time necessary to carry out the improvements required.</P>
    <P>Where a number of improvements are being sought, it may mean that a series of permits would operate.  If I feel, however, that no progress is being made I will not renew the permit.  It is not intended that a permit would be granted under this section in respect of a premises which is either clearly incapable of being brought up to standard or which may constitute a danger to public health.  The transitional period of up to five years is not considered excessive having regard, for instance, to the need to secure planning approval where such approval will be necessary to allow improvements to go ahead.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to staffing and finances and were concerned that the finance provided for local authorities through the proposed fees structure might be insufficient to fund the Bill's staffing provisions.  I can assure them that this will not be the case.  The position is that a detailed analysis of the Bill's costs and funding to local authorities was conducted by the Department of Agriculture and Food in September 1986.  The estimated revenue to accrue to local authorities from the fees on slaughterings being provided for under section 44 of the Bill will be of the order of £1.4 million annually.  The estimated additional cost of employing whole time veterinary staff in the 23 areas now without such staff is £0.6 million annually. The balance in receipts of £0.8 million will enable local authorities to provide such back-up services as are necessary as well as covering the remuneration of the corps of part time veterinary inspectors employed in the local authority veterinary service.  The cost of the latter corps approaches £0.4 million annually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> While in the overall the Bill's proposals will be self-financing there are nine areas Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, North Tipperary and Waterford county, where revenue from veterinary inspection fees will be insufficient to finance whole time staff.  It is anticipated that suitable combinations of areas can be made to finance the cost of whole time staff from the aggregate revenue in inspection fees in these areas.  In this connection, subsection (4) of section 35 of the Bill allows for such combinations.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, particularly Deputies O'Keeffe, Stagg, McCoy and Durkan raised the question of there being no provision of grant-aid for local abattoirs, claiming that such abattoirs would be placed at a disadvantage, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the export meat plants.  I read into the record the editorial in the <i>Master Butcher</i> by Eugene Kerins.  The IDA are responsible for grant-aiding premises and their guidelines provide that grant-aid to export plants are based on the need for export trade development and are necessary to secure markets in the European Community and elsewhere.  The same considerations do not apply to the domestic trade.  My ministerial colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for that area and Deputies know how sensitive I am in relation to keeping out of another man's area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will make representations to the Minister in relation to concerns about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transferability of an abattoir licence was raised by a number of people. I assure the House that the intention of section 13 is to make matters easier for everybody.  Essentially, section 13 provides that a licence, which has to be renewed annually, will not be passed on with the sale or lease of an abattoir.  In such circumstances, it will be necessary for the new owner or occupier to make application for a fresh licence.  This is necessary to ensure that the new owner or occupier is a fit and proper person <Col N="1736" /> to hold a licence as required under the provisions of section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, section 13 was amended on humanitarian grounds in the Seanad to provide that, on the death of a licence holder, the licence will continue in effect for the benefit of the personal representative of the deceased for two months or until its normal expiry, whichever is the longer.  Somebody referred to the question of licensed premises.  In this case we are looking for a trained, fit and proper person.  Deputy O'Keeffe inquired about the use of the returns being sought from local authorities under section 60 of the Bill.  These returns, which I intend will be submitted on a monthly basis, will enable me to be satisfied that the Bill is working properly in each area.</P>
    <P>For the first time, they will provide accurate and up to date information on slaughterings and, in the case of knackeries, valuable information on animal losses and disease.  There will be a monthly return from each premises which will give a considerable amount of information on disease and animal movements generally.  I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that the returns should prove very useful in helping to finally eliminate the scourge of TB.  With, in the future, post-mortems on all slaughterings at domestic abattoirs, I will be arranging for closer liaison between the local authorities and the Department's network of TB offices.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of environmental health officers under the Bill.  Under section 67 of the Bill the provisions of the food hygiene regulations will not apply to abattoirs as otherwise there would be two sets of regulations governing standards in the same premises.  As the proposed controls in the Abattoirs Bill are largely veterinary in nature I would not see any great merit in providing for a specific role within abattoirs for environmental health officers.  Rather, would I consider it necessary to avoid a situation where different State paid officials should be employed on overlapping functions in the same area.</P>
    <P>Section 35 (3) of the Bill will, however, <Col N="1737" /> allow local authorities to engage the services of environmental health officers, on an agency basis or otherwise, to assist the full time veterinarians in implementing the Bill's provisions.  Further, the transport and retail sides of the meat trade will continue to be subject to the provisions of the food hygiene regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the existing District Court network effectively provides most of the features associated with the so-called &ldquo;small claims courts&rdquo; that operate in some other jurisdictions.  The present jurisdiction of the District Court <Col N="1741" /> enables claims to be brought in that court for amounts of up to £2,500.  The District Court sits at some 250 venues around the country and procedures in that court are reasonably simple, in particular the summary judgment procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

I am not sure how one could deal with such an issue or whether we would be able to successfully discourage lawyers from attending court by simply requesting them to do so.  That is part of the problem that would have to be dealt with.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 10, 17 and 24 and Priority Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 24 November last, there are reasons for believing that four separate cargoes of arms and ammunition may have been landed here during 1985 and 1986.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the evaluation and advice of the Garda authorities in relation to this matter, the Government requested the Garda with Army support, to launch a major search on the basis that there is an obligation on the State to establish whether those arms were in fact landed here and if so, to seize them.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to disclose the information sought in Question No. 24.  It has never been the practice to disclose information received on a confidential basis from intelligence sources. However, as regards the search itself, I wish to report to the House as follows:</P>
      <P>The search, which took place in all Garda Divisions, commenced on 23 November 1987.  In the following 10-day period, a total of 50,132 houses were searched, 7,573 under warrant and 42,559 without warrant.  In addition, 164 cruisers on the River Shannon and 775 caravans were searched without warrant.</P>
      <P>33 people were arrested.  Five were charged with offences and one is receiving medical attention in hospital.  Files in respect of 11 of those released without charge have been submitted to the Law Officers for decisions as to whether prosecutions should be initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following arms and munitions were found during the course of the search up to 3 December: 22 rifles; 15 revolvers; 13 shotguns; 4,312 cartridges; 2,277 bullets; 43 detonators; 2 timing devices; 1 cwt of suspected explosive mix; <Col N="1745" /> 7 gas cylinders of the type used in mortar bombs; 25 cylinder bombs packed with suspected explosive mix.</P>
    <P>In addition, a number of documents were seized.  These are currently being evaluated and it is possible that in some instances they will provide the basis of criminal charges.</P>
    <P>Additionally, four bunkers and sixteen dug-outs were located.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that houses were searched, where necessary, under warrants issued in accordance with authority provided by section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. I do not propose to go into the details of the search or the criteria used by the Garda in deciding where to search.  These are operational Garda matters.  The grounds on which a warrant for searching may issue are set out clearly in the Act. As I mentioned, criminal charges may arise out of possession of certain documents seized in the search.  I am aware also of a press report that one of the persons whose home was searched is considering court proceedings on the matter. In the circumstances, comment in any detail by me in relation to these matters would be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that a great deal of goodwill was encountered by the search teams.  I am aware too of course that this was not the universal response &mdash; I have seen press references to the disquiet of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, for example. A certain amount of resentment was inevitable and indeed understandable. Indeed when I announced the search, I knew that some degree of inconvenience was to be expected but I asked for forebearance and I was confident that most people would understand what was being done and why it was necessary.  The Garda Complaints Board, the statutory authority for resolving complaints about Garda behaviour, can be resorted to by anyone who feels aggrieved by anything that was done in the course of this search.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the search for the arms will continue. On the basis of information and <Col N="1746" /> intelligence acquired during the search so far, further searches on a selective basis may be necessary for some time yet.  I do not propose to say anything more on the subject beyond that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the nationwide search now officially over?  Will the Minister agree, in view of the find that took place as a result of this major search, that the information supplied in relation to two boatloads of arms landing in this country in 1985 and 1986 containing a similar amount of arms to that contained in the <i>Eksund</i>, was not accurate?  Will the Minister also agree that it was a mistake for him to go on television and radio half an hour after the search began implying that the security of the State was under threat when there is no evidence to show that it was?  Would the Minister not also agree that this was really a beat the bushes exercise in co-operation with the RUC to flush out people in hiding along the Border and that it was done under the guise of a national search for arms and ammunition that was supposed to have been imported into this country in 1985 and 1986?  With the permission of the Chair I will come back to the Minister again.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, I would refer him to the final part of my answer where I said that the Garda authorities had informed me that the search for the arms would continue and that on the basis of the information and intelligence acquired during the search so far, further searches on a selective basis may be necessary for some time yet.  That more than adequately covers the first part of the Deputy's question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, I have a number of other supplementaries from Deputy Barrett with which I would like to deal.  With regard to the suggestion that because the search failed to uncover anything like the amount of arms and ammunition that was on board the <Col N="1747" /><i>Eksund</i> it showed that the information we have with regard to other cargoes was incorrect, I must deny that.  To draw an inference of that nature would probably be a mistake.  The fact that nothing like the <i>Eksund</i> cargo has been discovered at this stage of the search is not conclusive proof of anything.  What the search revealed, particularly the bunkers, obviously indicates a state of readiness to receive a cargo such as that on board the <i>Eksund</i>, but it is too early at this stage to draw firm conclusions on the question whether the previous four cargoes were successfully landed here.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third part of Deputy Barrett's question about the statement by me on the morning of the search, I have more than adequately dealt with that insinuation which was raised in the House a couple of weeks ago and I do not intend to waste the time of the House in repeating it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked if this was a beat the bush exercise in conjunction with the RUC.  From the beginning I made very clear why the Government on the advice of the Garda decided that such a search should take place.  I regret the insinuation, by way of innuendo, in Deputy Barrett's question.  It is totally unhelpful, unjustified, untrue and mischievous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about a situation where he has informed the House that a number of boatloads of <Col N="1748" /> arms were landed here and yet notwithstanding this extensive search those arms have not been located?  What are the Minister's proposals in that serious situation?  Is the Minister at all concerned that in some cases at least the Garda perhaps have been over-extensive in casting their net, and that the reports from the Council of Civil Liberties and other sources are a matter of extreme concern? It would appear that very many people who have no connection whatsoever with militant republicanism have had their homes surrounded and searched without warning.  It would also appear that at least some left-wing activists who have no connection with militant republicanism have been singled out for attention by the Garda.  They feel this is designed to intimidate them from engaging in legitimate political activity.  In one case, the details of which I can give to the Minister privately if he wishes, the gardaí came into a home and paid more attention to the contents of the bookcase than to searching elsewhere.  I would ask the Minister to comment on these very serious complaints of over-zealous activity in some instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the question of whether the search was justified having regard to the fact that no major caches of arms were discovered, I would say to Deputy Taylor that it is not merely a question of whether the action of the Army or the Garda Síochána was justified. There were reports that these arms had been landed.  These reports were evaluated by the Garda Síochána who formed the view, with which the Government concurred, that it was necessary for a major search to be undertaken to find out if the arms had been landed and, if so, to seize them.  I do not think this matter should be spoken about in terms of value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports were received and on professional police evaluation a search was considered <Col N="1749" /> necessary.  I may add that the search will continue until such time as it can be said with some degree of certainty whether the weapons were landed here on the scale alleged.  Regarding the second part of Deputy Taylor's question, he should reflect on what I said in my initial reply. If there are complaints about the way the police operation was carried out it is open to any citizen to lodge his or her complaint with the Garda Complaints Board which is there for that specific purpose.  I should point out that six out of every ten homes searched were searched without any need for a warrant.  Almost 43,000 homes were searched without the need for a warrant while 6,500 homes were searched with the help of a warrant.  I am grateful to the people for the co-operation they gave the security forces in carrying out this search.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that these four cargoes arrived as he said on 24 November and that their combined tonnage of arms and explosives exceeded that on board the <i>Eksund</i>?  Will the Minister tell us why the search has now been scaled down so drastically?  The reported finds are nothing like what was found on board the <i>Eksund</i>.  Is it true that people who had bunkers built on their premises may only be charged with breaches of the planning laws and will not be prosecuted for any other offences? Why did the Minister fail to answer Question No. 24 which seeks to establish whether the police who travelled to France were informed by the French authorities, as I am told, that the cargo on board the <i>Eksund</i> was loaded at Tripoli? I am mystified as to the Government's failure to answer this question since I have been told that these gardaí reported they were informed by the French police that the <i>Eksund</i> was loaded at Tripoli.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's sources of information were revealed to the House perhaps they could be looked upon in the cold light of day to see what is in them. With regard to the combined tonnage which I referred to in my statement last <Col N="1750" /> month, the Garda were of the view which I indicated.  The Garda have informed me that the search for arms will continue on the basis of information and intelligence acquired during the search so far. Further searches on a selected basis may be necessary for some time yet.  The Garda will conduct these searches and in the event of their needing help from the Army I have no doubt they will make the request for same in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's suggestion that those people who are involved with bunkers and dug-outs may only be charged with breaches of the planning law, it is a matter for the Garda to decide what charges to bring.  They will do their business in the normal way.  We in this House will not tell the Garda what charges to bring against those involved.</P>
      <P>Regarding the information sought by the Deputy in Question No. 24, I repeat that I do not intend to disclose the information sought.  It has never been the practice to disclose information received on a confidential basis from intelligence sources.  That is the practice and I do not propose to depart from it.</P>

      <P>If an entirely innocent family were raided by warrant either by error or as a result of incorrect or malicious information supplied to the Garda &mdash; I have a specific case in my own constituency &mdash; what recourse have the family to establish the reasons they were listed for search and interrogation and to clear their good name and, in the interest of civil liberties, to ensure that they will not be the subject of unjustified Garda attention in the future?  Is it not the case that the Garda Complaints Body would simply claim privilege?  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that in such an exceptional case the Garda Complaints Body will give the information required and take steps to clear the name of any such family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said he knew of an entirely innocent family who had their house checked.  I have already told this House that 50,000 houses were <Col N="1751" /> searched during the course of this operation. It was an ordinary Garda operational decision.  If people have any grievance or complaint about the way the search was conducted I suggest they consider getting in touch with the Garda Complaints Board set up by statute before the change of Government.</P>

The Minister indicated at his press conference that there was a threat to the security of the State but it would appear from what he has said today that there was not such a threat to the security of the State.  Given what was found and the type of search carried out, there is nothing to suggest that the security of the State was at risk.</P>

The fact that we have found four bunkers, some constructed to such a high degree of effectiveness by way of light and ventilation, that we have discovered a number of dug-outs, that people like Dessie O'Hare were arrested, warrants the congratulation of the security forces of this State, on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the people. I might add that the owners of 43,000 homes allowed the Garda to search without any warrant.  That totally belies the suggestion in the Deputy's supplementary question.</P>

Is the Minister telling the House that we here, as Deputies representing our constituents, are to be fobbed off?  Is he, as Minister for Justice, satisfied to airily dismiss serious claims by people who protest their innocence and non-involvement ever with militant republicanism, about being raided, guns being brandished, children frightened?  Is he content that the matter be referred to the Garda Complaints Board and that we, as Deputies in this House, are not correct in standing up <Col N="1754" /> protesting about their position here while he, as Minister, for Justice, is not standing over their civil liberties, having regard to the very genuine complaints that have been raised and mentioned here by myself and other Deputies?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister still consider that there is a serious danger to the security of the State having regard to the results of this search?  Does he also still believe that there are arms hidden away in this State equivalent to the haul taken from the <i>Eksund</i>?  If he does hold such a belief does he intend to invoke any of the other powers available to the State, pursuant to the Offences Against the State Act, to take measures to ensure that the security of the State is safeguarded?  If he does intend in the future to invoke any of the other powers available to him under the Offences Against the State Act would he so indicate to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most certainly I am satisfied that if arms equivalent to the haul found on the <i>Eksund</i> had got in by way four shipments &mdash; which information we received indicated to be the case &mdash; then undoubtedly there would be no reason for anybody to believe but that we were facing an exceptionally serious threat to the security of this State.  On 26 January 1986 there were four finds of arms, three in County Sligo and one in County Roscommon which netted in excess of 100 Kalashnikov and East German and Romanian automatic rifles, quantities of explosives and large quantities of ammunition. Twelve months later, almost to the month, there were two finds of arms and explosives in the United Kingdom, in Macclesfield Forest and Delamere Forest.  What was found in <Col N="1755" /> those two caches was clearly linked to or tied up with what was found in Counties Sligo and Roscommon.  One could draw conclusions that some of those cargoes &mdash; had they got in &mdash; were already being distributed to other parts.  I believe, as do the Garda, that there is every reason the search should be continued.  That is their professional judgment, that is why they are searching and will continue to search.  The Government will be acting constantly on the advice of the Garda observing the situation as it develops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that perhaps the reason 42,000 people were so willing to allow the Garda search their homes was that, first they were not aware of their rights and, second, that most people would feel intimidated if a large number of armed Garda and so on arrived at their door? Furthermore, would the Minister agree with me that these people are now subject to a certain amount of suspicion in their communities and that many of them are deeply embarrassed?  Would he agree that it would be helpful if he, in particular, and the Garda Commissioner issued a public statement to the effect that, unfortunately, the homes of many innocent people had to be searched during the course of this nationwide search by the Garda and Army?  Lastly, is the Minister now in a position to indicate one way or the other whether these arms that are supposed to be in the country came from Libya?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, <Col N="1756" /> I do not accept that people who cooperated with the Garda were not aware of their rights or felt intimidated.  This was partly the reason it was decided that, in the course of the statement issued by me on the particular morning that the search began, there would be included a request to people to co-operate so that people would know what was going on. There was not any question &mdash; to use the Deputy's phrase &mdash; that people would wake up and find armed men at their doors or windows.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion of guilt contained in the Deputy's supplementary I should say there is no need whatsoever for any feeling of guilt on the part of anybody whose property was searched to ascertain whether there were any guns or explosives on those properties.  Nor indeed was there any reason for people to feel any guilt any time the Garda had to conduct a search.  We did have nationwide searches on previous occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to accept that all of us in this House would want the weapons that are alleged to have been brought into this State to be found and taken out of the hands of those who may use them.  But there is concern among many citizens about the widespread searches.  To allay that fear, will the Minister state the criteria the Garda used to select houses?  By way of assistance, let me suggest that on a number of occasions houses were searched and the people told it was because the houses were located in lonely places.  Could the Minister outline any other reasons that houses were selected for search?  Would the Minister also indicate, in relation to the bunkers that were found, whether it was felt that these bunkers were prepared for use or had already been used?  In other words had the weapons that are being sought already been there and moved out or had they not arrived yet?  Third, I would ask the Minister to clarify a question Deputy Shatter raised in relation to the threat to the State. One must presume that when the search exercise has been wound down the threat is not perceived to be as great as it was. Could the Minister indicate if that is so?</P>

      <P>Let me take the third part of the Deputy's question first.  The Deputy will realise and appreciate that there is always a threat to the security of the State when there are highly armed subversives who have explosives available to them and are carrying out the sort of atrocities that are being carried out by people engaged in that area.  That threat would be lifted to a far higher level if they could get a greater fire power and the additional manpower to use it.  There is every reason for the Government to be concerned with the situation as it is.</P>

      <P>I take it that in raising this question the Deputy has in mind the physical condition of the offender referred to.  I have no doubt that this factor would have been taken into account by the court in imposing sentence. Accordingly, I do not regard it as having a bearing on the length of sentence the offender can expect to serve and, in this respect, the offender will be treated on the same basis as other offenders who have received similar sentences.  As regards the physical needs of the offender, appropriate facilities are being provided at the prison as is the practice in cases of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether in view of the recent <Col N="1760" /> upsurge of vicious crime the Government will consider an immediate restoration of the pain and suffering provisions of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the basis on which compensation is paid for personal injuries criminally inflicted should necessarily be influenced by fluctuations in the levels of crime.  The changes introduced on 1 April 1986 to exclude compensation for pain and suffering, were decided on by the then Government in the light of the escalating cost of the scheme as it operated up to then and in the light of available resources.  In the present financial circumstances I see no real prospect of returning to a more favourable basis for compensation under this scheme.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, an analysis of the statistics available for the last few years would not support the contention that there has been an upsurge in the level of violent crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply.  Would he not agree that a society that does not compensate people who are injured as a result of being criminally attacked or assaulted is a sick society?  The amount of money involved is only about £1 million.  That could be found by further fines through the courts or in ways of that kind.  Would the Minister not agree that it is wrong that people who suffer serious injuries can only be compensated for loss of earnings and can get no compensation at all for these injuries?  This is our only way of showing in a practical manner that we as a society condemn in the strongest possible terms those who engage in crimes of this kind.  Would he not agree that prison officers whose lives are endangered in many cases as a result of the work they do on behalf of this State are a very vulnerable group in this regard, that they in particular should be the subject of special compensation arrangements, as are the Garda Síochána?</P>

I am telling the Deputy that from the records being kept that information is not readily available and to give it would be at the expense of a disproportionate amount of Garda time which would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>Between the date on which the statement was made and the date on which it was brought to the attention of the British Court of Appeal, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and the Department of Foreign Affairs were involved in consideration and discussions on the matter.  While this was necessary, it does appear that the matter was not dealt with with the necessary dispatch.  I am examining the matter in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with a view to ensuring that delays of this nature do not occur in future.</P>
      <P>I understand that when the court in question had examined the statement, the Lord Chief Justice ruled that the evidence was not credible, and the court declined to admit it.  This, however, does not take from the fact that delay did arise.</P>

Could I bring to his attention, and ask him to bring it to the attention of those involved in the unduly lengthy discussion about this statement, that the delay in making the statement available to the lawyers acting for the Birmingham Six could have seriously prejudiced the outcome of this case?  The comments made by the Lord Chief Justice related to the statement which was handed into court.  The delay that resulted in the statement being made available to the lawyers acting on behalf of the Birmingham Six meant that the person who made the statement could not be called as a witness before the Court of Appeal.  That person, if called as a witness, might have had evidence to offer which not only would have been credible but which could have considerably enhanced the case being made on behalf of the Birmingham Six that they were not guilty of the offences of which they have been convicted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question on 13 May 1987 it is my intention, before commencing a review of Garda matters of the kind referred to in the Programme for Government, to have discussions with the Garda Commissioner and with all the Garda representative associations as to the precise form such a review might take.  The report which the commissioner has been requested to make to the Government in the aftermath of the recent kidnapping investigation will also <Col N="1770" /> have a bearing on the matter.  As I indicated in an Adjournment Debate on security matters on 10 November, the Government will consider this report before deciding on any action that may be called for in relation to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As regards a police authority, there can be no question of allowing any form of independent body to take over responsibility for the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána will have to remain answerable to the Dáil through the Minister for Justice and the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined clearly in my initial reply what my intentions are.  I have had informal discussions with the present Garda Commissioner and his predecessor, and I will be in a position to have further discussions as soon as I receive proposals and suggestions and when consideration has been given to them.  It is also important that the Deputy recognise that the report which the Government sought in connection with the recent kidnapping investigation will also have a bearing on the matter when recommendations are being made to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pretty awful that in seven months the Minister has not had an opportunity to meet these associations.  If he was serious about changing the structures, particularly the management structure, in the force he would have met them by now.  Would the Minister agree given that next year the Garda Síochána will cost £273 million to run, it is now time that the archaic procedures under which they operate should be up-dated as a matter of urgency to allow the Garda Síochána to operate more efficiently and in a more cost-effective manner? Secondly, would the Minister also agree that it is time to remove once and for all from the taint of political interference the <Col N="1771" /> appointment procedure for senior Garda officers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21, 23, 28 and Priority Question No. 37 together.</P>
      <P>In replying to these questions I want to explain the background to the matters that are referred to and to put them in proper perspective.</P>
      <P>The reductions referred to are relatively very minor and must be regarded in the light of the serious state of the public finances and the measures which have had to be taken across the board to reduce public expenditure.  The overall funds available to the Government to run the public services in 1988 have had to be determined by the Government in the light of the critical need to restore order to the public finances.  As is very widely known, a major review of all public expenditure was initiated in May last. This review, which applied to every area of the public service, had the specific objective of achieving very significant reductions in expenditure.  It was, by specific Government direction, undertaken on the basis that no area of public expenditure could be regarded as sacrosanct and that no service or scheme was immune from scrutiny to see if it could be eliminated or reduced.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána had, prior to this review, emerged relatively unscathed from the effects of the cutbacks, arising from our financial difficulties, which had been affecting practically all other services for a very considerable time.  For example, the Garda Síochána, almost uniquely, were exempted from the staffing embargo which applied generally throughout the public service.</P>
      <P>The continuing seriousness of the financial situation meant that there could no longer be an exception for the Garda Síochána and that every aspect of the service they provide had to come under the scrutiny of the review I have referred to.  This scrutiny was in fact carried out by Garda management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in this context that Garda management came to the conclusion that &ldquo;parading time&rdquo; could be terminated and that certain other services could be reorganised, in furtherance of the objective of reducing public expenditure.  In the <Col N="1774" /> judgment of Garda management, none of these measures will seriously affect the effectiveness of the force.  In relation to &ldquo;parading time&rdquo;, for example, the view is that necessary briefing can be provided by other means than by attendance which involved the payment of overtime.  I understand that the up-to-date communications system now available to the force has a role to play in this.  This is, of course, a matter for Garda management who must exercise the responsibility of ensuring that all Garda resources are utilised with maximum effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government, in deciding on expenditure reductions, took fully into account the vital importance of the Garda service to the community.  This is reflected in the fact that the financial allocation made in respect of the Garda Síochána for 1988 represents an increase of 1 per cent in the allocation for 1987 and the savings in overtime and allowances represent a reduction of less than threequarters of 1 per cent in the overall allocation. It must be accepted that a reduction of this amount is minor in the context of reductions which have had to be applied elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances that I have outlined it must also be accepted that there is genuinely no prospect that the overall allocation of funds for the Garda Síochána in 1988 can be increased.</P>
    <P>I have already met representatives of the Garda associations and explained all of these matters to them.  I would again express the hope that they and the members they represent, will accept the genuineness and the reality of the position as I have outlined it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there are some areas in the public service where it is both unwise and impossible to reduce the level of public expenditure and that one of those areas happens to relate to the security of the State? The other area, which is the one we are arguing about at present, is primary education.  Added to this problem is the reduction in the numbers of gardaí that will be available to the public because of the non-recruitment policy <Col N="1775" /> that is now being pursued.  I am quite certain that the Garda Síochána may find a way of briefing other than by the payment of overtime for parading time. Surely that was initiated in the first place for the purpose of briefing members of the Garda Síochána who were about to go on duty about what had happened in the previous hours when they were not on duty.</P>
      <P>Further I would like to ask the Minister if he could justify to the House why the services of the juvenile liaison officers and other officers involved in crime prevention will not be available to the public at weekends because of cuts in overtime. I understand that the moneys involved in relation to the juvenile liaison officers and the other officers involved in crime prevention is small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister, in view of the announcement yesterday by the Minister for Finance of a £1 million saving in 1987 in the Garda Vote, if he would review the Government's decision to cutback on Garda overtime and to dispense with the services of juvenile liaison officers and crime prevention officers at weekends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Barrett's series of supplementary questions I think he will appreciate that I have covered most of what he further requested of me by way of information in my initial reply.  Of course, I appreciate the Deputy's concern, as does everybody, with regard to cuts right across the board.  Cases have been made here against all the cuts in all the Departments. As I said to the Deputy, the cuts in the Department of Justice are of a very minor nature.  In fact there is only a one per cent decrease in the allocation for 1988 over 1987.  No other member of the Government could stand up and say that they had that percentage decrease as far as their Department were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Barrett said, there is a <Col N="1776" /> reduction in the number of gardaí as a result of the public service embargo.  I have asked the Garda Commissioner to see whether a number of gardaí who are involved in what one might term desk jobs could be deployed to other places.  That is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  On the question of recruitment, the House will know that there is no provision made in the 1988 Estimates for additional gardaí.  That shows the seriousness of the situation as it is at present.  With regard to overtime being paid for parade time, there is a saving on this of £1.7 million.  Having attended a meeting of Ministers for the Interior-Justice during the past few days I failed to find any police force who have a system like ours where parading time is on an overtime basis.  It does not exist anywhere.  It went out in the year of dot.  As Deputy Harney suggested a few minutes ago we are reorganising, rebuilding and restructuring, and getting ready for the year 2,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and yet we are anxious to maintain, if at all possible, this type of set up.  The Garda management have said quite definitely that there is no need whatsoever for overtime parading &mdash; briefing time.</P>
      <P>As regards the other associations and sections of the Garda mentioned by Deputy Barrett &mdash; he only mentioned the juvenile liaison officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a minute.  Grouped with the juvenile liaison officers are three other very small groups.  They are very small in numbers but by organising their efforts during the ordinary five day week the saving here will be £0.3 million.  As well as talking about JLOs and crime prevention officers, we are talking about public service vehicle inspectors and weights and measure sergeants.  The Garda management have assured me that in no way <Col N="1777" /> will the efficiency of the force be interferred with to any degree by reorganising the way these people carry out their duties and they can give the service which is required during the normal Monday to Friday week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the role of the juvenile liaison officers.  There is no doubt that the work done by these members of the force is very valuable in the area of crime prevention. Surely the Minister is unwise to take those members out of the districts they work in at weekends when youth are available through sports clubs and other clubs.  It is not correct to say that those involved in that work are satisfied that they can do the work properly by working on a nine to five basis, five days a week. That is not the view of those men in the field.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that decision in relation to the juvenile liaison officers because it saves money in the long term, whether it is in the area of health or crime prevention.  If we prevent crime rather than have to deal with it later on that will save money and if we prevent illness we will save on medical bills later on.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider that.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, in the course of his reply to my previous question, that there was no shortage of funds on the part of the Government when it came to dealing with the security of the State and crime. I maintain that this is one area in which it is very unwise for the Government to interfere.  This is particularly so when we are dealing with a reduction in numbers in the force.</P>

    <Title>Abattoirs Bill, 1987    [Seanad]:    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was responding to the various points raised by a number of Members.  Deputy Flood was concerned about the collection of fees by local authorities and the possible problems that could arise for local authorities in the collection of outstanding slaughtering inspection fees.</P>
      <P>I hope it will prove to be the exception rather than the rule for a local authority to have to go to court to seek recovery of fees.  In the first instance, section 45 makes it an offence not to pay fees and the penalties for breaches of that provision are substantial enough to ensure that nobody reneges.  Secondly, the local authority will have an immediate remedy at hand in that the offender's meat may not be inspected and stamped fit for human consumption.  The question of revoking the abattoir licence would also come into play should a proprietor refuse to remit the slaughtering inspection fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, particularly <Col N="1803" /> Deputies O'Keeffe, McCoy, Stagg and Durkan, raised the health mark arrangements for meat.  Carcases will be stamped on each hind and forequarter.  In addition, bovines will be stamped on the strip-lion on the back.  Each individual piece of meat will not be stamped and, furthermore, it is not necessary.  Any person checking up on the matter need only go to the butcher's cold room and check the carcases or quarters hanging there to establish that adequate marking has taken place.  There will be no problem about giving a distinctive number to each abattoir and which number, for tracing purposes, will be reflected in the stamp. Regulations under section 40 will cover the stamping arrangements including the certification of meat being consigned in boxes or packages from abattoirs.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCoy adverted to the levies payable under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979.  Levies under that Act have been paid on all bovine slaughterings at both export plants and at domestic abattoirs since their introduction in 1979. Section 51 of the Bill merely contains technical amendments to the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act consequent on the Bill and does not, as would appear to have been suggested by Deputy McCoy, impose any new liability for payment of the levy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock questioned the exclusion of rabbits and deer from the animals to be covered by the Bill.  Rabbits are excluded from the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo; as in recent years they have not been a factor in the home trade.  Those concerns which are engaged in rabbit production-slaughtering are doing so for export purposes.  As such, they are already covered under the Agricultural and Fishery Products (Regulation of Export) Act, 1947, and the Export of Poultry and Rabbits Order, 1950.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to deer is that currently there are no regulations on either the export or home side.  A further factor is the involvement of the Forest and Wildlife Service through the Wildlife Dealing Regulations, 1977, and the issue of licences thereunder.  The inclusion of <Col N="1804" /> deer in the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo; under the Bill would, in effect, mean that all deer slaughtering premises, usually referred to as larders, would come under the control of local authorities.  This would have implications for export inspection and certification as it is the Department's veterinary inspectors who currently supervise and certify, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, venison for export, mainly to Germany.  Currently, the whole question of deer farming is being examined and, pending the result of such examination, it is considered best to omit deer from the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the exclusion of rabbits and deer from the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo; under the Bill, there is provision in section 39 (3) for establishing their fitness for human consumption when they are slaughtered or found hanging in a local abattoir.  This would arise occasionally.  Further, should volume slaughterings of rabbits and deer begin to take place at local abattoirs, I can exercise the power under section 2 (3) (a) and make the species fully subject to the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>I am aware that deer farming is becoming popular as is the consumption of venison. It is the policy of the Government to promote deer farming as an alternative enterprise and I will have no hesitation in exercising the powers under the Bill to include deer should the industry want it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the question of hormones.  I accept his comments on hormones, residues and food additives generally.  We have banned hormones, in common with our EC partners, and we are operating a campaign to detect any illegal use of them.  In the past year there were 20 successful prosecutions for the illegal use of hormones.  I agree with the comments of Deputy Boylan in regard to the standard of hygiene.  I accept that the majority in the trade take great pride in their work and take care to ensure that the meat is hygienically prepared. However, loose and lax enforcement in certain areas provides an ideal breeding ground for unscrupulous operators.  The purpose of the Bill is to tighten up the hygiene regulations nationwide. <Col N="1805" /> Deputy Briscoe was concerned about small abattoirs trying to cater for a large volume of business.  Section 2 provides that an abattoir licence may contain a condition limiting the class or the number of animals that may be slaughtered in an abattoir.  A regulation under section 20 will ensure that no congested conditions obtain in any abattoir.  Deputy Briscoe was concerned about people who had a licence revoked or who transgressed the regulations being given a new licence.  I share his concern but I would not be prepared to go as far as he has suggested. However, I must point out that the Bill provides that an applicant for a licence must be a fit and suitable person to hold such a licence.  Clearly, any previous transgressions would be a factor in the renewal of a licence.  I do not think we will be moving towards becoming a nation of vegetarians just yet but we will ensure that those in the meat and food business prepare and present their produce in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested that we should refuse a licence to those who transgress the law when transporting meat.  Deputy Durkan was also concerned about this matter.  The Department of Health are updating their provisions under the food hygiene regulations in relation to the transport of meat.  The aim of the Department of Agriculture and Food is to ensure that not alone is meat properly prepared under the regulations but that it is transported and presented in a proper manner. We want the whole operation from slaughtering to the consumer carried out with hygienic utensils and by proper modes of transport.  When the Bill has been passed the Departments of Health and Agriculture and Food will introduce regulations to cover the transport of meat and meat products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the transport of offal in open trucks.  I experienced a similar offensive odour from open trucks transporting offal.  I intend to introduce regulations to control that practice.  Regulations made under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, will deal adequately with that matter and we will <Col N="1806" /> endeavour to ensure that that practice is discontinued.  Deputy Durkan also asked about the extension of a licence beyond two months on the death of a licence holder.  I should like to tell him that section 13 which deals with this matter was amended in the Seanad following a long debate.  I introduced an amendment, which was deemed satisfactory by the trade to cover this issue, which was accepted by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan queried the position in relation to the processing of meat.  The cutting up and packaging of meat within abattoirs will be dealt with in regulations to be made under section 20 of this Bill. Outside of abattoirs the provisions of the food hygiene regulations apply and will continue to apply in these operations.</P>
    <P>The question of illegal slaughterings and slaughterings of worn out or debilitated animals was raised by Deputy Durkan.  The control measures in this Bill will put an end to illegal slaughterings and the sale of meat of dubious quality. Furthermore, the ante-mortem inspection of animals before they are slaughtered will ensure that no worn out, debilitated or emaciated animals will be passed as fit for slaughter.  Thus consumers will be assured of meat of the highest possible standards, and I am sure we will be able to improve the quality of meat for Deputy Deenihan's greyhounds in north Kerry as well.</P>

Under the heading of cruelty to animals I will look into the matter.  Meat can be quite discoloured and damaged by that type of activity.  I think, though that it is a pretty rare activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, speakers in both the Seanad and this House were extremely constructive and welcomed the Bill.  A number of matters were raised which do <Col N="1807" /> not relate to the details of the Bill and they can best be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I hope we will have sufficient opportunity to treat them with the attention they deserve.  Some of the other points raised relate to details of matters which are intended to be the subject of regulations under the Bill, and obviously, we are not in a position to go into these in detail today.  However, the interest shown by all the speakers is very heartening and augurs well for the industry here in Ireland.  The geneal purpose of the Bill is to upgrade the standards and give an assurance to the public that when this Bill comes into effect meat processed and prepared for human consumption will be up to the highest possible standards.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since earlier this year when I took up office, I have been very aware of the pollution risk to the Irish coastline from oil tankers.  Ireland is in an especially vulnerable position because of it proximity to the major sea routes, the length of its coastline and the very severe weather which can affect the seas around our coasts.  For these reasons I am very anxious to take whatever steps are necessary to reduce the impact of oil spills in the sea which might happen in the future. There is a serious need for legislation <Col N="1808" /> covering liability for compensation for oil pollution damage caused by oil tankers and I have taken the necessary steps to have this Bill covering this area introduced at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The main aims of this Bill are, first, to ensure that oil tankers entering or leaving Irish ports have adequate insurance to cover their liability for oil pollution damage, secondly, to provide supplemental cover where oil tankers owners' liability is exceeded and, thirdly, to establish a legal framework for recovery of costs connected with oil pollution incidents.  The Bill and consequential regulations will enable Ireland to ratify the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969 and its 1976 Protocol and also the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971 and its 1976 Protocol.  These Conventions are generally referred to as the Civil Liability Convention.  For the information of Deputies I have placed a copy of a booklet which includes both Conventions in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>The Civil Liability Convention obliges owners of ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo to have appropriate insurance to cover liability to a specified limit for oil pollution damage.  The liability limit is £116 approximately per ton up to a maximum of £12 million approximately whichever is the lesser.  The equivalents of these figures are set out in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fund Convention provides for the establishment of a fund financed by oil companies for payment of compensation for oil pollution where shipowners' liability is exceeded up to a current overall maximum of £46 million approximately. This limit has now been increased to approximately £52 million from 1 December 1987, and it is the equivalent of this figure which is referred to in section 21 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The units of account mentioned in sections 10 and 21 are Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund and the actual equivalent in punts will be governed by the exchange rates <Col N="1809" /> applying on a particular day.  The unit of account for both Conventions was originally gold francs and this was changed to Special Drawing Rights of the IMF in the 1976 Protocols to both Conventions.</P>
    <P>At present Ireland is reliant on voluntary international schemes for compensation in the event of oil pollution damage from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo.  These agreements are the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement on Liability for Oil Pollution &mdash; TOVALOP &mdash; and a Contract Regarding a Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution &mdash; CRISTAL.  TOVALOP and CRISTAL were intended to be interim solutions and to remain in operation only until the Civil Liability and Fund Conventions had worldwide application.  While the scope of TOVALOP and CRISTAL is similar to that of the international conventions, it is not possible to incorporate their provisions into national law.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 outline the liability of oil tanker owners for pollution damage and the circumstances under which they can be exempt from liability.  In the event of damage from oil pollution, owners of laden oil tankers will have strict liability for such damage except in a few particular cases, namely when the damage results from an act of war or a grave natural disaster, or the damage is wholly caused by sabotage by a third party or the damage is wholly caused by the failure of authorities to maintain navigational aids.  If the oil pollution damage is proved to have been due to the personal fault of the tanker owner, he will not be able to limit his liability.  Sections 20 and 21 of the Bill cover the liability of the Fund Convention.</P>
    <P>The Fund Convention becomes operable if claimants are unable to obtain full compensation under the Civil Liability Convention for one of the following reasons: no liability arises under the Civil Liability Convention; the owner is financially incapable of meeting his obligations under the Civil Liability Convention and his insurance is inadequate; or the damage exceeds the owner's liability under the Civil Liability Convention.</P>
    <P>However, the fund is not liable for <Col N="1810" /> pollution damage if it is proved that the discharge of oil which caused the pollution resulted from an act of war or was caused by oil which has escaped or been discharged from a warship or resulted from the wilful misconduct of the owner of the ship.</P>
    <P>In relation to those claiming compensation under this legislation, I have included a provision in section 12 whereby, after a court has decided that a shipowner is liable for oil pollution damage, the court may order the payment in court of the amount of the owner's liability.  I feel that this provision will be a useful safeguard to claimants. Furthermore under section 13 where a ship has incurred a liability for oil pollution damage, any other ship in the State which has the same owner may be detained.</P>
    <P>Section 16 outlines the provisions in relation to the insurance of Irish registered ships carrying 2,000 tonnes or more of oil in bulk as cargo and all other ships carrying these quantities of oil to or from Irish ports.  All these must carry insurance certificates showing that the vessels have appropriate insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Inspectors appointed by the Minister for the Marine, surveyors of the Department of the Marine, sea fisheries protection officers and harbourmasters may carry out inspections of ships to ensure that the required insurance certificates are carried on board.  If a ship does not have the required insurance certificate, it may be detained.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress here that the Bill covers liability and compensation for oil pollution damage from laden oil tankers, irrespective of whether the spillage is from cargo oil or bunker oil.  There is no international convention covering liability and compensation for pollution from non-laden tankers or vessels other than oil tankers.</P>
    <P>The detection of defective tankers is now carried out among participating States of Port State Control (PSC) of which Ireland is a member.  Inspections are carried out at all ports of call and any vessel found to be defective is not allowed to put to sea until repairs are carried <Col N="1811" /> out to the satisfaction of the inspecting surveyor.  Regular exchange of information on the findings is communicated between the states and this greatly reduces the risk of damaged vessels arriving in our waters without the port authority concerned having prior notification.</P>
    <P>The fund of the Fund Convention is financed by persons in the contracting states to this convention who receive crude oil and heavy fuel in these states after sea transport.  Section 19 provides for receivers of these types of oil in Ireland to make the appropriate subscriptions to the fund.</P>
    <P>The penalties in section 38 are divided into two categories.  The greater penalties of a fine up to £1 million and/or imprisonment of up to five years in the first subsection are for offences such as a ship ignoring a detention order, a ship not having the required insurance cover and an oil receiver failing to make the required payment to the fund.  The lower penalties in the second subsection are for persons who impede inspectors and harbour master in the exercise of their functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will greatly improve the position in relation to liability and compensation from oil pollution damage caused by oil tankers and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and agree that it is long overdue.  I find it is a reasonable balance between the interests of oil tanker owners and the public at large.  During the passage of this Bill in the Seanad, Members underlined the importance of protecting our 2,000 miles of coastline as we are adjacent to the major sea routes and often prone to adverse weather conditions.  I can only echo their sentiments having recently been present in Cork at a seminar on water pollution organised by Sherkin Island marine station, where I witnessed most vividly and graphically, from the Cork county engineer, details of the clean <Col N="1812" /> up operation of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster. I am only too well aware of the cost and effort that has to be put in to restore coastline damaged by oil pollution.</P>
      <P>Although I welcome the Bill for what it does, it is, in fact, very limited.  It applies only to oil tankers carrying 2,000 tonnes or more of cargo oil, and the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> would not have been covered as the offending oil in that case was fuel oil.  I understand other legislation is in the pipeline to cover other aspects of pollution and other pollution sources.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the Bill are to provide compulsory insurance for all oil pollution damage from oil tankers in Irish waters, to provide extra cover where owners' liability is exceeded, and to provide the legal framework for the recovery of any costs involved in that clean up operation.  The Bill allows us, most importantly, to ratify two conventions, the Civil Liability Convention of 1969 and the Fund Convention, as well as the 1976 protocols which amend the original conventions.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why we are not using this opportunity to ratify the 1984 Civil Liability Convention?  We are among the last of the nations which sat down at the Brussels international legal conference on marine pollution in 1969, in the wake of the 1966 <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster, and drew up the draft Civil Liabilities Convention, to ratify it.  Why can we not, for once, consider early ratification of this latest protocol?  I accept that while this protocol deals with many issues not dealt with in this Bill, such as paying for the clean up operations outside territorial waters or damage caused on a ballast passage, it does create other problems, such as the introduction of special drawing rights in place of the units of account as per section 10 of this Bill, and we could have difficulties with the absence of index linking, together with the provisions of the 1984 protocol, of increasing liability and the provision of breaking the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, problems or not, for us to ignore the 1984 protocol as if it did not exist, and to enact legislation, in many <Col N="1813" /> respects already outdated, needs an explanation from the Minister.  Will it take us another 17 years to ratify the 1984 protocol?  Why not consider it now in conjunction with this legislation?</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom they ratified the Civil Liability Convention in 1971 and in doing so used the precise language of the draft conventions.  The same applies to other countries which have ratified the conventions we are discussing this evening. Concern has been expressed in many maritime legal circles about this Bill departing from the precise wording of the conventions in question.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that he is satisfied beyond doubt that the drafting of this Bill will, in fact, allow us to ratify the conventions in question.  If there is any likelihood of our legislation being challenged on these grounds, we need to amend the wording while we have the opportunity rather than run foul of the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <P>These two conventions were intended to bring about a degree of unification in international maritime law so that the courts may reach the same decisions on the same facts in different jurisdictions. If, in this Bill giving effect to these two conventions, we depart from the text of the conventions, it may not be possible for us to ratify them without being in breach of our obligations to other contracting states.  I await the Minister's assurances on this most important matter.  I do not express just my own concern, but that of many eminent people in maritime legal circles.  They are far from satisfied in relation to the wording in some of the texts in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While awaiting ratification of the two conventions, this country has been covered by two voluntary international schemes for compensation in the event of oil pollution damage from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo.  These are the Tanker Owners' Voluntary Agreement on Liability for Oil Pollution known as TOVALOP and the contract regarding a supplement to tanker liability for oil pollution, better known as CRISTAL. TOVALOP and CRISTAL were intended to be interim solutions until the <Col N="1814" /> civil liability and fund conventions had worldwide application.  I am advised, however, that even when this legislation is enacted the option to claim a gratuitous settlement from TOVALOP will still remain, if an action under the new Act has not already been instigated.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm that this is so. The explanatory memorandum with the Bill indicates that this would not be the position but I am reliably advised that the option will still remain to claim from TOVALOP rather than to proceed under this Bill if and when it is enacted.</P>
    <P>I will look briefly at the different sections of the Bill and, if the Chair will bear with me, I should like to indicate as I go through the Bill some of the areas about which I have particular concern and about which I hope to table amendments. If I do that we might reach agreement in advance of Committee or Report Stages in relation to some of the areas about which I have misgivings and thereby help to speed the passage of the Bill through the House rather than producing amendments &ldquo;cold&rdquo; before Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand that.  On page 6 of the Bill there is a definition in relation to &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  It is most important that it is beyond any doubt in the context of the Bill as to what the State means by the owner of a tanker.  I should like the Minister to recall the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> disaster. In that case, when the matter of damages, etc., was being considered it <Col N="1815" /> was discovered that there was a parent company to which the owning company belonged.  There was also an operating company and finally the ship had been chartered out to a different company.  In terms of the operators of the ship or those responsible for any disaster, you could have had the pick of four companies.  I am not quite sure that our definition of owner would cover all four possibilities, for instance, in an <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> type disaster.  Could the Minister please assure me &mdash; and the House &mdash; that he is satisfied that the definition of owner is sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that nobody would slide out from under their responsibilities because of the wording in the Bill?</P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the second line of section 8 that before the word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; should be inserted.  I do this quite deliberately because the section deals with the exemption from liability for pollution damage and there may have been no intention to do this particular type of damage by the operator of a ship, they may intend to do a different type of damage and so slide out from the responsibility we are trying to nail them with.  The &ldquo;such&rdquo; damage referred to oil pollution damage specifically and perhaps the Minister will consider accepting that amendment.  It is rather simple and of a technical nature but it is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 concerns the limitation on liability for pollution damage.  As the Minister is aware, the right to limit liability is given to ship-owners because of the enormous risks to which a ship-owner is exposed in the modern world.  The ship-owners insure their liability in mutual protection and indemnity associations known to us as the P &amp; I Clubs.  The London P &amp; I Clubs who, between them, insure more than 90 per cent of the world's tonnage each bear the first $750,000 of any claim against any of their members.  Claims are then pooled between the clubs, up to $12 million, after which the excess of any one claim falls on reinsurance underwriters with whom the London group of P &amp; I Clubs <Col N="1816" /> have placed their insurance.  The London group of the P &amp; I Clubs are now insured for 1,000 million US dollars in excess of the 12 million dollars for any one claim.</P>
    <P>So great are the risks to which ship-owners are now exposed that the professional managers of the P &amp; I Clubs are discussing whether they can continue to offer unlimited cover which has always been a feature of P &amp; I.  P &amp; I Club managers seriously believe there is a danger that some day they will be faced with a claim which will go through the present limits of cover which is over 1,000 million dollars.  The limitation of a shipowner's liability has to be considered against this background and the right to limit liability should be virtually unbreakable to provide the element of certainty which is necessary when attempting to negotiate adequate reinsurance cover.</P>
    <P>The test which is applied in section 10 for an entitlement to limit liability is the absence of actual fault or privity.  As the legal profession will confirm to the Minister, these words have been a fruitful cause of litigation for many years.  As I said, if limitations of liability is accepted in principle &mdash; which it is &mdash; the right to limit should be more or less unbreakable to ensure that certain risks are in fact insurable.  For that reason, the more modern tests applied in recent conventions is that the entitlement to limit liability should be contingent on the ship-owner, that he or she did not commit an act or omission with the intent of causing the damage which gives rise to the liability nor that he acted wrecklessly or with the knowledge that such damage probably would result.  Perhaps a lot of these issues will be cleared up when the limitation convention of 1976 comes before us for ratification.  I await the Minister's response to the particular difficulties in that section and the interpretation of fault or privity and its relationship to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also have grave misgivings about section 13 which appears to usurp the role of the Admiralty Marshal.  The IMO could again find us in breach of the CLC which, to my knowledge, does not include such a detention power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> One of the main purposes of the Bill is to ensure the compulsory insurance of any oil tanker in our waters.  If in such a case where the tanker is insured an oil pollution accident occurs, can the Minister say in what circumstances an inspector or harbour-master would be entitled to detain the ship?  Effectively indefinitely, as the procedure for court determination of the entitlement to limit liability could last for months under this section.  What if the ship owner is not entitled to limited liability as per section 13 (2)?  According to this section, the ship could never be released but left to rot in port.  I also question the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; on page 11, section 13 (2), line 30.  Would it not be better to substitute the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; so that the section would read: &ldquo;Where the court has determined that a person, who has incurred a liability for pollution damage under section 7, is entitled to limit his liability or such person has paid into court a sum of not less than the amount determined by the court to be the limit of his liability ...?  In other words, if the polluter concerned had discharged his obligations in terms of paying for any damages done, surely he would be entitled to have the ship released even if he could not prove he was entitled to limited liability?  I would rather &ldquo;or&rdquo; than &ldquo;and&rdquo; in that case; we are protected either way.</P>
    <P>A ship, if insured, has done all required of it under the Civil Liability Convention. This detention provision could be considered penal.  There is, incidentally, no provision in UK law, the 1971 Act specifically, for such detention and it shows a misunderstanding of what the Civil Liability Convention is all about.  I would draw the Minister's attention to this entire section which I feel is superfluous and unnecessary.  I have no difficulties at all in relation to the detention of ships under section 13 in criminal cases, I support that fully, but the detention of ships in civil cases, I do not accept as necessary and I am of the view that it is penal.  I await with great interest the Minister's detailed explanation as to why this section is necessary in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I felt this section <Col N="1818" /> usurps the role of the Admiralty Marshal. In fact, the Admiralty Marshal would need a court order for a ship's arrest in the first place.  He would also need a sworn affidavit in court effectively a <i>prima facie</i> case, before he could detain a ship and finally a ship owner could lodge a <i>caveat</i> against arrest by undertaking to pay a bond in the case of the action by the Admiralty Marshal.  We intend to proceed in a far more penal manner, which I do not find acceptable in a civil action.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with the insurance of the ships in question.  As I have said, the power of detention in section 16 is most important where there is no insurance, in other words, in a criminal case, and I support it entirely.  It is only in civil cases as envisaged under section 13 that I oppose the power of detention as outlined. However, further complications arise in this area under section 34.  I will deal with that section now, if I may, because it is directly related to the two sections detailing the powers of detention.</P>
    <P>Under section 34 an inspector who detains a ship will have to go to the District Court and indicate that there is a contravention of the Act when, in fact, there will be no contravention of the Act, because the Act provides that, if the ship is in fact insured, we are dealing with a civil action and there is no contravention. Either the ships owner's liability will be limited, as per the insurance terms, or in the case where the claim goes over and above the limit of liability, the fund convention comes into action and takes the surplus claim on board.  In section 34, we are asking an inspector who wants to further detain a ship to go to the District Court and prove there is a contravention of the Act when, in fact, there can be none if the ship is insured.  On the other hand, the harbour-masters do not have to apply to the District Court under section 13 for the continued detention of a ship.  I refer the Minister to the wording of the first three lines of section 34:</P>
    <P>Whenever an inspector, in exercise of his powers under this Act, or a harbour-master, <Col N="1819" /> in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 16...</P>
    <P>The harbour-master has no powers to go to a court under section 13 by the wording in the first three lines of section 34.  The drafting of section 34 leaves a great deal to be desired.  Perhaps it can be explained, but I doubt it because I have checked in detail with informed sources the point I am now making.</P>
    <P>The harbour-master does not have to go to the District Court under section 13 for continued detention of a ship.  Again, in theory, the ship could be left in the port to rot if it had been detained by a harbour-master under section 13.  To my knowledge, there is no way of getting the ship out of detention as per section 34.  If an inspector detains a ship under section 13, there is a way out, providing he can convince the court that it is in contravention of the Act which cannot be so under section 13 in a civil case.  Providing he can do that Houdini trick, in theory the ship can be released but if a harbour-master detains a ship under section 13 he can never get the ship released through a District Court or otherwise because the provision is not there for him to do so. The whole idea of allowing power of detention when a ship is insured must be completely reviewed.  Powers of penal detention in civil cases are totally against the spirit of the Civil Liability Convention which we are trying to ratify here today.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with section 28 (1) (c). In certain political circumstances it might not be possible to gain entry to defend a case.  For example, if an Israeli was trying to defend a case in a Syrian court, politically this would not be possible.  This eventually should be provided for by amending section 28 (1) (c).  Such an amendment, in fact, was accepted from the Israeli delegates during the drafting in 1969 in Brussels of the Civil Liability Convention.  We need such a provision in our own law and I ask why it is not there. I ask the Minister to take this point on board and amend section 28 (1) (c) to allow for any political difficulties that may arise for the claimant or defendant <Col N="1820" /> in putting their case before the courts under this Act.</P>
    <P>I would like, if I may, under section 32 (2) (i) to give the Minister notice that I will be proposing an amendment which I feel is essential in view of the fact that as yet we have no civil evidence Act here. For the sake of clarity I shall read the paragraph into the record:</P>
    <P>copy an entry in any document required by this Act or by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977, to be kept and require the person by whom the document is kept to certify the copy as a true copy of the entry;</P>
    <P>It concerns evidential requirements when eventually we get to court under this Bill. As I have said, we do not have any civil evidence Act.  We rely on common law for what may or may not be admitted as evidence in court.  This, as we know, will lead to obvious difficulties and in cases likely to be brought under this Bill, they will be particularly acute.  Technical reports and what may be considered as classified documents would not have evidential value in court.  Our legal system has survived to date, notwithstanding these difficulties, as virtually all maritime claims of this nature have been settled out of court.</P>
    <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> case illustrates the difficulties that may arise under this type of provision in the section.  In the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> case the receiver of wrecks drew up a report for the Department, having interviewed the captain and all the crew.  This report by the receiver of wrecks was not for public dissemination and, therefore, will not be available as evidence in court for the fishermen who are pursuing a claim against the owners of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  Likewise in the <i>Betelgeuse</i> inquiry, if this had proceeded here, Justice Costello's report would not have had evidential value in court.</P>
    <P>I wish to indicate the content of the amendment I will be circulating on Committee Stage.  I feel we might possibly get agreement on it because I do not think it is contentious in any way.  I would like section 32 (2) (i) to continue in this way. <Col N="1821" /> After the semicolon following &ldquo;entry&rdquo; it should read as follows &ldquo;the said copy shall have same evidential value as the original and may be proved to the court by the inspector who made the copy.&rdquo;  That is the exact wording of the amendment I should like to circulate on which I hope to have the Minister's agreement.  The reason I am proposing this amendment is quite clear.  A ship which accidentally causes oil pollution damage and which is covered by insurance might have long since left our territorial waters by the time the case gets to court.  If we do not accept copies of the original evidence, such as the logbook, which displays the discharging and the offloading of the oil at different ports it may be nigh impossible to get the captain, the crew or whoever the relevant member is back into our Irish courts to give first-hand evidence or to produce the original logbook as the original evidence.  My amendment seeks to make provision for the fact, as we do not have evidential law in this country, that certified copies of the evidence may be produced in court by the original copier of that evidence and that that would be accepted as evidence in the particular case.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 33 (1) (c) I will also be circulating the same amendment, substituting &ldquo;harbour-master&rdquo; for `inspector&rdquo;.  One deals with the inspector's role and the next one deals with the harbour-master's role.  Effectively section 33 (1) (c) would continue to read as printed in the Bill.  There is a colon at the end of paragraph (c), not a semicolon for some interesting reason; there were semicolons in the previous section but after the colon which would have to become a semicolon we would insert the same amendment except giving the same powers to a harbour-master who may have made a copy of the original document. In view of what I have outlined I feel this amendment is essential.  The original logbooks kept by captains in relation to the loading and discharge of oil could long since be gone out of our jurisdiction and it may not be possible to get them back in court.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like the Minister to <Col N="1822" /> consider the wording of section 34 (b) extremely carefully.  I would like him to tell me what it is envisaged the harbour-master shall in fact do.  We cannot leave this section without reading it.  I do not know whether it was ten, a dozen or two dozen times I read this most convoluted sentence and, without any shadow of a doubt I have come to the conclusion that words are missing from it.  It is sufficiently long &mdash; 12 lines &mdash; so I must be forgiven for being confused by it.  I think I have studied it long enough and hard enough to say with some conviction that it is not just confusion but that in the drafting of paragraph (b), words have been left out. As I said earlier I have grave misgivings about the drafting of this section.  This is my second point in relation to section 34. I might, for the benefit of the Minister, read the section and perhaps he will be able to agree with me.  Section 34 specifies the provisions which shall have effect and paragraph (b) reads:</P>
    <P>where an inspector or harbour-master has, in the exercise of the powers conferred on him under this Act, detained a ship, he shall, as soon as may be, if proceedings for an offence under this Act have been, or are about to be, instituted before a District Justice and thereupon the District Justice shall,...</P>
    <P>At that point we depart from what the inspector or harbour-master shall do because the rest of that paragraph refers to what the district justice shall do.  We are told what the district justice shall do but at no point do we find out what the inspector or harbour-master shall do.  I would draw the Minister's attention to that.  Perhaps he will be able to solve the riddle on Committee Stage, put in the missing words and make sense of the provision, not only for me but for those who will be trying to operate it.  Unless we clarify it it will be a fruitful source of litigation and escape from the whole point of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the deficiencies which will remain after the passage of this Bill are comparable to those which exist generally <Col N="1823" /> in maritime law.  This Bill will be complemented by the other pieces of pollution legislation and by the limitation convention which I hope will be before the House fairly soon.  The Minister has my support for the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to make a detailed section by section analysis of the Bill at this stage.  That is much more appropriate on Committee Stage.  I just want to deal with the general principle of the Bill and to say that I welcome it.  I am sure that all parties in the House will welcome the introduction of this measure which should go a long way to ensuring that the consequences of oil pollution at sea can be more effectively dealt with.  There is now a much greater public awareness of the necessity for keeping our environment free of pollution, from all sources, and this awareness certainly extends to the sea and the horrendous consequences that can arise as a result of oil pollution.</P>
      <P>The Bill will fill a major gap in our legislation when it comes into operation. There will be legally binding requirements covering liability and compensation for oil pollution damage from oil tankers.  The Minister in his opening remarks, quite rightly, said that we are vulnerable to this kind of damage as we are located adjacent to major sea routes and we are subjected to very adverse weather conditions which greatly affect the seas around our coast and, consequently, increase the risks of accidents at sea.  We have had a reputation for being a pollution free country but unfortunately we have had bad experiences with land, sea and air pollution in recent years.  We must take whatever steps are necessary &mdash; particularly measures that are within our own control &mdash; to ensure that we minimise the risk of pollution in all these areas so that the consequences of pollution can be dealt with effectively and speedily and indeed prevented from happening in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> episode we are only too familiar with the damage that oil pollution can cause to <Col N="1824" /> our beaches and bird life.  Fisheries and tourism are two very important industries in this country but their potential can be greatly affected by oil pollution and environmental damage generally.  It is unfortunate that the damage caused by oil leaks from a ship cannot always be compensated for purely in terms of money because it can give rise to environmental problems that would have long ongoing consequences and indeed might never be resolved so it is not just the money issue that is at stake &mdash; the compensation for clean up and so on &mdash; it is also the continuing difficulties that would remain and which might never be resolved.</P>
    <P>Apart from the compensation aspects of the Bill I am glad to note that Part V provides for wide powers of inspection of tankers.  This is very welcome.  A high standard of inspection of ships is most important to ensure that they comply with all necessary maintenance requirements and particularly at present when the oil industry is not as prosperous as it was and when the oil transportation business has not been as profitable either in recent years.  I have no doubt that there are unscrupulous operators operating tankers which are defective and that they are not spending adequate amounts of money in maintaining those ships.  I hope that the inspection powers provided for in this Bill will be fully utilised and that the Minister will make sufficient personnel available to ensure that full and adequate inspections are carried out.</P>
    <P>This raises another point because I understand that the coming into operation of this measure will not necessarily result in any additional costs to the Exchequer.  If that is the case, is the Minister satisfied that the personnel he has already available to him are adequate both in terms of numbers, ability and competence to carry out the necessary inspections and other monitoring functions? Does the Minister think he will require additional staff for this purpose and, if so, can he redeploy them from other Departments if they are not available within his own Department?  This is an important matter and I would like <Col N="1825" /> the Minister to address it because proper inspection of these tankers is the only real safeguard we have against spillages occurring at sea.  I am sure the Minister will agree that in this case prevention is much better than cure particularly when dealing with the aftermath of an oil spillage.</P>
    <P>At present Ireland is reliant on voluntary international schemes for compensation in the event of oil pollution damage from ships carrying oil as cargo and this is not satisfactory.  The main purpose of this Bill is for Ireland to give effect to two international conventions, the Civil Liability Convention, 1969, and the Fund Convention, 1971.  As the Minister has stated, the Civil Liability Convention obliges the owners of ships to have appropriate insurance cover up to a specified limit for oil pollution damage and, in addition, the Fund Convention provides for the establishment of a fund which is financed by the oil companies and this is to provide cover where ship-owners' liability under the Civil Liability Convention is exceeded.  These are two comprehensive measures and we should ratify these conventions as speedily as possible.  Like Deputy Doyle, I feel it is regrettable that we have not done so before now as we might have been in a much better position to cope with and indeed to prevent some of the problems we have experienced in this area in the past.  As I have said, I do not understand why we have not given effect to these conventions before now.  At least it is to be welcomed that we are about to do so now.</P>
    <P>It is a comfort to know that with the passing of this Bill oil tankers which enter our territorial waters will have to have adequate insurance to cover their liability for oil pollution damage.  I am also pleased to note that the Bill provides a legal framework for the recovery of costs in connection with oil pollution incidents. In the past the hard pressed local authorities had to find resources to cope with the aftermath of an oil spillage and they may or may not be able to bring a claim successfully to recover the costs of a clean-up operation against the owners of <Col N="1826" /> these vessels.  It is also very useful to have a measure in the Bill where, if a ship has incurred a liability for oil pollution damage and has left the jurisdiction, the State has the power to detain any other ship which is owned by the same company if it comes into Irish territorial waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  There are weaknesses in this Bill as is to be expected.  One of them is that the measures in the Bill will not apply to ships which are not registered in countries that have ratified the conventions.  I think I am right in putting that interpretation on the Bill and I ask the Minister to confirm it in his reply.  If that is the case we do not have total control over the situation. I would like the Minister to tell us how many countries which are involved in the transport of oil have signed these international conventions and whether there are any countries whose ships will be continuously using sea routes near the Irish coast that have not yet ratified these conventions.  I fully accept that we cannot compel such countries to join the convention because that is outside our control but does the Minister have any plans, either at EC level or at international level, to encourage countries that have not yet ratified these conventions to do so?</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that in the case of oil rigs which are operating in Irish waters a condition of their exploration and production licences is that they are required to have substantial insurance cover to meet any liabilities that arise as a result of oil spillage at sea.  In that case we have direct control over the matter.  In relation to the last point, I presume that if a ship spills oil in international waters and ultimately that oil pollutes the Irish coastline, if we can prove that the oil spillage came from a particular ship the provisions of this Bill would apply to that ship if it was registered in a country that had ratified the conventions.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to clarify the position in relation to exemptions for <Col N="1827" /> liability that are given in particular cases, namely, when the damage to a ship results from an act of war or from a grave natural disaster.  I would like to know what constitutes a grave natural disaster. Is a violent storm at sea which results in the loss of a vessel and the consequent pollution of the sea be exempted?  Do we have to define the severity of storms to determine liability or who decides this? Does the court make the decision in that case and, if so, are there any precedents the Minister could cite that would enlighten us further in this area?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the position regarding the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster.  I understand the insurance provisions laid down in the conventions apply only to ships that are actually laden with oil.  The Minister has stressed this point in his speech. I understand the situation regarding the pollution from a ship such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which was caused by the vessel's engine oil leaking into the sea after the vessel had gone down is not covered under these conventions.  I further understand that new legislation is at present being prepared to deal with that type of problem.  When does the Minister expect to bring that legislation before the House because obviously it is very badly needed?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to confirm my party's support for the principle of the Bill.  We will certainly be voting for it at the end of Second Stage.  We will of course be giving detailed consideration to the various sections on Committee Stage and we will be addressing many of the technical points raised by Deputy Doyle in her contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this Bill. Anybody who has an interest in the environment of his country could not possibly see anything wrong with a Bill which attempts to protect the environment and to punish those who do not so wish.  Like Deputy O'Malley, one matter that concerns me is the fact that bunker fuel is not directly covered in this Bill but it will be covered in subsequent Bills.  There are two matters concerning this, firstly, the <Col N="1828" /> fuel of the ship and, secondly, the cargo. A certain problem has arisen in relation to that matter.  For many years many of the eastern European countries insisted that in each port they had a facility to ensure that when ships were carrying oil and they took on board water for balance they had a facility to filter the water before putting it back into the sea.  Many of the western European and eastern countries did not have that facility and this ballast fuel was pumped into the sea and this created untold pollution.  Oil pollutes the beaches and the shores where it affects fish.  It is essential that we bring in legislation to deal with this matter and this legislation seems to cover it in many ways.</P>
      <P>I have a great interest in the environment of our country.  As an island State it is absolutely essential that we bring in this type of legislation and the more severe and critical it is the better.  The ownership of many of the ships of today is rather dubious.  It is extremely difficult even to check the ownership of these ships.  Any powers we can give the harbour-master in the major harbours are agreeable to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State for the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Doyle, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Stafford for their contributions.  All of those contributions will be most helpful on Committee Stage.  I will look at the various amendments which no doubt will be circulated and if they improve the Bill we will accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill ratifies two conventions. Deputy Doyle referred to the fact that it took 17 years to ratify this convention.  I agree that this is much too long.  When the Department of the Marine was set up we became acutely aware of the necessity to ratify these conventions.  Since the conventions of 1969 and 1971 the Government have accepted in principle the duties and liabilities of both conventions subject to the legislation being introduced. It has taken a long time but it is now being dealt with.  This Bill could well pass through this House this evening <Col N="1829" /> depending on the amendments which we may receive on Committee Stage.  It is vitally important to enact this legislation because our coasts, particularly the west coast is extremely vulnerable.  There was no cover for the many vessels carrying cargoes of oil.  The only cover was from the voluntary contributions from the fund.  We were very fortunate that at least that type of insurance was there and that many interested parties, in their own best interest, contributed towards that fund. However, it is important to have this Bill enacted so that there is complete cover.</P>
    <P>The Members present in the House are fully <i>au fait</i> with the situation in relation to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>.  While this does not cover a <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>-type disaster it is very important.  The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster is covered under the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Bill 1977. We are pursuing the insurers in this case for £1.75 million approximately and we are confident of success in this claim.  I take this opportunity to thank the many people who were involved in the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> mop up, the officials in my Department, in the Department of the Environment and Cork County Council who did an excellent job.  That disaster impressed upon me the necessity to have this legislation enacted as quickly as possible. In the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster we were only talking about bunker oil or fuel oil, whereas this refers specifically to cargo.  It also includes fuel oil.  A spillage from a cargo vessel carrying crude oil is also covered.</P>
    <P>I hope to be able to bring in a further Bill shortly to tie up all the loose ends and further strengthen the legislation. The 1984 Convention protocol includes some worthwhile provisions, which are not as high a priority as the provisions proposed here.  When this Bill is implemented we hope to return to that and include the 1984 protocol.  We did not wish to delay this Bill any further by including the 1984 protocol at this time. We had waited 17 years and did not consider it wise to delay this Bill further.  We will not have to wait 17 years to deal with <Col N="1830" /> the 1984 protocol.  We will deal with it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that the wording of the Bill is not the same as the wording of the Convention.  Here I am entirely in the hands of the Parliamentary Draftsman who advises me that a simple translation of the text of the Convention into legislation would not be sufficient but that in this Bill the exact same effect is achieved. I can confirm that it will not be open to affected interests to apply to TOVALOP as well as to seek compensation under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is as comprehensive as the draftsman could make it.  Between now and Committee Stage I will certainly have a further look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Deputy O'Malley questioned the inspectorate.  I have no doubt that there are an adequate number of inspectors at the moment.  The inspectors and harbour-masters have adequate experience to deal with this.  If pollution is caused some distance from our coasts but it affects our coasts, we will be in a position to pursue the owners of the vessels responsible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle referred to section 13 and her comments will be taken into account on Committee Stage.  I will be happy to consider the Deputy's points and include them as necessary.  We have waited 17 years for this and we might be wise to wait a further seven days, and possibly take this next week, when we have further legal advice in relation to the inspectorate and any other inspector who may be appointed by the Minister for the Marine to take a case to the District Justice for decision.  There appears to be some ambiguity certainly in relation to section 34 in relation to the powers of detention, and it will be cleared up.  We have no intention of detaining any vessel for a very long period.  Indeed there are difficulties in all of our ports due to insufficient berths.  We certainly would not be over-enthusiastic about some of these ships using berths needed for our boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> In relation to the question whether the original as against the copies would be accepted these are all matters which we will tease out next week on Committee Stage if it is being taken then.  I assure Deputy Stafford that the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> situation will be tightened up with further legislation that will be brought before the House in the near future.  At the moment legislation is being drafted in relation to the pumping of waste oil or sewage from boats.  All that comes under another Bill which we hope to bring before the House in the next session.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked about the number of countries which have ratified the Convention.  As of early October 1987, 36 countries had signed the Convention and I hope that next week we will be added to that list.  A list of countries involved will be available to Deputies. All those in the business of carrying oil will be included.  When a claim exceeds the limit we can fall back on the Convention fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also referred to the question of exemptions.  That will be a matter entirely for the courts.  An example would be a severe hurricane occurring without warning, such as the one which struck southern England a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Opposition Deputies would be prepared to continue and take Committee Stage but I would have grave reservations in so far as there are references to international law.

      <P>Deputy Crotty has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Questions Nos. 79, 80 and 81 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter in question is the collection of three taxes which are payable by employers, namely VAT, PRSI and PAYE.  Since these taxes are collected by employers they should in the majority of cases be available to the Revenue Commissioners.  There are a number of reasons for believing that the Minister should take a very serious look at this question with a view to improving the collection rate.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the reductions in finance available to all Departments. When any sector experience a cutback they immediately raise a cry about collecting the outstanding taxes due to the State, which it is commonly believed run into hundreds of millions.  We all know that in the main these figures are estimates and that a large number of taxes are not collectable anyway.  For that reason alone we should be realistic.  The ordinary punter in the street is given the impression by media hype that there are hundreds of millions out there which the Minister is not prepared to collect.  This leads to non-compliance with the taxation laws and in the longer term it will lead to anarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more concerned with putting another point of view.  Companies, whether private or public, should be required to pay their taxes when due. This would be of great benefit to the State in that the Revenue Commissioners would be able to gather the funds due. More important, it would be of great <Col N="1833" /> benefit to firms.  Unfortunately these moneys are being used to bolster ailing companies.  We are all human and when we meet a bad patch we are inclined to hold back on payments of VAT, PRSI and PAYE and use the money to fund the company.  This is an ongoing situation. When the Revenue Commissioners eventually bring pressure for payment, the bill and the interest have escalated to such an extent that the business is not in a position to make the funds available and the Revenue Commissioners cannot collect them.  This is a pity.</P>
    <P>If the Revenue Commissioners had a local taxman who could approach firms locally, firms that normally return their taxes but in a particular instance have opted not to do that, it would be of enormous assistance.  Usually there is something wrong when they do not pay and it would be of great benefit if the Revenue Commissioners could approach them at that stage requesting a discussion with them of their problems rather than allowing the arrears to continue.  I am aware of firms who have continued to trade for anything between four to six years after the receipt of the usual circular from the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not consider that to be helpful to such firms because, in the long term, it puts them out of business.  There are other aspects to this matter as well, such as the fact that firms who retain these moneys are being subsidised by the State in order to remain competitive.  That is not fair to competition and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have been questioned on this matter on a number of occasions.  They have always replied that they must draw a very narrow demarcation line between insistence on collection of arrears, on the one hand, and putting firms out of business on the other.  Assistance at the right time from the Revenue Commissioners would ensure that more firms remained in business. However, over a long period the Revenue Commissioners have tended to engage in the practice of non-collection. A number of firms have pointed out that the non-collection of outstanding taxes is <Col N="1834" /> of no benefit to them whatsoever and that they should be collected.  There was a sad case recently of an unfortunate family businessman troubled by his taxation position.  However, I do not want to be come involved in emotional cases.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also that the State is losing substantial amounts of money on account of the fact that firms who do not pay their PRSI, VAT and PAYE contributions are going into liquidation, when usually it is discovered that the largest portion of the money they owe is due to the Revenue Commissioners.  It has been the case also that many such firms start up in the same premises, with the same directors, in the weeks following their liquidation, when it is the State that suffers.  This practice should not be allowed to continue.  A cursory glance at <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> or any of the other publications giving court judgments against firms will show that the largest number of judgments given now are in favour of the Revenue Commissioners, through the Collector-General, for outstanding taxes.  This is very serious and should not be allowed to continue.  Firms should make it known that they are trading down for the benefit of other traders, thus declaring their interest.</P>
    <P>When a firm does not pay its rightful VAT, PRSI and PAYE contributions the alarm bells should be sounded immediately because there must be something wrong when a firm that has paid its contributions over the years suddenly ceases to do so.  In those circumstances the Revenue Commissioners should do more than issue a letter.  They should consult them, ask what is wrong, requesting that they talk about the problem, particularly if it is a persistent one.  If it is the case that the firm is no longer a viable trading concern they should not be allowed to continue in business.  In turn, this means that suppliers are supplying goods to a non-viable concern and but for the fact that the firm concerned is being kept buoyant by the utilisation of those outstanding taxes which have not been collected by the Revenue Commissioners they would have gone out of business.  If such action were taken and assistance <Col N="1835" /> given to them at the right time they would not incur the debt that is usually disclosed when the final shake-up occurs.  It should be remembered also that this has a knock-on effect.  If firms are owed large amounts of money by one that goes into liquidation, in turn, it can lead to their liquidation, having a knock-on or domino effect of firm after firm going out of business.</P>
    <P>I make an earnest appeal to the Minister to carry out a close examination of this problem.  I suggest that he makes extra staff available for collection and local consultation because it is my contention that such consultation could have kept in business many a firm that went into liquidation.  I might suggest also that the Minister examines the cost effectiveness of employing additional staff for the collection of taxes.  There have been such studies conducted in other countries, particularly in England, which have shown quite clearly that the exercise is very much weighted in favour of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister is familiar with the problem of which I speak but voices need to be raised continuously. This matter warrants the attention of all people in public places so that, first, the State is seen to be fair to everyone, second, the State is seen to be helpful and, third, that the allegations that the State has these millions of pounds awaiting collection about which it is doing nothing be refuted.  I ask the Minister to give the matter his urgent consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Crotty for his helpful contribution in relation to this problem which I agree fully is a major one.  Over the years we have encountered the same sort of problem about the amount of arrears outstanding.  This has been demonstrated in the three questions to which the Deputy referred and others in my time in this House, almost 20 years now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective, I will give the House some figures.  I do not know exactly to which years they related <Col N="1836" /> but, in this period there were £31.6 billion tax paid and £693 million collectable. Therefore, it will be seen that while there is a number of defaulters there is a huge number of people who do comply, who pay their taxes, who make their contribution to the running of the State.  We must say to the latter group, &ldquo;a job well done&rdquo;.  We all know paying tax is a painful exercise, that nobody likes it.  However, while the great majority of people pay their taxes, there are others who do not. This Government and previous Governments have taken a number of measures to eliminate evasion and avoidance of tax.  It is good advice for an individual or a company to pay their taxes when they are due, because they can run into sizeable sums, especially when they are the vehicle for collecting PAYE or PRSI.  I remember talking to a hotelier one time whose two monthly VAT returns amounted to £50,000 so that if he missed one payment he could never catch up again; his main ambition was to try to keep up with payments.  Every company and individual would be well advised to do this in their own interests and in the long term interests of their company.  Not paying leads to difficulties.  Some companies close down and open up under a different name across the road.  But the new Companies (No. 2) Bill, and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission arising from their examination of debt collection and the role of the sheriff and so on, should help to eliminate those abuses.</P>
    <P>Turning to the issues we dealt with immediately we came into office, carrying through what the previous Government did in appointing sheriffs throughout the country we appointed the task force and operated a 10 per cent surcharge where returns were not made, and this comes into effect at the end of this month.  There are many factors hitting defaulters so hard that there is not a Deputy in this House who has not been making representations on behalf of those who feel they are under undue pressure.  If they are under pressure it is because they themselves defaulted over <Col N="1837" /> a number of years and allowed themselves to be in this situation.  In dealing with these matters the Revenue Commissioners are, as the Deputy said, walking a tightrope between enforcement and collection and trying to avoid putting institutions or individuals out of business. At the end of the day the Revenue Commissioners have no alternative but to operate the laws passed by this House.</P>
    <P>We dealt with staffing yesterday under other questions, and it is under review. The Deputy suggested that we should look seriously at implementing improvements in collecting and that is an ongoing exercise. The Deputy has been very helpful and all I can do is agree with most of what he said.  I and the Government are committed to dealing with this question of collection and enforcement, stamping out arrears and ensuring prompt payment of tax liabilities as they arise.  This will be given priority.  Any changes considered necessary, administrative or legislative, will be made.  Greater equity in the collection effort must be achieved.  Staff levels in the office of the Revenue Commissioners are already equivalent to about one head of staff for every 150 taxpayers.  Nevertheless, additional resources will be made available as necessary to achieve improved results.  The Revenue Commissioners are drawing up, as a matter of priority, a programme and timetable for reduction and elimination of arrears.  I am taking a keen interest in ensuring that that timetable is realistic and achievable.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the introduction of self-assessment for corporation tax and income tax for the selfemployed. Effective auditing procedures and appropriate penalties must play a major part.  Conditions must be such as to guarantee a significant improvement in compliance.  The range of enforcement powers available to the Revenue Commissioners and the sheriffs is being considered by the Law Reform Commission. The Commission have been asked to make their report on improvements in debt collection generally as soon as is possible.  The requirement to have a tax clearance certificate as a precondition for <Col N="1838" /> securing public contracts over £10,000 is being stringently applied and a similar system is being introduced for all grant payments.</P>
    <P>The introduction of improved identification systems to allow better co-ordination and control is under detailed discussion by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  I felt it was necessary to use this opportunity to emphasise the Government's commitment in this whole area. For too long the impression has been created that, because of taxation measures and savings made on particular Votes, if we only got in the extra taxes we would not have to do certain things. If we get in taxes which are overdue it will help the overall scene, but obviously that will just reduce borrowing and not necessarily lead to a situation where it will not be necessary to have whatever tax levels are required to meet the expenditure commitments of the Government. We have all accepted that taxation levels are high under almost all headings but the base is too narrow.  We have to look at all those factors and ensure that where taxes are due they are paid.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for giving us the opportunity to discuss this and I thank the Deputy for his co-operation in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am <Col N="1784" /> sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate, for obvious reasons, for me to discuss the details of the staffing arrangements at Portlaoise prison.  The security requirements at the prison can vary from time to time and this is reflected in the level of staffing there.  For this reason the level of staffing at the prison is kept under continous review.  I might, however, add that approximately 200 staff are currently being recruited for the Prison Service generally &mdash; primarily as a measure to reduce overtime expenditure &mdash; and some of those staff will be assigned to Portlaoise prison.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1 January 1987 to 1 December 1987 the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal made 601 awards the great majority of which are in respect of private persons.  Payment is outstanding in 313 of these cases.  Payment is also outstanding in 39 cases in which awards were made prior to 1 January 1987, giving a total of 352 cases in which payment is outstanding.  The cost of these cases is estimated at £2.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision of £1.975 million has been made in the 1988 Estimates for the payment of awards made by the tribunal. <Col N="1785" /> Provisions for years subsequent to 1988 will be determined in the context of the Estimates for those years.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on 22 November 1987 five wheel rims and one steering wheel were seized by officers of Customs and Excise from the person in question.  He admitted purchasing the goods in Northern Ireland and importing them via an unapproved road without payment of the import charges. As he had not remained outside the State for 48 hours immediately prior to arrival in the State he was not entitled to any duty-free allowance.</P>
      <P>The person in question rendered himself liable to prosecution under the customs Acts and the goods and vehicle liable to forfeiture.  In this instance, the commissioners are willing to refrain from legal proceedings and release the goods on payment of a compromise sum of £75. This amount takes into consideration the import charge of £37.50 payable on the goods.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The hospital infection research unit was funded for a specified period of time by the Medical Research board.  This funding enabled a number of clinicians to come together to develop new molecular tools for diagnostic and epidemiological studies of bacteria causing hospital infection, prompting rapid effective therapy. This funding is due to cease at the end of December.  The particular strain of M.G.R.S.A. (Methicillin and Gentamicin Resistant Steph. Aureus) referred to by the Deputy was identified and isolated in a Dublin hospital about three years ago.  Isolation procedures were immediately instituted to deal with the case.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that each major hospital in Dublin has a hospital infection unit which will carefully monitor the occurrence of this organism.  Each unit has arrangements made and adequate facilities available, to deal with any situation that may arise.</P>

The temporary nature of the appointment is in accordance with official practice in cases of this kind.  The staffing of the school is being reviewed in the light of the reduction in enrolments since September and my Department will communicate with the reverend chairman of the board of management in the matter.</P>

      <P>To date in 1987 the Gaelic Athletic Association has been allocated £89,000 in grant-aid from the national lottery. Recently the Minister of State at my Department had discussions with the Gaelic Athletic Association in relation to the activities and development projects from which the association is seeking additional funding.  As soon as the final details of these proposals are received I will be happy to have the question of making an additional allocation of funds from the national lottery to the Gaelic Athletic Association further considered.</P>
