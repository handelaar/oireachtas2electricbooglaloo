      <P>The Deputy will be <Col N="1412" /> aware that the status of women is a matter which arises across the whole range of Government policy.  For this reason, I have instructed the members of the Government to advance the position and status of women in all aspects of their responsibilities.  The need for this practical action was made clear in this Government's pre-election Programme for National Recovery.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, will be responsible for co-ordinating the activities of the Departments of Government in this area and for liaison with the Council for the Status of Women.  The specific responsibilities of other Departments in relation to matters affecting the status of women are contained in a statement which I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The Government intend also, with the agreement of the other parties in the Oireachtas, to re-establish as soon as possible the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights as we see this as the best possible source of proposals for positive action, particularly as what is proposed will be brought forward on a non-party basis.</P>
      <P Just="Center">STATEMENT.</P>
      <P>In addition to the responsibilities emerging from their general portfolios, Departments will have specific responsibility in the women's affairs area as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying the matter for me. Would he agree that since in Opposition he appointed a spokesman for women's affairs, he obviously felt there was a necessity for one person to have specific <Col N="1415" /> overall priority for this area?  As he has indicated that this responsibility will rest with the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, he is obviously agreeing that there is a need for one person to have overall responsibility.  Is it his intention to continue in operation the women in business scheme which was run by his Department and which was initiated by the former Minister of State, Deputy Fennell?  What is his view on the agenda for action programme which she published last year?  Do the Government intend implementing the recommendations of that report in relation to the inequalities which still exist in Irish society so far as women are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the statement I am circulating shows that the promotion and monitoring of the women in business enterprise campaign will be the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This is perhaps the most appropriate ministry in this respect.  The other programme is something we should discuss.  I attach a lot of importance to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. That Committee did excellent work in the previous Dáil and brought forward some excellent reports which could form the basis of an all-party approach in this area.  In so far as the various matters are not the specific responsibility of any one Minister, I would like to see them dealt with initially by that committee as soon as we can set it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the fact that the Taoiseach has redistributed the responsibilities which the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs previously held, how does he envisage precisely the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, co-ordinating policy relating to women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will have this type of responsibility in a number of areas.  It would be a natural extension of her general role of co-ordination to ensure that in so far as <Col N="1416" /> the different Departments are concerned, they exercise their responsibilities actively in this area and also to ensure that there is co-ordination between what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us which member of the Government will be responsible for preparing legislation to be brought before the House to give effect to the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women?  That was previously looked after within his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to have notice of that question.  I would see this function as more appropriate to the Department of Justice and it is, perhaps, something which would have to be dealt with by an inter-departmental committee because, as I have already said, matters of that kind stretch right across the whole range of Government activities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney, and this is the final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach two supplementary questions. The Joint Committee on Women's Affairs have published a number of reports.  Is it the Government's intention to bring before the House legislation to give effect to the recommendations which were made unanimously by the committee during the last session?  Secondly, is it the case that family law reform will remain the responsibility of the Minister for Justice?  If so, does he envisage various recommendations in the form of legislation coming before the House from the Minister for Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last question is yes.  With regard to the reports of the previous committee, the answer is also yes.  I hope we will be able to follow them up but not all of them require legislation. Many of them are in the administrative action area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach his Government's policy regarding Ministers and Ministers of State retaining membership of local authorities and subordinate bodies; and whether he has indicated to his office holders the activities he regards as compatible with ministerial office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a general principle for many years that Ministers and Ministers of State should, as soon as conveniently possible after appointment, resign from membership of any local authority or subordinate body to which they belong, unless only a short time remains of their term of office or other special considerations apply.  I have drawn the attention of those concerned to this principle which will continue to be applied.</P>
      <P>Ministers and Ministers of State have also been advised of the code of practice which applies to activities incompatible with ministerial office and told that in any case of doubt I should be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that it is an unusual situation, to say the least, that two members of his Government continue to chair the two largest and busiest local authorities in the country?  The Minister for Energy is chairman of Dublin County Council and the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows the impact that has been made by members of the Government.  The second person concerned is the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is Minister for Labour.  Does the Taoiseach regard that as normal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point made by my colleague from Dublin North Central I should like to point out that the Minister for Energy, Deputy <Col N="1418" /> Burke, resigned his position as chairman of Dublin County Council almost immediately on assuming office.  Indeed, he had himself replaced by a very competent successor.  The position with regard to the Lord Mayoralty is different and I hope the Deputy will appreciate that.  Deputy Bertie Ahern is Lord Mayor of Dublin, a post which he is discharging with great confidence and dignity to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>His term of office has not much longer to go.  In fact, Dublin Corporation decided last night to bring forward the election of a new Lord Mayor to the earliest possible date.  Furthermore, the Lord Mayor has withdrawn from most of the perquisites of his office but in deciding to remain as Lord Mayor Deputy Ahern has been influenced, as I have, by the fact that no Lord Mayor of Dublin city has ever resigned in the history of the mayoralty.  I do not think it would be a great wish inside or outside the House that that precedent should be broken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>I intend to consult regularly with the social partners and other interests and seek their support and their suggestions for other development measures to complement or supplement our proposals and to receive their co-operation and assistance.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in this House on 10 March last I am separately arranging to meet with the members of the National Economic and Social Council at an early date to discuss with them in greater detail the findings and recommendations of their report, <i>A Strategy for Development.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We propose to resume a fairly active programme of consultation with the social partners &mdash; the trade unions, employers and other representative organisations.  At the same time NESC, the special body established by the House, will continue to perform their own special functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that in the election manifesto of his party the Taoiseach promised a specific forum and not the normal process of consultations. A &ldquo;forum&rdquo; means a body in which more than two parties are present for discussions and I should like to know if the Taoiseach is now telling the House that <Col N="1420" /> it is not his intention to establish a forum but merely to engage in the normal process of consultation Governments have every day with various social interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Forum&rdquo; is a word which can be interpreted differently but, as far as I am concerned, the process I have outlined is a satisfactory one. Indeed, I am sorry the previous Government did not avail more frequently of it because there is enormous goodwill among employers and trade unionists. There is a fairly common desire to reach a consensus at least on economic and social objectives, whatever about the methods.  By &ldquo;forum&rdquo; I mean a constant process of consultation with the social partners and others.  Of course, NESC will continue to exercise their very important role and, as the Deputy is aware, they have brought forward a very important report on which there was general agreement in the House and outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the provision in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which promised the creation of a forum &mdash; a very specific promise &mdash; in which the social partners could negotiate the terms of a national plan for recovery has been abandoned in favour of the normal process of consultation and the continued operation of the NESC?  Will the Taoiseach agree that probably that is a sensible decision on the part of the Government but, notwithstanding its sense, it represents a significant departure from what his party said before the election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the <Col N="1422" /> steps he proposes to take to protect the remains of Coolattin Woods, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.  I welcome the Deputies' interest in the preservation of the remaining oak trees at Coolattin and I share their concern about the situation there.</P>
      <P>Under the Forestry Act, 1946, it is illegal, subject to specified exceptions, to cut down any trees without first notifying the intention to do so to the Forest and Wildlife Service now at the Department of Energy.  In the normal course, any proposed felling is prohibited to allow time for examination, from a silvicultural point of view, by the forestry inspectorate, and, if in order from a silvicultural viewpoint, for referral to the local planning authority for consideration from an amenity viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Local authorities who wish to preserve trees on amenity grounds do so by means of a tree preservation order, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Where a tree preservation order is in force an application for consent to fell must be made to the local authority, which must then decide on the application under section 45 of the 1963 Act.  A felling licence will not be granted by the Department of Energy unless and until the local authority have confirmed that the application is in order.</P>
      <P>Coolattin estate, comprising approximately 500 hectares of woodland, 300 hectares of farmland and an historic 18th century mansion was sold to its present owners, Bridgefarm Company Limited, early in 1983.  The Forest and Wildlife Service, now at the Department of Energy, have granted four felling licences to the company &mdash; and an associated company, Corglass Ltd. &mdash; since they acquired the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first licence, dated December 1983, authorised the thinning of 75 hectares and the clearfelling and replanting of 163 hectares.  The areas in question were overmature and understocked. <Col N="1423" /> They were not subject to tree preservation orders, and the felling was cleared on amenity grounds by Wicklow County Council.  This licence has expired, and the replanting obligation has been fully completed.</P>
    <P>On 28 January 1986, following an application from Bridgefarm Company, a one-year licence was issued authorising the thinning of 14 hectares in an area covered by a tree preservation order and the clearfelling and replanting of 45.2 hectares.  This licence expired in January 1987, and the replanting must be completed by January 1988.  On 9 September 1986, a limited felling licence was issued authorising the felling of 548 trees subject to a replanting obligation of 24,000 trees and compliance with the conditions of Wicklow County Council's consent.</P>
    <P>On 27 January, 1987, a licence was issued authorising the felling of 619 trees, subject to a replanting obligation of 36,000 oak trees and full compliance with the conditions attached to Wicklow County Council's further consent.  Tomnafinnogue Wood is the only remaining oak wood at Coolattin.  It is at present covered by a tree preservation order.  An application for consent to fell in this wood has recently been received by Wicklow County Council.</P>
    <P>On 21 March, I inspected the woodlands at Coolattin.  I was saddened by the amount of felling that had already taken place.  Tomnafinnogue Wood which remains is, in my opinion, of significant importance from the point of view of its scientific, visual, ecological and amenity value.  I have accordingly asked the Ministers concerned to examine urgently the situation in the light of the application which has been received in respect of this wood.  I hope Deputies will accept that it is not possible at this stage to go into what measures may be taken as a result of the examination now in progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his long and comprehensive statement but I wish to clarify one or two points. Will the Taoiseach indicate what proportion of the original oakwoods are left <Col N="1424" /> and the type of trees which are being planted in replacement?  In particular, is the Taoiseach aware of the local authority being under a legal disability in relation to compensation and if constitutional implications arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The remaining wood is quite small in relation to the original forest which existed there but it is the most important from a number of points of view, as well as being visually attractive. Its retention would be very desirable. Wicklow County Council can put tree preservation orders on any particular tree or woodland they wish but as the law stands they, unfortunately, leave themselves open to claims for compensation. In one particular case they did not object to the issuing of a licence because they feared they would be making themselves liable for a considerable amount of compensation. It is very unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that yet another case has been made, in the context of a constitutional review, for revision of the private property clauses of the Constitution, which are allowing felling to continue in the remaining wood?  Will he agree that felling is continuing today and that oak is being exported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think the position is that all these oak trees are exported when felled.  That, I suppose, is regrettable.  I agree that the situation in regard to amenities of this kind, whether oakland or otherwise, is very unsatisfactory. I am not sure that the unsatisfactory nature of the situation derives directly from the Constitution, but whether or which, the present situation is far from satisfactory.  We cannot be complacent about the fact that a great deal of our heritage of this kind can be destroyed under the existing legislative and administrative provisions.</P>

      <P>I am heartened the Taoiseach has indicated his interest in the last remains of this historic wood.  He told the House that he visited the wood.  I read in the newspaper that he flew over the wood on 21 March.  I am equally heartened to hear he has referred the matter as a matter of urgency to the two Ministers concerned.  Has the Taoiseach indicated publicly a personal wish, as the newly elected Taoiseach, that the last remains of these historic woods be preserved for the Irish nation?  Has he indicated his personal intentions to Wicklow County Council?  Does he feel at this stage that the only vehicle open to him and the two Ministers to whom he referred is the Planning Act of 1963?  If so, does he not feel it is time for urgent action to fill a gap in our legislation to ensure that this position does not persist?</P>

      <P>I have indicated in my reply that I would greatly wish to see this last remaining wood preserved.  I gladly reaffirm that to the Deputy now.  Anybody looking at the situation there would earnestly wish that this remaining important oakwood be preserved, whatever way it can be achieved.  I asked the Deputy earlier not to press me too hard on what steps might be taken and I reiterate that.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that the situation is under very active and urgent review.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's interest in Coolattin woods, which has been a matter of great concern to several of us in County Wicklow.  It has a great many legislative implications of which I am sure the Taoiseach is aware.  In view of the fact that his visit to Coolattin greatly raised expectations among concerned people in the immediate area as well as nationally, how soon can we expect the Taoiseach to bring forward whatever legislative proposals are required &mdash; and they are complex &mdash; to deal with the preservation of the remaining oak wood in Coolattin?  It is <Col N="1426" /> important that this is not put on the long finger because of a specific visit made to this area.  All felling up to now has been in accordance with the law and there is the very grave implication of compensation which applies in many other areas besides Coolattin.  Having raised expectations by his visit, which was welcomed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that I was not Minister last November.  If such a serious situation arose then I am amazed that no action was taken in regard to it.  As the Deputy is aware, the NPC were abolished by the previous Government in January 1986 and the decision then was that detailed procedures of price control and approval of price increases would be allowed to lapse and that the general thrust of policies should move towards new measures to create greater competition throughout the economy in free market conditions. There are orders in existence requiring the display of prices for drinks in licensed premises and restaurants.  Orders in <Col N="1428" /> relation to hairdressing and petrol have been in force from 1 March 1987.  Those for food, potatoes and milk, the Deputy may or may not be aware, have been transferred to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>The previous Government had prepared legislation for the establishment of a new fair trade commission to replace the Restrictive Practices Commission, and enabling legislation under the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill was prepared.  I am re-examining this legislation and when I have considered my re-examination I will bring it to the Government for consideration. Under that new legislation, if the Government decide to proceed with it, the new fair trade commission will be strengthened and given new powers to initiate and a broader remit in relation to promotion of competition.  The commission's remit to inquire into unfair trading practices will include banking, electricity and transport sectors hitherto excluded.  The proposed legislation will also provide for the adoption by the Director of Consumer Affairs of the functions of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, and the director's expanded area of responsibility will encompass a wide area of investigative and enforcement power relating to restrictive practices, consumer protection and prices.</P>

      <P>I informed the Deputy and the House that the Department of Justice had extensive experience in dealing with the problems of enforcement of the criminal law and of assessing the suitability of applicants for moneylending licences which the Garda and the courts deal with.  In reply to the Deputy, certainly I will take the matter on board and have consultations with the Minister for Justice and get his sensible response when he has had time to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the body responsible for the review of the semi-State bodies under his aegis; the terms of reference; and when it is expected the review will be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the wide diffusion of responsibility for the implementation of various aspects of industrial policy and the growing number of functions of State agencies involved in the process.  The Review of Industrial Performance, 1986, recently published by my Department, highlighted this issue and indicated that consultants would be engaged to advise on agency rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> At present, I am considering how best to approach this question including the extent to which it will be necessary to use consultants and their possible terms of reference.  I am not in a position as yet to indicate when such a review might be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Estimates were reduced by £9 million on the capital side regarding the IDA, and in view of the fact that they were committed to in excess of 11 per cent more than the budget which is now allocated to them for projects which they had approved for grant-aid, what is the Minister's opinion on what the IDA must now do?  Must they reduce the aid which they had promised, or slow down the rate of grant-aid to those industries which are involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reject what the Deputy says in relation to the cutting down of any projects which are suitable for industrial aid.  I might also tell the Deputy and the House that my information, both from the Department and from the IDA, does not suggest anything in line with what the Deputy says.  If I heard him correctly, he said they had 11 per cent more approvals than they had allocations to deal with them.  That is not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that at the end of the year £153 million was allocated in capital grants to industry and what was provided for in the budget was £136 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of an allocation of £153 million having been made, either by the previous Government or by anybody else, in relation to the IDA.  I remind the Deputy that when work starts on departmental Estimates every sector and every agency put up their estimates of their requirements.  It is then a matter for re-examination and reassessment.  The fact that the IDA were cut down by £9 million will not inhibit in any way, good, bad or indifferent, the <Col N="1434" /> promotion of industrial expansion this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it is now three weeks since the new Minister announced the proposed review of the semi-State bodies, could he not at this stage give some indication to the House on this matter?  I am quite surprised to hear he has no idea as yet of what he intends to do, of what questions he intends to ask. Could he give some idea to the House of his proposed terms of reference for this review body and by whom the review will be conducted?  It was certainly very unclear from his original statement and now we look for some clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept what the Deputy says.  It is quite clear from the statement to which he refers.  I have my own expressed views in relation to the number of separate agencies and institutions which are involved in the support area for industrial development.  In 1986 there were 20 separate institutions associated with the implementation of industrial policy, with a combined staff of more than 3,400.  This is causing confusion to existing and prospective entrepreneurs. The Department's survey of senior executives in Ireland in recent times showed a concern about overlap between the agencies.  Of those surveyed, 86 per cent believed there were too many agencies. I am concerned to have a review to see that there is no overlapping and no waste.  We need an official support agency service for industrial development and if there are too many I am prepared to take action to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money and that support for industry gets value for money also.</P>

      <P>Arising out of an earlier reply, does this indicate a complete U-turn on the Government's stated policy? I gathered from the Programme for Government there would be 28 new committees, boards and offices.  In trying to streamline the procedure, is one of the lesser aspects to be a shedding of all those new creations, or will they be part of the new programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the question was, but I might inform the Deputy that I am not involved in any U-turns, good, bad, or indifferent, in relation to agencies in the industrial <Col N="1436" /> development area.  My views are very well known and well publicised.  I intend to continue along that path.  In relation to the terms of reference query by Deputy Keating, I say to him and to the House that it would appear, before close examination, that many semi-State agencies have wandered far from their original terms of reference.  It is quite clear to the House and to the general public that many show signs of overlapping between one area and another.  A competitive edge appears to be developing between State agencies as to who will do what and who will do what best.  This is not a situation that I, as Minister, intend to allow continue.  We must have effective use of the taxpayers' money and the best cost benefit analysis carried out to ensure that industry gets an efficient and cost effective support system.</P>

      <P>Secondly, would the Minister confirm that of the money available for the IDA this year for capital, all but £14 million is already committed from last year?  Would he further agree that one good project would absorb all that money?  Would he agree that we are in a situation in the IDA this year where perhaps a sign &ldquo;Out of business temporarily&rdquo; might be hung on the door?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet had an opportunity of reviewing the existing industrial grants system.  However, I support the current policy which is designed to facilitate a shift in the pattern of State aid resulting in a greater proportion of funds being used to support marketing, technology acquisition and research and development with reductions for fixed assets and factory construction.  I believe this policy will encourage the development of stronger internationally-competitive companies capable of sustained employment and output growth.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the Industrial Development Authority are empowered, under the Industrial Development Act, 1986, to make an employment grant in respect of additional persons employed in small industrial undertakings.  An employment grant is only made available in lieu of a capital grant in respect of fixed assets.</P>

      <P>The State has taken over the company.  I presume that definition is good enough for the Deputy in reply to his question.  According to the recent accounts published the ICI have made a profit.  There have been reservations entered on both sides.  The qualification of the auditors indicates an inability to assess whether the adminiistrator's provision for contingencies has been understated.

Seventy million pounds have been advanced by AIB and the remaining £30 million are from the Central Bank's own funds.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the views of his party's former spokesman in this area, the present Minister for the Environment, that he was publicly in favour of a ban on below-cost selling? Will the Minister acknowledge that previous action in the area by successive Governments has been dictated by the view of the 1980 Restrictive Practices Commission report for example, and in view of the substantial change in their recommendations in this area will the Minister give a commitment to <Col N="1443" /> implement some of the recommendations?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the demand by supermarket chains for what is called &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; is very restrictive in relation to the number of new firms that can enter the wholesale or manufacturing trade in consumer goods?  Will the Minister indicate whether this is in line with the proposed policy of Fianna Fáil to expand job creation? Many small firms unable to meet this demand for &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; of about £10,000 are simply excluded.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that supermarkets ask for about £10,000 or whatever the figure is and I would recommend to any supplier not to pay it.  If a supplier's product is good enough, if the price is right, if the presentation is right, if he delivers on time, and if he does his job better than somebody else, the question of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; should not arise.  It is very foolish for any supplier to get involved in paying &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he proposes to implement the decision in the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i>, 1986 published by the previous Government that the level of fixed asset grants to small firms could be reduced; the particular means suggested to achieve this, namely, higher equity financing and greater use of loan guarantees and interest subsidies; and if he will indicate how and when this decision will be implemented.</P>

    <Col N="1444" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant State agencies are already implementing a number of Government decisions which should have the effect of reducing average grant rates for small industry projects in 1987 compared with 1986.  The maximum rate of fixed asset grant for expansions of existing small industries has been reduced on an administrative basis by 5 percentage points.  In the case of first time applications, an objective has been set for each of the regional small industry boards of achieving a reduction of at least 2.5 percentage points in average fixed asset grant rates in 1987.  Moreover, under section 21 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, promoters of small industry projects may now avail of employment grants in lieu of grants towards the cost of fixed assets.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the relevant State agencies that, as a general rule, grants should be at least matched by equity financing.  To this end, the business expansion scheme is being actively promoted as a way of increasing equity finance within firms.  In addition, under the enterprise development programme, certain small industry projects can avail of loan guarantees, interest subsidies and equity participation from the State agencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the reason over £4 million of a shortfall has been allowed to accumulate in his Department arising from the fact that the total net cost of claims paid under the export guarantee scheme, not including provisions for <Col N="1445" /> future claims, exceeded total net premium income by that amount; and the action he proposes to take to eliminate the shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortfall to which the Deputy refers is the difference between the premium income under the export credit insurance scheme in the period 1979-1985 and the cost of claims paid out under the scheme during that period.</P>
      <P>During the period in question, the actual level of claims paid out was £12.8 million.  Included in this amount was a sum of £5.1 million paid on foot of claims resulting from moneys due to Irish exporters being held up in foreign central banks due to foreign currency shortages in the countries in question.  Since such moneys are ultimately recoverable by the State and are the subject of ongoing recovery efforts by my Department, it is reasonable to view them as not representing a loss or shortfall in the short run.</P>
      <P>The export credit insurance scheme operates on the basis that &ldquo;taking one year with another, the scheme should operate at no net cost to the Exchequer&rdquo;. This approach recognises the fluctuating experience with claims which, in turn, reflect commercial and political changes in export markets.</P>
      <P>The scheme is constantly monitored in my Department and at present a comprehensive review of premium rates is taking place in order to ensure that the principle of &ldquo;break-even over time&rdquo; is adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the review mentioned by the Minister at the end of his reply, may I take it that the premiums will be increased?  Will the Minister accept that the point he makes about the scheme that there is no shortfall is not as stated by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 1985 report?  Why has there been consistent understatement in the Minister's Department about the likely cost of claims?  Are we now to be told that the premiums will be increased to compensate for the shortfall we have <Col N="1446" /> had over a number of years, amounting in this case to over £4 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's statement that there is a continuing shortfall. The Department and the ICI, the company who manage the scheme for them, are constantly engaged in efforts to recoup moneys due under the scheme. It should be noted that on an accumulative basis from 1979 to the end of 1986 the total shortfall under the scheme stood at £7.1 million while amounts owing to the scheme but currently blocked in foreign exchange central banks amounted to £7.6 million.  This reflects the fact that not only is a substantial proportion of claims paid recoverable by the State but in some years the premium income actually exceeds the claims paid.  The figures do not indicate what the Deputy seems to have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is what the Comptroller and Auditor General has in mind and he is the person who ultimately audits the books.  The Comptroller and Auditor General makes the case very strongly in his most recent report that there has been an accumulative shortfall.  Despite the Minister's approach of doing it by mirrors, there is a case to be answered in his Department for the constant shortfall in premiums.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer any questions from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office but I would remind the House that the way this shortfall was made up was: premium income of £7.8 million; claims made, £12.8 million, so in his figures a shortfall of £5 million and recoveries effected amounted to £720,000 at that stage.  What I am giving <Col N="1447" /> is the total up-to-date position from 1979 to 1986 which indicated that an amount ultimately recoverable by the State was held up in foreign central banks.  That would not represent a loss or a shortfall, as the Deputy is indicating in the house.</P>

I do not consider that to be fair.  As this is the first opportunity in the Dáil for statements to be made to the House, there is a danger of a precedent being created in relation to statements.  I cannot accept that.  Unfortunately, as of now, we have not a Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If we had, I would be asking for a meeting of that body to consider this.  I plead with the Taoiseach &mdash; I do not want to have to rise every day on the Order of Business to object to the proceedings &mdash; that between now and 6 p.m. alternative arrangements be made regarding the time allocated so that all the Members of the House can have an opportunity of speaking.  A fair proportion of time should be allotted for the parties.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, rather than have confrontation daily on the Order of Business, that between now and 6 p.m., which is the last time available for arranging the Order of Business, that the Whips make alternative arrangements.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Spring, we were not consulted about this item.  I was informed of it by officials of the House before being telephoned by the Chief Whip's office.  Last Thursday I sought advice from officials of this House and from the Ceann Comhairle as to whether this party could table the contents of motion No. 29 which is about this matter, as our Private Members' motion for this week.  I was told by the Ceann Comhairle and the advisers in the House that we would not be able to do so because as this was a budgetary item it could not be <Col N="1558" /> raised during the course of discussion of the budget.  In the light of that, it is wrong that a party were denied the opportunity of debating it in Private Members' time when on the very same night an opportunity is now being given &mdash; under I do not know what kind of precedent &mdash; for this matter to be discussed.  Despite that, we welcome an opportunity to discuss the difficulties which have arisen and to seek clarification so that the public, and particularly those concerned, can be reassured as to what the Government's intentions are in relation to this matter.  Finally, I say to the Taoiseach that I hope each party will be given an opportunity of at least 30 minutes to outline their position on this matter.  I agree with Deputy Spring that if that requires the time to be extended it should be done.</P>

      <P>The Government felt it <Col N="1559" /> would be a welcome offer on their part that extra time be given to the House for Deputies to make statements on this matter.  I am not too clear on the import of the suggestion of Deputy Spring or Deputy Harney to me.  The time has been allocated for these statements and I would have thought it is then a matter for the Chair to decide on calling speakers.

I would like the Taoiseach to assure us that arrangements like this will not be made in future, at least without discussion or consultation.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Employment Equality (Employment of Women) Order, 1986.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 28th February, 1986.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 61,000 women workers engaged in production industries in Ireland which are covered by legal limits on working hours which were introduced in 1936.  Just over 18 per cent of all women workers are affected by these restrictions which apply to women only. Most women workers have no legal limits on the hours they work.  Outside manufacturing industry, many women are engaged on nursing duties before 8 a.m. in the morning and after 10 p.m.  Women workers in public transport, women in cleaning and in catering establishments and women engaged in ancillary work in hospitals and residential homes are not prohibited from working outside those hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the order before the House is to bring to an end the longstanding legal prohibition on the employment of women in industrial night work and on Sundays.  At present, women may be denied access to employment opportunities in situations where shift work and Sunday work are involved.  Because of <Col N="1570" /> this ban, women may also be denied additional opportunities for training and promotion, and lose out on the higher premia attaching to such work.  Men who are involved in a three-shift system usually get a higher premium than women who normally rotate between two-day shifts.  These differences currently represent an important element in the gap between the hourly earnings of women and men.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977, makes specific provision for the review of protective laws when the concern for protection which originally inspired them is no longer well founded.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Employment Equality Act recognises that certain requirements in four Acts administered by my Department may in effect be forcing employers, by law, to discriminate against women in employment.  It accordingly empowers the Minister for Labour to repeal or amend any such requirement by Affirmative Order.  The Employment Equality Agency in a review of the prohibition on the employment of women at night undertaken at the request of my predecessor as Minister for Labour, Gene Fitzgerald, recommended the repeal of the nightwork ban.</P>
    <P>The agency also recommended that the scope for further relaxations of the 1936 restrictions be explored, and that the necessary steps be taken to enable the State to waive its obligations under Convention No. 89 of the International Labour Organisation to which Ireland had been a party.  In response to a more extensive review of protective legislation which the agency has also undertaken, modifications were recently made to a prohibition on the employment of women in mining and the process of denouncing an ILO Convention on work in mining is now under way.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the approach which was taken by the Barrington Commission on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work which recommended that not only our legislation, but also the wide range of alternative means of influencing conditions at work, should embrace all workers.  The commission saw no reason why restrictive conditions should continue <Col N="1571" /> to apply to women working in a small factory while at the same time large numbers of women in other types of work remain unaffected by such restrictions. This order is in some respects a forerunner to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill which I hope to introduce in the Oireachtas before the end of this year.  The new Bill will represent a very comprehensive reform package and will give effect to the recommendations of the Barrington Commission.</P>
    <P>In addition to the original report by the Employment Equality Agency, which provided the initial impetus for repealing the nightwork ban, we have had the benefit in recent years of the studies of shiftwork and nightwork undertaken in various EC countries on behalf of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.</P>
    <P>In view of the obvious concern among workers and their families about stress arising from nightwork, it is very important that every effort is made to ensure that good working conditions are provided. The effects of shiftwork, for instance, on family or social life is greatly influenced by workers' lifestyles, by their level of pay, by local customs and by whether they live in a rural or urban area. The involvement of workers in determining the kind of shiftwork system used &mdash; and not just at the level of trade union negotiations &mdash; is extremely important. Naturally workers will feel more commitment and enthusiasm about the success of a system if they are directly involved in bringing it about.  This is even more true in the case of shiftwork preferences since individual needs differ and the most satisfactory compromise is likely to emerge through joint discussion.</P>
    <P>I feel that it would be useful if, after the making of this order, the situation were to be monitored for a period.  The purpose of this would be twofold: firstly, to find out to what extent the change in the legislation is leading to an increase in the number of women being employed and secondly, to identify any new developments in relation to patterns of work.  My Department has been in touch <Col N="1572" /> with the Employment Equality Agency with a view to arranging the necessary follow-up action.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in submitting this order to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is my first opportunity to do so, I preface my remarks by congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  He received a warm welcome to Mespil Road where he was well known as Opposition spokesman. He developed a very good relationship with the people in that Department.</P>
      <P>The measure before the House is unlikely to provoke any great controversy given its legislative history.  The measure cleared its first hurdle during the lifetime of the last Seanad when it was piloted through that House by my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny.  The motion does not stand alone because it is one of a series of measures which have come before both Houses in recent years.  The relevance of some of our protective legislation and the question of whether it represents an outdated paternalism resulted in a series of those measures coming before both Houses for review and reconsideration. I remember about a year ago bringing before both Houses a measure out of the same stable relating to the mining industry.</P>
      <P>This measure is welcome because it removes an inappropriate paternalism and corrects what at this stage is an anomalous restriction.  It is a measure of some practical importance.  Studies which have been carried out by Mr. John Blackwell have established that the differential which exists between average male industrial wages and average female industrial wages are to a substantial part attributable to the fact that men are in a better position to benefit from overtime, shift work and bonuses of one sort or another. This measure is to be welcomed in so far as it opens up opportunities for women in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its importance is probably going to be tempered by the fact that the regulations governing the conditions of employment are so complicated that a number of employees, many employers and, dare I <Col N="1573" /> say, some of the employees' trade unions, are unclear as to which categories of workers this legislation applies to.  I see the Minister nodding his head in agreement and I hope this means he is going to put it on his work programme to sort out all those complications in double quick time.  No doubt as soon as he lays down the onerous duties of being Lord Mayor of Dublin to devote himself full time to the needs of Mespil Road he will be in a position to do this.</P>
    <P>The area of equality was a major priority for Fine Gael when they were in Government.  Nowhere was that shown more clearly than the vigour with which Deputy Gemma Hussey addressed the question during her few short weeks as Minister for Labour.  One thinks of her intervention with AnCO in order to ensure that it was established beyond doubt that access to apprenticeships would be equally available to men and women applicants.  There were other areas in which that enthusiasm was also seen.  The action taken by the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Hussey, was entirely consistent with the approach she took as Minister for Education.  What happens in the school area is of vital importance to what happens in working life and she established an emphasis on ridding the educational system of much of its inherent sexism.  I hope her successor in this area will follow suit because there are areas of concern there, for example, the extent to which girls in vocational schools have access to practical subjects.  The Minister for Labour should concern himself with this because any programmes he might put in place will come to nought unless the support, the groundwork and the framework have been provided within the educational system.</P>
    <P>The priority which Fine Gael afforded this area is not evidenced from this Government even at this early stage.  The Minister for Labour in his speech on the budget when he indicated his legislative work programme made no reference of any intention with regard to amendments of the equality legislation.  I regard that as a regrettable omission.  We had the <Col N="1574" /> extraordinary spectacle of the now Minister for Agriculture, the then Opposition spokesman on Finance, taunting AnCO because they had provided apprenticeships for girls in non-traditional areas, such as welding and bricklaying.  The Minister suggested that they should be punished for this eccentricity by having their funding reduced.  I very much hope that that sort of nonsense does not permeate this Government's approach and that we will see them taking the question of equality seriously.  There is a view in some circles that this is an issue which can wait for better times when the economy is going right and that when everything is going smoothly we can then turn our attention to these matters.  That is an entirely fallacious approach.  The question of equality is one of fundamental principles and arises in good times as well as bad times.  We have to be concerned at how little progress has been made in this area.  Even though it is now 13 or 14 years since the impetus of our membership of the European Community led to a series of legislative measures in this area, the gap between average industrial wages for men and women has not narrowed. This should be a cause of concern to every Member in the House.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am sorry the Minister did not indicate in his Budget Statement that the equality area would be one of his legislative priorities.  It is the case that for some time &mdash; and I accept for all of that time &mdash; we were in a position to respond and were beginning the task of responding. The Employment Equality Agency have been pressing for reforms, some of which are of a minor nature, housekeeping matters, which would facilitate them in their work.  Others are of substance and it is highly important that the Minister should take out that file and restore it to his legislative priority table.</P>
    <P>Specifically, we are seriously in default in that our equality legislation deals only with the question of equality in employment. It does not deal with wider questions such as equality in education and access to services, and of particular importance in the financial area, the question of entitlement to credit.  We <Col N="1575" /> undertook as part of United Nations Women's Year to adhere to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</P>
    <P>During Question Time I asked the Taoiseach what his intentions were in that area and he indicated that it might be a matter for an interdepartmental committee and that no doubt the Department of Justice would have a role.  I have since been informed, in what must be one of the quickest U-turns on record &mdash; although under this Government that is called a clarification &mdash; that this will be a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not mind who looks after it, but it is an area where the State has undertaken responsibilities and it is important that those responsibilities should be fulfilled as speedily and as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>The measure before us is of limited importance but of potentially not inconsiderable importance.  It is to be welcomed. I am sure it will receive a welcome from all sides of the House but, in so far as it is largely a housekeeping exercise, I want to repeat to the Minister that I hope he will see to it that the equality area will receive a degree of priority within his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Birmingham in congratulating the Minister, Deputy Ahern, on his elevation and to wish him well in his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the bringing forward of this order by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern.  It arises as a result of a report to the Minister for Labour by the Employment Equality Agency.  This report was published in 1978.  It is to be welcomed as a long overdue small step in providing the framework in which equality of opportunity will be given to women in the workplace.  As policy decisions regarding equality of women and men in the work-place have been taken and equality legislation has been passed, it has become evident that some of the employment legislation already in place is at odds with the newer legislation.  A number of Acts, including the Conditions of Employment <Col N="1576" /> Act, 1936, and the Safety in Industry Acts of 1955 and 1980, required amendments.</P>
    <P>The order before the House is intended to make the relevant amendments recommended in the report of the Employment Equality Agency.  However, even though in their annual report of 1984 the Employment Equality Agency drew attention to anomalies contained in the Safety in Industry Acts of 1955 and 1980, dealing with the use of lead and lead compounds, the agency specifically asked the Department of Labour to treat in a more urgent way the preparation of amending legislation to remove discriminatory aspects of existing statutes regarding employment.</P>
    <P>I have to say that, if this is the manner in which the Department of Labour treat submissions of an urgent nature from the Employment Equality Agency whose role is specifically to review existing legislation in the light of equality legislation and recommend changes, I cannot hold out much hope of radical reform in labour legislation in the near future.  I am aware that the other House passed this order on 19 March last year but there has been no further movement towards implementing it since then.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to point out to the House that just under one-fifth of all women workers are affected by their exclusion from night and Sunday work. This represents a very sizeable proportion of women in the workforce.  It is also interesting to note that the 1936 Act restricted women engaged in manual labour in factories or in industry at night. It was permissible for women to carry out other forms of work in factories such as overseeing, directing and managing industrial work.  It was also open to the relevant Minister to make exclusion regulations on application to allow women to take part in shift or continuous process work.  However, the Minister had to have regard to the provisions of international conventions at the time being ratified and binding on the Government.</P>
    <P>The convention which was relevant to this order now before the House was Convention No. 89 of the ILO.  I understand from the Minister's speech that we <Col N="1577" /> intend to denounce this convention which we would have to do before bringing in this amending order.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to what I believe to be the regulations concerning any denunciations of that convention and they are that, after the expiration of ten years from the date of ratification which we did in 1952, a State can denounce that convention but they must do so either within the first ten years or else at the expiration of each ten year period after that.  It seems to me &mdash; and I remain open to correction from the Minister &mdash; that the last time we could have denounced this convention was in 1982 and the next time we may denounce it is 1992.  Would the Minister in his reply address this matter and say what his intentions are?</P>
    <P>Presumably, women manual workers were not very numerous when this legislation was introduced.  Neither was it thought at the time that this type of work was entirely suitable for women. However, as the numbers of women engaged in industry have increased, and along with their male counterparts have become more organised and had their status increased, these regulations appear to be unnecessarily paternalistic and restrictive.  Women are now, and have been for a long time, losing out on additional opportunities for training and promotion because of lack of experience of working all shifts.  They also lost out on extra payments which are made in respect of night work or liability for night work.  Employment opportunities were also restricted because, where a firm operated on a shift system overnight, the management could not legally employ women on the same basis as men.</P>
    <P>When the report was being prepared by the Employment Equality Agency a number of other factors were referred to which deserve mention here.  Over the years since this restiction on women working has been in place, Ireland has become more and more industrialised often attracting foreign companies who have set up a plant or plants.  Their willingness to do so has been based on the ready availability of well educated and skilled labour.  However, there is no <Col N="1578" /> doubt that the restrictions referred to in this order have been a disincentive to attracting female employing industries such as electronics and textiles.  The Industrial Development Authority are strongly in favour of abandoning the prohibition on the employment of women at night in industry and are of the view that the growth in the trade union movement together with the advent of equal pay was sufficient to ensure that the exploitation which was feared when the legislation was introduced would not now take place.</P>
    <P>The point was also made in that report that many of our industries are under-capitalised and that shift work would have the effect of maximising the use of industrial plant.  This would be particularly useful where plant becomes obsolete so rapidly nowadays that maximum use should be got from it.  Shift work, therefore, is one answer to the problem of rapid obsolescence.  There is also the reasoning that in a situation such as ours where there are large numbers of people unemployed, shift work represents a chance of employing more workers and yet using the same plant.  It also allows us to increase the volume of output by firms without any extra capital investment. As we move into the nineties, and we hope that demand for our products will increase, particularly in the export market, we must recognise the essential role many women workers play in industries which we hope will provide great output and therefore create more wealth for the country.</P>
    <P>We must provide the framework for women to play their full part in this expansion.  However, if we are to promote the idea of shift work as a means of increasing output and employment, it is essential that we have regard to proper safeguards for the operation of such a system of working.  A number of reports have been completed in this area including that of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work who sat under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Donal Barrington in 1983 and who reported in 1984.  There is an urgent need to update occupational health and safety <Col N="1579" /> legislation to include women.  Many of the areas excluded from the present legislation are those in which the majority of women workers are in employment.  This is because of the small numbers of women in the workforce, as I mentioned earlier, when this legislation was framed.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the report of the debate in the other House on this Order in March of last year the Minister stated that he would be undertaking a monitoring programme of the change in legislation and its effects.  I feel it should be said that any supervision of the working and effects of this order should include supervision of shift working in general as it applies to male and female workers under the 1936 Act.  I would wholeheartedly agree with the recommendation from the Employment Equality Agency that present arrangements for licensing shift work, besides providing for consultation with both employer and worker representatives, should also take account of local conditions affecting hours of work, transport and rest periods.  Too often before now these factors were never taken into account where shift work was concerned because it was only men who were affected and they were assumed not to have to take part in the work of parenting.  This is the type of factor which must be taken into account when women are put on the same footing at work, so as to allow both men and women their full role in the world of work and in their family situation.  Certain other restrictions would, of course, also have to be included, for example, protection for pregnant women and presumably those who at any given time are medically unfit for night work.</P>
    <P>There is a whole body of real reforming legislation needed in this area of health and welfare in working conditions.  As I have stated, many of the occupations where employees are predominantly female or where there is a growing number of women &mdash; for example in new types of employment in chemical or pharmaceutical and computer-based industries &mdash; face real hazards to health.  Any changes in legislation or regulations <Col N="1580" /> should deal with issues affecting both men and women.  Very often the dangers affect both sexes equally, for example, lead poisoning, lifting of heavy weights, laboratory work in hospitals and industry and so on.  The so-called clean occupations are often those occupied by women at present.  They include work at dental surgeries, hairdressing shops, dry cleaning shops, laundries, laboratories and so on.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to press ahead with the necessary legislation prompted by the Employment Equality Agency and Barrington reports, and also those emanating from the EC and the international labour organisation.  Much of the protective legislation in place at present is outdated and neither takes account of social developments or changes in industry and the development of the electronics industry.</P>
    <P>I note in the Minister's budget speech he made reference to his intention to give priority to implementing European Community standards on precautions in the use of lead and other materials.  Given that the European Council directive on protection of workers from risk related to exposure to lead and lead compounds required member states to bring in the necessary laws and regulations by 1 January 1986 at the latest, and that we are now over a year behind time, I would like to hear from the Minister a commitment to a time scale for the introduction of this and the other very necessary reforming legislation envisaged.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to place on record the support of my party for this amending order.  Over the last number of years the legislative process has moved very slowly where updating legislation was needed in the area of employment equality.  This has meant unnecessary hardship and frustration for many thousands of women, not just in the area of work governed by the order before the House today, but also in the area of social welfare and, in particular, for part-time workers.  This Minister now has a golden opportunity to bring forward the proposed legislation to which I have already referred regarding safety, health and welfare at work, the <Col N="1581" /> preparatory work for which has largely been done, and also the legislation which has been in preparation for some years to update and amend the equality legislation of 1974 and 1977.  This has become necessary in the light of our experience and also the experience throughout the EC of how the equality legislation worked in practice.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that there should be equal access to opportunities for work, for promotion and for benefits under the welfare system.  The longer we do not accept this and act on it, the longer we are confining ourselves to making use of only one portion of our highly educated and well trained workforce.  I support this order and the speed with which the Minister has introduced it and appeal to him to proceed as soon as possible with the more complex but necessary legislation I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend to the Minister for Labour my kindest regards and to wish him well in his new post.  I am aware that he contributed quite a lot to the industrial debate during the lifetime of the previous Government and that at all times he gave a fair and balanced performance.  I should like to take this opportunity to welcome this order and to add that it is not before its time.  The order pertains to the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, an Act which set the maximum working hours for women industrial workers and restricted their employment on shifts and night work.  Those restrictions only applied to women engaged in the industrial field, women workers who are largely unskilled and, in many cases, in the lower income bracket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to say, the Labour Party welcome any measure which attempts to improve conditions for those women and to enhance their earning potential and promotion prospects.  During the Seanad debate on this Order the then junior Minister at the Department of Labour, Deputy Enda Kenny, stated that the number of women workers engaged in the production industries covered by these legal limits totalled 62,600, a figure <Col N="1582" /> refered to by the Minister today, and of this number approximately 18 per cent were directly affected.  So, in effect, 11,268 women will benefit from the change brought on by this Order.</P>
    <P>This is a crucially important step because at the moment the structures are piecemeal, as mentioned by Deputy Colley.  I have no doubt that the Minister will bring them together.  Pockets of industrial women workers have acquired exemption from the conditions of the Act because their employers have applied for licences from the Department.  Having to acquire a special licence to obtain permission to work after 8 p.m. is not satisfactory. The licences operate for specified industries and for specified places of employment but this still leaves the vast majority of industrial women workers having to comply with the archaic legislation.  The fact that they have had to wait 15 more years before a change was brought about is an indictment of the system.  When one considers that many people during that period had to work from a disadvantaged position one realises how archaic the system was.</P>
    <P>It follows that if women workers cannot avail of night work their position in applying for industrial jobs is weaker and they are, in effect, discriminated against.  In addition, they are deprived of any extra allowances or favourable promotional positions which would require a commitment to after-hours working.  Those involved in the high tech industries must work long hours if the companies are to keep up with the challenges facing them.  People must work beyond normal working hours in those industries.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on the legislative process that almost a decade since the initiation of the equality legislation which came to us from the European Parliament that Ireland still lags some considerable lengths behind other member states on its attitude to women workers. In European terms Irish women work the longest hours and in many cases in conditions inferior to their European counterparts and for still only 68 per cent of the average male industrial earnings. <Col N="1583" /> The 1936 Act which prohibited people from working on shifts and enhancing their earnings militated against female workers.</P>
    <P>During the current economic recession the position of women workers has deteriorated even further.  Thousands of women work in industrial plants for a very low wage and then return home to face another days' work in the home caring for children and getting them ready for school.  Their conditions are many years behind some of the more advanced European states, where women workers enjoy a shorter working week, with equitable rates of pay and creche facilities to provide for children during the working day.  It is indeed regrettable that not alone do Irish women not enjoy the average European standards, but that in 1987 we are discussing an Order to allow women to work after 8 p.m.</P>
    <P>For many women night work is the only opportunity to get out of the home to earn money to supplement the family income.  It may be possible for the husband to be at home to cater for the children so that women do not have to worry about paying for child minders or leaving the children in the care of friends, relations or neighbours.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the order advances the cause of equality for women, I would ask the Minister if it is possible to add conditions to the order to make provision for meals, transport and more flexible working conditions for pregnant women. A woman who is pregnant is still vulnerable under the system and there must be a far more tolerant approach.  There are physical and mental stresses involved in industrial employment.  Physical effort such as lifting can endanger the life of a pregnant woman who may be compelled for economic reasons to work.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the order is to be monitored by the Employment Equality Agency to ensure that it works effectively and to highlight any problems which emerge.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, there are a number of temporary licences in <Col N="1584" /> existence already and since 1980 quite a number of women have availed of these temporary licences.  These incidences will have given the Minister some measure of information about the working of the night scheme and some obvious problems will have already come to light.  Problems such as pregnancy and transport will already have emerged and it is regrettable that the Minister did not take this opportunity to attach some appropriate conditions to cover these problems at this stage, rather than waiting for a report from the monitoring agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that our society has become more violent and that women are particularly at risk travelling to and from work at night.  These risks are pertinent to both city and country, but women in rural Ireland do have very particular problems with transport.  A condition in the order pertaining to transport facilities would have made it easier for rural women to opt for night duty without having to worry about any danger in travelling home.  While women have to worry about the normal problems which arise with a pregnancy or have to worry about transport problems, it must be stated that they cannot opt for night work as freely as men.  In this respect conditions in the order would have made the situation more equitable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give some serious consideration to these points, to attach conditions and not to wait for another two to three years for a report from the monitoring agency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the monitoring of the order I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Employment Equality Agency, the body specified to monitor the order, be given adequate finance from the Department of Labour to carry out this important work.</P>
    <P>I note from the budgetary estimates that the finance to the Department of Labour is in line with 1986 figures.  If this is to be the case, I would like to put it to the Minister that he ensure that money be set aside for monitoring work to ensure that the workings of the order are watched carefully to prevent any further hardship on women workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> Finally, I should like to make one point about equality legislation and its implementation in Ireland.  It is a great weakness that some of the aspects of the equality legislation have not yet been implemented and other aspects are not even workable at the moment in Ireland. On this very point I would mention the Fianna Fáil statement during the Seanad debate of 19 March 1986 on the Employment Equality (Employment of Women) Order, 1986, when Senator Hillery stated:</P>
    <P>I would like to register my disappointment that the amending legislation has not been before us up to now.  In fact, I would ask the Minister to give us his best estimate of when we can expect the publication of the amended legislation.  I am happy to support the order and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <P>I would join with Senator Hillery in that regard and hope that this can be taken as a Fianna Fáil commitment to equality legislation.  I look forward to seeing a greater emphasis on equality for women workers both on the industrial front and for women workers in the home.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would ask the Minister to ensure that the numbers of women involved in industrial work after 8 p.m. be listed as a separate category in the Department of Labour annual reports in order that we may keep a close watch on the situation.  This is a reasonable request.  If there are problems arising from this order it is only right that Members of this House should be afforded the opportunity of commenting. This would not be possible without the proper information and statistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>As time is running out I will endeavour not to cover ground already covered by other Deputies.  I could not let this opportunity pass without welcoming this tardy legislation into the House.  Other Deputies have referred to the time it has taken to come before us.  I was a member of the Employment Equality Agency in 1978 when these recommendations were made and it was <Col N="1586" /> pointed out at that stage that it was totally contrary to the Employment Equality Act that any obstacle at all should exist to deny women equality of training, work and promotion.  Yet this has been happening.</P>
      <P>I express my best wishes to the Minister for Labour.  I am letting him know that I shall be monitoring very carefully certain aspects of labour legislation and that I hope to be able to give constructive support.</P>
      <P>These various pieces of legislation have been introduced in a long drawn out fashion since 1978 when the recommendations were made.  They went through the Seanad in 1986 but did not reach this House until 1987.  I make a heartfelt plea to the Minister and his officials to show by action that we have a genuine commitment to equality of opportunity and equality of rights for women.  The tardiness of all administrations in bringing forward the necessary legislation does not show such a commitment.  As usual in times of economic crisis there is a certain amount of pressure to discourage women from participating in the workforce.  In these circumstances it behoves us to bring in this legislation, not just to remove obstacles but to move on to a second phase by looking at the practice of equality legislation here and throughout Europe and recognising that it is not as effective or fast moving as it should be.  The reason is that all legislation regarding equality between the sexes, particularly in regard to employment, training and opportunity, must have a built-in affirmative action programme.  I would be delighted to have a conversation with the Minister on this topic at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the Taoiseach's statement at Question Time today that he will re-establish as soon as possible the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights as he sees this as the best possible source of proposals for positive action.  I absolutely approve of that; it is one of the areas from which positive action will come.  I would ask the Minister for Labour to use his influence to help in setting up that committee.  I am not trying <Col N="1587" /> to pre-empt what a future joint committee will do, but the former members worked very constructively together on a non-party basis and had decided that the whole area of employment for women and the monitoring of relevant legislation would be the next part of the agenda. Hopefully that will be high on the agenda when the committee are reconstituted.  I welcome what other Members have said with regard to the fact that the order will provide necessary monitoring to ensure that the health and safety not alone of women but of men, will be safeguarded. I know the Minister will be looking at this area with regard to other pieces of legislation.  The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions which is based in Loughlinstown have made some recommendations. They have been monitoring the situation.</P>
    <P>I will quickly refer to some of the points both the foundation and Deputy O'Sullivan have made.  One is that adequate transport, adequate conditions of comfort and adequate breaks between shifts would be seen to be important.  This is very good and should be the foundation of all our legislation.  In an ever changing technological work structure the search for solutions must be flexible.  We must monitor always the effects of new technology and new work on ourselves.  I know the Minister will always take into consideration that we must be flexible to change.</P>
    <P>I am aware the time is passing and I would like to give the Minister an opportunity to reply.  I look forward to all sides of this House working towards more affirmative legislation than we have here today.  Both Deputies O'Sullivan and Colley referred to the necessity of safeguarding the health and safety of women on shift work.  I reflect cynically on the fact that women were prevented by legislation from working at night in certain jobs yet were always allowed work in long drawn out and very badly paid jobs where they were totally disorganised such as cleaning, without any thought being given to their health and safety.  May I <Col N="1588" /> add my plea to those who have asked the Minister to give high priority to the whole area of protective legislation for part-time workers.  Women make up a great part of this group.  When we open up opportunities for women at work, whether training or promotion, we must ensure that at the same time we relieve them of some of the burden of the household tasks.  Men will have to share this burden because otherwise women will be pushed merely into pressured, burdensome and hardworking lives so that instead of their being liberated, they will be oppressed further.  This has got to be the bottom line for every piece of legislation we bring in.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I can cheer the House up by telling about the experience in Cuba.  As you can imagine that country had a certain difficulty with male attitudes to sharing family and household responsibilities but the Cubans were inventive enough to draw up a family code which spelled out very directly, seriously and authoritively to men where their responsibilities lay in the house.  I suggest to the Minister that when we consider the legislation we need we should think about having as a foundation, a family code which would ensure the sharing of tasks and parenting within the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the party spokespersons for their kind remarks and I congratulate Deputies Barnes, Birmingham, Colley and O'Sullivan on their promotion.  As it is an honour to be a Cabinet member, I always considered it an honour too, to be a shadow spokesman.  Unfortunately, I have spent longer here in the latter role than in my present role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say briefly, though not in any contentious way, that we cannot be proud of our failure in the past few years to implement legislation that was necessary. I assume that the Minister and Minister of State of the day did their utmost.  It is only with the co-operation of the other parties that I can succeed in having passed the legislation I am anxious to have enacted.  I certainly have the will but the records of Dáil Éireann down through <Col N="1589" /> the years is full of the will of Ministers. Their legacy, after leaving office is a different matter.  I know I speak for the Employment Equality Agency, of which Deputy Barnes was an active member, probably the most active member for several years, when I say that they received a lot of commitment from Ministers.  At the start of my reign I am anxious to bring forward this motion today to show that at least we can bring forward something. With the co-operation of the spokespersons we can enact legislation.  I do not mind saying it was difficult enough to get the motion ordered for today but I hope that with the co-operation of the spokespersons we will achieve a little more than has been achieved in the past.</P>
    <P>This Government have shown their commitment to facing up to their responsibilities.  We will bring forward in a timely manner practical measures which will serve to effect improvements in workers' rights and promote greater flexibility in the labour market.  An extensive review of the Equality Acts is underway but requires more time to complete. As I indicated at the outset this order is in some respects a forerunner to the safety, health and welfare at work legislation which will lay the foundations for a universal and effective system of safety covering all employees, employers and self employed.  I hope to introduce this legislation with your help in the House in the autumn session.  It is fairly fundemental and detailed legislation.</P>
    <P>I will deal quickly with some of the queries.  I noted the points Deputy Birmingham made and I will endeavour to pursue them.  Deputy Colley asked about the conditions attaching to shift working licences.  I think Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned this also.  Conditions attaching to these licences will in future require companies to provide hot meals at night.  In addition, there will be a recommendation to employers to consult employees about possible transport arrangements.  These arrangements will apply to both men and women.  With regard to monitoring the order, I consider the order to be a very important exercise which must be <Col N="1590" /> developed well.  The area is one of concern both domestically and within Europe.  It is one which Ireland is approaching more vigorously than most other member states of the European Community.  There is also the consideration that removal of the ban on industrial nightwork by women has obviously direct connections with the broader issue of labour market flexibility.</P>
    <P>I have proposed that monitoring the effects of the order will be by way of a research project, the parameters of which will be worked out beforehand between my Department and the Employment Equality Agency.  The agency have agreed to act as advisers in this process. We had meetings yesterday with the chairperson of the agency on this matter. The intention is that they would take part in the monitoring process for a limited period, say, the first six to nine months of the operation of the order.</P>
    <P>We need to get a clear picture on the ground of the order and whether the measure is enough to facilitate greater equality.  There may be also the related question of the impact on employers of the recommendations currently attached to shift work licences.  I envisage discussions taking place between my Department and the agency very shortly in order to settle satisfactorily the necessary concrete arrangements for getting the research project underway.  In that context we will examine the points made by the Deputy in relation to the scope of the monitoring.  The Deputy who referred to the ILO Convention 89 may be unaware that that was denounced in 1982.  I think the other Convention relates to mining.</P>

      <P>The legislative proposals designed to amend the two Acts have been prepared.  However, I have requested that a review of these proposals be undertaken by my Department.  I want to have them assessed to ensure, first, that the proposals concerned are valid and, secondly, that they seriously address the real difficulties which the operation of the two Acts may have brought to life. I put a timescale of approximately one year on the work when I discussed the issue yesterday with the Chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency because I believe the amendment is important.  A little more time spent in getting the Bill right is more appropriate.</P>
      <P>A number of things have happened since the first review of the legislation. My officials advise &mdash; I think it is correct advice and the advice would be supported by the agency and, I hope by the spokespersons for the parties &mdash; that it would be better to take some time to ensure that the two Acts are amended properly. As has been pointed out, it is ten years since they were reviewed.  The reviews that take place will be proper reviews and we will bring in a Bill &mdash; we will not rush it thus leading to a series of further orders, amendments and difficulties over the years.  I would rather spend a year trying to get matters right.  I would be very happy to keep the spokespersons briefed on the progress through the year to avoid any difficulty.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for supporting this order.  It is just a measure to put something on the programme and I ask them for their support in legislation which I hope to bring forward in my term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1987</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on 1st April, 1987.</P>
      <P>The proposed Regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, which is designed to secure a financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The need to adjust the rates arises from the Government's decision to increase the funding for the schemes to £30 million in 1987 and to require farmers to contribute more fully to the cost of the schemes. The new rates from 20 April will be 1.1 pence per gallon of milk processed and £6.50 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live.  The expected yield from the levies this year is £19.4 million that is the same as provided for by the previous Government.  The unavoidable delay in introducing the new rates of levy means that somewhat higher rates than originally envisaged will have to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach to disease eradication in 1987 is to restore the impetus to the bovine TB eradication scheme which was lost following cutbacks in funding in 1986 and to continue the drive towards final eradication of brucellosis. Arrangements have been made to begin a new testing programme on 21 April which will consist of a monitor of the national herd coupled with special testing programmes in badly affected areas.  While we would hope to carry out special programmes in most counties we will be concentrating in particular on <Col N="1593" /> County Longford which has the highest levels of TB in the country and west Cork which has been a traditional &ldquo;black spot&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the question of how the levies are used, I want to make it clear that the levies go to finance the running costs of the schemes, the two biggest items being the fees paid to veterinary practitioners for testing, and reactor and depopulation grants to farmers.  Expenditure on these two items alone is expected to come to about £24 million in 1987, a figure well in excess of the anticipated revenue of £19.4 million from the levies.  Taking into account other running costs, such as supplies, equipment, travelling etc., the Exchequer's contribution to the schemes in 1987, apart from administration, comes to £10.6 million.  This is a significant amount especially in the current difficult budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>In recent times there have been a number of suggestions for making the TB scheme more effective.  I can see merit in some of the arguments put forward; other suggestions strike me as having been thought through less fully and, if implemented, could have serious consequences for our farmers and traders. While I am open to ideas that will make for a more effective scheme and will, indeed, explore the more realistic possibilities of doing this over the coming months, I have to say that any new arrangements must satisfy some basic requirements, namely that they be clearly shown to be capable of eradicating TB, pose no threat to our export interests and, in present budgetary circumstances, be as near to self-financing as possible.</P>
    <P>The bovine disease eradication programme constitutes a sizeable part of the manpower and other resources of my Department and, as I have indicated, I will be subjecting it to thorough review in the months ahead with a view to achieving greater efficiency and speeding up the process of disease eradication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's speech, not so much for what is in it as for what is not included.  The Minister was Vice-Chairman <Col N="1594" /> of the last Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure who produced a major review of the programme for the eradication of bovine TB and a long list of recommendations as to how that might be achieved.  If one searches the Minister's speech for any vision or leadership in this regard, one finds them sadly lacking.</P>
      <P>We are entering a new era from the point of view of funding for the programme, and this imposes an obligation to chart out a new course through which the central objective of TB eradication will be achieved.  More of the same is just not good enough.  I ask the Minister in his reply to deal with the central crucial issues which now confront us in this very important area.</P>
      <P>We have had many reports in relation to the eradication programme, in particular the report of the Dáil committee of which the Minister in the last Dáil was Vice-Chairman.  We have had the O'Connor report through the ESRI.  At this stage there is general agreement that there is no mystery about the background to the current problems.  Looking back to the fifties we remember that the Department of Agriculture introduced a scheme and I suppose the reaction of the farmers at the time was that it was something they had to put up with.  In that situation irregularities were inevitable. Despite that, enormous progress was made in the early years of the scheme, particularly in the first two decades, and this should not be overlooked.  I understand that the figures at the time of the introduction of the scheme were of the order of one animal in six subject to TB and after a period of about 20 years of the scheme this was reduced to an incidence of about one in 300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that the progress in the last decade has been negligible.  This is particularly obvious when we compare our figures with those from other EC member states.  From the figures set out in one of the appendices to the report of the PEC we find that Ireland has the greatest number of TB reactors as a percentage of the number of cattle in the country of all the EC member states. <Col N="1595" /> Therefore, it is clear that we have not been as successful as our European counterparts in eradicating bovine TB. The most recent figures confirm that the number of TB reactors as a percentage of the cattle population here was almost 0.465 per cent.  If we look at the figures in the other EC member states we find only two countries with figures which are somewhat comparable.  Italy had 0.439 per cent and Greece 0.382 per cent, but all the other member states have incidence figures which are only a fraction of those.  Perhaps of particular concern is the fact that the incidence of bovine TB in this State is almost five times that of Northern Ireland, despite our similar farming patterns, climate and environment.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we have a problem despite the enormous expenditure of almost £1,000 million in present-day money terms over the past 30 years.  The question is, how do we respond to the challenge presented by that problem?  It is in that context that in my opening remarks I was somewhat critical of the Minister's contribution and will be suggesting that he deal with these matters on reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just make one point for clarification?  It is because of the time constraint on the Bill, which allows only two hours and I wanted to ensure that all Deputies who wished to do so had an opportunity to speak.  I could have spoken for an hour and a half but that would equally have been criticised.  I am not saying my contribution is comprehensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I put forward my point as a suggestion.  I would ask the Minister who has much expertise in this area, to indicate how he feels we should now go forward in achieving the objective. First, what should that objective be? We must switch from what, at least in terms of reference over the last decades, has been a TB containment scheme to an approach designed to reduce disease prevalence such as that prevailing in Northern Ireland.  That must be the <Col N="1596" /> objective over the next number of years. My own belief is that with a programme which has full backing and the commitment of all concerned that target is attainable over a period of from three to four years.</P>
      <P>What will be very important here is the question of attitude.  Perhaps that is the most essential element in this new approach.  The motion today involves farmers taking a very major financial responsibility for the scheme.  If that is coupled with a greater farmer input in the management of the scheme, it will result in a greater acceptance of the scheme and a greater commitment to success. As I see it now, the time is right for a specific change in management structures to take on board this proposal.  I have been considering how best this could be achieved and have been looking at proposals from the IFA.  I have a suggestion to make, one that I think could work but, obviously, it needs to be teased out.  I put it forward for serious consideration.  We can achieve this new approach by way of establishing an executive office along the lines set out in the White Paper, Serving the Country Better.  That executive office would be established by transferring into it those members of the Department of Agriculture and Food who are at present involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>While the ultimate responsibility would continue to lie with the Minister, this executive office would have a chief executive with, of course, all the powers and responsibilities that would follow such an appointment, but, in addition, I would suggest for serious consideration that there would be a board of management. The importance of this board of management is that it would provide for farmer input in the management of the scheme.  I would envisage such board of management of the executive office would consist of civil servants, members, of the veterinary profession but, above all, members representative of farming interests who are now largely paying the piper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been examining the situation in other Civil Service areas and we have already some precedents.  From the point <Col N="1597" /> of view of the establishment of an executive office, we have the Social Services Office, now running quite successfully. From the point of view of the establishment of an office with a board of management having on it outside membership we have, I think, a precedent in the establishment of the National Statistics Board.  My understanding of that board is that they operate an executive office in the statistics area and have on the board expertise from outside.  From the point of view of structures, I do not suggest this is the only answer, but it seems to be one possible answer to the establishment of a new approach with that most essential item, ensuring that there is a farmer input in the management of the scheme.  There are other possibilities and I would not exclude any of them.  The IFA have suggested an executive board of directors.  There are other suggestions involving the establishment of a semi-State office, or an independent tribunal.  I would be open on these but the one that appears to be certainly worthy of very serious consideration is the establishment of an executive office with a board of management having farmer representation.</P>
    <P>If we get the structures right, we must also look very carefully at the operation of the scheme.  If we adopt the proposal I am putting forward, there will be a more positive attitude consequent on that change and through that structure a much more innovative and flexible approach in dealing with the scheme.  There is need for concentration on new systems, including computerisation of the national herd, on which some work has been done but it stands to be completed.  A new approach to an animal identification system is needed.</P>
    <P>We also must be prepared to accommodate regional variations.  Of necessity, a national approach applied rigidly in Kildare may not necessarily bring the same results in west Cork.  The farming patterns are different in both areas and because of that it may be necessary to have a different approach in dealing with problems.  There is the possibility, under this new arrangement which I propose, <Col N="1598" /> to have that greater degree of flexibility. One could have an extension of the blitz programmes, taking into account the advice of the people on the ground as to how best to cope with particular problems in the different areas.</P>
    <P>There is another very major aspect that is and must be of concern to anybody interested in bovine TB eradication.  That is the question of research.  This aspect was looked at in the various reports.  As I understand it, there seems a general view that the area of research has to be broadened and that, specifically, there is urgent need for further research into the methods used in coping with the disease, examination of the spread of the disease and how to cope with that, and the problem of the development of a supplementary test in the diagnosis of TB.  I do not in any way suggest I am an expert in this field, but it is quite clear there must be a greater concentration on this whole area.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that must be looked at if we are examining this scheme and charting its future, that is, the question of administration costs.  I am not one who glibly will look at administration costs and say they are a soft target for savings, but I have to take on board the fact that administration costs in Northern Ireland appear to be far less than those obtaining here.  A figure of 50 per cent has been quoted.  I am not sure if there is an exact analogy in respect of the systems operating in both parts of this island, but it is generally accepted that the administration costs there are very much lower. At present, I understand, we have approximately 1,300 civil servants involved in the scheme.  We have administration costs of approximately £15 million. It is right to question whether a greater degree of efficiency can be achieved so that the moneys that are made available for eradication go towards the purpose for which they were designed and above all so that the farmers who are now expected to make a contribution towards eradication will be satisfied that their moneys are going to that purpose and not paying for public <Col N="1599" /> service jobs.</P>
    <P>If the computerisation programme progresses quickly this should enable some savings to be found.  A serious examination and reappraisal of the whole system could produce far greater savings. If we proceed with the establishment of an executive office and a management board their first major task would be to work on the containment and reduction of the administration costs.  There are many other issues relating to this problem which I do not propose to go into in detail but perhaps I should mention a few.</P>
    <P>I often wonder, as somebody who has taken over this brief, how we can be serious about TB eradication whereby reactors are identified and are not immediately certified as such and ordered for removal virtually on the spot.  As I understand it the system involves the veterinary surgeon reporting the incident to the district veterinary office.  Subsequently, in the fullness of time the necessary documentation is completed for the removal of the reactor.  I find that a very strange system.  If the veterinary officer is entrusted with the task of testing the animal, surely he should be trusted with the job of producing the necessary documenation for removal of that animal.  Taking it a step further I have noticed that a collection system in my area, based in Bandon, is working very successfully.  If that is so I believe the Minister should give me an indication that this system will be established in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We have many reports and recommendations from various bodies: the Committee on Public Expenditure, the ESRI and the IFA.  What we need now is action.  Funding is only one aspect of TB eradication.  Of course funding is essential but money alone is not the answer.  We need a new approach with the total involvement of and commitment by all those involved.  Only in this way will the programme for eradication of bovine tuberculosis be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure to eradicate bovine TB over the past 30 years <Col N="1600" /> which has cost over £1,000 million in public funds in today's terms, and the slaughter of two million animals, is a national scandal.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and his Minister of State responsible for the food industry are serious in their stated aim, in making Ireland the food centre of Europe, then central to this aspiration must be the eradication of bovine diseases.  This will then ensure a supply of healthy and wholesome raw materials.</P>
      <P>The eradication programme to date has been a costly failure, both to farmers and the Exchequer.  The Committee on Public Expenditure meeting in October of last year were forced to the conclusion that drastic action to remove technical and administrative constraints was essential to a cost effective TB eradication programme.</P>
      <P>Further, the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure identified no less than 25 matters of serious concern in the operation of the eradication programme, and it is in these areas that the Progressive Democrats would like to see the Minister addressing himself rather than using the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act as a means of raising and gathering extra taxes.</P>
      <P>The disease eradication programme has now assumed the proportions of a major industry, employing over 1,300 civil servants in various categories, and notwithstanding that the bulk of the field work is done by 800 private vets.</P>
      <P>Last year farmers paid £14.5 million in disease levies and less than 50 per cent of herds were tested.  All reliable evidence points to the fact that central to the success of an eradication programme are intensive annual rounds of testing.  I am informed that there are herds in existence that have not had a round of testing since 1983.  If such a situation exists, how can anybody say with any certainty what the actual national disease status now is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Veterinary Union have stated that they could complete a full round of testing for £8.5 million.  If this is correct are we to assume that out of the £14.5 million raised in levies last year approximately £4 million to £4.5 million was actually paid out for testing?  I would like <Col N="1601" /> to ask the Minister what was the amount that was actually paid out to the private veterinary surgeons who undertook the actual testing in 1986.  Since the late sixties there has never been three consecutive years of a full round of testing.</P>
    <P>There is a growing consensus among individual farmers and also at farmer organisation level that the time is nigh for a change in direction, with a new structure, to totally eliminate, and not just contain bovine TB and brucellosis. In that pursuance and taking up what the Minister had to say I believe that his basic requirements, namely that any new proposals would have to be capable of eradicating TB I say in that context that the old system has patently failed to eradicate the disease and has failed to be self-financing.  Central to this objective is: yearly rounds of testing with the farmers dealing directly with his or her vet.  The Progressive Democrats propose that the landowner be given the responsibility for the health status of his or her herd.  The role of the Department of Agriculture and Food would then become a managerial one with a phased reduction of civil servants employed on the disease eradication scheme with a subsequent saving in levies.</P>
    <P>Will the motion before the House proposing to increase levies to £20 million annually give any guarantee that every herd owner will have a full round of testing in 1987?  Is the Minister prepared to give the House an undertaking that such a guarantee will be forthcoming if the proposed levies are implemented?</P>
    <P>There are many more aspects of the disease eradication programme requiring urgent redress and attention, such as, first, an effective epidemiological unit which can investigate unexplained outbreaks in hitherto clear areas and herds. Second, the need for strict uniformity in testing throughout the country.  Third, the full implementation of the relevant rules and regulations by all concerned and, fourth, a substantial increase in the penalties for tampering with ear tags and identity cards.  Individuals, heedless of the consequences of their carelessness, can no longer be allowed to stand in <Col N="1602" /> the way of eliminating tuberculosis and brucellosis.  Bovine tuberculosis has been eliminated in many European counties in less time than our programme has been in operation.  For example, it has taken 22 years to get the incidence down to 0.04 per cent in Northern Ireland.  We must take the necessary steps to put our house in order no matter how unpalatable or radical those steps may be.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats oppose any increase in the levies and, indeed, are opposed to them in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief remarks arising from the Minister's introductory comments.  May I wish him well in his new ministry.  It is an understatement to say that there is very great concern among taxpayers at the failure to make the progress that most people would have liked to have seen in the eradication of disease as it has been funded through public taxation over the past several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that a number of the points made already are entirely valid in relation to what efficacy we may envisage from the levies which this year will be of the order of £19.4 million, as was mentioned in the course of the Minister's remarks.  May I say immediately that this whole question of levies, when commented on by the Labour Party, has a fundamental principle at stake.  The principle is entirely that one should out of general taxation make provision for such moneys as are necessary to bring agriculture as a resource and the quality of the national herd to a state of adequacy and that such a scheme is preferable to the imposition of a levy system.  Within the constraints of a levy system I might say this, that I fear it will have the defect of being unable to discriminate between the impact of the levy on farms and herds of different size, a great defect in itself. The overall proposals in relation to agriculture &mdash; with which we can deal when we come to discuss the main budget &mdash; are not encouraging in that regard; for example, the cutbacks envisaged in relation to the advice available to farmers, <Col N="1603" /> as they will affect small farmers in particular, will be such as to render it very difficult to see discipline obtaining among very smallholders and which is necessary for an effective eradication programme.</P>
    <P>Having stated the sense of outrage felt by a highly taxed population at our apparent failure to make progress by comparison with other countries, I do not subscribe to the view that this is a matter of money only.  I want to express my concern that when attempts have been made to ask questions as to the structure of our eradication scheme and to compare the structure of our scheme with that of others, one is usually met with a blank response from some of the practitioners involved &mdash; that if additional moneys are voted then we can get on with the business of eradication.  It is clear to any person on the street that it is not a matter of money only.  Other spokespersons here have asked the entirely reasonable question: is there some inherent defect in the structure of the scheme preventing us making the progress we might have envisaged?  That is an extremely reasonable question.  I note the Minister's handling of time so as to allow maximum participation in the debate but I would urge him when he comes to speak again to explain what he meant when he said in the course of his introductory remarks:</P>
    <P>In recent times there have been a number of suggestions for making the TB scheme more effective.  I can see merit in some of the suggestions put forward; other propositions strike me as perhaps thought through less fully and, if implemented, could have serious consequences for our farmers and traders.</P>
    <P>This suggests that there has been a wide range of proposals put to the Minister and his Department, some good and some bad, which have about them the status of a comment about the weather. I should like the Minister to tell us what <Col N="1604" /> proposals he finds have merit and probable efficacy.  Some of us watching different current affairs programmes dealing with this subject, following the debate in the agricultural journals and so on, are very well aware that people have proposals to make.  I should like to know which are considered to be meritorious in themselves and likely to yield results. Equally, I should like to know which have been dismissed because, in that regard, there are suggestions that could be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The third principal point I want to make is in relation to the notion of the self-financing arrangements for the eradication of disease.  This is an inherent point when one moves to the imposition of levies rather than to general taxation.  It seems to me it has an inherent defect in that the people who have worked hard and responsibly in agriculture not only at eradicating disease but maintaining the status of disease-free herds are discouraged by the lack of effort by others in their areas.  We would appreciate had there been made available to us information on social and economic characteristics of the farming community who are and who are not helping in relation to disease eradication.  Surely it must be heart-breaking for many people who have made an effort to see neighbours flouting the different measures taken, without adequate penalties being imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Looking at the long history of public money being spent on disease eradication programmes, surely there must be some concern of a greater kind than I have seen expressed from within the farming organisations themselves as to the lack of discipline involved which has prevented us from achieving these levels.  Continually I hear prominent members of some of the bigger farming organisations hectoring the trade union movement about industrial peace, industrial man hours lost and so on.  I have not seen the same voices turned on some of their members who are major consumers of public taxation.  It is useful to draw a distinction between those who are assisting and those who are not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> I would regard it as a fundamental of good citizenship within the agricultural community that there be a commitment to disease eradication.  It is particularly interesting in so far as the Minister's new Department is entitled Agriculture and Food.  Surely the eradication of disease is one of the most important preliminaries to our moving into the food industry, into capturing the value-added content and the related employment which would come from that, so that we would have dramatic results as quickly as possible?  I agree with previous speakers who would agree with spending money on a disease eradication programme to enable it to be completed, but I am worried about the idea of simply funding a programme which is in all its structural features similar to one which has obviously not been effective.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of surveying the state of Irish agriculture, the impact of the farm tax proposals will lead to an immediate lack of availability of a number of people who are doing more than just assessing acreage for adjustment purposes.  It will lead to a much smaller official presence on the farms involved.  As the State withdraws more and more, as State personnel withdraw more and more and as we rely more and more on levies, we will have less rather than more discipline in relation to disease eradication.  I make these points not because I begrudge a penny of the public moneys spent on improving the quality of Irish agriculture or the quality of the national herd.  In order not to be divisive I would say that workers are as dissatisfied with our industrial policy as they are about the money wasted on disease eradication. We would welcome some kind of a statement on the structural features of the systems that have worked best in other countries and on the disabilities of their application in the Irish case, on what changes are envisaged in relation to our own scheme, on which schemes are to be discussed with the vets, with ACOT and on what special studies have been done in this area and have been provided to the Minister's Department.  We would also like at some stage an elaboration of <Col N="1606" /> these mysterious positive and negative suggestions to which we know the Minister has listened with courtesy, but it is not clear what they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can dispute that a disease eradication scheme that commenced over 30 years ago and which has involved the expenditure of perhaps hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money and which has not eradicated the disease has failed.  In County Longford there are outbreaks of bovine TB and the incidence of the disease there is higher than when the scheme commenced. There is nearly an equally bad situation in County Westmeath and a high level of bovine TB exists in practically every other county in Ireland.  The inescapable, unacceptable and embarrassing conclusion is that the attempt to eradicate bovine TB has been almost a total failure. A stranger being presented with these facts would first ask &ldquo;who has been in charge of this scheme for the past 30 years?&rdquo;  The answer is that the Department of Agriculture have had the entire control of this scheme since then.  The Department have, in effect, determined the level of funding, the controls and the scientific aspects of the scheme.  The Department must stand indicted for having made a total mess of bovine TB eradication.  I do not say that with any pleasure.  It is forced on me, when we look at the level of bovine TB in the Irish herd today.  The Department have made a total hash of the scheme and it is high time there were changes in the administration of that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be an involvement of new parties and new thinking must be admitted into this whole area.  I understand that the farmers' association have recently suggested that control should be on a tripartite basis.  The Department must have a say, farmers must have a say and the veterinary profession must have a say.  It is common sense that the three interested parties should get together and hammer out a scheme with the correct administration, the scientific input and the financial input, designed to achieve <Col N="1607" /> a reduction in the incidence of disease in our herd to an internationally acceptable level, something we have failed to achieve after 30 years of trying. It is surely as obvious as the noses on our faces that radical changes in the administration of this scheme are necessary. The only area of wasted money I can compare with this waste &mdash; indeed it does not compare; it is in the halfpenny place &mdash; is the money wasted on the Connaught Regional Airport.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was brief and his reason for that was to give us time to get in.  I will not delay the House for long but I have to draw the attention of the House to a matter to which I have already adverted, that is, the high level of bovine TB in County Longford and the level which is nearly as high in County Westmeath, in west Cork and in other areas throughout the country.  Nobody knows why these areas suffer from this high incidence of the disease.  Yet, for the past 30 odd years there has been a similar flare of disease in odd locations in the country.  As far as I am aware no scientific or epidemiological research has been done to identify the cause of this high incidence in certain parts of the country.  There has been only very slight scientific study and very vague knowledge as to how bovine TB spreads.  The inthing was lateral spread &mdash; it jumped across the ditch.  I do not know whether that is so.  It may be that Irish farming practices are so bad that the defeat of this disease is just impossible to achieve.  It may be that farming structures with the frequent movement of cattle is such as to defy a solution, but we do not know after 30 years and countless millions having been spent.  We do not know these basic facts.</P>
    <P>Consequently, all these points emphasise the imperative of restructuring the administration of the eradication scheme.  It is essential that it be taken out of the hands that have failed for the past 30 years, and other parties brought into it.  This has to be done as a matter of urgency because at this stage I am sure our European partners must be looking <Col N="1608" /> askance at us and must be looking at us with a certain amount of kindly contempt because of our failures in this area.  We must obviously be putting at risk their continued tolerance for our failure in this area.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would be a little more specific on the figures as to how the projected £30 million will be spent.  I gather the three main items of spending are the fees paid to veterinary surgeons, the reactor depopulation grants to farmers and administration. The Minister indicated that in 1987 it is expected the veterinary fees and the reactor grants to farmers will take up £24 million of the scheme.  I would like to see the breakdown of that between veterinary fees and farmers' grants.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer's contribution in 1987 is £10.6 million on top of the £19.4 million to be raised from the levies out of a total expenditure of £30 million.  The Minister indicated £24 million will be spent on veterinary fees and reactor depopulation grants, leaving £6 million for administration. I would like the Minister to tell us if that is the entire cost of the administration of the scheme and what it covers.  He said &ldquo;taking into account other running costs, namely, for supplies, equipment, travelling, etc., the Exchequer's contribution to the schemes in 1987, apart from administration, comes to £10.6 million&rdquo;.  What does the term &ldquo;administration&rdquo; cover?  Does it cover the army of functionaries who go around the country and who issue cards and leave documents with farmers at great expense?</P>
    <P>I recall a recent dispute which the Department settled with the veterinary profession.  It was a condition of the settlement that when a reactor was identified the veterinary surgeon would serve an appropriate document on the farmer there and then, but the agricultural officers objected because it was one of their perks that when a vet reported a reactor they would drive out to serve that document on the farmer, claiming travelling and subsistence expenses.  The Department gave way in that instance <Col N="1609" /> and agreed that that wasteful, unnecessary and expensive practice be continued. Therefore, I would like the Minister to tell us how much of the scheme money is spent on travelling and subsistence expenses for the officials concerned and how much is covered by this word &ldquo;administration&rdquo; which the Minister separated in his speech from the other costs of running the scheme.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to acquaint themselves with the volume of regulations made under the parent Act because it would take a lorry to bring them all into this House.  The amount of bureaucracy which this scheme has fostered over the past 30 years is incredible.  Every new round of testing produces some new form of bureaucratic control, all designed with the objective of reducing and eventually eliminating the disease, all as futile as their predecessors.</P>
    <P>We need a totally new approach but the Minister will not get it until sole control is removed from his Department who have singularly and obviously failed to discharge the functions given to them by the late James Dillon 30 odd years ago. A new radical approach is necessary and can only be put in place by putting new people in charge of disease eradication. That new group should be a tripartite group composed of the Department, the veterinary profession and the farmers. If they were given the budget which is available I have no doubt they would have the incidence down to an acceptable level in jig time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this motion for increased levies for bovine tuberculosis.  I have a practical knowledge of all the hardships and problems involved being a practising farmer. I look on this review as one of the hardy annuals of the agricultural industry and the bane of the farming community.  For 30 years we have been involved in disease eradication.  When I was a schoolboy my only good memory of this scheme was being kept home from school to bring in the cattle.  This scheme came into being in the late fifties and farmers co-operated: it was not a compulsory scheme.  To this <Col N="1610" /> day the farmers have played their part.  I want to make it clear that the failure of this scheme cannot be laid at the door of the farmers.  Now we are being given an opportunity to review this scheme and we should not continue along the road which led to this failure.</P>
      <P>Of course it was not a complete failure. Deputy O'Keeffe gave us some figures. Up to the sixties we made very good progress and I believe I know the reason. We reduced the incidence from one in six to one in 300.  In the early sixties farmers were compelled to participate in the scheme and veterinary surgeons from Northern Ireland and England were employed by local practitioners.  They encamped in an area which was completely tested.  At that time an area was designated and tested systematically but we got away from that.  Over the past ten years we adopted a haphazard approach. When a area was designated, the private practitioner was notified but six or 12 months could elapse before neighbouring herds were tested.  That, I believe, was the cause of the breakdown.  Last year we got back to the system we operated in the sixties.  We started a systematic testing of herds in a certain area and neighbouring herds were tested within seven to nine days.  That made sense because if there was a TB reactor in a herd that animal could be identified and isolated.</P>
      <P>We have to change our policy and have a more systematic operation of the scheme.  The levies begin introduced today mean a considerable increase in the levies farmers are paying.  If the farmers are making this contribution of £19.5 million, surely it is a case of he who pays the piper calls the tune.  The farmers should have a say in how this scheme is operating. That is only fair.  They have a great deal of knowledge to impart but they have not been consulted in the past.  Civil servants, who are far removed from reality, dictated how the scheme should operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Cooney, I should like a breakdown of the costs.  I want to mention the hardship suffered by farmers whose herds have been destroyed.  The <Col N="1611" /> compensation being paid for small store cattle is far from adequate.  The compensation for a good dairy herd which has been infected and destroyed does not leave the farmer with sufficient income to replace that herd when his farm is cleared.  An even more serious point is that when a farm is completely depopulated there is no provision for an income for the farmer.  If he worked in industry or was employed by the State and lost his job he could look for social welfare assistance or unemployment benefit but the farmer gets no money. How is he expected to provide for himself and his family?  Has the Minister any proposals to make to help such a farmer? If farmers in areas where there are severe problems know they will be out of pocket and will not get reasonable compensation for the cattle that are being taken from them, how can they be expected to give full co-operation when they have families to raise?  What will be done to give such people an income until they are able to get into farming again?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Longford as an area on which the Department will concentrate.  May I suggest that the Longford-Cavan border be considered because the outbreak of the disease in County Longford has meant it has spread into part of County Cavan.  Therefore when looking at County Longford, I ask the Minister to take into account the parts of County Cavan which border County Longford where there is a very serious outbreak.  I know farmers who do a good job, who do not buy in stock, who rear their own replacement stock, who keep their fences in good order and who have not had an outbreak in the last five years but who found on the last test round that a number of their animals showed positive signs of TB.  What is the reason for that?  Are we carrying out any investigations as to how a farm such as that can be hit when the farmer is running his farm by the book and doing everything possible to prevent TB?  There must be some reason other than mismanagement. Is there any investigation being carried <Col N="1612" /> out with regard to wildlife, badgers, for instance, carrying the disease?  There is a theory that where badgers are prevalent there seem to be outbreaks of TB.  Those are some of the problems farmers are faced with.  They would like to know why there are sudden outbreaks of TB in herds where there were no outbreaks in the last ten years.  Their local veterinary officers are not giving them satisfactory answers.  Are we working in conjunction with the Ministry in Northern Ireland, in England and Europe even in this matter? We should all pool our resources in order to find the reason for these outbreaks of TB.</P>

      <P>After 30 years of a bovine TB eradication programme it can rightly be said that we have attained a rather dubious distinction, that of having the worst incidence record in Europe, in this regard, followed only by Italy and Greece.  That is the position at a time when it is imperative that the Irish food industry takes full account of ensuring a continued niche in the European and world markets.  That is something we should all ponder on very seriously.  The taxpayers are extremely annoyed at the continued expenditure while there is such apparent lack of success.  Consumers are equally and rightly concerned at the continued expenditure and the obvious ineffectiveness of the schemes to date. Having regard to all of that, one can only conclude that after 30 years we do not seem to have achieved a great deal other than continuing year after year to carry out a test system which does not seem to operate very effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have come to me telling of having bought in animals that had had clear tests and in respect of which export certificates had been issued.  These were bought into farms where there had been no previous experience of bovine tuberculosis but after six months or less these farmers found that half their herds were reactors.  Obviously something is happening along the line to such an extent as to do great damage to the whole system of testing and of attempting to eradicate <Col N="1613" /> bovine tuberculosis.  I appeal to the Minister &mdash; I know he is thinking along those lines having regard to his speech this evening &mdash; to look again at the various means and methods that have been adopted and incorporated in the scheme to date.  He should find out if, for instance, the vaccines we have been using for a number of years, which we have changed from time to time, have brought about the desired results.  He should find out also whether there is a reluctance in some parts of the country to carry out tests in a fashion that would be desirable and compatible with the overall requirement to operate the scheme on a national basis to such an extent as to bring about the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We are discussing the introduction of a levy.  Nobody likes to hear about a levy and I am sure the farmers were not too happy when they heard about it but it has the element that there will be an added impetus on the part of the farming community to ensure that the bovine TB eradication scheme is successful, that nobody can evade testing or continue in any way to do anything that would be prejudicial to the entire scheme.  From discussions I have had with the farming organisations I know that the farming community are very anxious to ensure the maximum co-operation with the Department in bringing an end to this scandal, and I use the, word, &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; advisably.  In the European context we have a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to assure the House that in the next year, when the new testing round starts, it will be possible to ensure that all farmers, particularly those on whose farms there has been a history of bovine tuberculosis, carry out tests and that spot checks are done at regular intervals so that animals removed from those areas are not likely to infect other parts of the country which might be free of tuberculosis.  I suggest that, as opposed to using the district electoral divisions as boundaries for testing on a regional basis, natural boundaries or divisions such as rivers, lakes, mountain ranges and so on be taken into account. These would provide a much safer guideline <Col N="1614" /> than the old system of District Electoral Divisions.  They would obviously be much easier controlled and would make it much easier to ensure that there would not be cross infection between the various areas.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and other speakers, too, suggested the setting up of a management team.  That would be a very desirable way to approach this matter.  If a management team were set up it could incorporate the Minister's office, the farming organisations and the veterinary profession. With the full co-operation of all concerned it should be possible to bring about a position whereby greater progress could be achieved during the next two or three years than has been achieved in the past 30 years.  One of the things we are all most concerned with is that we do not face another 20 or 30 years of the same.  The farming organisations, the farming community, the consumers and the taxpayers are equally concerned that that would not happen.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned that the eradication scheme is an industry and it looks as if it is.  That is unfortunate.  It was initiated in order to have a job done, that of eradicating disease, nothing more and nothing less and it should be seen as such.  The objective must be to eradicate the disease, otherwise there is no sense in putting money into the scheme year after year.</P>
    <P>After identification of a reactor in a herd, the process of removing that reactor is not satisfactory.  Obviously, once a reactor is identified it should be removed immediately from the herd.  I know certain checks have to be made to see whether there is cross infection and that animals that had tests that were inconclusive previously may transpire to have active lesions.  On the other hand, once a veterinary surgeon decides that a animal is a reactor, the obvious thing to do in the interest of overall expenditure and efficiency should be to remove that animal from the herd and ensure that no further infection is caused by it.  If that was done it would reassure all other herd owners in the area that their interests <Col N="1615" /> were being looked after.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan mentioned the fact that birds and certain animals are carriers of the disease.  The question has been asked again and again how a herd which has previously been free from tuberculosis has been reinfected when store cattle are brought in.  One can investigate and evaluate but there is a question to be answered in that regard.  When that question is answered we will know why eradication has failed for the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>The one good thing about the food industry is our ability to produce a quality product and to sell it on international markets.  We have already achieved a great deal in that area but, as we have the worst incidence of TB in Europe, people elsewhere may well take a second look at us.  We must be very careful in that regard and the Minister must take the necessary measures to ensure that the scheme is brought satisfactorily to a conclusion; by that I mean the eradication which the name implies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in congratulating the Minister and wishing him well.  I also wish to congratulate you on your appointment.</P>
      <P>I wish to express outrage, on behalf of the people I represent, at the scandalous failure of this scheme.  An unbelievable amount of taxpayers' and farmers' money has been spent but we are now worse off than when it started.  If it had been possible to have an effective scheme 20 or 30 years ago, the money that would have been released for research and development in farming, the creation of added value in farming and the wealth which would have been created for the country in general, would have left us in a very different situation from an agricultural point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should examine how the scheme has been working to date and if there has been a breach in regulations. Have there been incidences of fraud? Have there been unscrupulous actions by farmers in breaking regulations which they know will put themselves and their neighbours at risk, in the hope of making <Col N="1616" /> quick, easy money?  The Minister should restructure the scheme to eliminate all these possibilities.  That will not be easy but we should look at the more effective schemes operated in other countries.  We should try to ensure that our disease level will be reduced to that of other European countries.</P>
    <P>I see the tax element in the motion before us as a regressive movement in the whole tax structure.  It is moving from an equitable central taxation system based on ability to pay or the wealth possibilities of property.  Paying tax at the point of delivery of a service is not fair on those who have already paid their taxes and done their share in the elimination of this disease.  They, as well as the PAYE worker, will be asked to carry a continuing burden for this scheme.</P>
    <P>Once more I ask the Minister to examine the scheme to see how it can be changed so that the failures of 30 years can be eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody welcomes an increase in taxation for any scheme but we had also proposed the doubling of these levies.  There is always a sting in the tail and these levies have been increased by .1 per cent in relation to milk and by 50p per beast.  Was this discussed by the Minister at his recent meetings with the IFA leaders?  Did they agree to these proposals before the budget?  I accept, in general terms, that we have created another first by our inability to eradicate this disease.  It is a £30 million business and none of us is happy about the way it has developed.  It is only a few short years since the farming organisations offered to play a major part in doing something positive in relation to eliminating this disease. Of course they had not contributed substantial amounts of money but that is not now the case because, as the Minister said, they are paying a total of £19.4 million at present.  I have no doubt that the farming organisations should play a major part in running this scheme.  I asked the previous Minister for Agriculture on a number of occasions to discuss it with his officials, and I ask the new Minister for Agriculture and Food to set <Col N="1617" /> up, without delay, a board of management, as he has the power to do giving the farming organisations a major part in the running of this scheme.  This is the only way to ensure that the continuation of the scheme will be a success in the elimination of bovine TB.</P>
      <P>If the levies continue to increase at the same rate as they are now, it is only around the corner until such time as the farming organisations will be paying for the full implementation of this scheme. That is as plain as the noses on our faces and it does not matter which Government are in office.  Farmers should be given the opportunity to be involved much more in ensuring that the scheme is run properly and that they will comply with rules and regulations which has not been the case in the past.  We all know that a small percentage of people have lived off the scheme because of the way it has been run and the way they organise reactors and bring them into farms.  Deputy Cooney asked how often animals are moved in Ireland.  Most animals are moved about six times during their life in comparison with other European countries where they are only moved once. The collecting of reactors is a major problem. There is no real input into ensuring that reactors are immediately taken from farms which should be the case.  In the Committee on Public Expenditure, of which the Minister was a member, we spent many hours discussing this problem. There are over 1,300 people employed in this scheme and the committee asked that special lorries be provided to collect reactors.  Until such time as little things like this are organised in a proper way, we are not going to eliminate this scheme.  By sitting around the table with the farming organisation and discussing our proposals with them, we can with the £30 million which is available this year, and the same amount of money over the next three years, make a positive effort to eliminate this scheme.  We are all at one in this but I am sorry to say that our friends in the PD's do not want these levies increased.  Do they want the taxpayers to pay the extra money?</P>

While we are paying that acceptable share, the people involved who are paying the piper at this stage should be calling the tune.  I want to ask the Minister if it is true that the officials do not want any interference from outside in regard to the running of this scheme and is he prepared to make a decision to form a board, which would include a number of members from the farming organisations, to eliminate this scheme.  I am fully committed to accepting these proposals as long as a package is put together to sell it to the farmers and the only way the Minister can do this is to give them an input into the running of the scheme.  The farming organisations have branches in almost every parish in Ireland and they can run this scheme much better than the officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food who work five days a week.  I would not like to think that this debate would alarm our colleagues in other European countries.</P>

    <P>From the discussions which we had with the veterinary unions at the Committee on Public Expenditure over the past year and a half, I believe that unless the Minister immediately sets up a board, including members of the farming organisations who are paying two-thirds of the cost at present, we will be back here in one, two or three years time with no improvement made.

      <P>As this is my first occasion to speak in the House I would like to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, and wish him every success in his new position.  Knowing his ability in other areas during the years I have no doubt that he will be an outstanding success.  He will bring great success to Irish agriculture both at home and in Europe.  What is needed at present is confidence in our agriculture industry and I assure him of my full support and assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that we are discussing animal disease eradication because during the last 30 years we have spent almost £1,000 million in today's money terms and slaughtered over one million cattle and we are still the lame duck nation in Europe in disease eradication. As a farmer and a politician I cannot be critical of this because it is mainly brought about by inefficiency at all levels.  The farmers have been used as the scapegoats in this case and are the people who have suffered most and lost millions of pounds which is unaccountable for in their efforts <Col N="1620" /> to eradicate disease.  By and large, farmers are people who co-operate and are always forthcoming in their efforts to give assistance in every way possible.  The scheme failed basically because of the way it was operated and the kind of bureaucracy that obtained.  Farmers in Ireland have a problem because of the types of farming in which they are involved and the nature of our industry. There are large movements of calves and cattle from one place to another without proper controls and proper monitoring.</P>
    <P>The question of commonages needs to be looked at and I hope the Minister will direct his attention to this.  In rural areas, commonages are a kind of no-man's land. There must be licensing to overcome the problem where cattle can roam around without being tested for short or long periods and then after a while brought back into the herd.</P>
    <P>With regard to the moving of cattle there should be some type of flying squad which would stop trucks on the roadside and carry out spot checks to see that cattle were identifiable, had proper identity cards and to ascertain the source from which they were purchased.  It is the small minority of people who are breaking the regulations and who are not operating the scheme properly who are the major cause of the problem.  It is frightening to think that one herd in every 30 is still affected.  The EC target is one herd in 500.  I do not see the day when that target will be achieved.  We must protect our exports of dairy products and beef valued at £1 billion in the interests of all the people of this country.  We could put our export trade in jeopardy if we do not carry out this testing programme effectively and correctly.</P>
    <P>What has bedevilled the scheme during the past few years has been the stop-go policy.  We have what is known as the round test.  In some areas there has only been 90 per cent participation and that is not a round test.  A round test means 100 per cent participation in all areas and if it is to be successful it needs 100 per cent participation.  We cannot but criticise the <Col N="1621" /> stop-go policy of Governments in the disease testing area.  For testing to be effective there needs to be continuity and we all know the importance of that not just in disease testing but also in other areas.</P>
    <P>Farmers are going to pay a substantial increase in levies this year.  The cost of administration is alarming and frightening. There are 1,000 civil servants operating the scheme and some 800 vets are involved.  Some of those involved have a vested interest in the continuation of the scheme as it is a dollar earner for many.  The cost of the scheme to the Department is in the region of 40 per cent which is a scandal.  Last year, the civil servants had to be paid before a single animal was tested.  That was as a result of the cutbacks in Exchequer spending. If the scheme is to be successful it has to be taken out of the hands of the Department of Agriculture.  Perhaps some form of privatisation may be the answer to the problem.  I have much sympathy with the farming organisations in the suggestions they have made.  Many proposals have been looked at but all have failed.  Without the co-operation of the farming organisations and without taking their views into account, the scheme will not be successful.</P>
    <P>This year the disease levy is going to be doubled without there being any guarantee that the disease will be eradicted. Something positive must be done to ensure the farming community will be satisfied that their money is not going to waste.  The Committee on Public Expenditure published a report on TB eradication and that report merits a debate in this House.  The committee suggested measures which were worthwhile and I would welcome an opportunity of debating that report in this House.</P>
    <P>Today there was another disruption in the scheme.  I hope the veterinary profession will realise the importance of completing the round testing proposed by the Minister which is due to commence on 20 April.  What the veterinary profession are doing is holding the owners of cattle herds to ransom by not co-operating with the Minister.  This is only going to make a bad situation even worse. <Col N="1622" /> However, I want to point out that the country is not rampant with the disease. I come from an area that has an excellent record in disease eradication.  The successful brucellosis scheme of a few years ago was administered by the co-operative movement.  The disease of brucellosis was frightening in its infancy and many people were very worried.  After a short period substantial progress was made and we are now brucellosis free.  The success of that scheme was due to the involvement of the private sector and the co-operative movement in seeing to it that the scheme was properly administered. Something along those lines is needed in the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>There is no point in penalising farmers as they have suffered enough.  I appeal to the Minister not to attack the farming community.  They should not be the target of attack.  Many other people have failed.  The farming community have not been the beneficiaries of the TB eradication scheme.  There is a lot of work involved in eradicating the disease and, as I have said, the co-operatives have always been willing to undertake that work.  The delays in moving reactors and in land leasing should be looked at.  I will conclude by welcoming the Minister's document and suggestions and I wish him well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As health certification is vital to successful marketing, it is selfevident that the eradication of bovine TB is of vital importance to our dairy, meat and cattle trades.  Here in Ireland, an <Col N="1623" /> insular nation with a temperate climate and with excellent grassland, we have a great natural advantage in the production of cattle.  One of the tenets of the Treaty of Rome which particularly appealed to me is that concerning the concentration of production in the areas of greatest natural advantage.  I doubt if there is another area within the EC which has a greater natural advantage in the production of cattle than here in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The European Community has now a consumer market of 360 million people, all virtually demanding environmentally pure products on their market shelves.  It is in all our interests, and especially in the farmers' interests, to achieve bovine TB eradication.  We must ensure a full round of testing and if possible a round and a half because a round per year will not be sufficient if we are to get to the acceptable levels of eradication now in other countries.  If the only way forward in our disease eradication programme is to proceed on the lines of the motion, we must accept that must be done.  I wish we did not have to ask the farmers to dip into their pockets once again, particularly those who have always paid their way and their fair share but I am sure that if the choice was between them not having a round of testing this year or no further progress along the road to eradication or proceeding as we now suggest they would accept the latter option.</P>
      <P>The final clearance of bovine TB from the national herd remains one of the most urgent problems facing agriculture.  A price cannot be put on the importance of a TB-free status for our herd and, as an agricultural net exporting country, we must strive to achieve this.  The tragedy is that we have been messing around for more than 30 years spending millions of pounds and we have not made much progress, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise two matters that have not been referred to in the debate. The first concerns the method of reporting incidence or prevalence of TB.  In October 1984 when I contributed to a debate on a similar motion I was critical <Col N="1624" /> of the Department for reporting incidence figures.  The figures given for disease incidence only include the results of the round test and do not take into account any animals that might go down on the pre-movement test, the check test or tests at meat plants.  I said it was questionable whether the figure for inconclusive retests was included in the figures for incidence given by the information office of the Department.  A false impression of the seriousness of the position could have been given by that method of reporting. I made the point then that all those extra facts and more incidences of TB would be included if the Department of Agriculture issued figures relating to the prevalence of the disease.  The prevalence figure includes all herds which have broken down or are restricted from any check test, round test, factory test or pre-movement test.  In other words, all positive reactors should be included in the figure for the prevalence of the disease.</P>
    <P>Prevalence is the number of restricted herds as a percentage of the total number of herds in the country while incidence is the number of restricted herds as a percentage of the number of herds tested. I was delighted when the Department changed a year or so ago to reporting our TB problem on prevalence figures, thinking that that was the information we need.  However, I can be forgiven for being somewhat cynical when I discovered that prevalence figures were all of a sudden better than incidence figures. Previously the incidence figures had looked better than the prevalence figures. I ask the Minister to forgive me if I questioned whether the figure was up or whether it was another effort to fool most of us and the farming community.  It may be a coincidence and it may be that I am being unfair but we switched from incidence to prevalence reporting at a time when we all thought that would be more honest because of the type of testing. All of a sudden the prevalence figure is lower than the incidence figure although the reverse was the position heretofore.  I ask the Minister to comment on that and give the House the <Col N="1625" /> reason for the change.  I hope he has a bona fide reason.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the serum we use.  In October 1984 I pointed out that the veterinery community were using a British avian serum and a Dutch bovine serum or, as it was called, a British top and a Dutch bottom.  The whole test is a comparative analysis of the reaction to those injections.  The comparative analyses of the reaction was originally worked out using a British top and bottom.  In October 1984 I said I was unaware of any research work on the efficacy of the system at the time, a British top and a Dutch bottom.  We have changed again and we are now using a Dutch top and a Dutch bottom.  For the second time we have changed the type of serum we are using without any comparative analysis being carried out in relation to the efficacy of the serum used.  I hope the Minister can assure me that scientific research has been carried out on the type of serum we are using and the comparative analyses therefrom.  I do not think it has been carried out.</P>
    <P>Various documents have been issued containing a comparison between the position in Northern Ireland and the Republic in relation to TB incidence. Those documents do not state the type of serum the British are using compared with the type of serum the Irish are using. One cannot use comparative figures for comparative analyses unless one is comparing like with like.  Unless we get the full details and confirmation that adequate backup research has been carried out on the different types of serum we must question the system we are using now.</P>
    <P>The eradication of bovine TB must be based on the histological examination of all lesions rather than the interpretation of an inaccurate test based on the measuring of lumps on cattle which is basically what it is.  The tuberculin test we use is a good screen test for the herd but it is not sufficiently detailed or accurate to select animals within the herd.  We must forget that we are talking about herds that go up or down in the test rather than individual <Col N="1626" /> animals.  The efficacy of it in relation to the individual has not been proved.</P>
    <P>Given tuberculin of 80 per cent sensitivity we could perhaps accept that the test sensitivity as to the status of herds could be up to 98 or 99 per cent. However, when it comes to isolating the individual reactor animal the sensitivity drops dramatically, despite the claims to the contrary by officialdom.  It is a good test from the point of view of the overall herd status but it is not specific in picking up the individual reactors.  Over the years it has consistently failed to pick up the TB animals in our herds.  I hope some of the levy being imposed will go to research.  Deputy Austin Deasy, when Minister for Agriculture, established a research team in the Department and I would like to know the progress they have made and the type of research work they have carried out.  We need far more in the area of epidemiology.  We must find out how the disease is spread and how we can prevent it in future or if we should continue to test and kill the animals that react without deciding on how to prevent infection in the future in our herds.  For more than 30 years, and all the millions of pounds spent on TB eradication, we have spent virtually nothing on research and that stands as an indictment to our seriousness in regard to the eradication of bovine TB.</P>

      <P>As my time is limited I will confine my contribution to a number of important points.  Under the previous administration I was a junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture and I had an opportunity of investigating the TB problem countrywide.  In my view three factors bedevilled the TB eradication scheme.  The first, and the obvious one, was finance.  I admit that the financial position will not be any worse now than it was under the previous Government.  We should not play politics with this issue because of the importance of the national herd to the country.  Politics was played in regard to the shortfall in the expenditure programme of the previous Government and those who stood <Col N="1627" /> outside chapel gates last year are aware of that.</P>

      <P>We heard a lot about the damage those cutbacks would do.  The Minister should not say too much about that because there are many promises hanging around.  I was never satisfied that we knew what caused TB and, having spent four years in the Department, I am still of the view that nobody knows.  That is a serious matter and for that reason I hope that work at the research centre is stepped up.  If staff are needed for that work they should be hired immediately.  When there is a breakdown the official from the DVO is sent out but all he can do is walk around the farm, see about the fencing, the water trough, the badgers and so on.  There is always some reason given and most of the time that reason is perfectly in order and sensible. However, we have no background research to tell us what is actually wrong. How can we explain a sudden outbreak of TB in an area where there has been no breakdown for many years and the farmer does not buy in any cattle?  Until we come to grips with that problem we will never get rid of the disease, no matter how much money we pump in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the debate which has been conducted on this very important issue.  I also thank every Member who wished me well in my responsibility, particularly in tackling this issue on which there is a very definite consensus which is reflected outside the House as well.  While the time allowed for my reply is limited, I assure Deputies that every point made in this excellent debate will be taken on board, but I would ask the indulgence of the House if I do not have time now to refer to all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to be clear about the fact that we have a large reservoir of disease-free cattle which can be and are certified as such and are traded in international markets as live animals or beef. <Col N="1628" /> That is the basis of our very important export trade.  That said, our purpose is to eradicate this disease and only the highest and most exacting standards will be acceptable.  The House has demanded in this debate that nothing less that the best be achieved and I hope we can get the necessary programme under way.</P>
    <P>I want to make a full disclosure to the House of the relevant facts.  The total cost this year is £30 million which is broken down as follows: reactor and depopulation grants, £10.1 million; veterinary fees, £13.4 million; travel, £3 million; miscellaneous items, including computer programmes, £1 million; tuberculin, £1.4 million; tags generally, £0.7 million; milk tests for brucellosis; £0.3 million.  That accounts for roughly £30 million.  Departmental administrative costs amount to another £8 million or £9 million.  That puts on the record the breakdown of the costs.</P>
    <P>I also want to put some other facts on the record so that we will be able to refer back to them in time and see how successful we have been.  There was a certain amount of concern about staffing levels.  About 600 people are concerned with bovine TB and about 300 others are concerned with brucellosis.  I may have misunderstood Deputy McCoy when he said that veterinary fees in 1986 amounted to £4.5 million.  The actual figure is £11 million.  The total breakdown of staff in the Department dealing with disease is as follows: TB staff, 395, mostly administrative staff at the district veterinary offices; veterinary officers, 91; agricultural officers, 165; and seven laboratory officers, giving a total of 658.  A further 301 people deal with brucellosis, giving a grand total of 959.  This represents a very considerable investment in funds and in personnel and we want to maximise that investment.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge immediately that the farm organisations have an essential interest in this matter and a legitimate right to be represented in any structure we introduce.  I hope the House will understand that in the time available to me I cannot go further than saying that I will consider in great detail all that has <Col N="1629" /> been proposed.  The success of the eradication programme depends on full and enthusiastic co-operation between the farmers, the vets and my Department, all of whom have a vital input in the total effort.  In fostering this co-operation I am prepared to the greatest extent possible to take account of the legitimate interests of all parties, particularly the farmers whose well-being depends on the success of the programme.  I hope they will find me open and receptive to ideas aimed at improving the eradication programme. Anything that can be proved to be worthwhile in terms of effectiveness and economy will be acceptable to me.  Our trading requirements are at the base of this.  The success of our farmers and of those engaged in the food sector, as well as our economy generally, is involved here.  For that reason I appreciate the sense of urgency and obligation that has been evident in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke about success in reducing the level of TB incidence to the point where it was down to one in 300 from one in six, but that is the point at which it becomes most difficult.  The dramatic drop occurs in the early stages, as Deputy Connaughton appreciates.  We need an end to the stop-go policy, but I will not go back to parish pump or church gate politics.  The financial element, research and development and other factors are vitally important.  I am trying to maintain the level of finance for this year to ensure a full round.  That does not mean I am relying totally on the old ways or using the levies to maintain the old ways.  I have had preliminary talks with the IFA and hope to have talks with the other farming organisations very shortly.  Over the course of the next few months these will become more searching on this and other issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned the particular problems of commonage.  I would have had the same view, but it appears from the surveys that the incidence of TB in cattle on commonage is sometimes less than the incidence among cattle that are not on commonage.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not time to deal <Col N="1630" /> in detail with the very wide-ranging and informed submissions made to me but I hope my very brief reply to those directly concerned &mdash; the veterinary profession and the farmers in particular &mdash; will indicate that my mind is open to the urgency of the matter.  We have to improve.  Even though we may not be satisfied with our standards it is important to conclude by saying that our standards and what we have achieved give us a reservoir of cattle and beef for export slaughter which is acceptable at the highest level of international standards.</P>

    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit the entry into the State of vessels or aircraft carrying nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to make the point that the manner in which this Bill has come before the House and the short time available for it is an indication of the way in which Private Members' Bills are treated in this House. There have been promises on a number of occasions that Private Members' Bills would be dealt with more favourably. To date there has been no move in that direction.  I urge the new Government to take on board the proposals we have made a number of times that Friday be set aside for Private Members' Bills.  I hope that in the not too distant future that step will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Weapons (Controls) Bill, 1987, which we are discussing tonight seeks to prohibit the entry into the State of any vessel or aircraft carrying nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  Under the Bill any <Col N="1631" /> foreign naval vessel seeking permission to enter Irish waters or any military aircraft seeking permission to fly over or land in this country would first have to furnish a written statement to the effect that it was not carrying any of the prohibited weapons.  There is provision in the Bill also for the inspection of such vessels or aircraft when they land here.</P>
    <P>The visit to Dublin last October of the United States vessel the <i>US Nitro</i>, a ship specifically designed to carry nuclear weapons focused attention once again on the total absence of control in the matter of inspecting naval vessels visiting Irish ports.  The United States Government have persistently refused to say whether US ships visiting Irish ports are carrying nuclear weapons.  Other nuclear powers adopt a similar position.  The policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs which in effect is simply to rely on the goodwill of other countries not to send vessels carrying prohibited weapons is incredibly naive.  Figures given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last year show that permission was given for 1,462 over flights by military aircraft and that a further 271 were given permission to land.  The fact is that we do not know, and the Department of Foreign Affairs do not know, if any of these aircraft were carrying nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. What is even of more concern is that there was an estimated 3,000 overflights in 1986 for which no permission was given.  It is now more important than ever that neutral non-nuclear countries such as ours be seen to be taking a strong stand against these weapons of mass destruction. By passing the legislation we could deliver a strong message to the nuclear powers that we want no hand act or part in nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and that we will do nothing to facilitate their passage around the world by ship or by aircraft.  New Zealand took a stand on this issue.  They have adopted a policy of not allowing in vessels unless an assurance is given that there are no nuclear weapons on board.  There is no reason why we should not follow suit.</P>
    <P>I believe it is inconsistent for the Irish <Col N="1632" /> Government to take a strong stand on radioactive pollution from Sellafield while being prepared, apparently, to turn a blind eye to ships and aircraft entering the State and carrying weapons which could destroy the entire population of the country.  Clearly this legislation would not save the country in the event of a nuclear war.  Only the total elimination of nuclear weapons would do that but it would reduce the dangers to the Irish people and indeed to those on the western coast of Britain, also.  It would reduce the danger of Irish people being the victims of nuclear accident.  I believe it is just as important that it would enable us to deliver a strong public statement of our disapproval of the senseless arms race.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Bill as I indicated last week in the House but I want to make it clear that I am opposing the Bill not for any reason to do with the substance or intent of what Deputy De Rossa has put before us but simply because with the Bill being raised in this manner it would fall to be put into Private Members' time.  Private Members' time has been reserved for parties who have achieved a certain minimum stature in this House.  It is in all conscience a short enough time for matters which require to be raised in this way.  I want to say, however, that I am fully open as are my party to looking at other ways in which we can expand the amount of time available in the House to deal with matters of this kind.  In line with proposals made in the past by my colleague and the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton, I would be prepared, for example, to look at the possibility of allowing Fridays for the discussion of matters of this kind.  For those reasons I am opposing this Bill tonight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> Strictly speaking that is true but because of the way Standing Orders operate the Bill cannot be taken in Private Members' time unless agreed to by the Fine Gael Party or by one of the other parties in Opposition.  Effectively, therefore, it goes into limbo until such time as we get agreement from the other parties to debate it.  Effectively there is no point in opposing it.

      <P>The House may give more time tomorrow.  Deputy Colley will use some of my 40 minutes.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to take the necessary steps to facilitate the sale of shares in such State companies as are thought appropriate and feasible, to employees of such companies, to members of the public, to Irish pension funds and other institutions; to sell such other appropriate State owned assets as are not needed for national strategic purposes, and to apply the proceeds of such sales in the reduction of public debt and the stimulation of economic and employment expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> I am proposing this motion in the hope that we will have a debate which eventually will lead to a policy in this country that will be inspired by principled pragmatism on this question rather than on one influenced by outdated ideology.  The type of debate we have had in the country &mdash; we have not had one in this House on this point previously &mdash; has tended to be influenced by what I describe as outdated ideology rather than principled pragmatism, and it is a matter to which we need to give considerable attention, and we need to do it without the sort of hangups, ideological and otherwise, that have been a feature of the debate on this topic so far.</P>
    <P>A short extract from the programme of the Progressive Democrats published in October 1986 is worth quoting.  It is on page 25.  There are five references in all to this point in this document but this is the main one that I will read, if I may, to put on record the attitude of the PD's to this problem.  The quotation is as follows: Public Ownership of State Assets:</P>
    <P>The proceeds from this programme will be used to reduce the level of state debt.  This will, in turn, reduce the cost of servicing the national debt which is paid annually on the current side.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now unique in Europe in not pursuing a programme of disposing of the state's commercial assets. France is currently undertaking a widespread programme of selling state assets to the public.  The Progressive Democrats believe that such a policy is essential here if we are to get the nation in its broadest sense to work more efficiently for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>The returns from such a programme will begin to come through in year two. It will provide a valuable opportunity for investment at home to pension funds who are starved of these possibilities at present, and will ensure the utilisation of Irish capital for the benefit of our economy while reducing the calls on the state.  We see no point in the state retaining assets of value on which it gets no return, while at the same time it has no pay up to 14% to borrow <Col N="1635" /> funds.  Each year, Irish pension funds have many hundreds of millions of pounds for investment.</P>
    <P>Since the suggestion is sometimes made that this whole idea of the State selling its assets in one form or another is new, or unique, or something dreamed up by the PDs or subsequently by Fine Gael, I would like to make brief reference to an article which appeared in <i>The Times</i>, the London paper, of 27 June 1986 setting out the position throughout the world and underlining the fact that this country is unique virtually in the fact that it has not undertaken any programme of this kind.  I will quote, if I may, just a couple of brief paragraphs from that article:</P>
    <P>Privatisation has become one of the world's growth industries.  Governments everywhere &mdash; in the advanced economies, the Third World, even communist &mdash; are divesting themselves of state holdings and activities.  Japan, having privatised its telecommunications system and launched its state tobacco and salt monopoly towards the private sector, has now embarked on the sale of Japan National Railways, which is to be broken up into six passenger and one freight company.  This sale will dwarf that of Telecom, Britain's biggest to date.</P>
    <P>Later the article makes reference to a long series of countries and I have picked out one or two of them as examples of what is happening even in unlikely places. I quote:</P>
    <P>Private food production in Hungary now accounts for half the total, and people are being invited to bid for the right to run state enterprises for profit.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere it says:</P>
    <P>A country such as Sri Lanka, torn by civil strife, deregulates and privatises its bus system, sells loss-making textile mills, and puts the telecommunications system up for sale.</P>
    <P>Nominally socialist Spain sells Seat, the national car manufacturer, while at the other end of Europe the rather <Col N="1636" /> more right-wing government of Turkey sells the Kevan hydro-electric dam and even the Bosphorus Bridge.</P>
    <P>That article goes on to give a long list of examples of what is happening in the world today.  When we look at the reality of things we realise why it is happening.</P>
    <P>We are putting this country at a great disadvantage by not being part, in some degree at least, of that movement.  Some of the more obvious reasons why, particularly in this country, it is necessary for us to begin to take this road can be stated briefly.  We need, perhaps above anything else, to diminish the impact of the State on our economy.  We need in that way to create a more vibrant economy by giving more scope to those in a position to make it a vibrant economy, and nobody can suggest that the State is in that position. By doing this we would create capital for the State rather than the position we enjoy today where the State is sucking up the great bulk of all the capital available. Inevitably, private involvement, management and so on of many of these companies who are run entirely by the State at the moment will lead to more efficient allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether we are in a position to continue the level of State spending here which as a proportion of our GNP is incredibly high even by comparison with countries which are nominally Communist.  It is interesting to note that even what are usually regarded as the most Communist of all countries, the USSR and China, are moving towards private activity, private commercial activity, and away from more and more State activity.</P>
    <P>The proportion of our GNP which is consumed by the State in one form or another is two thirds and, in comparison with our neighbours in Europe or elsewhere, that is an unbelievable proportion. There is no doubt that in general terms that money is spent less efficiently by the State than if it were spent otherwise than by the State.  That is not unique to Ireland; it is a fact of life throughout the world, recognised throughout the <Col N="1637" /> world, and my suggestion is that it should be recognised here.</P>
    <P>Many problems face the State and State companies today which cannot be overcome by the State alone.  Some 30 or 40 years ago the reverse was true; there were many things that private or privately owned companies could not do and the State had to intervene.  One example is Aer Lingus who require £700 million or £800 million and there is no way in which this State will be able to raise that money and pay it to them in the way it has supported other commercial State entities in the past.  I know of no evidence that Aer Lingus, for example, are averse to raising private capital.  Probably their management, like the management of all well run companies of that kind, would be quite happy to find themselves in the position in which they could raise private capital.</P>
    <P>One aspect of involving assets or investment other than the State's is that losses must be borne by the investors. Unfortunately, a feature of our State companies is that generally they make losses and many of them make enormous losses every year, and every year there is a procession of Ministers into this House, whichever Government happen to be the Government of the day, looking for more and more money basically to fund such losses.  Therefore there is in such a move an additional incentive to efficiency which we are lacking at the moment because it does not matter whether a company is efficiently run, as we have seen.  Ministers, including myself, have come in here asking for more money to make up for the losses and the inefficiencies and I do not recall any senior management being fired in circumstances in which, if they were not employed by the State, certainly they would be fired. It is interesting to note that in Britain particularly &mdash; and indeed in other countries &mdash; two or three years before privatisation of a company actually took place there had been a great rush in each case to make the company commercial and efficient because the management began to realise that they would be fired if the company did not perform.  It is <Col N="1638" /> worth making the point that it is desirable there should be greater shareholding among the public at large here than is the case.  People become more aware of the realities if they are shareholders but are far removed from reality if they are simply shareholders via the taxpayers' money, which is invariably being lost anyway.  We have in this country substantial funds of small savers and others, through pension funds and life assurance companies, that have no opportunity at all, or very limited opportunity, for investment even though the companies are obliged by law to invest 90 per cent of their funds in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to return briefly to some of the historic reasons for many people here holding certain views on this matter and will try to show that they are no longer valid.  One of the first points I want to make in that regard is that there is a belief here that if the Government of the day do not own some particular undertaking they lose all control of it; therefore, that they are opting out if they opt out of full or majority ownership.  That is quite untrue.  Let me take the banking world as an example.  The Government own only two very small banks of a specialised nature &mdash; the ACC and the ICC.  They constitute only around 1 or 2 per cent of our whole banking system. Nonetheless, the Government control our banking system very tightly by regulation without owning any of it other than the small ownership of the two specialised banks.  That can be the case in any other field in which the Government feel that in the national or public interest it is necessary to retain control, even if they give up ownership.</P>
    <P>We must realise there has been here for a very long time &mdash; almost, indeed, from the foundation of our State in the early twenties &mdash; often what can only be described as the misuse of capital.  There was very little opportunity for any proper utilisation of capital for the right purposes. In the twenties we had the Civil War and its aftermath and at the end of the twenties we had the Wall Street crash and the almost total lack of trading activity in the world at that time.  In the <Col N="1639" /> thirties here we had an economic war which obviously severely curtailed our ability, at a time of protectionism, to become involved in any major economic development, so that what did take place tended to be behind tariff barriers for particular purposes in our own country. In the forties we had the Second World War and its aftermath which devastated, if not us happily, unfortunately many of our neighbours and trading parties.</P>
    <P>For a long time, therefore, we had no development because we really had nothing to develop and no great opportunity. We began, as a result of that, to acquire a banking system that was not geared for specific purpose lending but adopted an attitude of lending against assets.  People began also to adopt an attitude of borrowing on the security of assets and of understanding that they could not borrow unless they had specific assets.  The result of all this is that so much capital that should have been productively used &mdash; and in other countries and other economies would be so used &mdash; in this country was diverted into the ownership of assets when it was not necessary for productive purposes that that should have happened.</P>
    <P>This State is, by and large, starved of capital.  You have only to look at the interest rates charged in the interbanks money market today and for some years past to realise that fact.  Unfortunately for us, living in a country which is starved of capital in that way, any successful effort to create a surplus or a profit or to generate capital &mdash; and you can call it any one of those things, essentially it is the same thing whatever you call it &mdash; is sucked into the State system and is absorbed by the State; whether it is borrowed by them, or otherwise consumed by them does not matter.  It is, in fact, absorbed by them.</P>
    <P>On top of that whole economic system that has developed here with this obsession with the ownership of assets we have superimposed a kind of personal attitude towards ownership of things, also.  That is a legacy from the 19th century and our attitude to land and being <Col N="1640" /> dispossessed of land.  That is not something that dies very easily and even after three or four generations and a century almost it has not died.  It influences us in a way that does not apply to any other European country because no other European country is as devoted to the possession of fixed assets as we are.  What is important for us now is not ownership but rather utilisation of assets.  Who owns them does not really matter.  What does matter for this country is how they are utilised and, in particular, that they are utilised for the benefit of this country.  As long as you have them to use them, you do not have to own those assets.  That fact is recognised by many of the most successful firms in this country today.  I could name one of the largest and most successful public companies who have, as a matter of deliberate choice by themselves, no investments in bricks and mortar.  They chose not to, for reasons into which I shall go later.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I gave a reception in Dublin for visiting financial people.  The president of the particular association was a German and he made a speech about Ireland.  He said that he found it fascinating because in certain important respects he found Ireland to be the opposite of Germany.  I have seen this next item quoted elsewhere, so it must have made an impact on others also. He said that in Ireland everybody buys his house and rents his television set, whereas in Germany everybody rents his house and buys his television set.  He, as a German, said that the Germans are right and they are, from their point of view, but we absolutely assume we are right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point he was making was that the utilisation of capital in more profitable ways is what is needed by us.  That utilisation of capital, for example, in more profitable ways is the approach of people like the Germans, the Japanese, indeed the Americans and <Col N="1641" /> many other successful countries.  Capital has been used here to acquire and maintain fixed assets but it has been done by leaving a shortage in manufacturing companies for the purchase of raw materials, a shortage for the payment of labour and a shortage, generally, for the production of goods.  Research and development in this country and, generally speaking, marketing and sales are starved of investment.</P>
      <P>There are similarities between our existing national situation and a manufacturing company which is in that position. A manufacturer who is utilising all his gross profits to service existing capital debt limits his opportunity for expanding production which would be the very means he would need to escape from the stranglehold he is in.  Such a company would do their utmost to reduce its debt, and the cost of its debt, by disposing of all or part of its assets and leasing or renting back those assets if they were getting no return on them for more productive use.  This country can be allied to that sort of position because in order to service our existing debt we have to utilise all our income tax revenue.  Apart from having a very serious effect on the Exchequer and, therefore, on the level of taxation that has to be levied this also has an effect that, I might say in parentheses has been neglected in the recent budget, which will be under discussion tomorrow.  It neglects the interest rates situation.  The situation we face today raises a much higher level of expectation in the lender to us than it would in the lender to a company of the kind I have indicated.  That is the reason the general plateau of interest rates has been raised and maintained at the present level. Unless we are prepared to recognise those realities, the difficulties we have will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates very closely to the purpose of this motion which is to get the State to divest itself of things it does not need to have.  As in the case of a manufacturer it can, by divesting itself of ownership, make available to it capital that it does not now have to improve the means of production.  If a manufacturer disposes of <Col N="1642" /> fixed assets which are crippling him in trying to service them, it gives him the opportunity to finance his work in progress, to finance his expanded labour costs and his investment in marketing, and that is precisely what the State should do.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have an ideological hangup about ownership and the retention of ownership that is not the case in other countries.  Whatever is available by way of capital should be ploughed in to what is to be produced rather than where it is produced, which is what we seem to find more important.  There are many areas where State funds are invested in fixed assets to no useful purpose.  Apart from companies there are many assets, buildings and land, all over the country, on which there is no return and which are, in fact, a drag on us in one form or another, but which are left there and are not realised.  An example, which I hope will soon be removed, would be part of the docks in Dublin which, if sufficient encouragement is given and a framework is set up by the State can be developed by private investment.  I hope this will be developed in the same way as many of the derelict docks in London, which were lying there for the past couple of decades, have now been developed at no cost whatever to the British State.  There are many other similar things, which if the State could divest themselves of them, tremendous progress could be made.</P>
    <P>At present, in the property market, the current yield that is looked for from a State tenant is about 6 per cent to 7 per cent or from any other good tenant as the State would be regarded.  While that is the yield sought for modern space, the Government is borrowing money in order to provide things of that kind at a cost today of 11 per cent and only a few months ago at a cost of 14 per cent which was then the yield on long term gilts.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>If the State could remove itself from the position it is in and has been in for some time, of sucking up all the available money and paying so heavily for it, of building and creating and investing in things that it does not need to invest in, <Col N="1643" /> but which other people are prepared to invest in at a lower rate of interest, then it should let them do it.  I do not want to refer to individual companies but I cannot help thinking about Irish Life which is actually heavily constrained by the fact of its State ownership.  The management and staff are anxious that it should no longer be owned by the State and where the State has a return of £300,000 per annum, where the chief executive's valuation of it is somewhere between £100 million and £200 million; let us say £150 million, what businessman in his senses would retain assets of £150 million in order to draw a dividend on them of £300,000, which is less than one-third of a million?  Nobody would do it.  Would it not be very much better for us to realise that money and thereby reduce our borrowing which is costing between 11 per cent and 14 per cent, give us an income of £300,000 and save ourselves, perhaps, £20 million?</P>
    <P>I want to give Deputy Colley an opportunity to speak on this matter.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to develop a number of these points as much as I would wish if I had the full time.  I want to draw attention to the fact that a survey was carried out in Washington of the US Federal Government's requirements in terms of buildings, which would be very substantial, in the District of Columbia in 1979.  It was found that more than half the buildings or space occupied by the Federal Government was rented because having studied the matter they could not see any point in doing otherwise.  It was much less costly for them and they had no hang-up about ownership.  If the current cost of renting anything is at a lower yield than the cost of money, then neither they nor us nor anybody else who manages our affairs sensibly should do otherwise.</P>
    <P>In a country like this where there are very scarce resources of capital those scarce resources should be directed towards stimulating growth promotion or activity and not locked into bricks and mortar; either in the literal or metaphorical sense.  I think it is worth reminding ourselves that the new investments in <Col N="1644" /> Irish equities today are well over 80 per cent by Irish institutions using Irish people's money acquired in small amounts weekly or monthly, by deductions for pension funds or life assurance funds and so on.  Those institutions which are representatives of hundreds of thousands of people in this country are denied the opportunity that should be given to them and which they would welcome to invest in Irish equities.  If they were in another country they would certainly have that opportunity.  If we want to bring in foreign capital for these purposes, all we need do is put in a currency guarantee clause and we will get unlimited foreign capital if we want it.  People will say that is taking an exchange risk.  The truth of the matter is we have borrowed and owe £24 billion, half of that to foreign lenders, and by borrowing in their currencies we have given them, in effect, a currency guarantee clause.  Therefore, we would not be in any different position.  We are also entitled to ask about the position of employees in these companies; in other countries, where it has been enormously beneficial, they have been given the opportunity to invest in their own companies.</P>
    <P>I happened by accident last night to look at a television programme at approximately 11.45 p.m. at the end of the BBC 2 transmission, called TeléJournal on which they transmit the main French news of that night, or German, or whatever it happens to be, a foreign one, and last night it was France, it was TF1.

      <P>A phrase often used in relation to this matter by those opposed to these kinds of ideas which are worldwide today is one used by the late Earl of Stockton, formerly Harold MacMillan, arising, I would have thought, partly out of his antipathy to Mrs. Thatcher is that she is selling off the family silver.  If some of the companies about which we have been talking are to be described as the Irish family silver I would describe them as fairly tarnished EPNS.  We are in a much different position in this country.  If we want to maintain our strange, unique ways, our lack of practicality and pragmatism as to what is happening around us, if we want to maintain a lack of a commercial sense at all times, we can retain this tarnished EPNS, the family silver, but we are in danger of doing it at the expense of getting rid of any food off the table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the possibilities open to the Government concerning the provision of services by the private sector previously undertaken by the public sector.  I should like to examine in a little detail the whole concept of privatisation or wider ownership of public assets.  It would be true to say that the private ownership or funding of State assets can take and have taken many forms.  We are all familiar with a number of these already and we accept them as part of the ordinary conduct of Government.  We live in a mixed economy, some would say weighted too heavily towards the State. <Col N="1646" /> But we have not heard up to now any claims that the State is falling down in its duty by, for example, sub-contracting the provision of goods and services such as office accommodation, cleaning services, the general medical service and so on. In these examples the public sector still determines what services will be provided or supplied.  However, efficiency in production may improve because of sub-contracting with competition from alternative suppliers.  Also some degree of choice is given to the consumer in contracting out arrangements.</P>
      <P>The franchising concept where public services are provided by the private sector and financed through charges to the public, for example the East Link Bridge, is another example of an option which has been taken up by the State in order to provide services which are needed but which the State cannot afford to provide itself.</P>
      <P>Another area where we can talk about privatisation which has already occurred, to a lesser or greater degree, is that of the liberalisation of regulated markets.  I have in mind here many services which up to now have been considered to be the domain of the State, for example, air transport, passenger transport, road freight and broadcasting.  Another area already brought into the privatising net is that of tenant purchase of local authority houses, giving people real ownership of an asset, and relieving the State of the enormous burden of maintaining these houses.  There are also some activities such as car insurance in Ireland, and welfare payments in the United States, which the State requires to be carried out but it mandates the private sector to provide these services.  This is a situation in which the State requires something to be done but allows the private sector to do it and also requires the private sector to finance it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile examining the reasons for the setting up of the commercial semi-State companies in the past.  These range from the inability or unwillingness of the private sector in our earlier days, as an independent State, to develop new industry, <Col N="1647" /> to develop vital products or services, for example, Bord Na Móna and the B &amp; I.  There certainly was a place for a State-owned Bord Na Móna, ESB, Sugar Company and so on in earlier years, given our early state of commercial development. We had no tradition of industry or enterprise nor access to capital as individuals. Neither had we experience of marketing internationally nor of product research and development.</P>
    <P>The case could be made for saying that the very existence of these large Staterun monopolies, or near monopolies, was a major disincentive to private enterprise becoming involved.  We are now being fed with the notion that somehow these State companies had the capacity, and were intended to fill the employment needs of this country.  Neither was true. The whole thrust of the establishment of these State bodies was that they were to provide services and products where there were no private companies doing so.  If private companies had become involved in the provision of the same services they would have had to compete against the State.  This was not what was intended as being in the nature of these companies.  Now, many Irish companies would, if they could, compete on an equal basis and get involved.  However, our tax structure, for one, discourages enterprise; some markets are not free and are heavily weighted in favour of State enterprises in any case.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge the success of many State companies in the past 30 years, and the vision and commitment which those who were entrusted with the task of running these companies showed. They gave a sense of pride and achievement to a country which otherwise showed few signs of being commercially alive.  However, as time has gone on, the disadvantages of the inordinate growth of the State sector have become more obvious.  In particular there are restrictions which State ownership places on State companies, a few of which I will name.  Government clearance is needed on key decisions, often necessitating <Col N="1648" /> delay.  As I have said, they cannot compete with the private sector.  Their pay and conditions, particularly in senior jobs, are severely restricted.  They have commitments to specific markets and are subject to price control.  They cannot close down elements of the company or make redundancies on a commercial basis alone, and they have limits on access to capital markets and foreign investment.</P>
    <P>In an economy such as we have &mdash; have had for many years now, and will have in the foreseeable future &mdash; it is not possible for the State to fund the enormous amount of capital needed to maintain the existing State enterprises and their necessary and recurring capital costs, let alone find funds to initiate new enterprises. In such an environment State companies will flounder for lack of capital and also because of the difficulties of making provision for future development. It is quite feasible for a State company to operate well in the market place for some time but, when it comes to the point of needing to re-equip, modernise or develop new markets and products, it may be limited in its access to capital markets, experience delay in obtaining Government approval on key decisions, and find itself the victim of a set of political priorities on spending which have absolutely nothing to do with commercial realities or the needs of that particular enterprise.  There appears to be some idea around among those who would wish to see the expansion of State enterprises encouraged that most if not all of the existing State companies' problems arose from Government inaction where equity and loan capital was concerned.  That is getting to the nub of the discussion.  What I am suggesting is to allow the proper financial environment to be provided for State companies so that they can operate on an efficient a basis as possible.</P>
    <P>State companies are victims of the same situation that many private companies experience.  It is because of the inordinately large size of our public sector that the Government have had to resort to such large-scale borrowing, and that <Col N="1649" /> in turn has put pressure on capital markets and so on interest rates.  So private enterprise is not just short of equity capital; when it can get it, interest rates are so high that the death knell sounds for many companies.  The public at large, and particularly employees of these State companies as well as institutional investors, will want to subscribe for shares in State-owned companies, as they would if they were offered an imaginative scheme for investing in a managed equity fund, perhaps State guaranteed, which would offer equity capital to new private enterprise. The State has kept a monopoly on so much of the capital available through high interest rates that new enterprises find it almost impossible to get started. We are told glibly that public sector industries are owned by the State acting for all the people.  What is the significance of that statement?  Are we supposed to feel more secure in the knowledge that the State, faceless and nameless, has control over these enterprises?  That very control and the nature and essence of State control is the cause of many of the problems associated with State ownership. The control the State exercises over State-owned commercial enterprises is not compatible with the commercial freedom needed to exist in the open market.  In effect, the same small group of people will run the company whether it is in State ownership or public ownership, that is, with shares publicly subscribed for.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reaffirms its support for an efficient and profitable semi-State sector as a major instrument for economic development and the provision of employment, and endorses the policy of the Government in maintaining and developing a viable semi-State sector which will provide an efficient, cost-effective service to the general public and actively pursue opportunities for growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The terms of the amendment which I have just moved are in line with the commitment which was given in the Fianna Fáil Programme for Government, and with the sentiments expressed by all speakers from this party when the question of the semi-State sector was debated in the House in December last.  At that time the Government in office also expressed their support for the concept of &ldquo;an efficient and effective semi-State sector as a major instrument of economic development and the provision of employment&rdquo;.  The record of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government over the years has, firmly established our bona fides in this regard.  I would claim that Fianna Fáil have done more than any other party to build up the State sector.  The record of this party is there for all to see.  In certain cases it may be necessary to adjust to changing circumstances.  Our policies today must also be our own, not those of earlier times, or those of other countries but related to our own needs, our own time and our own circumstances.</P>
    <P>The question of the semi-State sector cannot be considered as if it were an academic concept which existed independently of the national economy and economic developments generally.  No less than other enterprises, these bodies have had to contend with the forces which over the past decade and a half have transformed the economic environment. Some have coped better than others. Some have experienced particular difficulties and others have had success.  The State-sponsored bodies commercial sector is wide and varied.  It ranges from the generation of energy supplies to the <Col N="1651" /> operation of transport services, from the provision of communication facilities to manufacturing and processing enterprises. Generalisation in this context is difficult and can be downright misleading. The issues arising are varied, the nature and detail of the problems to be addressed differ considerably.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of weeks since the Government took office.  Since then much of my time and energies and those of the Government have been devoted to the preparation and introduction of the budget.  Nevertheless, as the Minister charged with general oversight of policy relating to the semi-State sector, and particularly its financial dimension, I am acutely conscious that we must continuously assess the role of the State companies in presentday circumstances, to ensure that their resources and talents remain fully employed towards the realisation of the goals shared by all in this House &mdash; the promotion of development and the generation of employment. However, if they are to do this it must be from a position of strength.  Weaknesses must be identified and dealt with, greater efficiencies must be introduced and viability firmly established.</P>
    <P>While this Government believe that the commercial State bodies can be a major force for economic development, we are equally aware that unless these bodies are run efficiently and contain their costs they can become a burden on the rest of the economy.  There is an ongoing demand for State cash injections into the commercial State bodies.  Last year £98 million was provided in the form known as non-programme outlays, the bulk of which went to these bodies.  This year I have provided £75 million in the budget for this purpose.  This is less than the £90 million which the previous Government proposed but, given the state of the public finances, no more could be afforded.</P>
    <P>This cut on the previous Government's proposed allocation demonstrates an essential point, namely, that while this Government believe that the State bodies can make a major contribution to <Col N="1652" /> development, we are not prepared to finance losses caused by mismanagement or a failure to contain costs.  Our approach is that the commercial State bodies can and should be run with as much regard to efficiency, and to commercial realities, as their counterparts in the private sector.  No State body should be under any illusion that it can expect the Exchequer to finance without limit its mistakes or to make up for any failure on its part to generate the funds it needs for investment.  A great deal of responsibility, therefore, rests on the bodies themselves.</P>
    <P>This Government's approach to the semi-State sector, as will be clear from my remarks, will be positive and developmental. We are, and always have been, a party which seeks the best solution to the economic problems we face.  To do any less in the current economic climate would be irresponsible foolishness and would ill serve the people we were all elected to represent.  So, while our commitment to the notion of State enterprise is firm, this policy will not be pursued irrespective of cost.  The resources are not there to do so.  On the other hand, and here is the nub of the question, we are not prepared to adopt a general policy of selling commercial State bodies for its own sake, as the motion at present before us seems to suggest is the policy of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it can be dangerous and misleading to generalise about the semi-State sector.  This Government will carefully evaluate the position of all State bodies operating in the commercial sector &mdash; their performances to date, their present position and their future prospects.  We will look hard at the role they play in the economy, their relevance and impact in the changing circumstances of the present day.  When we have done that, we will take the decisions required. We will do so in the interest of the State, bearing in mind the contribution these bodies make to economic activity and to the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>The motion before us asks that we take such steps to sell shares in such State <Col N="1653" /> companies as are &ldquo;appropriate and feasible&rdquo; and apply the proceeds to the reduction of debt and the stimulation of economic and employment expansion. For the reasons I have indicated, the Government reject the approach inherent in the motion.  We are not prepared to take indiscriminate steps to dispose of bodies many of which have been established and developed at substantial expense to the taxpayer and which perform a valuable role in the economy.</P>
    <P>The proposers of the motion may believe that the removal of these bodies from the State sector will suddenly infuse them with a spirit of enterprise and success which they previously had lacked, as if a magic wand of some sort would be waved.  I do not agree.  We have had successes and failures in the public and private sectors.  The State has spent large sums bailing out private firms in difficulty, as well as its huge investment in the public sector.  Change of ownership is not a panacea for solving problems, and I would not subscribe to any notion that it is.</P>
    <P>I do not rule out the possibility that in the case of individual bodies, when their situation has been analysed and evaluated, changes including some arrangements with private companies might be desirable.  Indeed, in our <i>Programme for Government</i> we pledged to encourage, where appropriate, the potential that exists for new joint ventures between public and private sectors.  Each case would have to be considered on its merits and the action taken would depend on the specifics of the situation.  Any action which may be taken however, and I can assure Deputies of this, will be on the basis of mature and balanced consideration. At present we have no proposals in mind.</P>
    <P>As far as non-strategic, superfluous State assets are concerned the situation is somewhat different.  An example of this category of asset might be land surplus to requirements and for which no useful role is foreseen.  Certainly in current economic circumstances we would have no <Col N="1654" /> wish to hold on to any non-productive assets, if such exist and are in the ownership of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that.  The Deputy has pre-empted what I was about to say.  I believe that some such assets have already been identified and I am pursuing this question. However, in all honesty, I must say I would not expect that any attempt to sell those assets would realise any great amount &mdash; certainly not in the context in which we are speaking.</P>
      <P>Ideology is no guide to the way forward. The policies to be pursued must have as their goal the growth which we all recognise as being necessary, if the full potential of this country is to be realised. This applies no less to the semi-State sector, which for so long has played a vital role in our national development. This Government will consider closely and effectively the position of the semi-State sector and the role which it has to play in our future development.  We will examine carefully the circumstances of all bodies and take whatever decisions are necessary to maximise their contribution to the economy and to the country.</P>
      <P>My concluding note is that everyone in those bodies, from workers to directors, must play their part and recognise that the way to generate growth and overcome problems is largely for them to find. If they find it this Government will back them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment to amendment No. a1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> To add to the amendment after &ldquo;growth&rdquo; the words</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and urges the Government to include, as part of this policy, the selective sales of shares in State Companies to members of the public, Irish pension funds and other institutions on the following basis</P>
    <P>(a)  where an element of significant public interest is involved, the State would continue to hold a majority of the equity or would adopt such other measures as are necessary to protect the public interest in question</P>
    <P>(b)  the continued growth of, and employment in, the enterprise and sectors concerned would be a major concern in structuring any sale of shares and in the application of the proceeds</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to (a) and (b) above, the proceeds would be applied to the reduction of public debt, the reduction in demands for equity that would otherwise be made on the State, and the stimulation of economic and employment expansion generally</P>
    <P>(d)  a guiding factor would be the need to ensure that public sector enterprise is a dynamic and flexible factor in the economy generally, moving forward in sectors where development needs are greatest, rather than confining itself in sectors in which the State has had a traditional commercial involvement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to amend the Minister's amendment.  Our approach accepts the full wording of the Minister's amendment, but seeks to go on from that.  It seeks to draw some of the logical conclusions inherent in the Minister's words and urges that the policy of selective sales of shares in State companies, subject to four guidelines which are set out in my amendment, should be undertaken.  The Minister stated that he was not prepared to take indiscriminate steps to dispose of bodies which may have <Col N="1656" /> been established and developed at substantial expense to the taxpayer.  I agree with him and nobody here, certainly not the Fine Gael Party, is suggesting any such indiscriminate sale.  What we are suggesting is a discriminate sale of State assets when this appears to be pragmatically sensible from a commercial and economic point of view.</P>
    <P>We would accept that selling assets in itself is not a panacea for any of the problems which exist, but I say this to the proponents of State enterprise: if it is an ideological position that once an asset or a company comes into State ownership, whether by accident or design, that it shall never at any time cease to be in State ownership, that limitation in itself sets a limit on the scope of activity of State enterprise, because the proponents are saying that the State must be very careful not to get into anything because, if it wants to get out, the ideologists will throw the book at it for attempting to disengage itself.</P>
    <P>The opponents of selective sales of State assets are the greatest enemies of public enterprise in Ireland at this time because they are seeking to put a limit on the role of State enterprise by saying that once the State gets in, it cannot get out, and by inference, the State will not get involved in the first instance because it knows it will be caught.  Far from being friends of public enterprise, I contend that the parties of the left who are opposing on ideological grounds even the selective sale of State assets are setting a limit to the activity which could be undertaken by the State.</P>
    <P>One of the guiding principles in the Fine Gael approach to public enterprise is set out in paragraph (d) of our amendment which says that a guiding factor would be the need to ensure that public sector enterprise is a dynamic and flexible factor in the economy generally, moving forward in sectors where development needs are greatest, rather than confining itself in sectors in which the State has had a traditional commercial involvement. That view informs Fine Gael's opinion that the State must be prepared to sell <Col N="1657" /> some State assets so that it can reinvest money in State ownership of other assets.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have strongly supported the concept and the actuality of the National Development Corporation.  One of the mandates of the National Development Corporation is that they can invest in something in order to prime the pump, to get the investment going, but once going there is nothing to stop the State, i.e. the taxpayer, realising the capital gain from its good investment and putting the money into something else.  You get the maximum number of jobs rather than the minimum number for each £1 the State invests.  You do not imprison the State investment for all time in a particular use but you ensure that it can be moved from one area to another.  That attitude is profoundly favourable to public enterprise and is a much more modern view of what public enterprise should be than the view hostile to any sale of State assets that is expressed by certain other parties.</P>
    <P>The ideological parentage of these views is considerably mixed.  Franco's Spain was one of the great nationalisers of industry.  The Instituto Nacionalde Industria under Franco brought about the position where the State owned 747 industrial companies.  The Socialist Government of Spain at present under Felipe Gonzalez are in the process of selling these nationalised industries set up by the Falange.  For instance, the Socialist Government in Spain sold previously State-owned textile companies, previously State-owned travel and tourist companies and went so far as to sell Seat, the Spanish motor manufacturer, to Volkswagen.  That is the attitude of a Socialist Government in Spain.  They are prepared to sell off the investments of the ultra right wing nationalising Franco regime.</P>
    <P>Likewise, Sweden who had a Socialist Government for practically its entire history in this century, sold off Luxor, an electronics company, Sodra Skeagarna, a forestry company and a number of banks. There is no reason from a party point of view why one should say privatising is a matter for the right and nationalising is a <Col N="1658" /> matter for the left.  In fact, it was the right in Spain that nationalised the companies and the left are privatising them.  I do not see any reason why we should not be as flexible or as imaginative as the people in Spain.  Nor should it be seen that privatisation &mdash; I do not like that word; it is simply the transfer of shares from one ownership to another in order that money can be invested in another way &mdash; or the sale of State shares in enterprise is in any way hostile to the interests of trade unions in those companies.</P>
    <P>I will quote from an article in <i>New Society</i>, a magazine whose political leanings are not to the right, of 21 June 1984. It took the opinions of various trade union officials in companies which had been privatised by Mrs. Thatcher to see whether or not this move had served or disserved the interests of trade unionists. In that magazine Veronica Bayne who represents the CPSA, a white collar union representing people in Amersham International which had been privatised, stated that pay had improved considerably once the company had been privatised.  Likewise, in the cases of British Aerospace, Britoil, and Cable and Wireless the unions report improvements in the way companies consulted unions and in their general attitude to unions once the ownership had changed from being a wholly State-owned company to one in which there was considerable private ownership, including ownership of the company by those working in it.  That may be one of the reasons why trade union-employer relations had improved.  Trade union members, as a result of the open policy of selling shares in the enterprises, had become part owners of the company.  The traditional divide between the interests of the worker on the one hand and the interests of management on the other had been abolished by both becoming performers of the same role on both sides of the table.</P>
    <P>Likewise, unions have increased membership in privatised companies.  The trade union, Apex, reported that their membership in Britoil was increasing considerably, much more than &mdash; to use <Col N="1659" /> their words &mdash; in the bad old days of the British National Oil Corporation.  There is no reason why one should be opposed to this on the grounds that it might be either ideologically unacceptable &mdash; we have seen the example of Socialist Spain &mdash; or adverse to the interests of trade unionists &mdash; we have seen the examples of what happened in the United Kingdom where companies have been privatised. There is no reason why one should be fearful of this from the point of view of the public interest.  There is the concept of the golden share where the company continues to be in the ownership of the State but for a single share worth £1 the holder of that share is specifically enabled to veto any change in any specified article of association of the company.  If one wanted, in selling a particular company, to say that the new private owner shall not do A, B, C, D or E, all one needs is to take a golden share in the company for the price of £1 when one is selling it and to say that without the consent of that £1 shareholder, the State, no change can be made in any one of those specified articles.</P>
    <P>I have to agree that a change in the ownership of a company does not work miracles.  If you privatise a monopoly and it remains a monopoly in private ownership just as it was in public ownership, it can be just as abusive of the interests of the customer or the consumer as was the previously publicly-owned monopoly. It is extremely important, if one is considering sales of companies which have monopolistic conditions, that proper legislation exists to ensure there is adequate competition.  I believe privately-owned monopolies are considerably worse than State-owned monopolies.  Privatisation is no substitute for an active competition policy.  One must have an active competition policy no matter who owns the company.  That is why I believe any attempt to examine the role of State companies must also be accompanied by the active promotion of the legislation prepared by the previous Government to update fair trade legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> At present vast chunks of public services, the supply of electricity, the supply of telephones and the supply of banking services, are totally exempt from examination by either the prices authorities of the State or the restrictive practices authorities of the State.  Small operators selling holidays or a barber selling the services of cutting people's hair can be investigated by the National Prices Commission or by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  However, the ESB, Telecom Éireann or An Post are not required to subject themselves to any competition policy or scrutiny while small corner shop operators in the private sector are subject to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether it is intended to sell shares in these companies, it is essential that they be subject to a competition policy because no matter who owns them they will abuse their position unless there are strictly defined competitive rules applying to them.  Therefore, I urge the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, to bring forward, as a matter or priority, the legislation prepared by the previous Government, which is already published, on fair trade law which would remove the exemption from competition policy scrutiny of all these public enterprises.  This would also apply to the privately owned banks who are currently exempt from scrutiny by the fair trade authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the problems faced by publicly owned companies at present is that they come within the limits of the Devlin pay guidelines.  One of the reasons for companies in Britain doing well in private ownership is that they are no longer required to set an upper limit on the salaries they set for the people whom they employ in senior positions.  Of course, one could allow State companies, while remaining State-owned, to pay any salary they liked to their chief executive but it is more difficult to do that if the company is privately owned.  The Minister for Finance would be a shareholder earning a salary perhaps one-tenth of that paid to the chief executive of a company in which he was the principal and sole <Col N="1661" /> shareholder and that situation is potentially slightly anomalous.  The Minister, Deputy MacSharry, is worth a great deal more than he is being paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  Other reasons, apart strictly from ownership, have inhibited the operation of State companies and one is the restriction on salaries.  Clearly, if one is moving towards a position in which ownership is varied and in which there will be private shareholders, that provides an opportunity to lift some of these limitations, thereby providing an opportunity for companies to expand more fully.  There is also the danger that bureaucracies &mdash; I speak without regard to my friends in the Department of Finance, although I cannot now talk to them &mdash; do not always function as one would wish them to do. They tend to be slow in making decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cable and Wireless in Britain made a major investment in Hong Kong which proved to be extremely profitable.  They made that decision in a space of about three or four days after they had become a privately owned company.  If they had had to consider making that investment decision three or four years previously, when they were still State-owned, they would have had to consult the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain who, in turn, would have had to consult the Treasury.  There would have been letters and memos going here and there and eventually the matter would have ended up in Cabinet where everybody would have contributed his or her anecdote and knowledge of Hong Kong and its economy.  This process would have taken from six months to two years by which time someone else would have made the investment in Hong Kong and Cable and Wireless would have lost a valuable opportunity of investment.  It is inherently impossible for a public enterprise to make quick decisions of this kind; once the company is owned by the Government there are layers upon layers of people who have to make sure they <Col N="1662" /> will not be criticised for having done something unwise.  A consults B who, in turn, consults C who consults D who eventually consults the Taoiseach &mdash; who probably consults somebody else if he does not consult God &mdash; and a decision is not taken for a very long time.  The difficulty with being publicly owned is accountability and, therefore, valuable opportunities are lost unless there is an extremely influential management which is completely trusted by the Government.</P>
    <P>There have been notable successes in State enterprise in Ireland due to one or two personalities in these companies &mdash; I could name them from the existing public sector &mdash; who have had the confidence of all Ministers who did not make any inquiries because those executives had a good track record and they let them get on with it.  Unfortunately, they are in a minority.  Most public enterprises have had their bad days as well as their good days and, as a result, are scrutinised with great care by public servants and politicians, including Opposition Deputies putting down questions.  The result is that they never make any creative decisions because of this fear of public accountability. One of the ways in which one could get rid of that would be by selling either a majority or a minority share in the company because, once you sold even a minority share to the private sector, the private sector interest would insist on procedures to protect their investment, one of which would be a time limit on any approval of commercial decisions. We could achieve the benign effects for which we are looking in terms of a more creative approach, of speedier decision making and possibly even salary setting for chief executives, by selling a minority shareholding.  You do not have to sell 51 per cent.  A minority shareholding will be sufficient to get all of these creative effects because they will be demanded by the private sector and investor as a precondition to their investment.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few more points.  There is a major case to be made in Ireland at present to change the way in which people hold wealth and savings. We are obsessed with saving in the form <Col N="1663" /> of owning our own houses.  People are prepared to tie down and restrict their income for 30 years ahead so that, at the end of their lives, they will own their houses although they will probably only completely own them for the last five years of their lives because the mortgage will not be paid off until then.  At that stage, their daughter may be living in Limerick, their son in Kerry and another offspring in some other part of the world and not one of them will be in the slightest bit interested in inheriting the house for which their parents have made sacrifices over the years.</P>
    <P>Instead of becoming the exclusive owner of an asset which none of their children is interested in inheriting, we should encourage these people to become the owners of shares in companies originating in the private or public sectors. That would mean a much more productive use of capital and, as Deputy O'Malley rightly said, we are very short of capital.  Our GNP per head is only 60 per cent of that of Britain and yet we assume we should have a living standard of at least 110 per cent of that in Britain. If we want to have a living standard of that kind, we must use the little capital we have more effectively.  Imprisoning it forever in public enterprise because of an ideological hang-up which says we will never sell it, or tying it up forever in houses because each of us most own his own house regardless of whether that is the best use of investment, is not a way of ensuring that we use our limited capital resources to the best effect to create employment.  In order that we might achieve our full potential as a nation, one of the things I would like to see coming out of this debate would be the stripping away of the ideological hang-ups which exist about how one should save and what one should put money into.</P>
    <P>I would like to distinguish between the amendment put down by Deputy Noonan and me and that put down by the Progressive Democrats.  Our amendment contains a specific requirement to take account of the interests of those employed in the enterprises.  That does <Col N="1664" /> not seem to be prominently referred to in the amendment put down by the Progressive Democrats.  Another difference between the two amendments is that we want the public sector to remain a dynamic and flexible force in the Irish economy.  We are not trying to disengage the public sector from the economy; we are simply trying to make its role more flexible and dynamic.  We are concerned also that one would have an adequate means of protecting the public service interest elements of any of these enterprises. This is not referred to in the Progressive Democrats' amendment.  The approach of Fine Gael is different from that of the Progressive Democrats.  I would be so bold as to say that it is more fully thought out but not inconsistent with the attitudes adopted by the other parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a rush of motions on to the Dáil Order Paper since the Government's decision to abolish three of the four schemes of housing grants was announced in the budget.  Various parties were, I would suggest, somewhat hastily falling over themselves in a public relations exercise to cynically exploit the Government's courageous and responsible decision to abolish these grant schemes.  Many of the precipitate statements made could have been avoided if those making them had waited until details of the implementation of the decisions were made available by me as Minister responsible for the operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making this statement I want to indicate briefly the budgetary strategy which underlies the decision to abolish <Col N="1665" /> these grants.  I want to put on the record of the House the appalling extent of the housing grants liabilities I inherited on becoming Minister for the Environment and, finally, I will elaborate for the information of Deputies on the detailed arrangements which will apply to the termination of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Our budgetary strategy sets out to tackle the three evils of high taxation, high interest rates and the lack of confidence that continue to undermine our economy.  Unsustainably high levels of public expenditure and its offspring, national debt, is at the root of these three evils.  Therefore, any radical attempt to tackle our serious economic problems must start with public expenditure.  It must be brought down to a level that can be sustained without choking the economy to death.  If we are to do this we must be prepared to cut out some expenditure programmes while ensuring that the rest are both efficient and effective.</P>
    <P>Housing, as the largest single constituent of the Public Capital Programme area, cannot be exempted from the overall need to cut back on public expenditure.  While in receipt of large scale and expensive public expenditures, the housing sector is at the same time suffering from excessively high taxation, including the trebling of VAT since 1983. Furthermore, it is severely afflicted by very high inflation rates and widespread lack of confidence.  Clearly the existing policies and the wide, if not contradictory, range of Government interventions have failed to arrest the decline in the industry.  To suggest that we continue down this road is hardly credible: a redirection that will contribute to a resolution of the underlying problems is what is needed now.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record the appalling situation in regard to the public expenditure commitments I found in the housing grants area on becoming Minister for the Environment.  On house improvement grants alone I found that grants approved totalled almost £230 million with applications still coming in at a rate <Col N="1666" /> that would add £5 million a month to this staggering figure.  Payments this year will cost at least the £100 million provided in the Estimates and even this may not be enough.  Compare this with expenditure of £7 million on house improvement grants in 1985 and £27.5 million in 1986. The legacy of public debt bequeathed by this scheme results from a crude attempt to buy survival for a shaken Coalition Government who were having grave difficulties facing the resumption of the Dáil after the 1985 summer recess.  This was a hastily conceived open ended scheme under which expenditure could neither be predicted nor controlled.  It provided large handouts of taxpayers' money to individuals regardless of their means for doing often inessential or even cosmetic works.  It was the better off people who were able to make most use of these grants.  Moreover they have not had the impact on employment that was originally predicted for them.</P>

      <P>To compound the dangers, my predecessor engaged in an unnecessary hype of the scheme by means of a saturation and expensive campaign of public advertising.  Had the 1985 scheme continued the extra administrative cost alone this year would have come to £2.5 million.  How any party supposedly espousing financial rectitude could have promoted this great scheme is beyond comprehension.  However, my predecessor continues to defend the scheme. If it was so good why was it necessary to extensively revise it and change the grant ceiling in the abortive 1987 Fine Gael Estimates?  If it was wrong then surely it was wrong in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with the payment of a wholly unprecedented sum of £100 million in 1987 there will still be a very large liability to be met next year and even the year after.  The only way to bring the situation under control and to stop this intolerable escalation of liabilities was to bring the whole scheme to an end at this time.</P>
      <P>Because of the huge build up of approvals, the decision to abolish the grants will have very little impact on the public finances this year and the cost of the scheme will continue to make sizeable demands on the Exchequer well into 1988 and 1989 and even up to 1990.  When these bills have been cleared off we will be in a position to look again at the nature, extent and type of assistance that is necessary, appropriate and affordable in the area of improvements to the existing private housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now clear that the multiplier effect of these grants in terms of building work fell short of expectations generally.  It now appears likely that the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer will only represent something like half of the total output generated by the grants.  Furthermore the facts cast grave doubts on the earlier claims that the scheme would create thousands of jobs in the building industry.  A year after its introduction the number of building workers on the live register of unemployed was only marginally reduced from 45,207 in October 1985 to 43,550 in October 1986.  When one considers that building workers were emigrating throughout that period it is evident that the scheme has not fulfilled its expectations in yielding legitimate employment.  The gratuitous nature of the scheme is underlined by the fact that a total of 66,223 grant approvals have issued for window replacements to the value of £42 million.  Yet previously many householders would have regarded this type of work as part of the normal upkeep of a house.  There is also evidence to suggest that the availability of grants for these works tends to inflate the cost to householders further, diminishing the real benefit of the grants.  The grant aiding of totally unnecessary extensions <Col N="1668" /> to houses is perhaps even more difficult to justify.  The cost of the 19,360 grant approvals for extensions generally amounts to £37.2 million.  It is estimated that over 75 per cent of these would not be justifiable by reference to the relief of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Just one year after the inception of the improvement grant, as if to celebrate its anniversary, my predecessor brought in the £2,250 builder's new house grant last October.  In many respects this measure had even less merit than the improvement grants.  This grant was supposed to compensate builders for the devastating effects of the increase in the VAT rate on building from 3 per cent in 1983 to 10 per cent up to 1985.  Clearly, it is self-defeating and highly inefficient to be raising taxes and then introducing subsidies to compensate for those taxes.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the grant to builders in order that they might reduce new house prices is highly dubious in the absence of a procedure to ensure that the benefit of the grant is actually passed on to the house purchaser.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While the benefits of the builder's grant of £2,250 were largely notional, the costs which were building up for the taxpayer were very real indeed.  A disturbing aspect of this scheme was the fact that the grant was payable in two deferred instalments, 12 months and 18 months after completion, and would have cost £22 million in 1988 and £29 million in 1989.  This grant scheme was ill-conceived, badly structured and hurriedly introduced.  Its primary purpose was to placate a demoralised building industry without any thought as to its effectiveness or the administrative difficulties it was bound to throw up.  In fact, it proved to be an administrative nightmare.  It was confusing for the builder, for the industry as a whole and for the client and it patently failed to create the stimulus for house <Col N="1669" /> building that it was supposedly intended to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did today and I am repeating what they told me.  At any time it would have been the wrong kind of grant to introduce.  Financial support for those wishing to house themselves should be aimed at the individual and this has been the principle for many years.  It was a retrograde step, therefore, to make it a builder's grant.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the decision to delay payment to the builder necessarily meant that frequently he would not be able to allow for the full value of the grant when pricing his house for sale purposes.  It was aimed at encouraging trading up, or so we were told, and no upper limit was placed on house sizes for the purpose of eligibility.  The greatest criticism of the scheme, however, is that it failed through a combination of complexity, confusion and flawed purpose.  It might well be described as the wrong grant for the wrong purpose at the wrong time.  I do not mourn its passing.</P>
      <P>By 1989 the total cost of both new house grants would have been up to £15 million compared to the £14 million paid out last year.  Deferred grants are a dangerous and irresponsible practice because they can be brought in painlessly enough at no cost in the first year while building up intolerable debts years on.</P>
      <P>I will now go on to refer to the £5,000 surrender grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers purchasing houses in the private sector.  I exempt this grant from my earlier comments on the other two grant schemes.  It has been effective in achieving its purpose and it has given good value in terms of public expenditure by increasing the number of dwellings which local authorities have available for letting to applicants on their waiting lists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>By doing so it has assisted <Col N="1670" /> the reduction in the total number on the waiting lists over the past five years. However, against that, the scheme had a serious, adverse impact on a number of very large local authority estates.  Many tenants in employment who had previously purchased their houses under the house tenant purchase scheme and who had established and developed their roots in the area and in the community decided instead to avail of the £5,000 grant and move to another area.</P>
      <P>The segregation of employed from unemployed is harmful to society. Indeed, this undesirable aspect of the £5,000 grant scheme was publicly acknowledged by the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, at a conference in Dublin earlier this year.  However, even without the surrender grant, local authority tenants are still assisted in a substantial way to become house owners.  In the first place, they may buy their existing houses on very favourable terms under the tenant purchase scheme.  This arrangement is in many ways preferable to enticing tenants out of their neighbourhoods in that it avoids the adverse social consequences to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>Considerable assistance remains available to any tenant who wishes to purchase a private house including a special category house purchase loan of up to £27,000, the £2,000 first time purchase grant and, in certain cases, the £1,000 site subsidy.  Because of the misrepresentation of the Government's position on the grants issue in recent days, it is necessary to state explicitly that it was never the Government's intention that persons who had entered into binding contracts prior to the termination of the grants should lose out financially.</P>

      <P>Despite the difficult financial circumstances which made termination of the grant schemes unavoidable I have ensured that the schemes have been terminated in such a way as to prevent any adverse effect on those who have a legally binding and irrevocable commitment to acquiring a new house or improving their existing dwellings.  Applicants for the £2,250 grant for the purchase or building of a new house and the £5,000 grant payable to local authority tenants will qualify when they can establish that by 27 March 1987 they had entered into a legally binding and irrevocable commitment on foot of a reasonable expectation of getting a grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In short any person purchasing or building a house who can meet these requirements and the other conditions of the scheme will qualify for the relevant grant.  In this way persons who had committed themselves and who otherwise have suffered financial loss by the abolition of these schemes have been fully protected.  My Department will be in touch with existing unapproved house grant applicants over the next few weeks to obtain particulars of their contracts, if any, and a certificate of approval will follow when it is established that there is an entitlement to the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to the £5,000 surrender grant, the local authorities are being advised of these requirements and they are free to approve applications for surrender grants where they are satisfied that the necessary commitment exists. In the case of house improvement grant applicants, I have also ensured that no one is unjustly deprived of the grant. <Col N="1672" /> Deputies will be well aware of the fundamental and longstanding prior inspection condition of that scheme which is an absolute prerequisite to eligibility.  Any applicant who had the necessary inspection on or before 27 March and whose proposal was found to be in order will qualify for the grant.  Accordingly, no applicant who has started work in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the scheme will be affected by the ending of the grants.  Obviously there would be no basis for extending eligibility under the scheme to others such as those who had lately submitted applications but who had not received a visit from the inspector. No work would have commenced in those cases, or if it had no grant would have been allowable in any event.  Therefore, such applicants would in fairness have no more claim to a grant than persons who had not applied at all.</P>
    <P>What I have just said clearly shows that in putting down his ill-considered motion, Deputy Boland was more anxious to be seen decrying the Government's decision than he was concerned about any implication it might have for the public.  On the one hand, the Deputy is looking for grant approval for all existing applicants whether or not they have entered into any real commitments, but he does not apparently consider that anything should be done for those who have contracted to buy houses in expectation of a grant but who have not yet applied.  It was Deputy Boland's Government, and in the case of the £2,250 builder's grant Deputy Boland personally, who were responsible for bringing in schemes which encouraged people to enter commitments without reference to their eligibility for grants.  Seemingly Deputy Boland has now no concern for those who were encouraged in that way to make commitments and who might have been disqualified but for the fact that this Government were fully conscious of their situation.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Deputy Harney and The Workers' Party Deputies have referred, apparently again with little thought, to the creation of extreme hardship by the termination of the grants.  I am catering <Col N="1673" /> for everybody who had made a commitment and who could legitimately have expected a grant.  I am now waiting for those Deputies to explain how there can be undue hardship for thousands of families in the light of the arrangements I have detailed here this evening.</P>

      <P>There have been suggestions that this year's budget figures will be thrown out to the extent of £30 million by the way in which the decision to abolish the three housing grant schemes is to be implemented.  I want to completely refute this type of misinformed comment. It is not possible at this stage to establish how many cases, as yet unapproved, will be able to satisfy the requirements laid down and eventually mature for payment. It is clear, however, that having regard to the existing pattern of time lag between grant approval and payment relatively few of those yet to be approved will mature for payment this year.  These will be of little significance in the context of provisions totalling £122.5 million for all three grants this year.  I fully accept that no more money can be made available for these grants this year unless there is a shortfall of expenditure in other areas of my Department's budget which would enable me to transfer moneys to grants in the event of that being necessary but it is not envisaged that it will be necessary. Any shortfall will have to be accommodated some other year from some other Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I finish, let me reiterate my dismay at the way in which the house improvement and builder's new house grants were introduced and operated adding to an appalling level of national debt and pre-empting scarce resources for future years.  They were brought in for party political gain at the expense of the nation.  If the managing director of a company conducted his business in this way by running up debts which he knew the company could not afford, he would be held personally responsible under the reckless trading provisions of the new <Col N="1674" /> Companies Bill.  By adding wantonly to public expenditure and debt these grants were contributing to the problems they were supposed to solve.  In the context of the overall strategy underlying the budget there was no alternative to a root and branch job.  A regime of lower interest rates and lower taxation, which we are endeavouring to make a reality, will be of immeasurably greater benefit to house builders and householders alike.  It is a pity the previous Government did not see it that way.  They are now held responsible for the confusion that exists in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment has defended a bad case from a bad script in a mildly entertaining manner but that does not gainsay the fact that we are looking at a disastrous situation, ill-conceived, hastily put together and confusingly presented by the Minister and his colleague to the detriment of applicants, the building industry and to the absolute confusion of the general public and the body politic over the past week.  Various documents were published in recent months and one was entitled, Construction and the Environment, published by Fianna Fáil, The Republican Party.  That document states that the entire system of existing grants to the construction industry will be reviewed to ensure maximum effectiveness. I am not sure I need to say anymore than to quote from that document. We should put that document beside the Minister's interesting perambulations across the various provisions of the Vote of the Department of the Environment.  We are told that having reviewed the grants to the construction industry the Government decided in one fell swoop to abolish three of the four grant schemes to ensure that the entire system would work to the maximum effectiveness.  I wonder how that can be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business on the Thursday <Col N="1675" /> before the budget I asked whether the Government intended to introduce legislation to abolish the new house grants or the house improvement grants. There was silence from the Government benches which, I suppose, spoke a multitude, but never did any Member dream even at that stage, that there could have been the intention to abolish those grants and abolish them retrospectively.  It has always been the tradition as any of us with any experience of the House or the operation of local government know that while it is the prerogative of Government to change or amend schemes from time to time it has always been regarded as basic equity and fair play that for a scheme to be changed an announcement is made in relation to it and that that announcement applies to applications arising after that date.  In my 20 years experience in local government I do not remember a scheme being abolished retrospectively or applicants who applied before the supposed termination date being unilaterally deprived of entitlement to the scheme for which they validly applied and which was in operation to their knowledge, and the knowledge of everybody including the Minister and the officials administering it, at the time they applied.  Indeed, the opposite is the case. If the Minister turns to his left I am sure he could be entertained for quite a long time by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment on that score.  I am sure some Members remember when on a very limited reconstruction grants scheme a Fianna Fáil Government deciding to abolish that scheme. However, they went about it the opposite way, though just as ineffectually, because they announced one day that the scheme was being abolished with effect from a fortnight hence.  They managed to accumulate the equivalent of three years applications in that fortnight and the dregs of that are still with us.</P>

      <P>The dregs of that 1981 scheme are still hanging around O'Connell Bridge House and still have an impact on the Vote of the Department of the Environment because of the ineptitude of the Government in abolishing it.  I venture to suggest that the ineptitude of that abolition has been more than surpassed by the clumsy way that these three schemes were abolished, the consequential mopping-up job and, I suggest, the consequential perambulations through the courts before the matter is finally resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast and despite the Minister's bluster, I should like to remind the House that in the budget published by our Government in January, we provided for the continuation of each of these three schemes during 1987.  The Minister is, of course, quite right in saying that we modified and refined some of the terms of the very extensive and successful house improvement grants scheme which was introduced in November 1985.  We did so in order to lessen its impact on the Exchequer, while at the same time continuing the high level of support for the construction industry and for employment within the construction and allied industries which the scheme had so obviously brought about.  Despite whatever else the Minister and his colleagues might venture to say about that Government, I do not think it could be argued that there were any 15 people in the country who were better aware of the exigencies of the situation and of the demands on the Exchequer and the public finances than <Col N="1677" /> were the Government in January.  In preparing a budget which would have resulted in a current budget deficit of 7.4 per cent and an estimated borrowing requirement of 11.8 per cent, we nonetheless recognised the importance of the stimulative effect which each of these grants had for the construction industry and for the assistance and encouragement of that well-recognised desire of the Irish people to own their own houses. In so doing, we ensured that these three schemes would continue and provided the financing accordingly, while still producing a budget which arrived at an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 11.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>That these people could arrive in Government and within three weeks manage not to find that money and to abolish the schemes in such a clumsy way speaks for itself.  Since the afternoon of last Tuesday when these three announcements were visited upon this House and the nation, we have witnessed what can only be described as high farce, a situation where a new Government who came into office having claimed that they could do it a better way managed in the space of three weeks to write high farce in relation to the Department of the Environment, not just in connection with these grants but in virtually all their works and pomps.  It speaks ill of the manner in which the representative of that Department presented his case to that Cabinet that we should be holding this, the first of a series of discussions that will be inevitable in relation to the Environment Vote because of the way in which it has been decimated in the space of less than one month.  We have been witnessing in the past week the writing of high farce in relation to all matters conducted at the Department of the Environment, a farce conceived in Merrion Street, gestated in the Cabinet, produced from the Custom House, rewritten on Friday to reviews which could only be described as a washout, which will have to be visited with a totally new production and presentation before it will pass the censor.</P>
    <P>When reading the statement issued by the Government on Friday evening, following <Col N="1678" /> their U-turn, one had to ask in relation to the original decision, where was the sense of equity, the sense of fair play or the understanding of how any one of these three schemes worked on the part of the Government who were going to do it in a better way.  The Government statement suggests that one of the reasons for changing the scheme was that &ldquo;the State could have incurred a legal obligation&rdquo;.  Where was the legal advice available to the Cabinet who took this precipitate decision?  Where was the Attorney?  Where was the legal advice available to the Minister for the Environment? Where was the common sense? Where was the experience we were advised was manifest inside this Cabinet? Where was any sense of reality?</P>
    <P>The statement issued on Friday night contains a number of extraordinary claims.  It refers to the looseness of the terms under which the various grant schemes were operated.  This is rather extraordinary when one recalls that most of the Deputies now sitting on the Government side of the House spoke when on this side of the House in praise of the introduction of each of these schemes, the last of which was introduced in October last year.  I see Deputy Treacy opposite and I recall Deputies from the west of Ireland using the first available opportunity to welcome that scheme without reservation.</P>

      <P>I shall not mention the names of the Deputies involved.  The Government statement suggests that the grant of £2,250 would in a full year have had an annual cost of £29 million.  That is rather disingenuous on the part of the Minister.  He forgets that the scheme was replacing the scheme of mortgage interest subsidy which would in a full year have cost more than £29 million and that this scheme was carefully designed, especially in its phasing arrangements to <Col N="1679" /> ensure that the impact of the Exchequer this year and next year would be minimal and that over a five to six-year period there would actually be a saving to the Exchequer through the operation of this scheme and the elimination and phasing down of the five-year mortgage interest subsidy scheme.  That was precisely the reason the £2,250 scheme was introduced on a phased 12 and 18-month payment basis.  The Minister suggested this evening that the scheme in a full year costing £29 million compared unfavourably with the cost of £14 million for new house grants last year.  The Minister is not comparing like with like.  He is comparing the cost of one scheme with the potential cost of another, ignoring the elimination of the mortgage interest subsidy scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are further extraordinary contradictions and strange claims within the statement issued on Friday night.  The Minister announced that he had no alternative but to close the offices of his Department until yesterday in order &ldquo;to check the position with local authorities responsible for the administration of the £5,000 (surrender grant) scheme&rdquo;.  Yet in reply to a written question of mine today, when I asked how many people had lodged their £5,000 surrender grant application with his Department between the termination date of the scheme on 27 March and the date on which termination was officially announced, 31 March, the Minister said that as the scheme in the first instance is a matter for the local authority, the information is not available in his Department.  On Friday he was closing down the whole housing grants section so that he could ring up a few county councils to ask how many applications they had received, but on Tuesday he says he does not know how many applications they have, and this evening he tells us what the potential financial obligation of the scheme would have been.  Either he knows or he does not.  If he knows, he has answered my Parliamentary Question in a manner that is less than fulsome.  If he does not know, what on earth was he doing closing the housing grants section to the public for a <Col N="1680" /> period of time, claiming that he was doing so in order to ascertain details from the local authorities?</P>
    <P>Be that as it may and leaving aside some of the hyperbole, it is still difficult to accept the Minister's continued assertion that the announcement of last Friday or the attitude this evening does not represent a U-turn, a backing down on the part of the Government.  The Minister says it was never the intention of the Government to deny to people who had legally binding and irrevocable commitments their entitlements to the grants. If that is the case, why did the advertisement placed by the Minister's Department in the newspapers on Wednesday last and in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> clearly indicate that in respect of not one of the three grants would any application be further processed unless the applicants had the magic certificate of approval in their hands by 27 March?  Anybody who read those advertisements or who heard the statements will know whether the statement by the Minister for Finance at the weekend or by the Minister for the Environment here again this evening can really stand up.  Indeed, they will know whether to believe any other statement on any issue made by either of those gentlemen.  The Minister was scathing in his comments on the £2,250 grant.</P>

      <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1 October 1986 in relation to the announcement of the introduction of the scheme, the editorial suggested that the money involved could tilt domestic decisions to move up market and so start a chain of activity in the housing sector which would benefit builders, their suppliers and the public as well.  On the same day <i>The Irish Times</i> said &ldquo;what the grant will do, and it is important, is to improve the competitive position of the tax-paying builder <i>vis-á-vis</i> the &lsquo;black economy&rsquo; operator.  The new grant, in taking its place, represents an imaginative redirecting of resources... the measures do not represent a major financial boost for the construction industry and a few months will pass before they manifest a greater level of activity.  They will, however, greatly increase the confidence in the industry.&rdquo;  Less than six months later the grant is abolished unilaterally and 3,517 applications later, of which 3,237 have yet to be determined, the grant is abolished without warning, without notice, having been in operation for less than six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a series of questions that need to be asked in relation to the house improvement grant.  The Government and the Minister kindly acceded to a request for this debate in order to clarify matters.  Perhaps the Minister will take note of the questions and reply to them at the end of the debate.  In relation to the house improvement grants, the Minister has suggested that persons who had received a visit from an inspector will have their grant processed and, if in order, paid in the normal way.  Those who did not, will not.  Question No. 1: why should an applicant who has applied for a grant but had not received a visit from a departmental inspector be treated any differently from somebody who did have such a visit?  Question No. 2: Why should an applicant in one part of the country where there is no backlog of applications and where, following application, inspections are carried out within a couple of weeks, be treated differently from an applicant in another part of the <Col N="1682" /> country where there is a delay of perhaps eight to ten weeks?</P>
    <P>As the Minister may know, or will discover eventually, there is a wide variation in the length of time taken between inspections following application from one part of the country to another.  Why has there been a departure from previous practices where applications received up to the date of the announcement of a change have always been accepted and processed in the normal way?  What is the position of applicants who had a visit to their homes from an inspector but were not at home when the inspector called? What is the position when the amount of work to be done was disputed by the inspector when he called and is the subject of ongoing correspondence and discussion between the departmental inspector and the applicant?  Is there not a clear inequity in processing applications which were received some months ago and were inspected, and denying applications which were lodged in the week ending 27 March 1987?  Those applicants could not have hoped to have an inspection before the announcement.</P>
    <P>Is there not a clear inequity in denying people who applied between 27 March &mdash; when unknown to them the scheme had been abolished &mdash; and 31 March when the termination was announced?  According to the Minister's own information 723 applications were received between 27 and 31 March, the day the abolition was announced.  Altogether there are 4,500 applicants throughout the country who are to be denied their house improvement grants because of the unilateral introduction of this extraordinary new rule that if you were lucky enough to have been visited by the inspector your application would be processed, otherwise not.</P>
    <P>Perhaps most important of all, in view of the belated discovery by the Government that they have legal obligations on foot of schemes operating and offered to the public at any given time, is the Minister satisfied that those who are now being refused because they did not have an inspection have no legal case <i>vis-à-vis</i> those who applied at the same time, or <Col N="1683" /> perhaps even later, and who merely because they had a visit from a departmental inspector are now to have their applications processed and paid?  Can the Minister guarantee the House that there is no legal obligation outstanding in relation to those cases?  The Minister should think before he answers that in the same way as he and his colleagues should have thought before they made the announcement last Tuesday on which they had to backtrack on Friday.</P>
    <P>In relation to that grant, the Minister said &mdash; and he has made the claim more than once &mdash; that the £100 million provided by the Coalition Government for the administration of this grant in 1987 was not sufficient.  This is marked at variance with the statement made by the Minister for Finance in the course of his budget speech when he said that the sum was examined carefully to see whether it could be reduced, but the Government came to the conclusion that it could not, and £100 million was necessary.  It would be better if the Minister stuck to his facts, realised the embarrassing situation which he and his colleagues have reversed into and accepted the consequences without endeavouring to apportion blame to others who had provided for the continuation of this and other schemes.  It is interesting to reflect that, according to official figures, there are some 6,000 people in employment in the construction industry today because of the operation of the house improvement grant scheme. It ill-behoves the Minister to deny that figure, which is accepted by all sides of the industry.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting aspect to the house improvement grant scheme. Whilst the scheme was abolished for the vast majority of people living in Ireland as and from 27 January, but announced only on 31 March, it appears now that the house improvement grant scheme, with an additional premium payable still applies in all its arts and parts, water grant, sewerage grant, house extension grant, pre-1940 improvement grant and chimney grants, the lot, if you happen to be fortunate enough to live in a Gaeltacht <Col N="1684" /> area.  Perhaps the Minister would explain whether the financial exigencies and the demands of the public purse extend only as far as the borders of the seven Gaeltacht counties and the Meath Gaeltacht. Perhaps the Minister would explain, as I am sure he has explained to people in his own constituency, why in parts of the Breac-Ghaeltacht in Mayo people can still apply for a house improvement grant and in other parts of his constituency they cannot.  Why have people in one part of Mayo to bear the burden of the difficulties of the public finances, but in another part they are O.K. as long as they apply trí Ghaeilge?  That, I am sure, would be a great consolation to those in the greater part of the country and of enormous consolation to the 4,500 applicants who are told they are not going to be processed any further because they did not have an inspector call and speak to them in Irish, English or Hindustani.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has had nothing but the height of contempt in regard to the £2,250 grant.  This is extraordinary considering that this grant was negotiated with the CIF on foot of an idea of theirs for some six months before it was introduced, and it was carefully, in order to minimise the budgetary impact in 1987.  It replaced the mortgage interest subsidy which was no longer effective.  It would be more cost effective than the mortgage interest subsidy in the next five to six years.  It was designed to encourage the range and type of new housing being built.  As the Minister said, it was certainly designed to encourage trading up, to give builders cash flow to encourage them to build ahead, and it was geared in its provisions towards the new house-builders' guarantee scheme.  In all of those ways this scheme which the Minister said &ldquo;has patently failed&rdquo; but which was welcomed by the editorials generated 3,517 applications, and for the first time in two years the number of new house starts in the last quarter of 1986 had increased on the previous year, from 1,854 in the last quarter of 1985 to 2,137 new starts in the last quarter of 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> There are questions to be asked about that scheme also.  The Minister says that an applicant may be processed if he has a binding and irrevocable contract.  That seems to indicate that if an applicant had a contract where there was no let out clause, subject to grant approval he will now have the grant paid to him whereas an applicant who had a prudent and careful solicitor who inserted clauses demanding that there would be a caveat regarding the approval of the grant, is now to be deprived <i>vis-á-vis</i> the applicant whose solicitor was not so careful.  If that applicant is to be deprived in any large measure, then presumably the unfortunate builders who are now well into the construction of the houses which they understood they had contracts for will be left to bear the cost of an enormous number of houses returned to them through cancelled contracts, and they are operating in many cases on the minimum of margins.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister make it clear to us that somebody who signed a contract before 27 March can still apply for this grant even after 27 March and, if so, up to what date can he apply?</P>

      <P>The same questions apply in relation to the £5,000 surrender grant. I do not understand how the cancellation of that grant which allowed local authority houses to be provided at a cost of £5,000 and in circumstances in which £12 million has been taken from the local authority housing Estimate this year, can have any other effect but to drive more and more people back on the local authority waiting list with the inevitable consequential pressure on local authority housing capital.  All in all, the abolition of that grant will impose an inevitable and dreadful burden on Exchequer financing and create demands for more and more local authority houses to be built with all of the consequences of that in the years to come.  The abolition of these three grants has all the hallmarks of ineptitude, <Col N="1686" /> haste, lack of guidance and lack of leadership.</P>

      <P>The callous and uncaring way the Government announced the cancellation of the various grant schemes in last week's budget has been matched only by their brazenness at the weekend in pretending that the U-turn they did on the issue was not a U-turn but a clarification. That kind of arrogance was not only an insult to the intelligence of the people, but if it were to be taken seriously for one moment it simply underlines the contempt that Fianna Fáil have for the many thousands of householders affected by the original budget decision.  Last Thursday I issued a statement on behalf of the Progressive Democrats condemning the retrospective abolition of the grant scheme as grossly unfair.  I would go so far as to question its legality in that it would have hit at people who had entered into house purchase contracts in all good faith on a State scheme which existed at the time of their action and which this Government sought retrospectively to cancel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party accept the necessity to cut back on various Government schemes. Indeed, our own economic programme, <i>A Nation That Works</i>, published in October last, proposed that the home improvements grants scheme should be abolished because it was a luxury the country could not afford especially considering the way the window replacement grants scheme was being operated.  In its place we called for a home improvements grants scheme restricted to pre-1940 <Col N="1687" /> houses.  Because of the totally unfair and unjust way the Government sought to cancel this and the two other grant schemes, we welcome the weekend reversal of policy by the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to allow all valid applications of 27 March last to stand. This is only fair and proper.  The retrospective cancellation of the schemes would not only have caused immense hardship to house purchasers, it was grossly unfair to many building firms who were proceeding with house construction on the understanding of having the support of the grant scheme.</P>
    <P>Any consideration of the grant scheme in this area cannot overlook the irresponsibility of the former Coalition Government in allowing massive claims to build up under the home improvements grants scheme which was introduced as an attempt to boost the badly tarnished image of the Government in 1985.  To date applications totalling £230 million for that scheme have been approved, yet only £27 million was originally allocated for the scheme in last year's Estimates, and payment to date totals just £47 million.  This means that potentially the Exchequer will have to come up with an additional £180 million to meet grant commitments under this scheme.  This was the height of irresponsibility on the part of the former Coalition.  They began to realise the folly of their ways at the beginning of this year when the separate window replacement scheme was abolished.</P>
    <P>According to the Department of the Environment figures last week the number of applicants for the £5,000 local authority grant scheme at 27 March last who had not written approval then was 2,500 with a potential cost to the Exchequer of £12.5 million.  For the builder's £2,250 grant there were about 2,845 applications outstanding.  Most of these will now also qualify under the terms of the reprieve which the Government were panicked into conceding last Friday.  The potential value of those is in the region of £6.4 million.</P>
    <P>In broad terms we welcome the change <Col N="1688" /> of heart by the Government.  The people affected have rightly been given a chance to fulfil their housing plans, but the Government must spell out what they see as the consequences for the construction industry of their decision to terminate the grants and what developmental plans they have for the economy in this area.  In the last election Fianna Fáil were big on developing the economy and making what has now been revealed to be a litany of false promises to every sectional interest. We are now entitled to know the Government's real plans for the construction industry and for the other sectors.  Now reality has dawned on the Government and they realise that their &ldquo;happy day&rdquo; formula of the past four years is no longer a viable political stance in a country that is in such severe financial difficulties.</P>

      <P>I shall try not to respond to the jibes from the Fianna Fáil benches. I think Deputy Browne has heard enough in his constituency to keep a low profile. The opinions of a councillor was enough indication to me of the attitude.  The social welfare and health cuts have yet to be felt and no doubt we shall have time later on in this parliamentary session to deal with them.  Deputies on all sides of the House have been inundated with representations about the effects which are already being felt from the changes signalled in the budget speech of last Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In no area is the case more true than in relation to the retrospective termination of the three or four major grant schemes in the housing area.  The cases of injustice and broken faith arising from these decisions must run now into thousands. From my own experience and from checking with my colleagues, the number of people who are desperately in need of clarification and relief is now legion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of cases which have been brought to my attention over the past number of days include some of the following &mdash; and I should stress that this is only a small number of examples &mdash; local authority tenants who have paid a deposit on a new house in the expectation of <Col N="1690" /> having access to grants and who now do not know if they must forfeit the deposit, in some cases their life savings, because they are more than £7,000 short of the asking price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are families who had committed themselves to a new mortgage after agreeing to the sale of a house. The Minister responds that legally binding and irrevocable agreements will be honoured.  That, no doubt, will provide employment for one section of the community, the legal profession, who will have a field day again, unravelling the morass that this Government have visited upon these people.</P>
      <P>If anything, the U-turn announced by the Government last Friday and the Mark II U-turn announced tonight have made the situation worse in many regards.  They have piled confusion on top of chaos. People no longer know where they stand and are anxiously trying to find out the situation from other Deputies and myself and from the Department.  The Department's telephone lines are inundated and this staff were, for the best part of last week, unreachable for people trying to ascertain whether they have any prospect of achieving the improvement in their living conditions which many of them have sought and striven for and for which they have saved for a considerable portion of their lives.</P>

      <P>Of course, the manner of changing this decision has reflected little credit on the Government.  Last weekend we were afforded the unseeming spectacle of the Minister for the Environment insisting on radio and television that there was no U-turn, while we could read in the Sunday papers the details of how he had conspired against his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to secure precisely the U-turn he was so vociferously denying on the national media.</P>

      <P>This is the first effect of the budget which is being felt in the community. Over the next couple of weeks the very deep and harsh cuts which have been made in social welfare entitlements will begin to be felt.  The impact of the £30 million cut in local authority revenue will become ever clearer as local authorities meet to compile their estimates in the weeks and days to come.  When they receive their notification from the Minister's Department health boards will be told what their individual allocations are and now much they must cut in terms of staff numbers and services.  Already today we have seen the INO declare a virtual work-to-rule that will visit hardship and chaos on the health services, on the very people the posters all over the country suggested Fianna Fáil were going to protect.  How much more of this must we endure?  The Finance Bill which will be published will obviously contain much of the fine print, the details&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words in detail about the grants that have been abolished.  Let us take the £5,000 grant to local authority tenants who surrendered houses.  That was a very imaginative and just as important a very cost effective grant.  In towns like my own, where the unit cost of providing local authority housing is £30,000, Wexford Corporation were able to fulfil 25 per cent of its housing start needs last year by the use of this grant.  We had the equivalent return to us of 25 per cent of the houses we built last year under this scheme.  For a sum of £5,000 we got back the equivalent of a house valued at £30,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had, and the Deputy will be aware, the best housing programme in the history of the State. Indeed, in the Deputy's own home town of Enniscorthy, for the first time ever <Col N="1694" /> there is not a waiting list of any measurable dimension, thanks to the policies pursued by the Minister's predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This imaginative grant fulfilled a number of purposes.  It enabled major inroads to be made on our housing list, it enabled people who had never owned a home of their own to fulfil that life long ambition and it enabled builders to find purchasers for houses that might never have been built otherwise.  The termination of that grant spells the end of the dream of all those tenants who had hoped to buy their own houses.  It means also that in most local authority areas the cost of providing new houses will increase six fold in realistic terms.  This is craziness and it is compounded by the fact that local authority revenue will be intolerably squeezed in the years ahead.  The Government, therefore, are squeezed in what they can do.  The result of all this will be that local authorities will have longer waiting lists after we having tried and succeeded in reducing them.  It may become necessary again to have two, three or four children or to be housed in a grotty flat before you have enough points amassed to get your own local authority house.  We had come away from that position and we had begun, for the first time to allow people to live in decent conditions while waiting for local authority housing, to allow them to plan their families as they wished and not to have to have children in order to gain points to obtain a local authority house.  All of that has now gone out of the window in one fell swoop.  This decision ultimately will cost a great deal more than money but in the process it will create hardship and bitterness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second grant which has been terminated is the house improvement grant and it, too, will bring with it its own share of hardship.  This was another imaginative scheme which was designed to attract £4 to £5 of private investment <Col N="1695" /> for every £1 of public money involved. The cost to date of this scheme has not been excessive and it lies within the power of the Government to regulate expenditure on it, to ensure that its cost never becomes over excessive, if that is the road they choose to follow.  One way of doing so, for example, would have been to establish priorities within the scheme so that people living in overcrowded accommodation could have availed of the scheme when money was tight and built patios, porches and other luxuries if, and when, money became plentiful again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not done.  The scheme was butchered, thrown out and thrown to the winds depriving people of any prospect of improving their housing and their standard of living.  Instead of adopting that rational approach the Government have decided to do away with the scheme altogether &mdash; another crazy decision in economic terms.  The scheme was beginning to breathe new life into the construction industry and into the industries that are ancillary to building and it was doing so by providing an incentive to householders to spend their own money.  The cancellations which have now occurred will lead to hundreds, if not to thousands, of lay offs in an industry in which the unemployment rate is already scandalously high.  It will have another effect, too.  It will drive a number of small builders and people operating on their own back into the black economy from which they had been enticed by the conditions of the house improvement grants scheme.  The work which had been done by builders who had registered for VAT, who were paying tax and PRSI, will now only be feasible for householders if they can get it done in the black economy. For many people that is the reality of this decision.  The result will be that in an attempt to save revenue the Government will lose revenue and a substantial opportunity to clean up a major problem <Col N="1696" /> of tax evasion will be lost to the State. We have a double blow &mdash; unemployment and layoffs for workers who were just beginning to feel there was a future for them.  Deputies may be aware of companies such as Weatherglaze Anglian in the Wexford constituency who are feeling the pinch and who will vent their feelings on Wexford Deputies when they have the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The third grant which has been terminated is the £2,250 builder's grant for new houses.  This will have one net effect.  It will drive up the cost of new houses and make them more inaccessible to young couples.  This, in turn, will increase the problems of overcrowding at a time when all the mechanisms by which overcrowding can be alleviated are being done away with and revenue available to local authorities is being removed.  Taken together, the removal of these grants adds up to a change not only of policy but of philosophy.  When two of these schemes were introduced in October 1985 Fianna Fáil accused the then Government of &ldquo;stealing their clothes&rdquo;. To a certain extent they were right.  It has always been Fianna Fáil policy to look after and provide a decent standard of housing.  The Fianna Fáil Government of old would not have embarked on the wholesale butchery of schemes that we have witnessed in the past week or two. The £2,250 builder's grant for new houses has another aspect to it.  It was not necessary to claim this grant until the owner was in occupancy for 12 months.  Many people therefore have built new homes but have not yet made formal application to the Department.  They will be numbered among those who will be left high and dry by this arbitrary decision.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The anomalies inherent in the arbitrary, illogical and totally unresearched decision become more and more obvious in every letter I open and in every telephone call I receive.  The Government have shaken the nation, in two months in office, visiting hardship, confusion and worry on a significant number of households.  How can people have faith in a Government or, in the State itself, when the ground rules for major decisions are changed at a whim and retrospectively to boot? People's confidence in schemes and measures to be announced by this administration in the future will be zero. Nobody will take a financial decision based on a promise or a structure established by this Government since they cannot know the day or the hour when that structure will be swept aside and dismantled in front of them.  The justification for this unholy mess is given as the state of the country's finances.  We are told that corrective measures must be taken.</P>
      <P>Labour has always accepted the need for strong and determined action.  How can any administration reduce taxation in one area &mdash; by abolishing the land tax &mdash; and at the same time appear so desperate for money that they would willingly increase unemployment, expand the black economy, worsen our housing stock, lengthen our house waiting lists, sap the nation of any remaining vestige of confidence in Government, knock the construction industry for six and rob thousands of people of any hope of implementing a life-long plan to improve their housing circumstances?  In charity I say the Government's action was simply not thought out.  I honestly believe that Fianna Fáil would not consciously and knowingly have cobbled together such a destructive cocktail.  I say to the Minister that he has made a mistake; he should rescind that decision and start again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is most sad about this development is that it constitutes the beginning only; over ensuing months and years we shall see more and more hardship being brought to bear on people who simply cannot withstand it.  The next few years <Col N="1698" /> will prove to be a time of increasing hardship and division in our society.  This Government have ensured that that division will be deep and long-lasting.</P>
    <P>I have a few minutes remaining which I want to give to Deputy Kemmy.  The Minister's reply is a pathetic response to a crisis affecting the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision of the Minister and his Government has caused widespread distress and hardship in many sections of the industry.  Normally I would not speak here on behalf of building contractors.  On this occasion I must point out that I have been approached in Limerick by people who have been involved in the withdrawal of these grants, trade unionists, building workers and contractors.  That might amaze the Minister because, in Limerick, the local branch of the Construction Industry Federation is almost synonymous with a local Fianna Fáil cumann.  I have spent over 30 years in the building industry and have a close attachment to it so that I would have as much knowledge of the building industry as any other Member.  All three groups, that is trade unionists, building workers and contractors have approached me.  The Minister has misjudged, indeed underestimated, the effect of these cutbacks on such people and he is in for a rude awakening.  I could have made my contribution in a different fashion this evening when perhaps I might have been put out of the House &mdash; which would take some doing if I were sufficiently determined &mdash; but I have chosen not to do so.  I hope the Minister will take note of my comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said earlier this evening, that as a people, we could not afford these grants.  That may well be so but the manner in which he abolished them was insensitive, drastic and certainly will lead <Col N="1699" /> to more unemployment within the building industry.  On the Minister's own admission there are at present more than 40,000 building workers unemployed. Certainly that number will rise, leading to more emigration.  Building workers, even apprentices, are emigrating in large numbers to Britain, to America, illegally, to Australia and Canada.  I know something of the hardship of emigration myself because almost 30 years ago to the day I emigrated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has voiced some criticism of the schemes, much of which could be true.  I might well find myself agreeing with many of the things he said.  For example, he expressed the view that it was an administrative nightmare.  One might well ask: what has he done?  He has now caused a greater nightmare in the short term at least by imposing hardship and distress on people who are helpless and have been caught in this trap.  As a result of the Minister's action many of them will lose £7,250.  These are not wealthy people; those who have been flocking to my advice centres are ordinary people.  The Minister has imposed nerve-racking pressures on them.  I do not know whether the Minister has met such people in his constituency but certainly, in Limerick, I have been inundated by people who have come to see me, some of them almost suicidal.  As an experienced politician I have seen people commit suicide on account of their problems.  I have had the experience of people drowning themselves in the River Shannon because of the problems obtaining in our society.  I am not somebody who is easily scared. The Minister is making a big mistake if he thinks he can get away unscathed with this action.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first grant the Minister mentioned, that of £2,250, he said he would examine the matter in the light of legally binding agreements.  I hope he will do so but one might well ask: what does it mean?  I hope he will examine that in a humane and compassionate way.  On the question of the £5,000 grant the Minister said he would examine commitments where they exist, that his <Col N="1700" /> inspectors and officials will examine that matter also.  Then the Minister said that, where an inspector has already inspected the work, home improvement grants will be honoured.  One can apply legalistic formulae to the situation but that will not alleviate the hardship caused by the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>I admit that our public finances are in a mess and that there are urgent remedies needed.  I believe the Minister has been wrong in the way he has gone about this. I believe he will have to re-examine the whole question with regard to the people who genuinely applied for such grants before 31 March.  He should remember that the effect of these cutbacks will be widespread.  I am concerned more immediately with the effect on urban and rural programmes in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, especially in Limerick where people have committed themselves to buying houses in an inner city development. The Minister is not long in office. Obviously he does not have knowledge of the urban and rural programmes in Limerick whereby private contractors have undertaken to build houses with the help and blessing of Limerick Corporation. In turn, people have agreed to buy those houses.  As a result of the Minister's action that scheme has been put in jeopardy.  If the Minister wants to talk to me privately about that I will inform him of the position.  The same must apply to other housing estates throughout the country.  One must remember also the effect on local authority building schemes, which will be fairly drastic because the £5,000 grant had obviated the need for them to build as many houses as heretofore.  This means that local authority house building has slowed down and one cannot expect them to accelerate and build more houses overnight.</P>
    <P>I have not come here to threaten the Minister or the Government.  Rather have I come as a building worker to give the Minister some advice.  The Government have caused problems for young people who have committed themselves to buying or to building houses.  I heard of a man who lost £7,250 as a result of <Col N="1701" /> the Government decision.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to look at this again.  I am not given to making pleas, as I have other ways of doing business, but on this occasion I appeal to the Government on behalf of the people I represent to consider this matter again in a compassionate and humane way.  I appeal to the Minister to consider all the applications made before 31 March and not to adopt a legalistic bureaucratic approach to those applications.  I would like the Government to set up a special committee to examine the applications with a view to adopting an approach which will help the people who have applied for these grants.</P>
    <P>Admittedly action had to be taken somewhere along the line and I acknowledge that the Government had an unpleasant job to do, but innocent people have been caught by the decision.  Although public finances are strained, by changing their minds on this issue the Government will win the approval of the people on whose behalf I am speaking tonight.  I hope they will take my view seriously because, if not, the consequences for the Government could be drastic.</P>

      <P>I have not got a lot to say because most of the points have already been made.  It is obvious that the decision arbitrarily and retrospectively to cancel three of the four housing grant schemes has led to a degree of hardship and distress for many thousands of people, not only those who had already applied but for many who were waiting until the end of their tax year to make applications for grants, to go looking for a change of house and to move out of Corporation houses and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that the builder's grant was of any great advantage to the house buyer in the way it affected the price.  I do not cry about that grant.  I also had reservations about the £5,000 grant, the arbitrary way in which it was introduced without consultation with local authorities and the very severe side effects it had on the communities affected by that grant.  However, my reservations do not deny the fact that expectations were there <Col N="1702" /> in many cases where people had applied, although in some cases the inspectors had not been out to them.  People built their hopes on the expectation that they would get a grant and some had committed themselves by way of holding deposits on houses to which, were it not for the £5,000 grant, they would not have committed themselves.</P>
    <P>The decision was clearly a mistake. The Government, in their decision at the weekend to clarify the position, seemed to recognise that an error had been made and fair dues to the Government for recognising that.  To be completely fair the Government should recognise the full extent of that error and allow any applications received up to the date of their announcement to be accepted as valid assuming everything else is in order.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that those who applied for the various grants up to 31 March are accepted as valid applicants and are dealt with on that basis.  As well as that, the Government must recognise the dire state of the building industry and the fact that there is a 50 per cent unemployment rate amongst building workers in this city.  It is particularly high in Dublin city.  I know of quite a number of building workers in my constituency who have emigrated to London looking for work.  The Government must also recognise that there is an urgent need for investment in the building industry.</P>

      <P>If this debate highlights one aspect of social policy, it indicates that there is an absolute need to examine and re-examine the whole question of housing policy.  I have been a Member of this House since 1969 and I can recall very few occasions, except spasmodically in the course of debates on the old local government Estimates or in more recent years on the Votes for the Department of the Environment, when there was a serious analysis by Deputies of the major <Col N="1703" /> anomalies that exist in our national housing policy.</P>
      <P>I draw the following analogy.  On the one hand we have a complex series of grants introduced in recent years with varying eligibility conditions and varying amounts of payments.  On the other hand I could bring Members of this House to a village in Limerick where a public health nurse could bring me within a ten mile radius of where she works to 26 houses, where mostly elderly people live, which have outside toilets, cold water, one tap, open fires and are generally unsanitary and decrepit.  How is it that in the Book of Estimates this year we have £100 million for grant schemes, we have £70 million or £80 million in local authority capital moneys for local authority housing, and yet those kinds of conditions are existing in terms of social policy?  I could bring Members to areas of my constituency in Shankhill and Ballybrack where people have left houses which cost Dublin County Council £32,000 to build. Families occupying good dwellings, in some cases four bedroomed dwellings with solid fuel central heating, in an excellent well planned environment, and not overcrowded in any way, have decided that what they want more than anything else is a new address in a non-local authority housing estate and they have availed of the £5,000 surrender grant.  We call that housing policy.  On the one hand one has the impoverishment of people who cannot even write a letter of application for a grant, who are too unaware and too deprived to talk to a local county councillor about their needs, who are ignored in the social services system and are in dire need of better living, habitable accommodation.  On the other hand, we have people of substantial means, in permanent pensionable jobs, whose families are virtually reared who get grants for double glazing.  At the rate we are going the whole country will be double glazed.  That is what we call a social housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are major issues.  There are people living in intolerable conditions.  I know many psychiatric hospitals which <Col N="1704" /> would be transformed by an expenditure of £10 million.  There are people in those hospitals living in dreadful conditions. Yet we reduce in the capital programme this year the capital moneys to provide these people with habitable accommodation. I challenge Members of this House to go to the Dundrum Mental Hospital to see the conditions under which these people live.  They will inhabit these cells for the rest of their lives.  They are living in what are in some respects sub-human conditions but what do we do?  We tell a family we will give them £2,500 tax free, irrespective of income.</P>
    <P>I approach this debate on the basis that we have a national housing mess when it comes to a national housing policy.  The Department of the Environment have one great policy &mdash; and I do not blame them &mdash; which is to hold on to the money for God's sake.  It is a reflection on the manhood of the holder of the portfolio if he cannot hold on to the money.  What he does with the money subsequently is a matter of political <i>ad hoc-ery</i>.  Our housing policy is one huge <i>ad hoc</i> scheme after the other, with nothing coherent about it and no long term planning involved.</P>
    <P>People in public life in the greater Dublin area can go into one housing estate after another and they will see there has been no effort to spend a few million pounds in a rational way to integrate the infrastructure into a habitable vibrant community where people are happy to live.  I am speaking of Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Jobstown, Killenarden, Shanganagh, Shankill and so on.  The houses are there, but where are the schools, the community centres and integrated planning?  There is virtually none. I plead guilty because I was a member of Dublin County Council.  I fought for that but most of my colleagues were interested in the housing allocations list. Once the letters went out and the people were allegedly happy, we had a housing policy.  That policy flourished in the political millieu of trying to get votes.  There was no planning in terms of transport, education, social services and so on.  I could take Deputies into the areas I mentioned <Col N="1705" /> and show them that in most cases there is not even an employment exchange or Manpower office.  If we were to convert some of the empty houses there we might be able to provide some facilities in those areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have the mess which is called the differential rents scheme.  Is it a differential rents scheme?  Where are the real differentials?  Where is the real reform?  It is an unholy mess compounded by the fact that, uniquely in Europe, we do not have a rates charges scheme on houses.  This is in a country where normally one would expect people of all social classes to expend a minimum of around 15 per cent to a maximum of 30 per cent of income on housing depending on income differential.  We have virtually no relativity in this country because if one has plenty of money what does one get?  One gets mortgage interest relief. Uniquely in western Europe we actually give income tax relief to these people. That, too, is a mess.  No matter where one looks there are grant schemes and mortgage interest relief schemes but in regard to paying for services, be it water, sanitary services, public lighting and so on we have nothing.  This is because the politicians in their puerile efforts to have a political social policy have dismantled and reconstructed the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I come back to the family in Croom, County Limerick.  I recommend that the public health nurse's report about Croom, County Limerick, be read by all.  The Department and the Minister should examine the housing policy and read the NESC reports.  They are worth reading but many of us do not read anything, apart from the PR preferences in an election.  For many of us that is what really counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the mess in the grants decision.  I do not know how that decision was made.  There are many ways a Government arrive at a decision.  I learned from experience, as Deputy <Col N="1706" /> Boland learned and as the Minister is learning, that when a decision is arrived at around the Cabinet table the matter then goes to the Taoiseach's secretariat, and is transmitted to the Department of Finance who honeycomb it for anomalies and decide to take a few more stabs at a draft decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By the time it arrives in the Custom House, where it is once again filtered through the system, it can be dramatically different from the decision taken in principle around the Cabinet table.  I was appalled when the Minister for the Environment indicated he had gone back to the Custom House after the Government decision was announced, had examined the consequences of this unholy mess and decided something would have to be done about it.  He corralled his officials until midnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, with due respect, that the mess was self-created, not born of inexperience but born of a lack of diligence on the part of a Cabinet that surely knew that the anomalies were manifestly evident.  If they did not know, then the Cabinet, in their first month in office, must be taking their directions on a straightforward basis from the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach.  The decision was published in national advertisements for all to see.  Surely it merited a cursory glance from the AG before it was published or before the final Government decision was circulated.  There are, as we well know, legal advisers in the Department of the Environment who also work for the Department of Health.  They would have examined the decision and their eyebrows would have arched quite flexibly. <Col N="1707" /> They would have indicated to the Minister that this decision was wide open to question.</P>
      <P>What we have is an exhibition of slovenly Government &mdash; I say Government because they are responsible &mdash; and a Minister who, for all his volubleness in approaching these matters, must not have burned the midnight oil in ensuring that he was fully briefed before he went to the Cabinet and defended his manhood before his colleagues in the best interests of the schemes that he is there to administer. I am glad there was &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; on the part of the Minister.  The Minister, Deputy MacSharry, emerged in a very clear, unambiguous light whether one agrees with him or not.  I disagree with the thrust of the budget because it was in many ways contrary to social policy.  He conveyed the impression that he knew precisely what he was doing in that regard.  I very much regret that he should have resorted to that age old cosmetic of blaming the media and of saying they got it wrong.  God help the media.  They are only three weeks old in their relations with the Government.  They are a very newly born baby.  To suggest that the media got it all wrong about the grants scheme and the Government decision is stretching credulity somewhat in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>What the Minister for Finance should have done &mdash; I do not think we would have considered his strength of purpose any worse that what our original view might be &mdash; was simply admit that there was a serious mistake made, that the policy decision was now being reviewed and that of course there would be consequential capital programme costs in 1988 and 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unquestionably, this will have a substantial impact on the Public Capital Programme on the housing side.  I regret I did not hear the Minister's initial statement in this regard.  I ask him to be quite specific in his reply because the numbers and the average costings are there.  We know the take-up figure for 1986, we know the budget provision for 1986 and all the basic data in relation to these <Col N="1708" /> schemes are now available to the Minister even if they were not available at the time or perhaps he did not brief himself fully in that regard.  We owe it to the House and to the country to tell people precisely what money is involved in relation to the changes that have been made.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have changed their policy on this matter. Unquestionably, many thousands of families directly concerned were being penalised by this decision.  I share Deputy De Rossa's trenchant and, as ever, appropriate comments in this regard.  I share his reservations on that aspect of social policy.  We in the Labour Party would have given due notice of policy changes and we would have prepared the ground. The Government might have been surprised at the degree of understanding and accommodation which they might have found in relation to the operation of some of the grant schemes and the criticisms by Deputy Howlin and myself in relation to the Government decision would not have arisen in such a trenchant form. A very bad mistake was made.  Having treated the matter in this regard I hope the Department and the Minister will deal with the outstanding applications in an effective way and will not cause what must be very disturbing and what we underestimate in the House, the declining confidence and declining regard which the people have for the Government, for departmental schemes and for politicians who change their minds with such cavalier lack of thought for those who have made applications.  For all of us, the process of buying a house and applying for a grant in order to buy a house are very serious decisions.  The home owners of Ireland deserve better than to be treated in that manner.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned about the impact on employment in the construction industry.  That industry may be less political and more objective in its dealings with political parties in future. They may be more rational in terms of the social policy implications.  If they were building a Taj Mahal at every crossroads in the country, as long as there is money from the Public Capital Programme they <Col N="1709" /> would build it without giving much thought to the real impact of social policy.  The construction industry have learned a very salutary lesson in relation to this scheme &mdash; that they should not trust any political party.  Their role and their contribution to the development of infrastructure should be well apart from the political process rather than singing &ldquo;happy days are here again&rdquo; as happened in my constituency when it looked as though Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, had 86 seats.  It rapidly died out when they appreciated that Fianna Fáil got only 81 seats.  Leaflets were dumped into every home in my constituency about bringing on the JCBs and bringing on the jobs. That kind of superficial politics and sloganising on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party has a hollow ring to it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government &mdash; I hope the Minister for the Environment will make a distinct contribution by urging his officials in the Department &mdash; to initiate, within the framework of the several hundreds of millions of pounds which we are still spending on house construction, improvements and developments and on infrastructure, a thoroughgoing social policy review so that the money we are spending will go to those in greatest need in our community.  I estimate that about 25,000 families are living in appalling housing conditions.  Help is not being given to those families who are spread throughout every county and we owe most to them in spending scarce national resources.  We should turn our attention to aiding these people instead of flooding constituencies with leaflets relating to home improvement grants.  They are entitled to at least fundamental improvements in their living conditions.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my thanks to those who contributed to the debate although I was not impressed by many of them.  Indeed, it became more obvious as the debate went on that there was a certain lack of sincerity in some of the speeches, although others were sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I deal with some of the points raised <Col N="1710" /> by individual speakers it might be the best way to bring the debate to a close. Deputy Boland seemed to be much more concerned about public notices in newspapers, the closing of departmental offices and articles concerning them instead of the termination of the grants scheme.  The sole purpose of the motion is obvious; it is to try to score cheap political points.  The Government's schemes, of which Deputy Boland was in charge for a while, were ineffective in achieving their purpose and inefficient in the use of public funds applied to them. It is not a question of how hastily my script was put together tonight.  The only thing I remember about the grants is that some of them were hastily put together by Deputy Boland which is why they were so ineffective.  There is now a general consensus that they were badly planned and many speakers implied that they were glad to see the end of them.  Unfortunately, the millstone around my neck and that of the Government will have to be borne for a considerable time before we can get away from the ineffective mechanism of house grants which Deputy Boland placed on the back of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland might have liked a different way of terminating the grants and having another date applied to the termination.  However, as he well knows, the experience of 1980 still lingers.  He was quite right in saying that, of the 45,000 applications made in the few short weeks at that time until the discontinuation of the scheme, some of the grants have yet to be cleared and finally paid by the Department.  It is regrettable that obviously there will be the dregs of the Minister's scheme which will have to be paid for at a later date.  There seems to have been an attitude prevalent in the previous Government that perhaps it was time to terminate the grants but, unfortunately, they did not have the courage in the dying days of their term of office to do that and to make a statement to the public.  They went a little bit of the road in January but failed to carry out their intentions.  As Deputy Boland knows, <Col N="1711" /> they had intended to terminate all these schemes before the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk here tonight about equity and fair play but I repeat that a Government decision had been taken to terminate the grants and it was left to the Minister for the Environment to implement that decision, to see where the anomalies were and where difficulties might arise.  Deputy Boland should have advised the Government subsequently and clarified the position for all and sundry.  That is exactly what I did when I closed down the Department for a limited period although I did not make a public statement, as it might have been misleading, until I knew exactly what was involved because of the various agencies which were responsible for the approvals, the different system of inspection that took place for various schemes and the morass I inherited owing to the mismanagement of the schemes by the previous administration.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual to close down an office for that purpose.  I wish to remind Deputy Boland that he closed down Department of the Environment offices for over a week last January and he spent that time sending out personal letters to all existing applicants.  He did this in the middle of a general election campaign.  At least I closed down the Department for a week to give the officials there an opportunity to get to grips with the mess which existed.  I certainly did not close it down so that half the staff could compile and send out letters to all parts of the country in the hope of gaining political advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor in office acknowledged that he was in charge of a scheme which had gone completely out of control. He proved that when he arbitrarily abolished the fire inspection requirement for the house improvement grant in 1986. The schemes had reached such proportions that it was beyond the capacity of the Department to administer them properly.  We all acknowledge the value of prior inspection as a measure of protection <Col N="1712" /> for the taxpayer funding the scheme but the then Minister was unable to provide that safeguard for the taxpayers. Instead of suspending the scheme, to allow the Department to do the decent thing, he completely abandoned it and wrote to 23,000 applicants advising them to go ahead and do the work without any inspection.  Is that a responsible way of dealing with taxpayer's money?  At the stroke of a pen, the then Minister, Deputy Boland, incurred a debt of £46 million without any restrictions.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned he has no case to make and he cannot justify what he did.  It was bordering on the irresponsible not just the way he inserted the advertisement when he introduced the £2,250 grant but that he never let anybody know what it was going to cost thereafter.  He never bothered to tell anybody that this money would go to the builders and that it would cost £22 million, £25 million thereafter.  I regard that kind of delayed payment tactic as being all right in the short term &mdash; and it was short term when he introduced it last October &mdash; but he left it to some other administration to pick up the pieces afterwards. This is the reason why so many people who have contributed to this debate this evening were happy to see the end of that scheme and so am I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put it on the record that legitimate contracts signed before 27 March where it can be shown that there is an irrevocable commitment to purchase will qualify for the grant assistance as long as they comply with the various other conditions of the scheme as they <Col N="1714" /> are laid down in the application form and memorandum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland showed scant regard for certain types of people, most of whom live in the west of Ireland along the coast. Rinne sé tagairt dos na daoine atá in a gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht.

    <P>I did not hear much from the Gaeltacht representatives sitting behind Deputy Boland when he was criticising the fact that the poor Gaeltacht people were going to be given the opportunity of continuing with the grants.  They vanished from the back benches very quickly when he set out on that line of chat.  This is a far cry from the £1.6 million which will be expended on all grants, new, secondhand, old improvement or whatever for the people of the Gaeltacht who in normal circumstances would be admitted even by your colleagues as being somewhat disadvantaged by way of geography and by way of income and entitled to that little extra.  I am proud of the fact that it has been possible to maintain the grant structure for those people living in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We should not be talking about retrospection. It is not correct to say that the grants have been abolished retrospectively to the detriment of many applicants. Everybody who had a legitimate commitment on 27 March 1987 in accordance with the terms of a particular scheme will get their grant.</P>

      <P>This was a poor debate and the reason for this was that apart from Deputy Kemmy nobody really sought to defend their position.  In his contribution I detected a sincerity about the people who might be disadvantaged.  I would like to assure him that that will not be the case.  Everybody else went on their own track with no recognition at all of any difficulties that might be experienced. They made their own political points seeking to embarrass me and the Government. I want to put on the record that there is no change in the Government's decision in so far as the termination of these grants is concerned.  All those who have a legitimate commitment and who are entitled and eligible under the schemes as and on 27 March 1987 will get a grant.  This was a Government decision and it was left to me to implement it. Anomalies arose and have been identified by me because of the different grant approval systems which were in existence as a result of the means of inspections which are applied to the various schemes. It was reasonable to expect that I would be given some time before clarification could be made.  That is why I closed the Department and did not make a public statement until Friday of last week.  If Deputies pay a little more attention to the clarification statement made last Friday then they will have no difficulties whatsoever in advising their constituents that all those without exception who qualified and who are eligible for a grant through a legitimate legal commitment as and on <Col N="1717" /> 27 March will be grant-aided by the Department and the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seán Barrett has been given permission <Col N="1718" /> to raise on the Adjournment the reason the Minister for Justice has failed to bring into effect those sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, dealing with the powers of the gardaí when investigating crimes, which had been scheduled to come into force on 6 April 1987.  The Deputy has 15 minutes.  Is he happy with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment arises from the public unrest at the failure of the Government to bring into effect those sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, dealing with the powers of the gardaí when investigating crimes.  The sections I refer to are as follows: section 4, detention after arrest; section 5, access to a solicitor and notification of detention; section 6, powers of Garda Síochána in relation to a detained person; section 8, destruction of records; section 9, application to persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939; section 10, rearrest; section 15, withholding information regarding firearms or ammunition; section 16, withholding information regarding stolen property etc.; section 18, inferences from failure or refusal to account for objects, marks etc.; section 19, inferences from an accused's presence at a particular place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An order bringing these very important sections into effect could not be made until provision relating to the investigation of complaints from the public against members of the Garda Síochána, not above the rank of chief superintendent, and the adjudication by a body other than the Garda Síochána of such complaints were enacted by the Oireachtas and in operation, and until regulations under section 7 of the 1984 Act were made.  These restrictions arose after many months of painstaking debate in this House on this very important legislation. Indeed, the Minister will recall the many hours spent by Members on all sides of the House on all Stages of the Bill in teasing out line by line the implications of this legislation.  It is fair to say that, at the end of that debate, the public felt confident that, whilst the Garda <Col N="1719" /> Síochána were being given additional necessary powers to deal with crime, care had been taken to protect the rights and freedom of the individual who may be questioned or detained for questioning in connection with a particular offence.</P>
    <P>Since then, we have had the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, which established the Garda Síochána Complaints Board from 6 April 1987 to deal with complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána.  In July 1986, we had regulations laid by the then Minister for Justice before each House of the Oireachtas providing for the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations. It would appear, therefore, that there is no justifiable reason for the delay in bringing into effect the sections I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister is no doubt aware of the alarming increase in the recent past in the number of armed robberies and other very serious crimes.  I sincerely hope that the unexpected delay in bringing into effect these sections does not indicate a weakening of the Government's commitment to give the Garda Síochána the new powers of arrest and detention they need to deal with crime at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension when he suggests that the remaining provisions of the Criminal Justice Act were scheduled to come into operation on 6 April. I am aware that there have been some reports in the news media which have suggested that this was the case but these were erroneous.</P>
      <P>The position is as follows.  With the exception of certain sections dealing with detention after arrest and the withholding of certain information, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, was brought into force on 1 March 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 (2) of the Act provides that <Col N="1720" /> the remaining sections cannot be brought into operation until provisions relating to the investigation and independent adjudication of complaints against gardaí have come into operation and regulations under section 7 dealing with the treatment of persons in custody in Garda stations have been made.</P>
    <P>The first requirement has now been fulfilled in that the Garda Síochána Complaints Board have been established and have commenced operations as and from yesterday, 6 April.  With regard to the second requirement, regulations under section 7 in relation to the treatment of persons detained in Garda stations were approved in draft form by both Houses of the Oireachtas in July last year.  It was necessary to await the establishment of the complaints board before proceeding to make these regulations in order that there would be an independent forum to deal with any complaints which might arise under them.  I want to assure the Deputy that I intend to make these regulations shortly.  When this is done I will be in a position to make an order bringing the remaining provisions of the Criminal Justice Act into operation.</P>
    <P>To have attempted to implement all of these complex measures on the same day &mdash; the establishment of the complaints board, the introduction of the treatment regulations and the bringing into operation of the remaining provisions of the Criminal Justice Act &mdash; would have created undue administrative difficulties for the Garda Síochána.  The practical approach is to introduce these measures on a phased basis which is what I am doing.  I repeat that I intend to make the treatment regulations and bring the remaining provisions of the Criminal Justice Act into operation shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 April 1987.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce his plans for job <Col N="1450" /> creation in Dublin city centre; if he is aware that this area is one of the most blighted and disadvantaged in the whole country in terms of unemployment; and if he will give priority to this area as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that unemployment is a very serious problem in Dublin's inner city, but would emphasise that the Industrial Development Authority are very committed to the development of industry in that area, which in common with many city centres has suffered from the move to the suburbs of firms in search of suitable sites to build and expand.</P>
      <P>In response to the needs of the Dublin Inner City the IDA in 1979 drew up a special programme of industrial development and, since that time, have committed considerable resources to the implementation of the programme.  To date IR£20 million has been invested in the provision of an industrial infrastructure in the inner city which included the construction of 496,000 sq. ft. of factory space and the acquisition of 35 acres of land for development.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the new factory space is in the form of enterprise centres which are specifically geared to cater for the needs of the type of small industry which flourishes in the centre city environment. Already 93 small Irish-owned firms have located in the two enterprise centres in Pearse Street and East Wall Road which collectively employ over 700 people in manufacturing enterprises which produce a range of goods from clothing and crafts to microcomputers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, since the regionalisation of IDA's small industry programme in 1984 a committed team of executives have been dealing exclusively with small industry development in Dublin.  This year, the IDA expect to approve over 200 small industry projects with a potential 1,000 new jobs to be created in diverse areas of activity from consumer products through to electronics.  The new centre at Gloucester Place which was completed in the middle of last year and comprises 18 <Col N="1451" /> small units ranging in size from 400 to 800 sq. ft. is being marketed vigorously by IDA with the local community group. Despite intensive efforts to secure locally promoted projects for this centre, the take-up has been disappointing with only three projects located in the centre so far.  The IDA are now seeking to procure projects from outside the area which will employ local people.</P>
    <P>In Prussia Street where IDA have constructed four factory units there are almost 100 people employed.  In the IDA's small industry centre in Newmarket 170 people are employed in 11 factory units.  The IDA, in close consultation with the local community have also allocated two units for the training of local people.  One of these units, allocated to CERT, has already turned out close to 175 people trained in the catering industry while AnCO have established a community training workshop in the other unit.</P>
    <P>The IDA have also allocated an 8,500 sq. ft. premises on the North Wall Quay to the North Wall Community Workshops Limited for the purpose of identifying locally based enterprises.</P>
    <P>The IDA are anxious to encourage private enterprise and community groups to develop space for manufacturing industry and are already in discussions with one developer in the north inner city who is undertaking a development.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of giving priority to job creation in Dublin's inner city, this area has been designated for special incentives for a period of five years from 1 January 1983 which enables grants of up to 60 per cent for fixed assets to be paid to suitable industrial projects.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Government recently announced the establishment of an international financial services centre committee, <i>inter alia,</i> to identify, in conjunction with the relevant public bodies and to advise the Government on a designated area in the Custom House docks site as the location for a major international financial services centre in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority announced recently that they had reviewed and modified the operating procedures for the research and development grants programme provided for under the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  The results of a survey of grant-assisted R &amp; D projects in the period 1980-1984 showed that 461 manufacturing companies had achieved over £200 million in sales of new or improved products in that period, of which approximately £100 million was achieved in 1984 alone.  The R &amp; D grant payments in respect of these projects amounted to £8.7 million.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on R &amp; D grants constituted approximately 7.5 per cent of total IDA grant expenditure in 1986 and it is projected that this will increase to 10 per cent by 1989.</P>
      <P>I understand that the revised arrangements for R &amp; D grants have been discussed with Kilkenny Design Workshops and Coras Tráchtála and will not give rise to any duplication or conflict.  The matter has not been discussed by the Management Committee on Industrial Policy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement regarding the special loan arrangements which were agreed by his Department in January 1983, in relation to a Nigerian company defaulting in payments due to an Irish exporter; the action taken in relation to this incident which occurred under the export guarantee arrangements of the Insurance Act, 1953, as the action taken within the Department had the effect of deferring payment <Col N="1454" /> of valid claims and incurring additional expenditure; the additional cost involved; and whether his Department have, at any time, entered into any other similar arrangements or derogations from the normal insurance claim arrangements under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a default by a Nigerian buyer which gave rise to a claim, under the export credit insurance scheme, for £1.9 million in December 1982.</P>
      <P>Normally the claim would have been paid direct to the Irish exporter by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI) which is the Minister's agent for the administration of the scheme.  The ICI is then repaid the amount of the claim.  Because the buyer had indicated his willingness to pay in dollars on a rescheduled basis and, in addition, would give a personal guarantee to pay generous interest rates, a loan arrangement was entered into whereby the exporter was provided with a loan to the full value of the default.  The Minister, as an inherent part of the export credit insurance and finance schemes, guaranteed the repayment of principal and interest.</P>
      <P>It was considered that the arrangement, which included a threat of legal action against the buyer and a rate of interest greater than the loan interest, was such that the buyer would pay as promised and, therefore, the term for the loan arrangement would be short.  The arrangement appeared to be working well as in 1983 repayments of £.5 million were received.</P>
      <P>When the termination of the loan arrangement was considered in February 1984, it transpired that if the exporter was obliged to meet his responsibilities in relation to his share &mdash; 10 per cent of the insurance risk and 100 per cent of the dollar exposure &mdash; the result would be the closure of his exporting business and the loss of employment of 60 persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As no further repayments from Nigeria were forthcoming despite exhaustive recovery attempts including visits to Nigeria by people from my Department, <Col N="1455" /> the bank threatened to call in the loan in October 1984.</P>
    <P>At that stage, and in the light of the plight of the exporter, the arrangement was altered, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to provide that the State would assume 90 per cent of the dollar exposure.  The loan was fully repaid in January 1986.  The cost was £163,243 in respect of an exchange loss and £496,229 in respect of interest.  In accordance with the provision that, taking one year with another, the export credit insurance scheme must break even the costs of paying the claim, bank interest and exchange exposure were taken into account with other relevant factors in applying an increase of 15 per cent in premiums in January 1986.  Thus the cost of the loan arrangement will be recovered over time.</P>
    <P>Two somewhat similar arrangements were embarked on in March and April 1986, because imminent legal proceedings were expected to lead to recovery of the amounts outstanding.  Both arrangements were terminated when it became clear that litigation was likely to be prolonged.  Court action continues in these cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cases to which the Deputy refers are those where the Government decided during the period 1983 to 1986 to approve special export credit insurance cover for exports to the countries in question.  The proposals, while not acceptable under the normal commercial criteria of the export credit insurance scheme, were nonetheless, considered to be an assumable risk because of the attendant economic and employment benefits in Ireland.  Where such cover is provided, strict conditions are applied in terms of the level of cover made available, the rate of premium charged and the credit period permitted. Total cover of £142 million was available in respect of the markets in question.</P>
      <P>The present level of contingent liability in respect of cover already granted in the countries in question is £37.46 million. Two claims totalling £120,000 approximately have been paid in respect of defaults in payments to exporters.</P>
      <P>The question of making proposals to Government for this special cover is searchingly re-appraised in my Department by reference to the changing political and commercial situations in the countries concerned and to their current and past payment records.</P>

      <P>The measures necessary to defend lives and property from IRA and other terrorist violence in Great Britain are a matter for the British Parliament and Government.

    <P>Statistical records of tax payments by vocational category are not maintained but by use of sampling techniques the Revenue Commissioners estimate that the number of farmers who paid income tax up to 14 April 1986 in respect of 1983-84 is of the order of 20,000.  The corresponding estimate for 1984-85 at 14 April 1986 is of the order of 17,500.  Both of these numbers are likely to increase over time as final liability is settled in cases still under appeal.</P>

    <P>(1)The figures cover more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  They include tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>
    <P>(2)Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are, to some extent, estimated.  The figures shown are estimates of the tax paid by full time farmers together with tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>
    <P>(3)This includes tax paid on income from trades and professions (other than farming) together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under Schedule E on employees.  This tax is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified.</P>
    <P>The figures also take into account tax repayments made to exempt individuals and bodies (such as charities and pension funds) in respect of tax deducted at source (such as income paid under covenants) or of tax credits attaching to company distributions.</P>
    <P>(4)The figures shown are in respect of tax deducted by building societies under the composite rate arrangement.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of tax referable to building society interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(5)The figure shown in 1986 is the yield in that year from tax deducted at 35 per cent from interest accrued in the six month period to 5 October 1986 on bank and building society deposits.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of tax referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(6)The heading of &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; includes tax payments made in respect of back duty settlements and income of Irish residents arising in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes who deals with the taxpayer's affairs has not received from the taxpayer a claim for repayment of tax.  A repayment was made to the taxpayer by his employer on 1 September 1986 following the issue of an amended certificate of taxfree allowances to include life assurance relief.  If the taxpayer wishes to have his liability for 1986-87 reviewed, he should forward to the inspector his form P60 (statement of pay and tax deducted) which should soon be available from his employer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the improvements which have been made on the internal control procedures for the prevention of and protection against irregularities in VAT repayments, particularly in respect of a number of serious irregularities involving the fraudulent claiming <Col N="1467" /> of VAT repayments which occurred in 1985 in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners which resulted in internal fraud and involved the raising of automatic repayments from £500 to £6,000 per two monthly period and unquantified sums of money; if he will make a statement on the total amounts involved, and the steps taken to effect recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims to repayments of VAT were made purporting to come from businesses which were found in the event not to exist.  A rigorous and detailed vetting procedure is now in place to establish that a bone fide trade exists when VAT registration is applied for.  This has involved redeployment of six officers from outdoor work to the surveillance of registrations.</P>
      <P>New arrangements have been put in place in connection with the issue and use of &ldquo;badges&rdquo; (plastic cards security coded) which authorise VAT officers with appropriate authorities to input and-or view information depending on an officer's responsibilities.  The passwords for badges are now issued by the district inspector or other appointed officer and are subject to being revised monthy, so that the password for a badge is known only to local management and the officer concerned.</P>
      <P>The data input is being monitored by sampling all types of transactions from computer edit lists.  The new arrangements enable transactions to be traced to the individual responsible for the input badge used.  The edit lists will be retained for a number of years to provide a record of all computer transactions.</P>
      <P>A total of £18,034.50 was fraudulently obtained by the officers concerned.  Of this, £11,158.41 was recovered leaving a balance of £6,876.09 outstanding.  Credit balances in bank accounts used in connection with the fraud by the four officers convicted amounted to £243.93 only.</P>
      <P>The four officers concerned were convicted on the charges and they were dismissed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further sum of £498.45 was also identified as having been fraudulently <Col N="1468" /> obtained but no person has been made amenable for this crime.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a statement regarding the allegations concerning the Stationery Office where stock-taking carried out on 31 December 1985 disclosed large deficiencies in the stocks of certain types of paper alleged to amount to £100,000 which could not be reconciled thus involving a Garda investigation; if he will outline the internal controls in operation then and now; and the action in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The stock-take carried out in the Stationery Office as at 31 December 1985 revealed net deficiencies in paper stocks of £84,000.  These stocks had been located in lock-up warehouses at the North Wall to which the Stationery Office, through lack of adequate storage space in Beggars Bush, had been obliged to transfer part of its paper stocks in 1981.  The Garda were immediately notified of the discrepancies and an investigation commenced which is still on-going.</P>
      <P>At the time of the discovery of these discrepancies, it had been expected that the new purpose-built warehouse at Bishop Street would have been completed by mid-1986 and ready to accommodate all the paper and other stocks located in the main warehouse in Beggars Bush and the North Wall.  It became obvious during the early months of 1986 that completion and fitting out of the new warehouse would not be completed until 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this the management of the office decided that a series of intermittent spot checks of some of the paper codes would be taken for so long as it was necessary to continue using the North Wall premises.  Additional security measures were also introduced.  Full interim stock-taking involving the examination of as many as 500 stock lines in both the North Wall and Beggars Bush warehouses was impossible.  One such spot <Col N="1469" /> check undertaken in May 1986 revealed further discrepancies.</P>
    <P>The management of the Stationery Office decided that because of the continuing discrepancies which had been revealed, the fact that the Garda investigations were not completed and the general unsuitability of the North Wall warehouse for paper stocks, the premises would be vacated forthwith and the stocks transferred to Bishop Street in advance of the completion of the building. To do this it was necessary to secure urgent delivery of special pallets and stillages and to strength test both to accommodate the paper on the racking system in Bishop Street.  The stock transfer was completed in early July 1986.  An interim stock take was carried out at that time.</P>
    <P>The general stock-take as at end December 1986 revealed further losses of £38,000.  A comparison of the position then with the position in July showed that these discrepancies occurred while the stocks were in the North Wall premises.</P>
    <P>The spot checks initiated in 1986 will continue in Bishop Street until such time as Beggars Bush is vacated later this year and the total stocks are organised in Bishop Street.  At that stage it is intended that stock-takes will take place at quarterly intervals and spot checks at monthly intervals.  Computerisation of the office by October next will greatly facilitate the task not only of stock-takes but of stock management.</P>

    <P>Column (b)</P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends for example the 1979 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1979-80.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(ii)  Full time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished.  Accordingly the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>Column (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the net receipt of income tax from other self-employed tax units in each calendar year by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the taxpayer's pension from Bord na Móna is charged to tax under PAYE.  His invalidity pension is taxable under Schedule E by virtue of section 110 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and is paid gross by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is standard practice to collect the tax attributable to the invalidity pension by restricting the taxpayer's tax-free allowances under PAYE by the amount of that pension.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes wrote to the taxpayer in December, 1986 for the information required to enable his tax affairs to be brought up to date.  On receipt of this information the inspector will make any necessary adjustment of the taxpayer's tax-free allowances.</P>

      <P>The examination of stallions under the Horse Breeding Act, 1934, was purely clinical in order to confirm the absence of certain specified diseases or defects.  Since 1976 inspections for licensing have been carried out in conjuction with Bord na gCapall's inspection of stallions for inclusion in their register of approved stallions.  This latter inspection which involved consideration of conformation, soundness, movement, temperament, bone, etc., was more thorough and took into account information on progeny.  It was considered that the examination under the 1934 Act could, therefore, be dispensed with.  In the light of the budget decision on the financing of Bord na gCapall the position is now being considered further.</P>
      <P>Imported stallions, which are registered in the herd-book of their country of origin, may be included in the register of approved stallions if they meet the required standards at inspection.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who are permanently incapable of work and who satisfy the contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>One of the contribution conditions for invalidity pension is that a claimant, who has been in receipt of disability benefit for at least one year on the 6 April 1987, has qualifying contributions in respect of not less than 156 contribution weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Department's <Col N="1494" /> records there are only 42 such weeks of insurable employment registered in respect of the person concerned since his entry into insurance.  It was noted that the person concerned was insurably employed in Britain.  Details of his British insurance were requested from the British authorities.  This information has now been received in this Department, and it transpires that the claimant satisfies the contribution conditions for receipt of invalidity pension.  A pension claim form was issued to the person concerned on 2 April 1987.  On its return, duly completed, the claim will be dealt with without delay and the pension will be awarded from the original date of his application.</P>

      <P>A deed of transfer has been prepared for the property.  However, the social welfare officer is satisfied that the applicant, in drawing up this deed, is divesting herself of means in order to qualify for a pension and that the sum of £48.88 per week must be assessed against her on these grounds in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referred to the insurability of share fishermen.</P>
      <P>The insurability of share fishermen is provided for under paragraph 6 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, viz., &ldquo;Employment as a member of the crew of a fishing vessel where the employed person is wholly remunerated by a share in the profits or the gross earnings of the working of the vessel&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the PRSI contributions of all share fishermen have been collected via the owners of fishing trawlers through the combined PAYE-PRSI collection system operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>A High Court judgment of February 1986, in relation to the crew of a particular trawler, held that an employer-employee relationship based on a contract of service did not exist in that case and that the skipper (the skipper was also the owner in that case) and his crew were partners; and that the skipper was not then guilty of offences with which he had been charged under the PAYE-PRSI collection system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that in consequence of the court judgment certain other trawler owners may not have continued to operate the combined PAYE-PRSI collection system for income tax and PRSI contributions. In general, in any case where an owner and crew establish that the PAYE-PRSI collection system for income tax and PRSI contributions is not applicable to them, they will be accountable to the Revenue Commissioners for <Col N="1496" /> income tax under the appropriate schedule and direct to the Department of Social Welfare for the payment of the social insurance contributions under the Department's special collection system for non-PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In view of the changes and interpretations of the court judgment that are involved, the Department have sought the confirmation and advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the matter and these are expected shortly.  The Department will then contact the Irish Fishermen's Organisation to outline the position to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of an anomaly in the social welfare legislation whereby a number of people do not qualify for old age contributory pensions because of a change in legislation governing compulsory insurance introduced in 1953 which continued until 1974, as a result of which people do not qualify for old age contributory pensions because the 1953 legislation provided that people receiving a certain salary were not eligible to pay social insurance, and were unaware of their right to become voluntary contributors until it became too late; and if he will rectify the situation as has been recommended on two occasions by the Ombudsman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to old age contributory pension is that a person must have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions since 5 January 1953 or his entry into insurance, if later.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Ombudsman related to the fact that non-manual workers were prior to 1974, not compulsorily insurable whenever their income went over a certain limit.  This meant that such workers could have gaps in their insurance record unless they became voluntary contributors.  In some cases the gaps were such that persons did not have sufficient contributions to qualify for old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The income limit was abolished in 1974 and since that time all employed workers are compulsorily insured.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Ombudsman was specifically examined in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare which made proposals for dealing with the problem. I am reviewing this matter in the context of my overall consideration of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The special transitional payments were granted only to persons who suffered a reduction in their entitlements at the date of implementation of that particular phase of equality treatment in mid-November 1986.

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who have been incapable of work for at least one year and who are likely to remain permanently incapable of work, and who satisfy the contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>One of the contribution conditions for invalidity pension is that the claimant has qualifying contributions or credited contributions in respect of not fewer than 48 contribution weeks in the last complete contribution year before the date of the claim.</P>
      <P>The contribution year at present governing entitlement to invalidity pension is the period from April 1986 to April 1987.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the burden which high insurance costs impose on all sections of the motoring public and I intend to do everything practicable to alleviate this burden where possible.  I am particularly anxious to improve the position of young drivers.  However, the cost of insurance is directly related to the level of claims occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motor insurance industry in Ireland has had significant underwriting losses in recent years.  In the absence of a change in the underlying claims experience lower insurance rates for young drivers would mean higher rates for other categories of driver.  More mature drivers have been statistically proven to be safer drivers than their younger counterparts whose rates reflect the higher risk.  As the insurance supervisory authority, my primary responsibility is to ensure that companies are maintaining their solvency margins and reserve requirements.  I must, therefore, respect the right of insurers to charge economic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience. The initial loadings imposed on first time insureds and more specifically young drivers can be offset over time by earning a no-claim bonus.  The question of giving some credit to first time policyholders who have previously been insured on a named driver basis on another policy (e.g. their parents') and are accident free is being pursued with the insurance industry. Independently of this, a major insurance company has just introduced a scheme of accelerated no claims bonus for certain categories of younger drivers in order to reduce the amount payable by such drivers as quickly as possible following a safe driving record.  It is <Col N="1510" /> hoped that other companies may follow this lead.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that it is only when the number and cost of claims is reduced significantly in overall terms that it will be possible for insurance companies to consider reductions in premium levels.  To do this it will be necessary for the motoring public generally, and young motorists in particular, to improve standards of driving and road safety.</P>

Funds under this scheme are, however, reserved for remedying structural defects in groups of local authority houses and are not, accordingly, appropriate to the works proposed by the Council.  However, finance is available from my Department by way of unsubsidised loans to enable authorities to carry out improvements such as those <Col N="1524" /> the Council are proposing.

    <P>I should explain that under the Redundancy Payments Acts, the responsibility for payment of a statutory lump sum payment is a matter in the first instance for <Col N="1534" /> the employer concerned.  If the employer refuses or fails to make the payment within a reasonable time, an employee can apply to my Department for payment from the Redundancy and Employers; Insolvency Fund.  Such application must be supported by evidence of entitlement to a redundancy lump sum either in the form of a Redundancy Certificate (RP2) issued by the employer or, where entitlement is contested by the employer, a decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the employee's favour.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Qualification in Irish. &mdash; An applicant for registration must produce evidence of having a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  For the purpose of this regulation a competent knowledge of the Irish language shall mean the power to carry on through it ordinary intercourse with pupils and in the general life of the school; and to speak the language with such fluency and correctness as will afford a reasonable hope that the applicant will, with experience, be able to use it as a teaching medium.

      <P>The application for the provision of additional accommodation at Listellick national school.  Tralee, Co. Kerry, has been examined in detail in my Department.  The school enrols a large number of pupils from the town of Tralee.  As accommodation has already been provided for these pupils in the town schools, my Department do not consider that additional accommodation should be provided at the school.</P>
