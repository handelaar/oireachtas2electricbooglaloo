      <P>Yesterday afternoon I sought to move in Private Members' time item No. 4 on this morning's Order Paper, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987 and the <Col N="1305" /> Taoiseach requested that we defer that matter.  The matter has now been discussed and I wish to formally move that the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.  It is my understanding that if the Bill passes through Second Stage in Private Members' time it will then go to a special committee of this House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, to insert the following new sections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1)  The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the law: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States or within this State and which <Col N="1310" /> have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition, and in particular those which:</P>
    <P>(a)  directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;</P>
    <P>(b)  limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;</P>
    <P>(c)  share markets or sources of supply;</P>
    <P>(d)  apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;</P>
    <P>(e)  make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this section shall be automatically void and shall be an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Commission may declare the provisions of subsection (1) to be inapplicable in the case of:</P>
    <P>&mdash;any agreement or category of agreements between undertakings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;any decision or category of decisions by associations of undertakings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;any concerted practice or category of concerted practices;</P>
    <P>which contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, and which does not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  impose on the undertaking concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> (b)  afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question.</P>
    <P>6.&mdash;(1)  Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the State or in a substantial part of it is prohibited and shall be an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Such abuse referred to in subsection (1) of this section may, in particular, consist in&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions;</P>
    <P>(b)  limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;</P>
    <P>(c)  applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;</P>
    <P>(d)  making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.</P>
    <P>7.&mdash;Any act which is contrary to the terms of section 5 and section 6 of this Act shall be a wrong within the terms of the Civil Liability Act, 1961 and it shall be open to a court to grant damages to any person injured by such a wrong in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Liability Act, 1961.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have some written remarks which can be circulated to any Member who wants a copy.  The purpose of these amendments is to radically change Irish competition law.  Instead of relying on cumbersome investigative procedures to deal with individual abuses, the new provisions would ban abuse outright from the beginning.  Irish consumers pay higher prices for groceries than consumers in Northern Ireland.  This has been the finding <Col N="1312" /> of a recent ESRI study.</P>
    <P>Our industrial costs are also out of line with those of our competitors.  It is generally accepted that, this being the case, more competition is the best way to deal with the problem and bring down prices.  The high prices that exist in Ireland compared with other countries, in particular Northern Ireland, are evidence that the Irish law to promote competition is not working.  I expect this will be borne out when the Minister eventually publishes the Restrictive Practices Commission report on price differentials which, I believe, he has had in his possession for some weeks now.  The reason that our competition law is a failure is not hard to find.  Irish competition law, largely unreformed since the late fifties, is based on very cumbersome procedures. It takes a very long time, indeed, for action to be taken against an anti-competitive practice, such as price fixing.</P>
    <P>First, there must be a complaint from an individual or association.  Then there is a lengthy investigation by the examiner, or soon to be the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This investigation is quite substantial and the matter is then referred to the commission which conducts an investigation which is very similar to a court proceeding.  That having been considered, a report is prepared and presented to the Minister.  The Minister does not announce any decision on the matter until that report is printed, and the printing can frequently take six weeks or more.  If the Minister decides to go ahead with the matter, an order must be drafted and that can take a number of months.  Finally, when the order is drafted, it must be approved by both the Dáil and the Seanad.  Particularly in the case of the Dáil it can take quite a number of months before time is found for the debate in the Dáil on the order.</P>
    <P>The investigation by the commission can frequently take up to six months.  The examination of the matter by the Minister between the printing and other consideration of the issue can take a further three or four months.  The drafting of the order can take another three or four months and finding time to have the <Col N="1313" /> matter debated in the Dáil can take a further three or four months or six months.  This process alone can take up to three years from the time a complaint is made to action being taken to outlaw it.  Meanwhile, throughout the three year period, the practice complained of continues without hindrance.</P>
    <P>Even when this long process has been gone through there can still be other hitches. For instance, in April 1982 the Restrictive Practices Commission recommended the removal of the restriction on conveyancing and advertising by solicitors. That is more than five years ago. The Attorney General advised that these matters could not be dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce by an order under the Restrictive Practices Act because they affected the Solicitors Act and required an amendment to the Solicitors Act.  The Attorney's advice was that it would have to be dealt with by the Minister for Justice who is responsible for the Solicitors Act.</P>
    <P>The recommendation made in April 1982 in regard to conveyancing has now joined the very long queue in the Department of Justice for legislation awaiting the attention of the legal services in that Department.  Of course, competition policy is not a departmental priority for the Department of Justice.  It is a departmental priority for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department. The Restrictive Practices Commission report of 1982 on this matter is a virtual dead letter because another Department have to deal with the recommendation rather than the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have another amendment which will attempt to address that problem.</P>
    <P>There is another defect.  The orders, when eventually made, have too narrow a focus.  Even when an order is made it applies only to the limited sector or trade about which the original complaint was made.  Action on similar or analogous practices in other trades which have not been the subject of the specific investigation initiated by the complaint necessitates going through the entire cumbersome process all over again with <Col N="1314" /> a view to making further specific orders in regard to that other trade or activity.</P>
    <P>There is a fourth defect.  The law in regard to competition is unpredictable. In theory a practice may be banned simply because it is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  This is essentially a political and not a legal concept. What is unfair today might have been perfectly fair 50 or ten years ago or might be regarded as fair ten years from now.  Nobody can, therefore, predict with certainty what the Restrictive Practices Commission or the Minister might decide to be unfair in particular circumstances. This unpredictability is bad for business, as well as being bad for the consumer.  It is bad for business because unless people can predict exactly where they will stand on the basis of legal advice they cannot make investment decisions.  If having made investment decisions thinking a particular practice would not be banned as being unfair and subsequently it is banned on that basis &mdash; the Minister has complete freedom to do so because &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; is such a flexible concept &mdash; the investment made can be set at nought.  This amendment proposes that we should have a definite set of rules applying to all sectors which can be interpreted by lawyers or by officialdom on the basis of exemptions, so that people in any given area will know exactly where they stand in regard to certain arrangements on which they base investment decisions.</P>
    <P>My amendments are designed to remove from competition law those four defects, namely, the cumbersome nature of the process, the fact that the orders can only be made in respect of issues directly within the Minister's own remit and not other areas, the limited nature of the orders when eventually made in terms of sectors and the unpredictability of the criteria applying to the law.</P>
    <P>Although we have had restrictive practices legislation since the late fifties, only a tiny proportion of our economy has been subjected to any investigation under it.  Groceries and motor spirits are the only sectors upon which orders have been made in the past 15 years which are still in force.  Competition law is little more <Col N="1315" /> than an expensive sham.  The present Bill improves matters slightly in that it simplifies somewhat the administrative procedures for investigations but the four basic defects I outlined remain almost the same as ever.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a more radical approach.  I argue, and my amendments provide, that the best route to follow would be the precedent set by two other small European countries, Greece and Portugal.  They decided that rather than go to the trouble of devising unique national competition laws banning certain practices they would introduce the strong, effective and well-tried competition rules of the Treaty of Rome directly into Greek and Portuguese law. This is exactly what my amendments would do here.  The text of my amendments follows word for word, with minor adaptations, the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  Here in Ireland, as in the rest of the EC, the Treaty of Rome rules apply only to trade between one state and another.  In trading between Ireland and Britain, for example, one cannot engage in a restrictive practice without being in contravention of EC rules on competition. That does not apply to trade or transactions within Ireland.  In Greece and Portugal, on the other hand, the EC rules apply not only to commerce between those countries and others but within those countries themselves.  I should add that France is following a similar procedure in its new competition law.</P>
    <P>I believe this approach followed in full by Greece and Portugal, and partly by France, is better than the one we now have.  This is because the Treaty of Rome, unlike Irish law, imposes a general ban on specified restrictive or anticompetitive practices in whatever sector they are.  There is no need for investigations of particular sectors before a particular practice becomes illegal.  The rules apply uniformly to all sectors from the outset.  There is a procedure for exemptions for particular procedures or practices which can be shown to be of benefit to the consumer but these exemptions <Col N="1316" /> have to be individually granted. That is the exact reverse of the Irish position where all restrictive practices continue to be legal until they are individually banned.  Under EC rules all restrictive practices are banned until individually exempted.</P>
    <P>The change I am proposing is relatively simple.  Basically all that is needed is to incorporate the terms of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, as is done in my amendments.  If my amendments are accepted we will then have the benefit not only of these well-tested Articles but also of the large body of European case law elaborating their meaning in practical situations.  It would bring much needed certainty to our law.  Irish business would then be subject to the same rules in its domestic transactions as it already faces on export markets.  Resources currently devoted to lengthy inquiries and to the drafting of individual orders for individual sectors could then be diverted to the enforcement &mdash; this is what is lacking in Ireland &mdash; of a well established body of law.  Businessmen, rather than having to wonder whether a particular practice was going to be deemed &ldquo;fair&rdquo; or &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;, would then know where they stood.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the new law would then ban all arrangements to fix prices, to control the supply of goods or services, to share markets or to discriminate disproportionately between customers.  These are all practices which push up prices.  An outright ban along the lines of the Treaty of Rome and the lines of my amendment is the only way, in my view, to deal with these problems.  An objection may be raised that the administration of the exemption of certain arrangements under subsection (3) of my amendment would require an army of officials to scrutinise a mound of applications for exemption. This has not proved to be a problem in Europe.  The Commissioners responsible for competition policy, formerly Commissioner Andreissan, and now Commissioner Sutherland, have introduced two specific procedures to get around these difficulties.  I would recommend <Col N="1317" /> such procedures here to those responsible if these amendments are accepted.</P>
    <P>They have introduced a system of block exemptions for certain categories of agreement.  This removes a lot of paperwork. Commissioner Sutherland has for instance used this technique to exempt agreements concerned with or indeed cooperation, between firms.  He has also, I understand, exempted out of the block exemption procedure, agreements concerned with patents, know-how licensing and franchise agreements.  I understand that the block exemption procedure has been used quite effectively to remove any unnecessary paperwork in regard to categories of agreement which can <i>ab initio</i> be deemed not to be ones likely to be in conflict with the public interest. That is one process whereby unnecessary paperwork, unnecessary scrutinising of exemption applications, can be removed by simply saying there is no need to apply if you come within the terms of a specified block exemption.</P>
    <P>By introducing rules which people would have to find out whether they were contravening in some fashion; either by seeking legal advice, getting an exemption from the Minister or failing to get an exemption from the Minister &mdash; in which case they would know they had to modify the practice &mdash; there would be the fear that this would take a lot of time.  The fear would be that businessmen would be waiting and would be uncertain on what their position would be until the bureaucratic wheels had ground to their conclusion. To counter that problem the Commission have introduced a system of negative clearance.  If a firm applies to have a particular agreement or decision exempted there is a procedure whereby if they have no reply from the Commission within a given period &mdash; two months is the period they use &mdash; the agreement or decision is thereby automatically exempted.</P>
    <P>I understand also from inquiries I have made that the staff involved in the Commission, considering the size of the Community with which they are dealing, is at present proportionately no larger than <Col N="1318" /> the staff we have in competition policy, very ineffectively not because of the individuals concerned but because of the law in Ireland.  There are about 150 officials in the Commission dealing with the entire Community of 300 million people.  The number of officials dealing with competition policy here &mdash; dealing with the problems of three million people &mdash; would probably be larger proportionately than the Commission's staff.  I do not see that as being a particular difficulty if there is a will to overcome it.  I have indicated in the two recommendations I have made &mdash; one the system of negative clearance and the other the system of block exemptions &mdash; that any fears for the business community as to uncertainty or for the administration as to cost can be set at nought.</P>
    <P>In the context of an amendment like this we must look at the overall public interest and the interest of our economy. If the Irish economy is to grow, it must become more competitive.  Being competitive means having more and better competition.  Comfortable and cosy arrangements, whether in the services or in trade, that push up costs should be outlawed if we want our economy to grow.  If we want job creation in Ireland we must get out costs down, we must promote an atmosphere of survival in difficult conditions rather than of attempting to create cosy conditions by pushing up costs for others.  The protectionist mentality of traditional Irish industry and services must be eliminated. These amendments, unlike the existing law, would do just that.  They are a radical attempt to improve the competitiveness of the Irish economy and, therefore, are of central importance in the battle for job creation in Ireland.  I hope these amendments will have the support of the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain why there are two amendments rather than one.  One of the amendments provides that to engage in the practices listed would be both a criminal and a civil wrong.  In other words, there would be the possibility of the Minister or the enforcement authorities prosecuting a person for it and if it was done to the detriment of somebody else in the <Col N="1319" /> different dentists.</P>
    <P>The other amendment soley provides for it to be a civil wrong and does not provide for any criminal remedies.</P>
    <P>I would prefer, and probably the Minister would prefer the first approach, the one which provides for both civil and criminal sanctions to apply, or perhaps he might prefer only criminal remedies to apply, with no civil remedies at all.  I am not dogmatic about that matter.  I am not unduly concerned about which would be the appropriate one.  The Minister in this debate may be able to enlighten us from the expertise available to him in regard to enforcement whether it should be a combined criminal or legal sanction, solely criminal or solely civil.  The important thing is that certain practices should be banned <i>ab initio</i> in order that we can make our economy a great deal more competitive and our job creation drive a great deal more successful than it has been in the past.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague Deputy Bruton in relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  They signal a proposed new departure in relation to competition policy.  In my contribution on Second Stage I pointed out a number of areas where I was dissatisfied with current consumer practices in Ireland on the basis that consumer protection had developed primarily on EC directives or case law and that the effectiveness of some of the legislation at present was limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area I mentioned as being of greatest concern to me is that relating to professions.  As Deputy Bruton outlined in some detail, if one wants to change the process relating to existing areas where the Restrictive Practices Commission have conducted a study, such as the advertising ban by solicitors, one finds that it is an extremely slow and cumbersome process.  Surely there is a strong case for uniform treatment of the professions, whether it be architects, accountants, solicitors, or in the medical field, opticians, dentists, chiropodists or whoever.  Surely there should be some <Col N="1320" /> basic consumer rights.  First there should be some method by which the public would be entitled to elicit information to enable them to compare different levels of fees, some level of information in order to determine which was the most qualitative service.</P>
    <P>Subparagraphs (a) to (e) of amendment No. 1 clearly outline some of the practices being engaged in in these professions. For example the subparagraph reads:</P>
    <P>(a)  directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;</P>
    <P>Effectively they have a cartel in terms of fees.  In some areas it is unethical to charge more than a certain rate.  Certainly it is unethical to reveal publicly how much one is charging.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (b) reads:</P>
    <P>limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;</P>
    <P>It is true that, in most cases, if one examines the third level educational requirements of some of these professions, one finds that they are in some way regulated by the profession itself.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties at present being encountered is that there is a myriad of different bureaucracies, Departments, dealing with these different professions. Each of them goes in for special pleading. Each can produce very eloquent, articulate, cases to defend their particular restrictive practice.  The unarguable case is that 3.5 million consumers &mdash; on the basis of the lowest common denominator &mdash; have certain rights from these professions. What Deputy Bruton is trying to ensure here is the best way to go about this.  If this House were to take, in a piecemeal fashion, each profession, each idiosyncrasy, each exemption, we would make no progress whatsoever.  I see no difference between one profession and another.  There is a basic right to information in relation to fees and services. This would mean that if I wanted to have a tooth extracted, or a filling done by a dentist.  I could compare the price and service available between four or five <Col N="1321" /> trade, they could sue and get damages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to a very important aspect which is that, if we raise competition standards in professions, and right across industry generally, it will improve our export potential.  One of the major changes taking place is the potential export of the professions, particularly, architecture, quantity-surveying and so on, because of the advances made in information technology whereby, over a telephone line and a facsimile machine, one can relay the tendering for professional services right across the world. There is an unarguable case that, if Ireland is to participate in the opening up of export market potential in the professions, we should have some competitive basis on which to operate at home.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House unduly because there will be cross dialogue in relation to these amendments. However, I should like to develop further the last point to which Deputy Bruton referred, that is, whether it should be the civil or criminal law which should be invoked.  I would have a strong preference for the civil law being the process through which this could be pursued. Whether it be Muriel Scorer in the building societies, or in another area where someone wants to ensure fair play, a new entrant to a particular profession, it should be left to individuals, through case law, to find their own level of dissatisfaction and subsequent enforcement through the courts.  What I am saying is that, because of the current restrictions &mdash; and recently I had parliamentary questions down about staffing levels for the previous offices of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, and that of the new office &mdash; I am satisfied that there are not adequate resources available to ensure proper staffing.  As was the case under the provisions of the Supply of Services and Sale of Goods Act, 1980, what this House passed is great in theory but, in practice, can be limited enough.  If people have recourse to the civil law to get fair competition, fair trading, to get adequate levels of information in relation to these <Col N="1322" /> professions, that represents the best way to proceed.  Therefore, I support this amendment with that particular emphasis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating, who spoke on Second Stage, is unable to be here today so I am taking over for him temporarily.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 seem to me to reflect very much the thinking on which Deputy Keating elaborated on on Second Stage and also that of the Progressive Democrats on this issue.  It seems to me to be a mistake, a missed opportunity, to go ahead with this Bill without giving serious consideration to the incorporation of a prohibition principle, as opposed to control of abuse, seeing that it is the principle which is invoked almost entirely throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>On the system as it stands, and that proposed under the terms of the Bill, I would contend that it has an over-dependence on complaints being made; certainly to date it had that dependence.  It definitely was a cumbersome procedure, very slow, with many problems being encountered along the way, abuses and restrictions being removed only because of the complaints, if any, that are lodged. I realise that, under the terms of this Bill, the powers of the commission and of the director are being widened to enable them to make inquiries on their own behalf.  I would still contend that it is tinkering with the essence of consumer law here.  In terms of consumer rights it is fairer to put the onus on the undertaking or business concerned to ensure that they are not putting the consumer at a disadvantage.  I do not see why that onus should be put on the consumer.  The consumer is an individual and has very little strength compared with the cartels, businesses and professions who get together and incorporate restrictive practices into their respective activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Second Stage debate the Minister referred to what is now being proposed by Deputy Bruton, and to which Deputy Keating referred in the course of that debate, as being a more costly procedure.  He left it at that without <Col N="1323" /> giving any further explanation.  I should like to hear the Minister elaborate on exactly how much more costly it would be and whether, in the long run, it would not be more cost-effective.  What was said by Deputy Bruton about the fact that the staff would be involved in enforcement rather than inquiry could make quite a difference to the effectiveness of the provisions of this Bill.  I see no point in putting more legislation on the books that is almost impossible to police and enforce.</P>
    <P>It is important also to have regard to our relationship with Europe which is changing amd moving towards closer harmony after the Single European Act.  In particular, we are moving towards 1992 when we are supposed to have total harmony in many areas.  I see it as a retrograde step to single out this consumer legislation for keeping us apart from the mainstream in Europe.  I realise that Britain has a system which is akin to the one suggested here and that we have been operating to a certain extent.  But even they insist that any restrictive agreements be registered and the vast majority of them are, in fact, disallowed.  So it seems to me that they have gone some way towards implementing a prohibition approach.</P>
    <P>We need a fundamental, radical change in our approach.  We have been given an opportunity here with new legislation being introduced.  If this amendment is not allowed, we will have lost that opportunity for a considerable length of time.  It will mean that the onus is put on the consumer and on the director and the commission who simply cannot keep up with the amount of work involved in pinpointing every different area of abuse.</P>
    <P>Tinkering with the system also leaves a huge amount of uncertainty for business, trade, industry and consumers.  It simply is detrimental to consumer legislation.  It encourages it to be ineffective.  The kind of restrictive practices such as price fixing, withholding of supplies, market sharing etc. which we have seen here are <Col N="1324" /> to the detriment of the consumer.  One example which comes to mind immediately in the circumstances we see surrounding the B &amp; I debacle is the cartel that operated on the Irish Sea for so long. That simply would be outlawed if this amendment were introduced and, as a result, the consumer would have basic protection afforded to him.  The companies involved, if they found it too onerous or if they felt that it was detrimental to trade, would have it open to them to make an application.</P>
    <P>There simply will never be a real change in approach to the rights of consumers if we do not switch to at least some element of the prohibition approach.  Some of the areas have already been mentioned here today &mdash; professions, trade, business of any kind, each having its restrictive practices operating. The director and the commission will never get around to examining them all and reporting on them all.  It would be far simpler to implement a prohibition approach.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say a word on the alternative amendments which are being offered.  The first is to involve both civil and criminal law.  While I note what Deputy Yates says about confining it to the civil law, I think it could well be important to keep both the civil and criminal law possibilities there because, whereas the consumer is entitled to find his own level and to establish what his rights are under the civil law, the ultimate sanction should be there for the Minister, for the commission and the director to stamp the common good on the implementation of this legislation so that if somebody is blatantly entering into restrictive practices which are outlawed under this amendment, the full sanction of the criminal law will be there if it is necessary to use it.  I have not given a lot of thought to it but I believe instinctively that that would be the right thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that I welcome the contributions on these amendments.  Just in case the impression might be created that the acceptance of <Col N="1325" /> these two amendments will solve our uncompetitive situation in the Irish economy and reduce the cost differences between North and South, let me say that is far from reality.  If it were as simple as that and we could solve all the uncompetitive aspects of this economy by passing just two amendments into legislation, the Government would be only too delighted to do it.  It is not as simple as that.</P>
      <P>Basically, there is a vast differential in taxation and indirect taxation between North and South which contributes to a fair extent to the differential in price which causes disadvantages in operating in the Irish economy as against in the North of Ireland economy.  There have been many <i>ad hoc</i> surveys done, not indepth surveys, as to what the cost differentials are.  A more recent one on RTE was not comparing like with like.  It compared a small cash and carry in northwest Donegal with a major cash and carry in Belfast.  The report Deputy Bruton referred to is at the printers and it will be published soon, and it will not show these vast differentials; it will show a survey which spreads over a wide number of items, not hand picking certain items. There is a cost differential and it will not be solved by the acceptance of two amendments here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic argument is between the advantages and disadvantages of the prohibition system and the control of abuse system.  Let me say at the outset that I have looked at this.  It was mentioned on Second Stage here by Deputy Bruton.  As I see it, the disadvantages attaching to the prohibition system are that it is inflexible and costly to administer.  I will go into details as I go through it.  It requires specialist staff to administer, and this has been the experience in Europe where we took a look at it in the short time since Second Stage.  There is no question in my mind whatsoever but that, rather than creating a better environment for industry and business, it creates uncertainty. The backlog of applications which has been experienced in Europe shows that it causes great uncertainty and business does not thrive in an uncertain climate. <Col N="1326" /> There is no question but that they want to get on with their business.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to change the whole basis of competition legislation in Ireland.  It is a fundamental, basic change that is being asked for here from the control of abuse system which we currently have to the prohibition system.  Under the existing system of competition policy in Ireland there is no outright prohibition on restrictive practices. Rather, the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides a schedule of unfair practices to which the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Restrictive Practices Commission must have regard in carrying out investigations.  The commission may recommend to the Minister that he should make an order prohibiting certain practices relating to an area where they held a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The orders made under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, are therefore confined at present to areas that have been examined by the commission.  It should be noted, however, that under section 8 of this Bill the Minister will in future have power to make restrictive practices orders on his own initiative, subject to consultation with the Fair Trade Commission and with any other Minister concerned. I would remind the House that rather than take on board the suggestion that it takes three years to do so, in February this year there was a report on below cost selling and the banning of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;.  I signed the order in May.  Rather than looking at the Restrictive Practices Commission, we should look at this House.  The confirmation legislation did not pass here until last week; yet this order was signed on 27 May.  Rather than point the finger elsewhere, we should look at ourselves in this House to see if we can improve the situation.  Here in this House only last Friday, Deputy Bruton made a suggestion to me in relation to streamlining that system, and we will have an interesting discussion on that later on.  Anything that can help to streamline it and make it more effective will be very welcome.</P>
    <P>The wording used in the proposed <Col N="1327" /> amendment is taken basically from Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. They generally prohibit all agreements or concerted practices which are likely to distort competition in trade between member states, unless the restrictive elements in these agreements or practices are offset by results beneficial in the long run to the consumer.  Article 86 prohibits the improper exploitation of a dominant position in the market place.  These rules apply generally to trade although special provisions apply in certain areas such as agriculture and transport.</P>
    <P>While the prohibition system may be more desirable in principle than our own control of abuse system, in practice it has many disadvantages attached to it.  Under the EC system companies must seek clearance for any agreement or undertakings which they enter into with others because of the blanket ban on all restrictive practices.  The huge volume of agreements notified to the EC Commission for clearance has meant there are long delays in dealing with individual cases.</P>
    <P>This has resulted in temporary negative clearances, or letters of comfort being granted to the companies involved.</P>
    <P>Letters of comfort are temporary, informal approvals which have no legal standing.  If this system is to be introduced here, the same problems may be anticipated. In times of scarce resources it is difficult to justify the extra funding which would be required to police such a system.  Experience has shown that the inflexibility inherent in the prohibition system can be a major disadvantage in economic terms whereas the control of abuse system, properly streamlined &mdash; and this Bill sets out to bring this about &mdash; can be more satisfactory using existing resources and having regard to particular priority areas at any given point in time.</P>
    <P>I take on board the point made in relation to the professions.  I would remind the House that a report was published recently in relation to the accountancy profession, that one in relation to the engineering profession is almost completed and that at present an investigation is going on into the legal profession.  I <Col N="1328" /> know that Deputy Bruton referred to changes in the Solicitors' Act but that would be more appropriate to the Department of Justice.  I would not disagree with him in his views, but this is not the appropriate place in which to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>The control of abuse system is much less onerous in terms of policing and deployment of resources.  If the Minister feels that unfair practices exist in any area, he may require the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out an inquiry and on foot of their recommendations any unfair practices which are found to exist may be outlawed.  Twenty six restrictive practices orders have been made since the first legislation in this area was passed in 1953.  These orders outlaw a number of restrictive practices and cover a whole range of sectors within the commercial field.  It is worth nothing that failure to comply with the restrictive practices order will make a person liable, not only to criminal sanctions, but also to civil sanctions.  Besides the criminal offences provided for in the legislation which are at present prosecuted by the Minister and will in future be prosecuted by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, the 1972 Restrictive Practices Act also provided for a right of civil action by any person.  Under section 19 of that Act any person can apply to the High Court for an order to enforce compliance with the restrictive practices order.</P>
    <P>The first suggestion that Irish law should be changed from the control of abuse system to a prohibition basis is not new.  Indeed, it was made by the Restrictive Practices Commission in a 1977 study, a study and analysis of the legislation and competition policy in Ireland in the light of economic and social changes taking place in the economy. This suggestion was considered at the time but it felt that a prohibition system would be much more costly in terms of staff required to enforce it, particularly if it were to be accompanied, as suggested, by a mandatory notification procedure.</P>
    <P>Article 85 on which this amendment is modelled is so widely worded that it can <Col N="1329" /> be applied to horizontal agreements, price fixing and market sharing and vertical agreements concerning distribution, licensing and franchise.  It provides for the automatic nullity of all agreements which it prohibits.  There is a danger that its application could deprive of validity a vast number of agreements which are completely innocent in the sense that the restrictions they impose on the parties are not anti-competitive and may even be in the interest of competition.  The process of notifying agreements to the Commission with request for exemption from prohibition has resulted in great delays in establishing whether agreements are in breach of Articles 85 and 86.</P>
    <P>Critics of the system have complained that while an estimated over 30,000 agreements had been notified at one stage, only 22 or so had been given negative clearances, less than 40 had got individual exemptions and most of the rest were in a sort of legal limbo.  Since then, criticism of the inflexibility of the EC system, particularly from the representative body for industry in the Community, has, if anything, increased.  In response to this criticism, the Commission have in recent years embarked on a course of exempting whole sectors from the scope of the general prohibition by means of, first, special regulations which have been adopted in respect of <i>inter alia</i> exclusive purchasing agreements, exclusive distribution agreements, specialisation agreements and motor dealerships and, secondly, issuing comfort letters in individual cases giving provisional sanction to agreements, although it has been pointed out by the representative body for industry in the Community that these letters have no legal basis and are therefore of little practical use to the company concerned.  Anybody would appreciate that the uncertainty of this legal limbo is not an atmosphere in which any business can thrive.  It is not conducive to a good business environment.</P>
    <P>Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty are in any case already binding in this country by virtue of our membership of the EC. <Col N="1330" /> In general, the concern of the Commission would be to ensure free competition between member states.  Articles 85 and 86 would also have application in a domestic context.  The EC Commission would be entitled to intervene if it felt that arrangements existed in Ireland which were contrary to the Treaty.  For example, Article 85 refers to agreements which may affect trade between member states.  If the Commission were of the opinion that an agreement which existed here should have an adverse effect on Community trade generally, they could take action under Article 85.  In addition, a private individual or a business enterprise would be entitled to take a court action for a breach of EC rules and the Irish courts would have to have regard to Articles 85 and 86 when coming to a decision in relation to any purported restrictive trade practice or abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred on Second Stage to the competition laws of Greece which are modelled on Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and recommended that we should follow Greece's example, or at least examine it.  Some research has been carried out in the Department into the Greek system although, as I am sure the Deputy would appreciate, this has not been a very detailed examination because of the short time available.  Information obtained from the Greek authorities shows that a highly specialised staff are required to administer this legislation and that, in fact, the person largely responsible for implementing the legislation in Greece is on secondment from the EC Commission.  Apparently, although the laws have been in force since 1977, they have not been used on more than a dozen occasions per year, largely because lawyers were unaware of their implications.</P>
    <P>The new measures being introduced under this Bill should speed up the investigatory process and thus make the legislation more efficient and effective, which is the basic thrust behind this legislation. I would remind the House that I did not draft this legislation.  I took it on board when I came into office.  I certainly have <Col N="1331" /> not lost any time in the interests of consumers in taking any action that was open to me.  If I had not been held up so much in this House as I have been, I might have been able to achieve more.  The sooner this Bill gets on to the Statute Book, the better.  There are many complaints in relation to banking charges, professions and so on and the sooner I can deal with the exemptions which have been in the existing legislation the sooner I shall be able to take action.</P>
    <P>The beneficial results of increasing the membership of the Restrictive Practices Commission to three full time members is reflected in the fact that five reports of investigations have been received from them over the past 15 months.  In particular, the commission's report of the inquiry into the accountancy profession has been published in the last few weeks and in addition, a report on the commission's inquiry into the engineering profession will be published in the next two to three weeks.  Finally, when the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade gets the power of prosecution under competition legislation and the scope of competition legislation is extended to include electricity, banking and communications, many areas will be investigated and the control of abuse system will be seen to be far more efficient than it has been up to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. That is most satisfactory.  I trust that the <Col N="1332" /> commission will take account of the statements that have been made by Deputies Colley, Yates and myself and, of course, by the Minister on the other side of the argument in this debate.  It is fair to say that the debate on both sides has been a very good one.  The Minister has raised a number of valuable points to which I should like to respond.</P>
      <P>As I said originally, the commission have been conscious of the difficulties that might arise in regard to delays.  They have deliberately introduced procedures to overcome the difficulties in question.  I refer to the negative clearance procedure and the procedure of block exemptions. I might suggest that in the event that the commission decide to recommend in favour of a prohibition system, or even decide to recommend against it, but want to deal with the prohibition system as giving the Minister the option to go for that system, they might, as part of the study the Minister has indicated will be undertaken at his request, look at what would be the appropriate block exemptions. In this way the Minister would get a package containing a recommendation for the incorporation of Articles 85 and 86 into Irish law, plus a package of block exemptions so that a number of practices would be exempted <i>ab initio</i> rather than have the Minister having to come in subsequently and say that he has made certain other exemptions.  That may not get over all of the difficulties but it could get over some of the difficulties to which the Minister referred in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question relates to the highly specialised staff and the size of the staff. My contacts in Brussels have given me slightly different impressions to the ones given by the Minister.  As I have said the number of professional staff in the Commission, who deal with this matter for the entire Community as distinct from the logistical support, amounts to 150.  I accept that is not directly comparable with Ireland in the sense that one deals with very big cases in the Commission whereas here one would be dealing with individual agreements, for instance, between publicans in one town, that they <Col N="1333" /> would all put up their prices on a particular day.  I have to concede to the Minister that there are differences of scale.  A staff of 150 is not a large staff to deal with a population of 300 million in Europe.  In fact, it is quite small.  I accept the point which the Minister made that it is highly undesirable that business agreements should be in a form of legal limbo and before one could adopt an amendment along the lines I am proposing one would have to be satisfied that that difficulty could be overcome.  Perhaps the Minister could ask the Commission to look at that aspect of it.  There appears to have been a very strong objection made on his behalf in regard to it. Nobody wishes to create uncertainty.</P>
    <P>There is always a case for saying that the best is sometimes the enemy of the good.  There is no doubt that if one seeks absolute perfection and no difficulties in the administration of this legislation one would probably never introduce it.  On the other hand, one must remember that there are many cosy arrangements and excesses charging in the Irish economy which are going to continue despite the improvements which have been referred to and despite the willingness of the Minister to take action quickly in regard to any matter which may be brought to his attention simply because, as Deputy Colley rightly pointed out, of a lack of information.  At present somebody has to go out to find the abuse, report on it and then go through this process of dealing with it.  That puts the onus on the Minister, his officials and agencies, with the aid of the public, to find the abuse.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this amendment would put the onus on the people who are engaged in business arrangements to make sure that they comply with the law. That would mean that many practices which one may be completely unaware of at present which are effectively putting up prices would be eliminated simply by the publication of this Bill as people would take evasive action to put themselves on the right side of the law without it ever coming to the attention of anybody, be they the Minister or his officials. One of the advantages of the prohibition <Col N="1334" /> system is that it has a pervasive effect, some of which is invisible in terms of commercial practice.  I ask that the commission in looking at this issue, as the Minister has agreed, not simply to concentrate on the disadvantages but rather at the big picture and the very substantial advantages which will flow from an arrangement along these lines.</P>
    <P>I will not comment in detail on the Greek system.  The Minister made a case that could conceivably be seen as being a little bit contradictory, although I do not think it is, in that he said it took a large staff to deal with this matter but then said there was only one person from the Commission dealing with this matter in Greece.  Admittedly, he did qualify that by saying that there was not very much happening.  Perhaps that is because the Greek public have changed their practices and the Minister the next time he is in that part of the world on business might personally investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>Portugal is Portugal and they are equally attractive.  As I have said, the French are doing it and, as the Minister probably knows, the British operate a notification procedure through their Office of Fair Trading, where certain categories of agreements have to be notified.  That is not based on exactly the same principle as this but it is similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment the Minister has given to ask the Restrictive Practices Commission to conduct an inquiry into this subject.  This debate has, therefore, served a very useful purpose.  I do not think realistically one could expect the Minister in a debate such as this &mdash; even if he was entirely happy with the purposes of this amendment which he is not as yet &mdash; simply to accept the amendment and put it into law without some further inquiry.  The Minister in agreeing to ask the Restrictive Practices Commission to conduct an inquiry, which I can assure him I will follow with interest, has been quite forthcoming in response to the amendments.  I am glad of that <Col N="1335" /> and, therefore, I do not wish to press the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments in regard to the Minister's reply.  I also appreciate the fact that he has committed himself to requesting the Restrictive Practices Commission, soon to be known as the Fair Trade Commission, to investigate the possibilities of incorporating one of these amendments or something like it in legislation.  I note the points he made about the difficulties involved, certainly in the initial stages, when a change is made in such a drastic way to the prohibition principle.  I suggest that these delays are part of the settingup procedure and that they need not necessarily continue once it has been set up.  Those difficulties could be suitably addressed if one did decide to switch to the prohibition principle.</P>
      <P>One of the elements which could help would be to provide block exemptions, to which Deputy Bruton referred.  I see some possibilities in that.  The Minister also referred to delays in introducing legislation.  On a party political point, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this House only sat until 26 June and then adjourned until 14 October.  There was no necessity for that to happen.  If legislation is on the stocks I will be very happy to sit further into the summer to continue the work we were elected to do.  I know there is a very heavy legislative schedule for this week and next week and I would encourage the Minister and the Government to enable the Dáil to deal with that in a more businesslike fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognising what the Minister said about uncertainty in business, about making things rather difficult for business interests to carry on their trade or manufacturing business, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is consumer protection legislation. There is no doubt that there is a difficulty in one Minister having responsibility for both the encouragement of industry and the protection of consumers.  Whereas I think the Minister is not necessarily at <Col N="1336" /> fault, I would see that in principle there is a difficulty.  This came out very particularly here.  I have to ask which is the priority in the Minister's mind in this legislation.  Is it the protection of the consumer or the protection of business interests?  I say that it should be the protection of the consumer.  While there are changes being made in this legislation which will make the procedures more effective and faster to implement, which will make it easier all round, the basic underlying fact is that it will still be nibbling at the edges.  It will not tackle the basic rights that consumers are entitled to.  I suggest that it would be very difficult for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go about providing that.  I ask the Minister to consider that and the other difficulties that are involved and to acknowledge them and perhaps ask another Minister to take responsibility for consumer interests.  I do not know which Department might be more appropriate but there is a difficulty here and it should be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points about which I feel very strongly but I shall not labour them.  Basically, the Minister said he was against prohibition because it would lead to uncertainty, that it would be costly and excessively bureaucratic. Perhaps I should preface my remarks by saying that I very much welcome the fact that the Restrictive Practices Commission are going to look into the whole area of competition, regulations and framework superstructure.  Perhaps they will look at the Official Report in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am totally dissatisfied with the situation at present.  The Minister alluded to the quick response he made in this House in dealing with the ban on below cost selling.  I would contrast that with the report of the RPC in April 1982 on advertising by solicitors and on the restrictions on conveyancing.  It irked me no end to hear the Minister say that that is a matter for the Department of Justice, that it has nothing to do with him.  The Minister has responsibility for consumer affairs and consumer protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in <Col N="1337" /> later amendments.  That is why I did not proceed any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly believe that Deputy Colley is right in saying that it is not appropriate that any Department should have responsibilities other than for consumer affairs.  I said on Second Stage that there is a strong case for the establishment for a limited period in political terms of the office of a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for consumer affairs, a Minister who would go through each Department, whether it be the Department of Health who deal with dentists and opticians or the Department of Justice &mdash; in whom I have no confidence because of the quick way they would bring forward legislation &mdash; who deal with solicitors.  It is vital that someone be given a task force job with an inter departmental brief to bring this forward and to get a new deal for consumers.  It is no good for the Minister to come in and say that the RPC have made a recommendation about accountants and that there is one on engineering on the way because those reports tend to gather dust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Only last Sunday I spoke to someone who talked in terms of business being choked by the uncertainty and extra bureaucracy which Deputy Bruton's amendment would bring into being. To put the matter in perspective, I spoke to someone the other day who is setting up a retail business.  He has had to pay £250 to an architect to apply for change of use for planning permission.  He will have to pay between £500 and £1,000 a year to an accountant to comply with State requirements and he has had to pay another £500 to a solicitor for contracts of employment to oversee a lease on the property etc.  Therefore, people incur expenditure of thousands of pounds when they set up small businesses that may have a very limited turnover.  They have <Col N="1338" /> to pay grossly excessive fees because of a lack of proper competition.  I am not saying that this applies universally, that everybody is over-charging.  What I am saying is that the public have a basic right to two factors.  First, there should be no cartel in a local town or county area whereby there would be insufficient numbers of doctors, dentists, architects or solicitors and no proper competition. Secondly, they should be able to shop around and get quotations and in certain cases displays of prices should be available. Until such time as that is the case we will not have satisfaction in this area.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister when he is replying to the section &mdash; and I am sure we will not be dealing with it for too much longer in view of his commitment to set up an RPC investigation into it &mdash; to say if he considers he has any responsibility for the implementation of RPC reports.  He has responsibility for consumer protection even though the legislation, as this House operates, may be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice under the Solicitors Act or the Minister for Health under the Dental Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly that the expediting of this process would be greatly facilitated by this amendment and I hope that the RPC will recommend the uniform changes which Deputy Bruton is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few quick comments in relation to the points made.  Nobody should have any doubt as to where I stand in relation to the consumer.  I have set out specifically and made it my priority to get a better deal for the consumer and I will continue to do so.  I hope I will get the full support of this House in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see a conflict of interest by being the Minister for Industry and Commerce and having responsibility for consumer affairs.  This Bill is complete <Col N="1339" /> because the two autonomous bodies &mdash; Director of Consumer Affairs and the Fair Trades Commissioner &mdash; will be totally independent and removed from the Minister and they will be able to carry on their business in that fashion.  I was not in any way referring to the protection of business interests when I spoke in this debate.  I am interested in an efficient industrial base, a competitive Irish economy and I have to be concerned about anything that adversely affects that.  My information is that the delays in Europe are on the increase, not on the decrease. However, I have already given a commitment to the House that I will refer the matter to the Examiner to have a look at it.  I do not think it should be dealt with here by way of amendment, it is too fundamental for that.  It will be referred immediately for examination and we can debate it further in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other points raised by Deputy Yates, I have a responsibility to ensure the best deal for everybody and I will certainly do everything I can in that respect but I cannot overturn every piece of legislation, as we will find later when we deal with other amendments.  I will certainly improve legislation in any way I can in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to lengthen the discussion but I should like to give one or two quotations from Commissioner Sutherland, who is responsible for competition policy in Brussels, and which are relevant to this.  The exemption procedures are quite new and, therefore, it would be wrong to come to the conclusion that they will not deal with the backlog until they have been in operation for some time.  I want to quote from a speech made by Commissioner Sutherland on 21 May this year when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1986, the Commission adopted a new notice on agreements of minor importance, the purpose of which is to indicate to undertakings which agreements the Commission considers, by virtue of their impact on competition within the common <Col N="1340" /> market and on trade between Member States, not to fall within the scope of Article 85 (1).  The new notice, will relieve many small and medium enterprises of the burden of notifying their agreements and will facilitate cooperation between them.  More importantly still, it will give them legal security in the conduct of their operations.</P>
    <P>I believe that the process outlined by the Commissioner can be followed here if we go along the lines of the amendment.</P>
    <P>In the same speech Commissioner Sutherland said in regard to the desirability of incorporating EC rules into domestic law which my amendment also proposes:</P>
    <P>...I have on various occasions emphasised, as I do again today, both my personal commitment and that of the Commission as a whole to encourage more frequent ... application of Articles 85 and 86 by national courts.  Several reasons underline this policy: (1) a more frequent application of the competition rules on a national level would lead to a greater awareness of the Community rules on the part of the citizen of the Community; (2) given the physical and psychological proximity of national courts, decentralised application would often provide a quicker and more efficient solution in cases where the competition rules apply; (3) a further desirable consequence of decentralised application is that the Commission's workload would no longer include cases which do not pose any particular complicated or novel legal or economic issues ...</P>
    <P>It looks as if the Commission want us to move in that direction.  A further difficulty was raised by Commissioner Sutherland in a speech on 17 October last year.  In the course of that he said:</P>
    <P>Cases involving Community competition law do not appear to involve any special or unusual obstacles over and above those inherent in any commercial legislation.  However, it is possible <Col N="1341" /> that litigants might encounter difficulties in gathering evidence outside the jurisdiction.  Proof of interstate trade might also prove a problem.</P>
    <P>If my amendment was adopted we would not have to prove interstate trade, it would apply to internal transactions.  One of the obstacles in the way of enforcing existing Community law would be removed in that the interstate trade requirement would no longer apply.  Not only would my amendment make our competition law more effective, it would also make EC competition law more effective within our jurisdiction because the interstate trade test would not apply. I hope the Restrictive Practices Commission will take account of those arguments when considering the matter.  In view of the Minister's assurance that this will be investigated by that body I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an aversion to sloppy terms which can be interpreted by anybody to ban almost anything to suit themselves, depending on the mood at the moment.  While I accept that our present procedures are so cumbersome that nobody is going to do anything overnight there is this element of uncertainty contained in the law.  I acknowledge that this is simply a rewriting of legislation that is in existence and that there is nothing new in it but that does not mean we should not debate the provision to see if it is right.  If the law is to become more active, as we hope it will, then deficiencies that might have laid at the <Col N="1342" /> heart of the legislation for years and cause no problem could become a problem.  For instance, in subsection (b) it should be sufficient to say &ldquo;prohibit unfair methods of competition (whether or not relating to price)&rdquo;.  I do not think there is any need for the words &ldquo;unfair practices or&rdquo;. If they do not involve competition, what sort of unfairness are we pursuing?</P>
      <P>It could be argued that one business is more efficient than another because the owner of one spends all his time communing with nature, thinking of the finer things of life and developing other aspects of his personality while the other owner is a workaholic.  It could be argued that it is unfair that one should succeed to the detriment of the other.  I accept that that is not what the Commission will look at but if we put in unfairness, which is almost a moral concept, we are getting into an area where God only knows what is going to be decided.  I do not think that is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a similar difficulty with subsection (c) under which the Minister is entitled to make any provision he thinks necessary to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods or the provision of services.  I know what the Minister intends by that but what is &ldquo;equitable&rdquo;? We are all for such terms as social justice and so on at election time but what do they mean in practice?  How can any businessman predict what Deputy Reynolds will consider equitable as against what Deputy Colley will consider equitable? Nobody knows in advance and that is the difficulty about the uncertainty of that law.  I am all for equity and social justice but we are talking about creating criminal offences if certain actions are not deemed to be in accordance with the Minister's interpretation of what equitable means.  In my view we should aim to be more precise and say exactly what we are getting at.  It should be related to unfair competition which has the effect of pushing up costs to the consumer or creating a monopoly by oppressive practices which need not in the medium term lead to higher prices for the consumer. That would allow a ban on below-cost <Col N="1343" /> selling, although it would not indirectly affect prices in that it could be argued that in the long term below-cost selling restricts competition by getting rid of others and allowing a concentration to arise.  Ultimately, the latter will lead to higher prices for the consumer.</P>
    <P>My argument is that the provision in section 8 should be more narrowly and specifically focused on practices which lead to higher prices now or at some foreseeable time if they are allowed to continue rather than a reference to unfair practices, equity and so on which gives the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to do what he likes.  I do not think the Minister should be given <i>carte blanche</i> in any matter and I am not so sure he would want that.  In my view he would prefer to be operating within more precise rules.</P>

      <P>The normal interpretation of &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; is treating like with like.  We could argue all day what the definition should be but we must ensure that the legislation is not limited in its application.  On the other hand, &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; is a word that has become synonymous with competition legislation here.  In the Third Schedule to the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, under the heading &ldquo;unfair practices&rdquo; there is a long definition of what to take into account in determining what is unfair.  That basically is the reason for the inclusion of it.  We will come to it later.</P>

It gives such a wide area of possible legislation by the Minister that people in trade have no means of predicting what way the cat is going to jump, so to speak, <Col N="1344" /> and if they are making investments they should have.  There is a problem in that area which the Minister might look at.</P>

      <P>This section introduces for the first time the area of competition going into industrial relations.  Hitherto it was impossible for the Restrictive Practices Commission in any circumstances to examine a service provided under a contract of employment.  Obviously, one does not want to have competition investigations taking place willy-nilly independently of the Government's overall industrial relations policy in regard to uncompetitive practices which might exist in one place which would have the effect of increasing prices and costs. There is a safeguard in this section which provides that such an inquiry would be undertaken only with the consent of the Minister for Labour.  However, I hope the Minister would judicially and carefully, in consultation with the Minister for Labour, allow the powers of this section to be used to supplement any industrial relations reforms brought forward by the Government.</P>

    <P>Not every circumstance of industrial relations can be envisaged in any legislation that the Government might bring forward.  Therefore, the possibility of an independent investigation such as this would be useful to look at particular <Col N="1345" /> issues where there is a dispute between one side and the other as to whether a practice is contrary to the interests of the consumer and the public at large.  At the moment it might be argued that the Labour Court perform that function.  In fact, they do not.  As far as I can see the Labour Court's function is a simple one of splitting the difference.  It is a conciliation service, not a court.  They do not really look at things in an objective way of looking at the public interest.  Their concern is with settling the issues between the parties before them, almost with the public interest excluded.  The Labour Court in their operations as a result of legislation put through in, I think, the early sixties no longer take account of the Government's financial situation in their recommendations.  That is because of a rather unwise amendment made to previous legislation at that time.  I cannot remember the date.</P>
    <P>Services provided under contract of employment can be just as frequently a cause of uncompetitive practices and high costs as services provided on a free sale basis.  Therefore, there is a case for using this with due consultation between the Minister and the Minister for Labour.  I hope the Government will not simply allow section 9 to be a sort of dead letter but will use it actively as part of their industrial relations policy to improve the efficiency of the economy.</P>

      <P>This is one of the sections the Minister named in his reply to me. He said sections 10 and 22 deal with the inclusion of banking and so on.  Now that they have new powers I ask the Minister to see that this new office looks specifically at the profit margins of what I call plastic money.  I understand that the <Col N="1346" /> profit margins of Access, Visa and other such cards are extremely high.  I am aware also of a degree of takeovers in the last number of years and different cards are now amalgamated into one card.  In the UK there are currently many calls for an examination into this area.  I hope that can be followed up.  No body are higher in the league of arrogance than the ESB in the way they deal with the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Moriarty and I do not agree on many things.  It is disgraceful that if anyone gets any installation of electricity into a house, business, mobile home or whatever and queries the capital cost of it, that person is invariably told that the matter will not be altered and if he does not accept the terms within three or six months it will be increased.  That is disgraceful, and there is nowhere for such people to turn to.  They waste time writing to the Minister for Energy, or the secretary of the company, or anybody. Those people cannot go to another company and they cannot afford a generator. That aspect of the ESB's operations indicates that: (a) they should be asked to give a full explanation as to how the costings were arrived at; and (b) people should have some right to write to Jim Murray or somebody to query if it is fair. I believe the ESB are shifting around some of their cost into this area, and that is totally unfair.</P>
      <P>As section 10 deals with this matter I suggest to the Minister that those two areas should be the first items taken up by the new office under these new powers.  I have other views about the extension of this area to other State services, local authorities, health boards, BTE, An Post and so on.  With the Ombudsman's office under financial restrictions, greater uniformity should be aimed at here.  I will leave that for another day but I would like plastic money and the capital quoted by the ESB for installations to be the first items on the agenda to be taken up under these new powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1347" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite my facetious intervention I support strongly what Deputy Yates said about the ESB.  I have similar experience of people being quoted large sums of money for the cost of installing electricity and it is virtually impossible to find out the basis upon which these are calculated.  The ESB will not tell you the breakdown between labour and materials and, as Deputy Yates says, because the ESB are a monopoly you cannot buy your electricity from somebody else so you more or less have to accept their terms for installation. Let it be said that the same applies to BTE who have a monopoly and can do the same.</P>
      <P>This section will ensure that the Fair Trade Commission can now investigate the operation of banks, the ESB, any transport service provided or operated by CIE or their subsidiary companies, any air service in or out of the country if restrictive practices are operating there, any transport service provided by a private operator which was previously exempt, any shipping service and the service of any harbour authority.  For the first time, as a result of this legislation, which I am proud to have steered through the previous Government and which the present Minister has brought forward now, there is an enormous field for investigation by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would particularly like the commission to look at the treatment of private suppliers of electricity who sell electricity into the ESB grid.  At the moment the ESB pay a price to private suppliers of electricity which is designed almost to discourage private electricity generation.  This is something which was commented on by the Jakobsen committee who asked that the ESB change their practice in that regard.  If that is not done, the powers in this legislation should be used.  However, I see a problem in regard to this.  If something has to be done as a result of a recommendation by the Restrictive Practices Commission, will the Minister have to refer this to the Minister for Energy who will have to introduce a special Bill to amend the <Col N="1348" /> Electricity Supply Acts?  If so, nothing will happen.</P>
    <P>This argues the case for some of the amendments I will be putting forward later, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Government and this House, should have the power to make amendments to other legislation by means of the order making powers under this legislation rather than passing the ball to somebody else, in this case the Minister for Energy who is the principal shareholder in the ESB and who will not be quite as enthusiastic about consumer rights as the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for the first time this legislation will allow the commission to examine restrictive practices in the shipping services.  For instance, if there is a cosy arrangement on the Irish Sea between shipping companies to keep prices up by restricting the number of sailings, then it will be possible under this section for that to be investigated, and I hope it will be.</P>
    <P>I have some worries about the exemptions in section 10 for services provided by the local authorities.  It is fair to say &mdash; and this was part of the Fianna Fáil platform during the last local elections &mdash; that local authorities should become more involved in promoting employment. If that is so, they may become more involved in the provision of economic services of one kind or another.  They are involved in refuse collections which are done on a commercial basis.  Let us assume that there is a possibility that a service which is provided by a local authority could be provided by somebody else on a competitive basis, but the local authority say they want to maintain a monopoly of that service.  If it is a refuse collection service and the local authority refuse to give the competitor access to the pithead, for example, in that type of commercial operation it is possible for the local authorities to engage in unfair competition.  I do not understand why the Minister has come to the conclusion that local authorities should be exempt because, as I understand it, this exemption of local authorities was not contained <Col N="1349" /> in the original Bill but was introduced by means of an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. There is a strong argument for not exempting local authorities as is proposed here.  All in all, I welcome the section and the Minister should use it to deal with the subject matter raised by Deputy Yates.</P>
      <P>In regard to transport services, there should be the possibility of individual routes or packages of routes operated by CIE being made available on a competitive basis for other contractors.  I recognise that some of the services are loss-making and are provided as a social service, but that problem could be overcome if CIE were to put up for tender a package of routes, some of which were loss-making and some of which were profit-making, telling the people who tender that they must operate all the routes according to the schedules they had determined, including the loss-making route.  If they can provide this service at a lower cost and still make a profit, that is fine as long as the frequency and standard of service are maintained.  It should be possible to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interests of the consumer and of competition, I hope the Fair Trade Commission will be asked to look at the efficiency and competitiveness of our public transport services to see if there are areas where we could put these routes out to tender.  There is a need for a public service body such as CIE to hold the reins and ensure that certain standards are maintained, that costs are not excessive and that vulnerable groups in society do not lose services simply because the profit motive alone determines what service should be provided.  I accept that fully, but subject to guidelines laid down by CIE, there are many possibilities for private enterprises to be introduced into the provision of public transport on conditions that are fair in regard to the maintenance of socially as well as commercially viable services.  The only <Col N="1350" /> thing that is stopping this happening is that CIE have some difficulty in operating an accounting process which distributes cost and evaluates the actual cost of individual routes.  This is an intellectual exercise which would appear to be beyond CIE, but it should not be.  There is no reason why a change along the lines I have mentioned could not be made.  I ask the Minister to have the commission look at that aspect, too.</P>
    <P>The only substantive objection I have to this section is the exemption to local authorities.  If the Minister is concerned one could introduce an amendment which said &ldquo;... local authorities, within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act, where they are providing a service which is not being charged for...&rdquo;.  If the local authority are providing a service which is being charged for, then they should be subject to the competition law.  I would contemplate introducing an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one point to make on this section.  As a new Deputy I have noticed that the accountability of all our State bodies is almost nil.  I have found it quite unbelievable that when State bodies are being set up they are not made accountable to this House.  They are not accountable in any real way to the public or to public representatives.  I see this Bill as a move in the right direction to make them accountable to a much greater degree through the Fair Trade Commission and the director for the service they provide to the public at large.  I would encourage the Minister in this direction because it is disgraceful that bodies like the ESB, Dublin Gas, CIE and many others, whose activities affect the daily lives of our citizens, should not be accountable in any real way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect much opposition to this section although it caused confusion on Second Stage because when the Bill was first circulated these exemptions were removed by including them in Part I of the Second <Col N="1351" /> Schedule to the Bill which lists the amendments to be repealed.  However, in the interest of clarity and after consultation with the Attorney General's office, it was decided to devote the full section in the Bill to the removal of these exclusions which, as I said, caused confusion on Second Stage.  This was done by way of amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  It is now catered for in section 10 of the Bill which will be welcomed by everybody because, for the first time, it takes away the exclusions and brings under the scope of consumer legislation services such as banking, electricity, supply and transport.  I need not name them all as Deputy Bruton listed them.  I assure the House that the powers now vested in this section will be used immediately. There is widespread concern in relation to the level of banking charges, the ESB and other areas and if there is a cosy relationship in regard to the Irish Sea we can look into it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's question in relation to CIE is really a matter for transport legislation, I cannot bring up the monopoly of CIE.  Local authorities are not a new inclusion and the services provided by them within the meaning of the Local Government Act will continue to be excluded.  They are so clearly regulated by the local authority and by the Department of the Environment that they have been excluded.  It may well be that in future there will be a development along those lines but not at present.  I will be looking at all the aspects that now bring into consumer legislation for the first time areas causing grievous concern to the public who are waiting for this Bill to be passed to enable them to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the exemption of local authorities, there is a case for saying that where they provide a refuse collection service for which they charge a fee, there should be a possibility that any unfair practices that exist in the provision of that commercial service could be the subject of investigation. Likewise, local authorities provide a repair service for their tenants as part of <Col N="1352" /> their responsibilities as a landlord.  Other landlords are &mdash; and always have been &mdash; subject to investigation if they are engaged in unfair practices or overcharging but local authorities are not as a result of this exemption.  There are suggestions in Britain, for example, that local authority tenants should be able to opt for an alternative landlord, that somebody else could provide the repair service in relation to their flat or house. Perhaps another landlord could provide a repair and maintenance service more cheaply.  I hope that this possibility will be looked at in Ireland.  These are all arguments for saying that in regard to services provided by the local authorities which are charged for or commercially free standing, there should be the possibility of competition policy examination. I do not expect the Minister to agree to that off the top of his head but I give him notice that I intend to move an amendment along those lines on Report Stage which would exempt genuine local authority services being provided free in the public interest which are not capable of being commercially charged for.  They would include local authority services which were analogous to commercial services. Perhaps the Minister could comment briefly on that possibility.</P>

Subsections (1) and (2) allow an investigation into conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of any goods or to one or more aspects of the supply and distribution of any kind of goods. <Col N="1353" /> This could relate to things that have nothing to do with competition, for instance, it could allow the Minister to introduce censorship of publications in regard to the sale of books.  The commission could decide that they wanted to ban certain types of prurient material in books.  I do not think that is what is intended but perhaps the legislation should be more precisely drafted to make it relate to prices and competition rather than almost anything one likes to mention. This is something that has run through our legislation but I simply wish to make the point, I do not want to make a meal of it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.  3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;Section 8 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of a new subsection (5):</P>
      <P>`(5) Where the Commission relies on paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section as a basis for recommending the making of an order under this section it shall in its report to the Minister include a definition of the term &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; used by it in coming to its conclusion.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment as it deals with the subject that has been just <Col N="1354" /> referred to.  Where the commission make a recommendation on the basis that a practice is unfair, they should be specific in saying what they mean by &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; in this context.  It tends to get away from the possibility of the type of wide, unstructured and unpredictable interpretation of the law which could occur from a literal reading of the provisions of the Bill.  To avoid that, the commission, if relying on the use of the term &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; rather than a specific competitor matter, should say how it is interpreting &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; in this context.</P>
    <P>I understand that in practice the commission give some such indication in that in the report of the inquiry they must give the reasons for the conclusions stated in the report.  This amendment, by simply asking the commission to go a little further in saying what they mean by &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; in the context in which it is being applied, would remove from my mind many of my worries about the unduly wide nature of the possible interpretation of the legislation. I hope the Minister can accept an amendment along these lines which would remove the necessity to amend the legislation to eliminate all these rather loose terms by simply requiring the commission to say how they are interpreting them in a particular case.  That discipline would establish a line of precedence which would tend to keep the legislation within reasonable rails, so to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new section in the Bill the purpose of which is to amend section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  Section 8 of the 1972 Act deals with the making of restrictive practices orders by the Minister, on the basis of a report of the commission.  The purpose of the amendment is to require the commission, where they consider that the conditions obtaining in relation to the supply of goods or the provision of services involve &ldquo;unfair practices&rdquo;, to include in their report a definition of &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the Act already contains considerable clarification of what is meant by unfair practices.  Section 3 of the Act provides that the commission <Col N="1355" /> and the examiner, in the exercise of their functions under the Act, must have regard to the unfair practices listed in the Third Schedule to the Act.  Therefore, when the commission hold an inquiry under section 5 of the Act, into conditions which obtain in relation to the supply of goods or services, or into the operation of an order under section 8, they must have regard to the long list of unfair practices set out in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Act requires the commission to include reference to a number of matters in any report made by them of an inquiry under section 5.  In particular, the report must state whether, in the opinion of the commission, any interference with competition or trade or with the provision of services is unfair or operates against the common good and also whether, in the opinion of the commission, any of those conditions involve practices which are unfair or operate against the common good.  By virtue of section 3, any consideration by the commission of these matters must be made in the context of the criteria in relation to unfair practices set out in the Third Schedule.  It is only at this stage that the Minister may decide to make an order prohibiting unfair practices and as this would be based on the commission's report, here again any order made prohibiting unfair practices &mdash; section 8 (1) (b) &mdash; would be in the context of the criteria set out in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>The criteria in relation to unfair practices set out in the Third Schedule essentially constitute a definition of what is unfair.  The criteria are, however, necessarily general because they are intended for global application.  In practice, in an inquiry, or review, by the commission, the general criteria are converted into specific recommendations on which the Minister of the day must make a judgement based on, in the words of the Act, &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the commission's report of inquiry of 1982 into the effects on competition of the restrictions on conveyancing and on advertising by solicitors the commission <Col N="1356" /> identified what they considered to be serious restrictions of free competition&mdash; paragraph (a) of the Third Schedule&mdash; and went on to consider whether these restrictions could be justified on the basis that they were necessary to preserve interests of even greater importance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the restrictions on conveyancing, the commission concluded that they did not see that there were any such interests which would justify prohibiting a vendor from employing a non-solicitor as his conveyancer.  They did, however, find reasons of the public interest why a purchaser should be prohibited from doing so.  In relation to advertising, the commission established that the prohibition on advertising by solicitors was an &ldquo;unnecessary restriction on the freedom to communicate&rdquo;, and recommended accordingly.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in their report of inquiry of 1984 into the travel trade, the commission stated that they were satisfied that there were two widespread practices in the travel trade, namely, discrimination in trading and price maintenance, which were objectionable from the competition point of view and which in the opinion of the commission did not result in any significant benefit for the consumer.  They considered that the rule of ITAA that a travel agent member was prohibited from dealing with a tour operator in another country unless he was a member of a national association recognised by the ITAA was restrictive and anti-competitive in nature.  They considered it to be an interference with the provision of services in a manner which was unfair and which operated against the common good within the meaning of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>The commission stated that they had in mind in particular those provisions relating to the prevention or restriction of competition, paragraph (a); restraint on the provision of services, paragraph (f); unjust elimination of a competitor, paragraph (c); restriction on the exercise by a person of his freedom of choice as to the supply of services, paragraph (g); and the exclusion of new entrants to a trade or business, paragraph (i).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> Again, in the commission's report of inquiry of 1985 into policies of building societies in regard to insurance related mortgage properties and valuation reports on properties the commission stated that they must have regard to the unfair practices listed in the Third Schedule to the 1972 Act.  The most relevant of these in that context was in the opinion of the commission, related to measures which have or are likely to have the effect of unreasonably limiting or restraining free and fair competition, paragraph (a); which without just cause prohibit or restrict the provision of services to any person, paragraph (f); which involved unjust or unreasonable conditions in regard to the provision of services, paragraph (h); which without good reason exclude or are likely to exclude new entrants to an industry or business, paragraph (i); or which in any other respect operate against the common good, paragraph (k).  There is a very clear demonstration there that the commission have to take into account in relation to the Third Schedule what is fair and what is unfair.  I hope the Deputy is satisfied with that reply.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;Section 8 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>(e) amended any legislation, whether that be the responsibility of the Minister or of any other Minister, if this is necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment.  We <Col N="1358" /> have been discussing in this debate the new extension of the commission's remit into areas such as the provision of electricity, road transport, air transport, sea transport, banking and so on.  All those areas are governed by legislation operated by the Ministers other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The recommendations emanating from the Restrictive Practices Commission Reports and the decision of the Minister will be ineffective because at present it is not possible for the Minister, by an order under the Restrictive Practices Act, to make any changes in the law affecting banking because that is a matter for the Minister for Finance, air transport or other transport services because they are matters for the Minister for Tourism and Transport, electricity supply because that is a matter for the Minister for Energy, the legal profession because that is a matter for the Minister for Justice and possibly a number of other professions or activities which have not yet been covered by inquiries in this area because the principal legislation is a matter for another Minister.</P>
    <P>Building societies are a further example.  The legislation there is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and it cannot be dealt with by the Minister by an order under this Act.  This Act only allows for an investigation and a report. There is no provision for enforcement or for dealing with the problem which must be passed to another Minister.  That is a recipe for long-term inaction.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to show how this can happen.  For instance, the recommendation in regard to solicitors concerning conveyancing and advertising has not been dealt with although the report was made in April 1982, because it was a matter for the Minister for Justice and that Minister has not yet done anything about it.  That is not satisfactory.  Another example relates to the inquiry into the restriction on the provision of dentures. This was to be dealt with by an order or by another method but the commission recommendation whereby members of the public should have the right to choose who they wanted to provide dentures was <Col N="1359" /> not accepted by the Department of Health and that was the end of the matter.  All the commission inquiries into that matter as far as that aspect was concerned came to nought because the Department of Health said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If competition policy is to work there should not be this possibility of veto.</P>
    <P>A similar situation applied with regard to a report presented in regard to tour operations.  The Attorney General advised me, as Minister, that the proposed order which I had prepared was <i>ultra vires</i> and that this came within the definition of air services and that the Minister could not proceed by order until The Restrictive Practices Act, 1987, was amended to include air services.  The Act is now being amended to include air services, but will the Minister now be told he cannot act on that order because air services are a matter for the Minister for Transport?  I am afraid that will happen, notwithstanding the reply that the Minister gave me in the Dáil some time ago.</P>
    <P>We had the same situation with regard to the inquiry into the policies of building societies relating to insurance-related mortgage properties and the valuation reports on properties.  The order that was recommended was deemed to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister's powers because it related to building societies which were regarded as coming within the terms of banking services for the purposes of the Restrictive Practices Act.  The Minister was then advised that he could not proceed with the order until the Restrictive Practices Act was amended to include banking business.  It is being amended to include banking businesses but will the Minister be able to act on an order under his powers to deal with building society matters in future or will he have to wait for the Minister for the Environment to introduce legislation?</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of activities in society, whether they be in the private or public sector are regulated in some form or another by some Minister. Even the most free of free services has some measure of regulation.  I am afraid this legislation will be totally ineffective <Col N="1360" /> because the other Ministers responsible will say it is a matter for them, that another Minister cannot act by order under the Restrictive Practices Act and the legislation will join the queue of legislation lying in the Departments or will be rejected outright, and nothing will happen.  The whole costly investigation of the matter by the Fair Trade Commission will be an utter frustrated waste of time and money.</P>
    <P>My amendment is designed to change that situation by saying that any legislation whether it be the responsibility of the Minister or any other Minister, if this is necessary, can be amended by the Minister by order to give effect to the recommendations of the commission.  I know that difficulties can be raised with regard to the amendment of principal legislation by means of an order and it could be argued that giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce the right to make orders which have the effect of amending an Act which is the responsibility of another Minister, even if the Cabinet had agreed and even if the Dáil had agreed, as it would because it has to pass an affirmative order with regard to orders under this Act, is going beyond the proper function of an order.  I understand that in the case of Cityview Press <i>v.</i> AnCO a decision was made by the courts to the effect that orders could not amend statute.  That is an academic point.  In both cases the Dáil will be consenting.</P>
    <P>In the case of an order made under this Bill the Dáil must pass an affirmative resolution.  I do not propose to change the procedure with regard to orders under this Bill.  The Dáil would have to decide that.  However, if we leave things as they are there will be a lot of high profile investigations into the ESB, into banking and into other areas and they will all come to nothing because at the end of the day a recommendation will be made to the Minister and he will be unable to act on it because if the Minister does not accept this amendment, it will be passed to another Minister and it will be buried in the sort of incinerator that Departments have for recommendations they do not like.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The public service tends to give a poor reception to an idea thought of by another Department.  I know this to be the case from intimate and continuous knowledge of the way the system works. If, on the other hand, the Department in question thought of it first it is an entirely different matter.  That is human nature. It is not peculiar to Ireland or to the public service.  I am sure it exists just as much in the private sector, this attitude of wanting to be the apparent master of one's own destiny.  Unless the Minister has the power which I propose he should be given, he will not be able to act on orders.</P>
    <P>If necessary a special section should be put into this Bill to clarify the legal position arising from case of Cityview Press <i>v.</i> AnCO.  It seems to me the Dáil has the power by statute to say that that case is overturned, because statute law can overcome a court decision in that manner.  There is not a constitutional issue involved here.  But whether my amendment serves to solve the problem, I hope the Minister will acknowledge that there is a potentially enormous problem in getting results because of the absence of a power to amend legislation affecting other Departments.  Certainly, it was my experience when I was Minister that in the case of two reports which I have already referred to that road block stopped anything being done, because the matter had to be passed over to somebody else who had not initiated the inquiry and probably their State agencies were doing their best to stop it ever happening.</P>
    <P>If the Minister asked the Restrictive Practices Commission to do a wholesale inquiry into the ESB there would be discreet or indiscreet representations made to him on the lines that there was no need for that, as the Minister for Energy had already commissioned a report, that the Jakobsen report had already been published, that the matter was being investigated and most actively considered, that the ESB board were extremely interested in doing something about it and that it <Col N="1362" /> would be a total waste of time.  All this comment would be poured on top of the Minister to try to prevent him from carrying out the inquiry.  Persistent man as he is, I know he would, once he has made his decision, ignore such representations and go ahead and produce his report six months later or whatever.  We will not argue about the length of time.  It would be a radical report and the Minister would want to act on it but his colleague, and it could be himself if he were in a different job, would say &ldquo;hold on, you can do none of that, that requires an amendment to the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, and subsequent amendments thereto and that is a matter for me.  You have got your publicity out of the inquiry into the ESB, you have done a good job for yourself but I am not going to allow any action to be taken on this report&rdquo;.  That would be the end of it.  I know the Minister will come back and say, and I have heard it before, that things do not happen like that in a Government like his.  I do not believe that human frailty has been abolished in Fianna Fáil any more than in any other political party.  It exists in all parties and will continue to the end of time.  It is for those of us who make rules in the House to try to envisage what will happen, indeed envisage some of the silly things we might get up to ourselves in certain circumstances and ensure that we are not allowed to do it.  The amendment I am proposing will greatly enchance the Minister's power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; in a direction necessary to give him the ability to deal with a genuine problem.  Let us remember it only gives him power to make amendments on the basis of orders which have arisen from an independent investigation, which orders have been approved by the Cabinet, collectively responsible &mdash; and all the orders have to be approved by the Cabinet &mdash; and which orders have subsequently been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is only with these three preconditions being fulfilled that this would take effect in <Col N="1363" /> amending any antecedent statute.  Those safeguards are more than adequate for anybody and I hope the Minister will seek to implement them.  Otherwise I fear that unless the Minister goes over to the prohibition approach which was urged in my original amendments, Nos. 1 and 2, which would sweep all of these problems out of the way from the outset, he will not be able to deal with the problems as they arise.</P>
      <P>In conclusion might I say there is another possibility the Minister might consider if he does not want to accept this amendment, that is, to give him power to introduce legislation to amend other legislation, the responsibility of other Ministers, if that is something recommended in a report of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  The Minister would do it on the basis of an amendment to the Restrictive Practices Act rather than relying on, say, the Minister for Justice to introduce an amendment to the Solicitors Act.  If the Minister says that the use of an order to amend a statute is a diriment impediment to accepting this amendment, which I do not accept but he may be able to argue that point, why should he not take the power in regard to any matter, that is the subject matter of a report from the Restrictive Practices Commission, to be able to introduce legislation to give effect to the recommendations of that order himself, with the agreement of the Cabinet, rather than simply relying on another Minister to do it by amending his own legislation?</P>
      <P>One road or another this problem has to be solved because I do not see how we are to have an active competition policy without it, that is, unless we go over to the prohibition approach that I was urging earlier in the day.</P>

      <P>The thrust of this amendment is validly based.  I can see very good reason for introducing some mechanism whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered to give real effect to the mounds of work, that will be done by Restrictive Practices Commission or the Fair Trade Commission. <Col N="1364" /> This begs the question of what is the real role of the Restrictive Practices Commission. Is it merely to be what we might term a talking shop or is it to be a body, appointed by legislation, appointed by the Government, and appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to investigate any given restrictive practice? When recommending changes is it to be given the authority to suggest changes in legislation, which can be fairly expected to be put into effect?  After all we are talking about legislation relating only to consumer protection, which by right is within the ambit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It should not come within the ambit of any other Government Minister, if it relates particularly to consumer protection.  I ask the Minister to consider what level of opposition he would think is acceptable from a Department against the efforts of the commission?  If the commission draft a report, present it to the Minister and the Minister accepts it and it is stymied at that point because it cannot get on the floor of the House except through another Minister, how strongly must that other Department oppose it, must they merely say &ldquo;no, we will not have it&rdquo; or must they put up reasoned arguments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure the Minister would agree with me.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to a parallel which may be of use, which exists in the United Kingdom, relating to the value <Col N="1365" /> for money reports which are drawn up by the National Audit Office there.  They have entered into a fairly new procedure but essentially the comptroller and auditor general and the National Audit Office decide, somewhat like the Fair Trade Commission will, to investigate certain matters and they draw up reports.  The great difference between that and what we are proposing here is that it is an agreed report with the Department concerned. Before the Minister rushes to say, &ldquo;here comes another whitewash&rdquo;, that is not what happens.  Extreme pressure is put on the Department concerned to acknowledge that they have made mistakes and to suggest ways of overcoming them.  It seems that it might be a useful vehicle for us here, where the commission draws up a report on some aspect, let us say, the solicitors legislation, and in doing so get the agreement of the Department concerned for the final report.  Therefore there can be no objection to the implementation of that final report by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The report would not have to wait in the long line of legislation in other Departments.  I submit that point for the Minister's consideration because if he is serious about wanting to have the final say regarding consumer protection legislation, he should be doing all in his power to ensure that the reports are implemented.  It is a method which might allow that to be the case.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment would give wide ranging powers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am glad Deputy Bruton acknowledges that that is a very busy Department.  I would like to see more action coming from other Departments on some of the other reports that have been made but it is not all one sided.  I have noticed an incident recently where the Minister for the Environment included most of the commission's recommendations in the building societies regulations.  Some <Col N="1366" /> Departments may be worse than others in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposed amendment is very far-reaching and it is considered much too far-reaching in the present context. Indeed, besides any administrative or practical questions which may arise, the amendment raises the question of whether such a provision would be in accordance with the Constitution and we have sought advice on this.</P>
      <P>Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State&rdquo;.  The question must, therefore, arise as to whether a power of the Minister to amend primary legislation by order is an usurpation of the power of the legislature.  There have been a number of court cases on this subject where the constitutionality of such legislative powers has been questioned.  In general, it has been held that the delegation of statutory powers is permissible only with certain fairly narrow criteria.  In particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Cityview Press <i>v</i>.  An Comhairle Oiliúna (AnCO), in 1979, stated:</P>
      <P>the exclusive authority of the National Parliament in the field of law making should not be eroded by a delegation of power neither contemplated nor permitted by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The court then formulated the general test it would apply to subordinate rule making activities:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The test, in the view of this Court, is whether what is challenged as an unauthorised delegation of Parliamentary power is more than a mere giving effect to principles and policies which are contained in the Statute itself.  If it be, then it is not authorised, for such would constitute a purported exercise of legislative power by an authority which is not permitted to do so under the Constitution.  On the other hand, if it be within the permitted limits &mdash; if the law is laid down in the Statute and details only filled in and <Col N="1367" /> completed by the designated Minister or subordinate body &mdash; there is no unauthorised delegation of legislative power.</P>
    <P>The above had been confirmed to me informally by the Attorney General's office.  I recognise this would be very useful power for the Minister for Industry and Commerce but nevertheless he is only one Minister in the Cabinet.  If a report comes out and the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants certain action taken by a certain Department he takes it to Cabinet and the Cabinet decide.  If what the Cabinet decides is against the Constitution, we all know the reality in that situation.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that a power to amend primary legislation has been conferred on a Minister of State under a number of statutes.  These powers, however, relate to very specific circumstances and are by no means as general in nature as the present proposal would seem to indicate. For example, under the Companies Act, 1963, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered by order to alter or add to the requirements of the Act as to the matters to be stated in a company's accounts.  It will be seen that this is a very specific power and relates solely to a matter &mdash; the contents of accounts &mdash; already decided on by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986 gives the Minister a somewhat broader power by allowing him by order to alter or add to the provisions of the Act in so far as it relates to the balance sheet and profit and loss account of a company and the notes and documents to be attached to such a balance sheet or profit and loss account. Here again, however, the actual format and contents of the accounts, and the notes to the accounts, are set out in the statute itself.  Furthermore, in this case, the statute in question implemented the Fourth EEC Company Law Directive and, thus, the Minister's power to amend the 1986 Act would always be subject to compatability with the contents of that directive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> Section 8 (2) of the Postal and Telecommunications Service Act, 1983, provides that the Minister for Communications for the purpose of giving full effect to the assignment of functions under the Act may, by order, adapt any enactment, with the consent of any other Minister responsible for the administration of that enactment.  Here again, the Minister's power is carefully restricted to being within the scope of what has already been approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the proposal made by Deputy Bruton, however, the only restriction on the Minister's power is that any amendment which he would make should be &ldquo;necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission&rdquo;.  This is much wider than any existing legislative provision and goes far beyond what is being authorised by the Oireachtas in the Bill generally.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a power such as that proposed by Deputy Bruton would be very useful for a Minister to have. It would certainly help to ensure that recommendations made by the Fair Trade Commission could be implemented without undue delay.  There would, however, be practical difficulties. The Minister might, on the basis of recommendations from the commission, consider it desirable that a piece of legislation which is the responsibility of another Minister should be amended. The Minister would, of necessity, be considering this in the context of his own responsibilities, namely, competition policy in particular.  It is considered that even a requirement for consultation with another Minister would not be sufficient to ensure that all relevant factors were taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that while the facility being proposed by Deputy Bruton may, on first sight, be a very desirable one, it is not right that the Minister should have the power to amend by order legislation in areas which are properly within the peculiar knowledge or competence of another Minister.  Thus, the practical advantages of saving time and allowing Ministers to effect recommendations <Col N="1369" /> made by the commission would be overridden by the more fundamental considerations of, first of all, constitutionality and, secondly, proper public administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened closely to the Minister and as far as I can see the heart of his objection is in the Cityview Press <i>v</i>.  An Comhairle Oiliúna court case where the judge decided the basic rules governing the making of delegated legislation. I have not recently consulted the said judgment, although I will do so before Report Stage.  Having listened to the extract read by the Minister, it does not seem to me what I am proposing is impossible or unconstitutional.  I recollect his saying that the delegated legislation must be no more than a mere giving effect to the statute itself.  Were those the words the Minister used?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be making the order under the Restrictive Practices Act.  I have been arguing that what is contemplated in that Act is so wide that it covers almost anything and gives the Minister the necessary constitutional protection.  I would contend that there is not a constitutional problem here.  If he were acting, for instance, under another Act which was rather more narrowly drafted, then perhaps it would be inappropriate to use delegated legislation but given that he is acting under the Restrictive Practices Act and the very wide principles contained in that legislation, there is no doubt whatever that he would have the power and that nothing he would do in implementation of this amendment would be contrary to the Constitution, at least as interpreted in the Cityview Press <i>v</i>.  An Comhairle Oiliúna case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objections the Minister is making are not really related to the Constitution. They are more related to the good order of Government business.  I should like to push this a bit further because it is worth <Col N="1370" /> the time.  I wonder if my amendment were to be altered to include words to amend this legislation, whether it be the responsibility of the Minister or of any other Minister, &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister concerned and with the approval of the Government&rdquo; if it is necessary to give effect to the recommendation of the Commission.  It is obviously important that the Government must consider the matter if the Minister is doing something of that kind.  In practice the Government do but it should be explicit in the Act.  If the Minister is introducing legislation, or if another Minister is introducing legislation, that has to go to Cabinet under Cabinet procedure instructions.</P>
    <P>There is an accepted practice &mdash; I am speaking from memory &mdash; that the making of an order does not have to go to Cabinet.  It is important to remember that any orders made under this Bill must be confirmed by an Act.  There is not the same objection in that case because it is not a normal order.  It is an order that must be confirmed by an Act and it cannot take effect until the Act confirms it.  In effect, the Minister is amending the statute with another statute.  The only difference is that the House does not have the possibility to introduce amendments which it does in respect of ordinary legislation. All the stages that go on here in regard to any statute must be gone through in respect of an order under this Act.  The only difference is that it is an Act confirming an order rather than the Act doing it.  I hope the Minister may be able to consider this between now and Report Stage because it would be an immense advance in competition law and would remove some of the necessity for the much more radical change in the introduction of the prohibition principle for which I have argued earlier if we could get speedier action on this new area.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should look at whether: (a) the Cityview Press does not apply in the sense that the criterion in this Act is so wide that it allows you to say it is within it; and (b) we should include within my amendment a reference to the consultation with the other <Col N="1371" /> Minister, to which the Minister referred, and &ldquo;with the approval of the Cabinet&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Government&rdquo;, whatever the appropriate terminology is.  If that were done perhaps the Minister could accept this and it would bring us a long way. As I have introduced a number of new arguments which I did not advance on Second Stage, I would prefer not to press the matter on Committee Stage but to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept it at that point or, if not, bring forward his own amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a further look at it but my advice from the Attorney General's office is that it would be unconstitutional. I should like to make a few quick points.  It is the Oireachtas that passes the laws, not the Government. There might be a slight difference of interpretation there.  I recognise the point the Deputy is making.  Between now and Report Stage we will have another look at it in relation to the points raised but I will certainly consider the points raised.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 18, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;18.&mdash;Section 18 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1) of the following after `section 10':</P>
      <P>`within fourteen days of its receipt by him'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment requires the Minister to act within 14 days of receiving a report. Where the Minister has a report made to him at present he does not have to lay that report before the House within a specified time limit so he can sit on it for as long as he wishes.  He may not sit on it as long as he wishes; that would be <Col N="1373" /> contrary to the spirit of the law, but there is no time limit.  My amendment suggests that the Minister should be required to lay the report before the House within 14 days.  He would not necessarily need to have made a decision within 14 days.  He would only be required to lay the report before the House to make it public.</P>
    <P>I realise that Ministers like to announce their decision at the same time as they are publishing the report in case somebody might dissuade them from their decision. Therefore, it is frequently convenient for Ministers to withhold the publication of a report until they have made up their mind.  I am not sure if that is good.  It is not undesirable that a report should be in the public domain for a while before the Minister makes up his mind.  If time is available for this purpose I do not think there is any great inconvenience for the Minister in laying a report before the House and saying: &ldquo;I will make up my mind within the next month and act then.&rdquo;  That is my recommendation.</P>
    <P>I know there are problems with the printing of reports.  There is a big queue at the Stationery Office to have Government publications printed.  It is possible that a report might be received by the Minister in stencil form which would not be in a printed form that he could publish or lay before the House within 14 days. On the other hand, many documents have been laid before this House in stencil form without any great disaster befalling the country.  We do not have to wait to have them printed.</P>
    <P>This is fairly normal practice with the Book of Estimates which is the most important document we ever receive.  For many years that was laid before us in stencil form initially and a fully printed up version was produced later.  There is nothing wrong with a stencilled report being sent within 14 days.  We do not have to wait for the printers to produce a beautifully bound copy.  I think this amendment is reasonable.  If the Minister cannot accept a time limit of 14 days perhaps he would accept some time limit to provide against the possibility that some less industrious successor might sit <Col N="1374" /> on a report for more than two or three months.  There is a case for putting in a time limit to act as a long stop against something being buried.  I suggest that the Minister might accept not this amendment but a time limit with which he could agree.</P>

Would the Minister agree that it would be advisable to at least retain those in each county at present since the staff are retained in these offices which have been closed down?  This would at least provide some work for those officers to do.

There are still certain amounts of land tax due but there may be some argument that has to go through the appeals tribunal for that purpose and that is why the records will be retained.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in relation to semi-State companies (a) if privatisation of any firm is under consideration by the Government and (b) the way in which it is intended to finance the expansion of semi-State companies to provide the additional jobs promised in the <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Col N="1380" />
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to (a) is no.  In the case of Irish Life, the position in relation to that company was outlined in my reply to a question on 5 November 1987.</P>
      <P>As regards (b), the proposals for job creation submitted by the various State companies and listed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> these will, as stated in the programme, be evaluated by reference to criteria of economic viability.  The financing of the projects in question will be a matter for the bodies concerned.  I would expect, however, that as these projects will only proceed if commercially viable the necessary funding will be secured on commercial grounds. In certain cases EC funds will be available.</P>
      <P>With regard to the commercial State sector generally I made it clear to the House in April last, when the issue of privatisation was debated, that the Government believe that an efficient and profitable semi-State sector can be a major instrument for economic development and employment.  It was in the light of this belief that the Taoiseach sought from the State bodies the proposals for development to which I have already referred.  The Government believe, however, that the commercial State bodies must be operated with as much regard to efficiency and to commercial realities as their counterparts in the private sector.  A great deal of responsibility for their future development rests, therefore, with the boards and management of the companies concerned.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his clear and succinct reply to (a).  He says that the Government are not considering the privatisation of any firm.  I am not clear as to the Minister's reply given on 5 November in regard to Irish Life.  Perhaps the Minister would repeat that.  In regard to (b), again I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister in regard to the efficiency and profitability of commercial State companies. That has to be one of the criteria involved.  In order to enable them to be so, is the Minister prepared to give them <Col N="1381" /> the freedom to compete without restrictions with the private sector?  As the Minister is well aware, there is always an outcry when the public sector goes into direct competition with the private sector so could the Minister repeat what the position is in regard to Irish Life?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the second part of the Deputy's statement.  I do not think there is any necessity to reply to it. I will give the reply to the question that was asked of me so that I will be giving an authoritative and correct reply to part (a) of Deputy De Rossa's question.  The reason I refer to Irish Life is that I was asked specifically on 5 November about the proposal to sell shares in Irish Life and the answer I gave was that no decision had been taken on the matter, that proposals by Irish Life for reorganisation of their capital structure were being examined and that any decision by Government would be taken on the basis of what was best in the national interest. Therefore, the answer is no but the qualification or clarification is on the basis of the reply I gave on 5 November to a specific question about Irish Life.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give details of the report of the wildlife inspector who monitored the coursing meeting at Listowel, County Kerry, on 14 and 15 November 1987; the number of hares killed; his views on whether this is a satisfactory situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The hare coursing meeting at Listowel on 14 and 15 November 1987 was attended by a wildlife ranger on 14 November.  Twenty hares were killed on that day.  The ranger's report confirmed that there were no breaches of the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the assurances that were received in this House that an official of the Forestry and Wildlife section will attend and monitor all coursing meeting, may I ask why none was in attendance on 15 November?  The Minister said there was one in attendance on 14 November.  Secondly, what is the Minister's view on an acceptable average of hares killed at coursing meetings?  Is he aware that the Irish Coursing Club stated that the average is four hares?  In view of the unacceptably high number of hares killed at this meeting, can the <Col N="1384" /> Minister state what action can be taken when this occurs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the wildlife ranger attended on the entire first day of the coursing meeting.  He was satisfied with the arrangements that were being made and that there were no breaches of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  As far as I know, that Act ensures that a report must be given to the wildlife section on the coursing meeting.  As regards acceptable averages of hares killed, I do not think that there is any acceptable average, but one would have to take into account that the Listowel coursing meeting is one of the largest in the country.  Consequently, the number of hares to be killed on any day at such a big meeting would be greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>How can an officer of the wildlife section monitor a coursing meeting if he only attends the first day of that meeting?  Is that the practice all the time?  Is it not normal to attend for the full duration of the meeting, if one is to monitor all meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In order for State officers to give a proper report and to observe in the most positive way possible and get the maximum information, they use various systems.  Sometimes they come on the first day of a meeting; sometimes midway through the meeting, and sometimes on the last day.  This is normally the practice.  The wildlife ranger on this occasion came on the first day of the meeting and was satisfied that the proper regulations and requirements were being adhered to.  Consequently, he filed his report to this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and previous replies given in this House, are any changes envisaged in relation to the attendance of wildlife rangers at future coursing meetings?  Specifically, how can the abuse, for example, of rerunning hares be examined unless an entire coursing meeting is attended?  Is it the Minister's intention to instruct his officials to attend <Col N="1385" /> meetings in their entirety without prior warning to those involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me is that there is a large hare population in this State at this time. Consequently, the necessity to re-run hares is not very great.  It would be hoped that a wildlife ranger would attend almost every meeting if possible and that adequate reports would be forwarded.  If the Deputy or, indeed, any other person has any complaints regarding actions that occur at any of these coursing meetings, I and my Department will be only too delighted to have them investigated thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a submission to the effect that hares are, in fact, in a very poor condition when being coursed and that there is not any adequate provision there to ensure that they have been properly treated since capture and before they are coursed.  Has the wildlife ranger any function in finding out the circumstances in which they were kept prior to being coursed, the length of time they have been kept in those conditions and the effect of those conditions on them?  I put it to the Minister that if there is a very high rate of kill it can only be indicative either of poor treatment of the hares prior to being coursed or of their being rerun, as Deputy Higgins has suggested. There cannot be any other explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the duty of the wildlife rangers to investigate the circumstances of the hares' captivity?  Without that investigation, how can anybody give the Minister a report?  Somebody must be there checking, from an objective, independent point of view, whether or not the hares are being properly treated.  I suggest that if the Minister is not willing to check that, he should now end the whole business of coursing hares. It is cruel and he is not providing any safeguard to stop that cruelty.</P>

There is no point in making allegations in this House unless <Col N="1387" /> one brings forward the evidence to allow the officers of the State to investigate any given situation to see whether what has been alleged did or did not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for ensuring that public expenditure programmes give value for money and are managed efficiently lies with the Departments concerned.  Secretaries of Departments, as accounting officers, are responsible for the efficiency and economy of administration in their Departments.</P>
      <P>With a view to promoting good management in Departments, my Department have launched a number of major initiatives in recent years.  These include the issue of guidelines for developing systems of financial management and a requirement that all Departments adopt departmental management systems with common essential features.  Such systems provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for planning on the basis of expenditure programmes and activities and active review mechanisms.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department are reviewing the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to see if proposals could be prepared to extend his remit to include considerations of effectiveness and efficiency.</P>

Would he inform us if he can, of the cost per annum of producing the comprehensive programme on public expenditure and would he not now, even at this stage, <Col N="1389" /> especially since public expenditure is so much an issue of public importance, reconsider the decision taken to end the production of this programme on an annual basis in order to inform the public as to the real extent and nature of the difficulty with public finances and public spending?</P>

A volume of comprehensive public expenditure programmes for 1986 was published in December 1986 and it was intimated in the introduction to that volume that for the future a summary of financial data would be published annually with updates of the programme statements being published at less frequent intervals.  In line with this arrangement, a summary of the public expenditure programmes for 1987 which gives a summary of the financial data of each programme but which does not contain detailed programme statements was published in June of this year.  Therefore, information is being published in relation to that matter but I will convey the cost to the Deputy.</P>

We respond to the demands of the Department of Justice and to their priorities and based on those priorities Ballyheigue will be reached as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's reply to the supplementary question from Deputy Deenihan on Question No. 2 I would again request the Minister to relent in relation to making available the information on the basis that what we are talking about is not specific confidential information.  We are talking about a general slide rule of economic capacity which for non-assessed areas would provide a very valuable signpost without in any way divulging confidential minutiae, and it would seem somewhat of a shame to confine this information to the archives when it could be of general application in particular areas.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply I would like to ask him if the figure of £17.3 million on 3 December shows that the £25 million he referred to in the budget speech is not going to be achieved.  Secondly, can I ask him whether the insignificant number of refunds shows that the safeguards which he said were in existence for people who <Col N="1398" /> would be adversely affected by this tax simply do not work?  Thirdly, can he get the other information which Deputy Cullen sought in this question and make it available to this House?  We were asked on faith to implement this system on the basis that it would do no injustice and we now find ourselves in the position that the safeguards are only worked to an insignificant extent.</P>

      <P>Without going into details &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy does not want to delay the House because he wants to have other questions replied to today &mdash; there are procedures laid down in the 1987 Act and once they are complied with the refund mechanism works fast.  If a taxpayer has his tax based on his previous accounting period paid up and is in excess of that figure, then he is entitled to a refund on the excess, provided he submits his claim with the appropriate form.  If there are any particular cases where the Deputy feels that people who should have got refunds have not got them I would be very anxious to hear about them because I have given a commitment in this House, as Deputies McDowell and Noonan and others who were involved in the Finance Bill know, that this refund mechanism would work efficiently and effectively.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 28 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>Based on expenditure returns from Departments, the present indications are that the Exchequer pay and pensions bill, including the exceptional costs arising under the voluntary early retirement scheme, is likely to be somewhat below the budget target.</P>
      <P>My Department are actively co-ordinating the application of the voluntary early retirement package and redeployment in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to a target of 10,000 redundancies this year.  This is a misinterpretation of my earlier statement <Col N="1405" /> that the number on the public sector payroll, including local authorities, would fall by approximately 10,000.  As I have previously indicated, this does not imply any specific figure for redundancy or early retirement since the reduction will be achieved by a combination of natural wastage, career breaks, and the scheme of voluntary early retirement.  To date, the early retirement package has been offered to about 13,500 public servants. About 900 have accepted and will be leaving during 1987.  The redundancy lump sums and related payments due in 1987 will amount to £10 million.  I intend to introduce an additional Estimate for this amount in the Dáil this week.</P>
    <P>In relation to 1988, the position is that in many areas of the public service the offer of voluntary early retirement will be made in the course of the year.  Some public service employers such as health agencies and local authorities have not yet decided on the appropriate level of staffing in 1988, in the light of their 1988 allocations so it is not known how many redundancies they will be seeking.  It is therefore not possible at this stage to give a number of redundancy acceptances for 1988.  However, within this constraint, it is tentatively estimated that the requirement for lump sum payments in 1988 will be in the region of £80 to £100 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the financing of these lumpsum payments I am pleased to report that the board of the Central Bank have now approved of arrangements under which the Bank will make advance payments of surplus income to the Exchequer, so as to assist the Exchequer in meeting the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme.</P>
    <P>The arrangements are in accordance with section 63 (7) of the Currency Act, 1927 which provides that the Central Bank may at any time pay into the Exchequer such sums on account of surplus income as may be agreed upon by the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I should explain that in the normal course the Exchequer receives from the Central Bank each year the surplus <Col N="1406" /> income earned by the bank in the previous year, less certain appropriations to the reserves of the bank.  Under the arrangements now agreed with the bank the Exchequer will receive in 1988, in addition to the normal payment of the surplus income from 1987, an advance payment out of the surplus the Central Bank will earn in 1988.  The amount of this advance of surplus income will be sufficient to cover the cost of the lumpsum redundancy payments, most of which will fall in 1988 as I have indicated. The result will be that the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme will be financed by the additional surplus income from the Central Bank, and will not add to either the current budget deficit or the Exchequer borrowing requirement. The additional surplus income from the Central Bank will come into the Exchequer as non-tax revenue in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The advance by the Central Bank will be repaid.  Repayments will be financed out of the annual savings to the Exchequer from the redundancy programme. Therefore, the exceptional lump-sum payments will not increase the national debt or the cost of servicing it.</P>
    <P>The repayments will take the form of four equal annual deductions by the Central Bank from the normal payments of surplus income for the years 1990 to 1993 inclusive.  This repayment period was agreed by the bank so as to allow the full impact of the savings to come through to the Exchequer and to ensure that realised savings are adequate to meet repayments to the bank.</P>
    <P>The bank has also agreed to finance the £10 million of lump sum payments that are expected to arise this year under the scheme.  Similar financing and repayment arrangements to those that I have already outlined, in respect of the 1988 costs of the redundancy lump sum, will apply.</P>
    <P>In agreeing to the financing arrangements the Central Bank indicated that they had taken into account the exceptional costs of the redundancy programme and the strenuous efforts being made by the Government to secure a <Col N="1407" /> lasting reduction in public expenditure and borrowing.  I want to place on record the Government's appreciation of the constructive attitude adopted by the bank in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just had the alarming disclosure today that between £80 million and £1,000 million will be borrowed next year, together with £10 million by way of an advance to cover this year, and that that money must be repaid by 1993.  Circular madness has afflicted the Government in that they are firing 900 public servants this year and between 8,000 and 10,000 next year.  They will have to pay for all that by way of advances from the Central Bank on normal surpluses which would go into non-tax revenue to keep the day to day administration going.  Will the Minister agree that such a strategy would make any respectable Minister for Finance with responsibility for the public service contemplate resignation if he was handling any other public service employment in the State?  Will the Minister agree that the whole tattered edifice of laying off 10,000 people needlessly thus dramatically diminishing the quality of the public service, in the areas of environment, education and health, for no good purpose other than giving people lump sum payments from the Central Bank surplus to be repaid by 1993 is wrong?</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I notice that the Minister in his reply referred to 900 acceptances of redundancies.  I am not sure whether it includes early retirement, but out of a total of 13,500 who applied there was an objective of 10,000 presumably which was announced in July.  I cannot understand why the Minister is claiming that that is successful, but my question related to whether the public service pay bill for this year remains in place as it was announced to be because the Government obviously wanted further redundancies and have not got them. So, is the public service pay bill going to remain as it was intended to be?</P>

      <P>The simple answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I can give the Deputy the details if she so wishes because that question was asked.  As I said in my reply, it would be below the amounts.  In the budget for this year it was £2,833 million.  It will now be £2,813 million.  That is a saving of £20 million which comes about as follows: Civil Service nil, Garda minus £1 million, education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No agreement has yet been entered into with any of the firms involved but the nature of the agreement will be such that the accommodation so provided will be purchased by the commissioners over a 20 year period from completion.

It is an extraordinary situation and, on top of what we heard about the Central Bank funding already, it is something to which I will certainly return.  An interest rate of 13 per cent over 20 years is an extraordinary handout to the private sector to carry out a decentralisation policy and it does not fit in very easily with the Minister's commitment to controlling public expenditure.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the fact that an assistant secretary at his Department while addressing a seminar organised by Financial Services Industry Association on 17 November 1987 on the attractions of the Customs House Docks site, Dublin 1, as a location for financial services, stated that initially it was envisaged that there should be no transfer at all of existing activities but that it was realised that in the real world an absolute position made no sense; if this signals a change of policy by the Government, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change of policy.  As I said in this House on 5 November in response to other questions on the Custom House Docks area, the purpose of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) is not to facilitate transfers of activities from elsewhere in Ireland.  Nevertheless, transfers into the area may be fully justified where there are plans for significant expansion in the scale of the activities in question in <Col N="1417" /> response to the stimulus of the favourable environment of the IFSC.  To refuse permission for such transfers would not serve the best interests of the economy since the increased profits and employment thereby arising would compensate for any tax loss on foot of the reduced rate of corporation tax.  The Deputy will appreciate that companies, whether starting up new operations in the Custom House Docks area or relocating from abroad or from elsewhere in Ireland, may qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax on profits derived from international business only.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on the specific forecasts made by the Central Bank or, indeed, by any of the other agencies which have thus far given their assessments of the 1988 economic outlook. Neither do I propose to publish at this time my Department's precise assessment of that outlook either on a preor post-budget basis.  In accordance with established practice this assessment will be published around the time of the budget when the picture for both 1987 and 1988 should be much clearer.</P>
      <P>However, the independent forecasts available suggest that, while growth in gross domestic product will continue next year, gross national product will show little change and, depending on the behaviour of net factor outflows, could indeed fall marginally reflecting, in part, the short term impact of the Government's budgetary strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's general budgetary strategy for 1988 is, however, strongly supported by most independent analysts. The Central Bank have stated that the firm steps which the Government have taken so far to rectify the condition of the public finances will, if maintained and followed through, lay the foundations for sound economic growth for the future. The Economic and Social Research Institute have made the point that the limited growth prospect in 1988 would <Col N="1419" /> appear to be a reasonable price to pay for a substantial change in the structure of the economy and that 1988 could come to be seen as a year in which the conditions for long term recovery were created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the latest unpublished ESRI forecast given to him &mdash; I think in the last week &mdash; shows that the downturn of GNP will continue into 1989 and may show some balancing out in 1990?  Far from the optimistic assurances given to us today, the extraordinary deflationary policies followed by the Government have, effectively, knocked the bottom out of the economy for 1988 and 1989?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same kind of accusations were made in March and April this year.  The budget was published on 31 March and over the following weeks we were accused of adopting deflationary policies and that there would be negative &mdash; indeed minus &mdash; growth in the economy this year.  I said the figures were based on a 1 per cent growth.  The Deputy laughed, just as he did today, in relation to this matter.  That figure has now changed to 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.  Because of the good management of the economy in the past nine months, and which will continue for the next number of years, we will succeed in going beyond, as we have done this year, the forecasts that were made.</P>

The Central Bank, the ESRI and even Allied Irish Banks have forecast that next year there will be at least a 1 per cent drop in GNP <Col N="1420" /> and in the following year, 1989, there will be a further 1 per cent reduction in GNP and that is not controverted by any officer of his Department or by any other independent commentator in the State.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour in view of the crisis situation at B &amp; I if he will seek an immediate meeting of the Employer-Labour Conference <Col N="1421" /> to bring this protracted and unnecessary dispute to an immediate end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to make the B &amp; I a viable operation, a survival plan was drawn up which provided for significant cost savings.  The unions representing both clerical and operative grades have accepted the cost-cutting proposals in order to save the company.  The only outstanding problem is the reluctance of the 130 officers, members of the FWUI, to make similar concessions.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court intervened in an effort to resolve the problem with the officers.  The court issued a recommendation on 18 November which was accepted by the company but rejected by the officers.  Several attempts have been made to resolve the issue since then but without success.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the matter last week and stated that it was not prepared to consider a B &amp; I plan of action which had not secured across-theboard support of the company's workforce. Seven days were allowed by the Government from the date of that statement after which a decision would be made by the Government on the future of the B &amp; I.  That seven-day period expires tomorrow.  After their meeting yesterday, the Government reaffirmed their position.</P>
      <P>I met a delegation of the officers this morning together with the General Secretary of the FWUI and I underlined the abolute firmness of the Government's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that this is not a normal industrial dispute.  Last May the Government directed the B &amp; I to submit a plan of action for implementation in the autumn aimed at restoring the company to viability.  Prolonged negotiations followed and a Labour Court hearing.  It is now December and I cannot emphasise strongly enough that B &amp; I are on the verge of immediate closure.  While normal working continues today, unless there is a change in the <Col N="1422" /> officers' position, every job in the B &amp; I is in immediate jeopardy.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances which I have outlined, I see no role for the Employer-Labour Conference.  If the officers fail to support the company's plan of action the Government will be left with no option but to withdraw financial support with the obvious and inevitable consequences which would mean the end of the B &amp; I.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the information which the Minister has given us, surely it is incumbent upon him as the Minister responsible for good industrial relations to make at least one last effort to ensure that an arrangement is arrived at with the officers and their union to meet the deadline or, in the event of that deadline not being possible while discussions take place, that the deadline be extended.  The Minister, since coming to office, has been involved in a number of disputes and with some success.  In view of the fact that a strategic fleet is concerned and the need to maintain a strategic fleet, which was the catchcry when the Government representatives were on these benches, the Minister should make this last effort to extend the time available for talks to take place.  If he thinks the Employer Labour Conference are not in a position to intervene, he should take this step rather than let this important national body go into liquidation. When so many other members of the B &amp; I employees have arrived at very severe decisions which will mean a reduction of hundreds of jobs in that company, the Minister should not allow this one last hurdle to prevent him from arriving at a complete solution to the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the vast majority of the staff in B &amp; I have made major concessions to try to resolve this impasse.  The fact remains that following six months notice of the stated position of the Government, the Labour Court involvement and my own direct involvement, I have already done today what the Deputy is asking, at this stage there still appears to be a total <Col N="1423" /> impasse.  There is no more room for concessions or for brinkmanship.  The deadline is set for tomorrow night and if the agreed plan is not accepted the Government will withdraw their financial support. As I said, that will lead to inevitable consequences for B &amp; I and I have made that very clear face-to-face with both the trade union representatives of the B &amp; I officers and their shop stewards.  I cannot go any further than that.  If they will not listen and jeopardise the jobs of the other 1,300 employees in the B &amp; I, the matter is then outside my powers of persuasion to convince them otherwise.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the intervention of any other group or agency would assist at this stage.  I hope the officers have listened to what the Government have said since April, to what all the remaining members of the workforce of B &amp; I have said, to what the Labour Court have said and what a significant number of the Irish public have been saying to them.  I have reiterated the Government's position to them today in the strongest of terms and there the position lies until midnight tomorrow.</P>

      <P>This concerns the request that an amendment be made which will ensure that the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission will be laid before the House within 14 days of its receipt by the Minister.  The Minister could do that even though he has not made up his mind about the recommendations in it.  Laying it here would allow other viewpoints to be expressed if necessary before the Minister made his decision.  If a period of 14 days is too short, is the Minister prepared to accept a longer period?</P>

      <P>I accept the point made by the Deputy.  In practice all these reports are dealt with within three months.  While not being rigid about it I accept that a period of 14 days is unrealistic. We are putting in a statutory requirement.  If I suggested six months would the Deputy agree to that?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 18, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;18.&mdash;Section 18 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> `(3)  If, within a year of its having been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, a decision on any recommendation of a report made by the Commission has not yet been decided upon by the Government, the Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report indicating why a decision has not been made.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to deal with reports where no decision has been taken in the hope that public interest in the matter will wane and everybody will forget about it.  There have been some reports upon which no effective decision has been taken, for instance the 1982 report with regard to solicitors and conveyancing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the bane of your life, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It illustrates a large gap in the law in that the Minister responsible cannot act on the recommendations and the problem has to be passed to another Minister.  No decision is taken apart from referring the matter to another Department, which is not a decision at all.  This amendment requires that, if a decision has not been taken on a recommendation, the Minister will lay before each House of the Oireachtas within a year a report saying why a decision was not taken.  Apart from the report already mentioned, there is a report on the travel trade on which no effective decision has been taken.  A report of 20 April 1978 in regard to the supply and distribution of cinema films and making recommendations was not acted upon for the strange reason that there was no consensus in the trade on their operation. That is an odd reason why a statutory body could not make fair practice rules. That is not a satisfactory outcome.  That case probably illustrates better than the solicitors' case the need for an amendment of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abuses in the area of the distribution of films affect only a very small number of people so there is not likely to be as much public agitation about them as there is likely to be in relation to solicitors and conveyancing which affect many <Col N="1509" /> more people.  It is a problem that can lie there without being dealt with, a recommendation having been made but no action having been taken.  This amendment would require the Minister to give a report within a year if a decision has not been taken on a recommendation and it would act as a form of incentive to take a decision if a Minister does not want to lodge a report admitting that he has been unable to do anything about a recommendation. This would be a useful improvement in the law and I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. There is very little accountability to this House for the implementation of decisions taken by this House.  This amendment seeks to introduce the very important principle of accountability.  If decisions are not implemented by civil or public servants or by independent bodies, we should at least be given reasons as to why something has not been done.  This amendment gives a deadline so that people would know that, after a while, questions would be asked in the Dáil and criticism would be made by Members of this House if action was not taken on directives for the common good of the people.</P>
      <P>By accepting this amendment there would be a working period of one year to implement each recommendation which is certainly less than the average at present.  There is a strong case for this not only in the area of RPC reports but in the area of EC consumer directives on door to door selling, on toy safety and so on on which we are lagging two, three and four years behind.  On the grounds of accountability and of bringing a deadline into the system this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of this amendment.  We are talking about the same thing here as we did on amendment No. 4, which is what happens to reports of the commission and to the work the director does after it is completed.  Has it any relevance to reality?  This House <Col N="1510" /> bears a responsibility in relation to that. As Deputy Yates said, we must have accountability.  If we take a decision we want to see that it is implemented.  I am not altogether happy with the way this amendment is worded.  It leaves things rather loose in that the Minister has to indicate why a decision has not been made.  To indicate why something has not happened is more difficult than to indicate why something might have happened.</P>
      <P>I can also see there would be difficulties arising, for instance, as we have discussed earlier on, where another Department, other than the Department of Industry and Commerce might be dragging their heels or at fault.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is required to come in to the House and blame another Minister. I think that is not really workable. On the other hand, the principle behind the amendment is absolutely right, that is, if a decision is taken, or if a report is issued by a properly designated body set up by the Government or by this House, it should not be ignored.  There should be channels through which it will be implemented or at least given consideration by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of Deputy Bruton's amendment is to force the Minister, where a decision has not been made on any recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission, to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas indicating why no decision was made.</P>
      <P>In general terms, when the Minister has published a Restrictive Practices Commission report which made recommendations which the Minister was empowered to enforce, the Minister has pursued the recommendations without undue delay.  There is no evidence to suggest that the absence of a provision such as this has led to delay in action being taken on the basis of any commission report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of cases where the enforcement of the commission's recommendations was outside the Minister's powers, as Deputy Colley has said, due to the exclusions contained <Col N="1511" /> in the 1972 Act in relation to banking, transport services and other areas. However, most of these exclusions are now being removed and such problems should not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no need to build into this legislation a requirement that such a report would be laid before the Oireachtas.  It is not envisaged that there should be delays of this sort once this Bill has passed and, in any event, if any Deputy is concerned about the progress of action on any recommendation he can get that information by asking a question in Question Time.  At any rate I refer the Deputies to the provision in the Restrictive Practices Act in section 8 (4) which requires the Minister to make a statement to each House when he decides not to make an order as recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>The existence of this provision helps to ensure prompt action by the Minister and also ensures that the Oireachtas will be informed if the Minister does not propose to proceed with any of the commission's recommendations.  I recall the instance referred to by Deputy Bruton in relation to the cinema which was resolved by agreement within the trade subsequently. In relation to the Solicitors Act, a decision was taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce but, as we all recognise quite rightly, it is a matter for the Department of Justice to take it a stage further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to do all the work if I was given it but the practicalities of doing it are one thing.  If the Deputy wants to upturn the whole situation and hand me the power, we are heading towards dictatorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the provisions in section 8 (4) of the Principal Act.  I have no recollection of any such statement being made in regard to the failure to implement the provisions of the report on conveyancing, for example.  I am referring to a reply the Minister gave me to a question on the <Col N="1512" /> travel trade.  He said that an order was recommended in regard to the travel trade, the Attorney General decided that this was <i>ultra vires</i>, but no statement was made in accordance with section 8.  The same applies in regard to the report on the inquiry in regard to building societies. An order was recommended by the commission and, while the Minister for the Environment acted subsequently in regard to most of the matter contained therein, within a literal interpretation of section 8 (4) the then Minister should have lodged a statement.  That did not happen.  I have to say I was Minister at the time, but it was never brought to my attention that there was such an obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask himself why this did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was never drawn to my attention and that is a fact. If I was aware that there was a statutory obligation to do this I would have done it.  It seems that the Minister's defence so to speak, that this provision already exists is there on paper but not in reality.  The provision I am putting forward in this amendment is more explicit and relates particularly to making such a statement, either where a decision has been taken not to make an order, or where no decision has been taken, that in both such situations a statement should be laid.  It may be that the technicality upon which officialdom did not recommend the laying of a statement under section 8 was that no decision had actually been taken not to make an order &mdash; it just had not been done &mdash; and therefore they did not feel there was an obligation on them to lay the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear if that is the case that a very cavalier attitude was being taken at the time in regard to the obligations under section 8.  I feel that my proposed amendment would make it more explicit. I accept fully that in normal times, in 95 per cent of the cases, this provision is irrelevant because the Minister will act. It is simply there as a safeguard, as a long stop.  Where there is a conspiracy <Col N="1513" /> of inaction of some kind or another in respect of a particular matter, there should be accountability.  We are not asking for anything draconian or costly, simply the laying of a statement which would appear on the back of the Order Paper on a particular day, no greater fuss than that, saying that in accordance with the section an order has not been made within 12 months for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister says rightly that this information could be obtained by means of a Parliamentary Question.  That would not have the same disciplinary effect because, to be quite frank about it &mdash; and Deputy Yates referred to this &mdash; you never know when a Parliamentary Question is going to come in.  They can come in any week and they do not have the same deadline creating effect whereas, if there is an obligation to lay a statement within 12 months of the original, because of the way organisations work, there will be a tendency at least if a thing is dragging on to avoid having to make that statement on the date specified. I believe this amendment will be valuable.  The Minister has shown himself in this debate willing to accept reasonable suggestions from this side of the House. He will probably agree on reflection that this is a reasonable enough suggestion and I hope he will be able to see his way to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification may I ask Deputy Bruton what is he really saying &mdash; if no order has been made or if no decision has been taken?</P>

      <P>What the amendment says is that, if within a year of its having been laid before each House of the Oireachtas &mdash; there is a bit of mis-drafting; the amendment is not properly drafted &mdash; a decision has not been made on a recommendation by the commission, the Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report indicating why a decision has not been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that in section 8 (4) there is a sufficient safeguard. I am prepared to look at the Deputy's amendment but I could not take that wording on board for a start.  As I see it, there are sufficient safeguards.  The House has its own ways of being accountable. I cannot accept that nobody knows when Question Time is coming on.  It is pretty well ordered.  We do the rounds as everybody knows, and the information can be got in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As someone who puts down quite a lot of questions I find, as the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle have often advised Deputies, they are in no way responsible for the answer that may be given to a question. The answer may not allude to any reason why a decision may not be given, or it may just state, as many Dáil replies do, that the matter is under active or serious consideration.  It may not give the reason a decision has not been taken.  This amendment seeks to provide that there should be some accountability.  If the amendment provided that there had to be implementation within a year there might well be problems.  For instance, if there were two general elections held in one year it might not be possible to get it drafted within a year.  All that is required is a short statement from the Minister indicating that the Government have decided to proceed with the recommendation. A statement of intent is sought or else an explanation.  That is eminently reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Bruton, I have not had the honour of working with civil servants but I was in no way surprised by the Civil Service text which the Minister read out <Col N="1515" /> in his initial reply.  My impression is that anything which creates additional accountability in the Civil Service is not approved of.  I ask the Minister to make an independent decision and to accept an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not join in any abuse.  The prospects of getting this amendment through depend on mutual goodwill among those who are listening to the debate as well as participating.  I will suggest a possible improvement on my amendment which I will put down on Report Stage.  Relying on section 8 (4) of the Principal Act, I would suggest that the subsection might be redrafted as follows:</P>
      <P>If the Commission, in a report to the Minister, recommend the making of an order and the Minister decides not to make any order or has not made such an order, he shall, as soon as possible or within a year whichever is the lesser time after he has received the report, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement giving the reasons for his decision.</P>
      <P>That would deal with cases where he has made a positive decision not to make an order and also with cases where he simply has not made any decision.  It would put a limit of one year on the lodging of such a statement.</P>
      <P>I accept that some gremlin got into the drafting of my amendment and that there is some tautology.  I do not think it is acceptable in its present form.  The amendment I suggest to subsection (4) is within the spirit of what is intended in the Principal Act.  It is not a very radical departure.  The introduction of a time limit of one year would deal with the minority of cases which are not acted upon.</P>

      <P>Sections 10 and 22 deal with new services which are now being included.  Could the Minister clarify why under section 22 (4) a local authority is exempt but a health board is not exempt? These new areas were listed in section 10 and one of the exemptions related to a local authority.  This was questioned this morning.  Deputy Bruton gave the example of refuse collection as one area whose exemption was questionable.  Why are the actions of health boards being treated differently from those of local authorities since they are within the same ambit?</P>

Most of these services &mdash; road repairs, bin collections and so on &mdash; are carried out exclusively by local authorities on a non-commercial basis so there is no element of competition involved. These activities are closely regulated by the local authorities themselves and by the Department of the Environment. Services provided under contract employment will also continue to be excluded from the Act.  They are already governed by the others.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 not moved.</P>

      <Col N="1518" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 23, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;23.&mdash;The Schedule to the Act of 1978 is amended by the addition of a new paragraph (j):</P>
      <P>`(j) the extent to which any damage caused in the short-term under the headings listed in this Schedule, will or is likely to be mitigated by the entry of new competition into the business in accordance with their right to freedom of establishment under the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment widens the criteria in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, which have to be taken into account in deciding whether a merger should be allowed.  The Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act was passed in 1978 but the criteria, strangely, make no reference to the likelihood that a dominant position created in the market by a particular merger is in practice vulnerable to competition from outside Ireland, but from within somewhere else in the Community, in that under the Treaty of Rome there is a freedom of establishment right for other operators.  Let us say that the Minister is worried about a merger between two firms in the bakery business which would give them, say, a 70 per cent control in the market on the figures at that time and that the Minister does not want that to happen because he feels they might make over large profits.  If there was no freedom for bakers from outside the Republic to establish here that could be a very serious matter.  On the other hand if &mdash; as there is &mdash; there was complete freedom for others to come in here, as they certainly would do if that merger gave the new firms such a dominant position that they were able to make excessive profits; those profits would attract somebody else into the market, either they would attract <Col N="1519" /> somebody else to sell goods here or would come in here and start producing within the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>My amendment would simply add to the list of criteria to be taken into account, the extent to which any damage caused under the headings listed in the Schedule will be mitigated, or is likely to be mitigated, by the entry of new competition into the business in question in accordance with their right to freedom of establishment under the Treaty establishing the European Community.  This amendment would not mean that the Minister would be in any way prevented from banning a merger because there was the right of establishment for somebody else.  All it means is that the Act, which at present takes no account of the right of freedom of establishment, would take that into account as well as all the other factors that it already takes into account in coming to a conclusion as to whether a particular merger or monopoly should be stopped or broken up.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the Act which was passed five years after we had entered the EC did not advert to the fact that many apparent monopolies are not as secure as a result of the freedom of establishment provisions as they would have been before we entered.  The amendment here would simply add this to the list of criteria that have to be taken into account.  It is a useful improvement to the legislation and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>In this amendment, Deputy Bruton is proposing that a new criterion should be added to the list of criteria already contained in the Schedule to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  This Schedule and the criteria contained therein relate to sections 7(b) and 8(2) of the Act.  What is provided at present is that the examiner in his investigation of a proposed merger, which has been referred to him by the Minister, must have regard to the criteria in the Schedule. Similarly under section 8(2) the examiner in reporting on his investigations <Col N="1520" /> must give his opinion as to whether the proposed merger or takeover would operate against the common good in respect of the Schedule criteria.  These functions which at present are carried out by the examiner will in future be carried out by the Fair Trade Commission by virtue of section 7 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The criterion Deputy Bruton is proposing for inclusion in the Schedule is that one of the matters to be taken into account in deciding whether a proposed merger or takeover should be allowed is the extent to which any damage caused in the short term is likely to be mitigated by the entry of new competition into the business concerned.  This addition is not necessary as the aim of the provision is implicit in paragraph (a) of the Schedule which states:</P>
      <P>The extent to which the proposed merger or take-over would be likely to prevent or restrict competition or to restrain trade or the provision of any service.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposed provision would be to qualify paragraph (a) in the Schedule but only in a partial and incomplete way.  Why refer to competition arising from the right of establishment and not from the rights of free trade in goods or in services?  Why refer only to new competition arising from the exercise of Treaty rights and not to competition arising from the normal operations of the market?  I would refer the Deputy to section 9(3) of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, which states:</P>
      <P>Before making an order under this section the Minister shall have regard to any relevant international obligations of the State.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy is proposing is well catered for in this section so it would be bad, it would be incomplete and it would cause confusion to include the amendment now.  Perhaps what is stated in section 9(3) will satisfy the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification on this section.  Does this refer to the people who are priceline inspectors being referred to operate under the new office? In that context it is often said &mdash; especially if you table a parliamentary question, a procedure the Minister is so fond of &mdash; that the Minister still retains the full powers under the Prices Act, 1958, in respect of price control.  Do I take it that these officers would still be available to do priceline work if the Minister saw fit?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) section 25 of the Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to repeal <Col N="1522" /> section 25 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which states:</P>
    <P>A contract for the supply of any goods or the provision of any services shall not be void or unenforceable by reason only of a contravention of any provision of the Acts or this Act.</P>
    <P>Basically that means that failure to comply with the legal obligation of truthful advertising shall not interfere with any existing contractual right; in other words, the pursuit of consumer information rights and the assertion of the guarantee against misleading advertising does not invoke civil law.  It is a right that can be asserted only on the basis of criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to suggest that if a person places an advertisement which is misleading then the contract to which the advertisement led is void.  I understand the difficulty with this proposal could be that if the contract is void it could be void for both sides; in other words, the consumer who had a right, who had paid for something &mdash; if there happened to have been a misleading advertisement &mdash; even though he himself was not misled could find his contract would be void.  That is not the intention of the amendment but it could be its result.  For that reason I do not propose to pursue this amendment.  What I was trying to get at was something more on the lines of what Deputy Yates referred to earlier when he expressed a preference for having legislation as far as possible enforced by civil law rather than having to rely on criminal sanctions.</P>
    <P>One possibility &mdash; but I would not be over-enthusiastic about it &mdash; would be to say something along the lines that the person who sells goods and is found to have used misleading advertising as a means of selling them shall not have any contractual rights against the consumer but that the consumer would retain all of his contractual rights against the seller; in other words, the only person who would lose his contractual rights would be the person who had committed the offence. This would render the use of misleading advertising a lot less attractive in that not <Col N="1523" /> only would there be a fear on the part of the misleading advertiser that he would be liable, if caught by the Director of Consumer Affairs, to a criminal prosecution &mdash; and I suppose there is a possibility that many people would not be caught &mdash; but also he would face the prospect that if he went to collect a debt owing to him by somebody who had acted on the basis of a misleading advertisement, he could not collect that debt. That would make people a lot more careful about the accuracy of advertisements.</P>
    <P>The amendment, as drafted, is not one I would wish to press.  Perhaps the Minister could look at the refinement of it I have just suggested between now and Report Stage to ascertain whether it would have any advantage.  I am not certain there would be but perhaps for the sake of debate I may draft an amendment and talk about it at a later stage.  It would be helpful if the Minister could give me even a preliminary response to the idea at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are fairly strong civil remedies available already.  For instance, if a buyer of goods considers he has suffered loss by virtue of misleading advertising or misdescription of goods he will have a right of action at common law on the basis of misrepresentation.  In such circumstances he will, at the very least, be entitled to damages.  Furthermore, if he can show that a claim made in an advertisement or in a description of goods formed an integral part of a contract the courts may &mdash; as they have done in the past &mdash; decide that the misrepresentation was, in essence a term of contract.  In such a case the seller would be liable for breach of contract.  Taking this one step further, if the court was of opinion that the term so introduced was fundamental to the contract it could order that the entire contract be set aside on the basis of common law doctrines of fundamental breach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the balance of remedies available to the consumer at present by virtue of the combined effect of section 25 of the Consumer Information Act, <Col N="1524" /> 1978, and the common law rules relating to misrepresentation and breach of contract provide far greater protection for the consumer than would be the case if section 25 of the Act were to be repealed. It is my view that, if repealed, it could work against the best interests of the consumer in the manner in which we have been discussing.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 28 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I mentioned my dissatisfaction with certain elements of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  In relation to section 28 of this Bill, which seeks to amend that Act, perhaps I should quote section 28 (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>the substitution for subsection (1) of section 13 of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where an advertisement in relation to the supply or provision of any goods, services, accommodation or facilities is published and does not include the name and address of the person who procured such publication or his agent, the publisher of the advertisement, shall, if the Director or an officer of the Minister so requests within 12 months of the publication of the advertisement, give to the Director or officer the name and address of such person or his agent.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether that covers in any way the new area of advertising which is a lot more subtle and slick than that prevalent in 1978 at the time of passage of the Consumer Information Act? Here I am referring to public relations, as they are commonly known, whereby there are supplements in newspapers &mdash;<i>The Motoring Times</i> for example &mdash; supplements such as property supplements, when there are advertisements in different parts but the central part is an article perhaps written by the editor of the particular supplement.  What the consumer is not told is that that article is also bought <Col N="1525" /> and paid for by those who placed the advertisement in the remainder of the page.  What I am endeavouring to ascertain here is whether in such instances there is any obligation on the advertiser to declare that this whole page is bought and paid for, that the particular correspondent may not be giving his totally objective opinion such as he would give in his normal weekly column but rather that he is filling in something that is a money-spinner for that medium?  Under the law as it stands I understand that one must state somewhere on the relevant page that it is an advertisement but that can be in very small print.  The position obtaining is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask is it in order that the Minister considers this on Report Stage but, more especially &mdash; if he cannot &mdash; that he would give this matter his urgent attention.  I believe the framework within which the Consumer Information Act was drafted in 1978 and the type of misleading advertisements its provisions endeavoured to deal with are now out of date.  The competitiveness in sharp marketing practices is such that one cannot but realise that time has moved on.  We were all made aware of this recently when a motor car company advertised the comments of individual motoring correspondents on the advantages of their cars.  Of course, these motoring correspondents were well wined and dined and given details of all the different benefits of the attributes of the cars.  What I am trying to get at here is the subtlety of public relations and the hoards of new public relations companies that have been set up in the last couple of years, where the pace of that development has been kept up by this Act.  I wonder whether this section can, in any way, deal with that new phenomenon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing here with an overhaul of the Consumer Information Act.  Paragraph (a) in section 28 is purely a technical provision and is consequent on the provision of paragraph (c) of this section of the Bill which removes the power to prosecute which local authorities currently have in <Col N="1526" /> relation to offences under the Consumer Information Act.  I do not know how the Deputy managed to get that discussion in under that technical section, but he did well.</P>
      <P>Under section 13 of the 1978 Act as it stands, the Director of Consumer Affairs, or an officer of the Minister, or an officer of the local authority may request information in relation to the publication of advertisements.  This amendment removes the reference to a local authority.  It is purely technical and nothing more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9a:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.  Section 26 of the Act of 1978 is hereby amended by the deletion of subsection (4) (a) and the substitution therefor of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> `(4) (a) Every order made under section 9, 10, 11 or 12 of this Act, or under paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling it is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order has been laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has been a bit of a problem here with some of the orders under the Consumer Information Act.  For instance, orders were being made recently to provide for disclosure of the true rate of interest in regard to consumer credit transactions; this order was laid before the Dáil in March and was not taken until last week.  It was laid before the Seanad as well and was taken there quite quickly. The reason for that is that the Seanad is not dealing with financial business and perhaps, not being quite as rumbustious a place as far as debate is concerned, tends to have more time for dealing with matters and tends to deal with things more quickly.  I am not trying to provoke Deputy Colley in any of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Seanad should continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments I am putting forward are alternatives.  One would dispense altogether with the requirement for a debate in respect of Consumer Information Act orders and also in respect of Sale of Goods Act orders.  These are basically orders extending the requirement to give truthful information or extending the requirement in regard to the particular nature of contracts &mdash; either that contracts should be specified in writing or that certain contracts should have a certain typeface so they can be easily read.  They are not contentious issues by their nature unlike, for instance, <Col N="1528" /> some of the orders that might be made under the Restrictive Practices Act where there is a contentious balancing of various interests and it is appropriate that orders under the Restrictive Practices Act should, in all cases, have to be approved here.  I am not proposing to change that but in respect of orders made under the Consumer Information Act and the Sale of Goods Act, there is a case for a speedier procedure, particularly in regard to approval by the Dáil.  It is a pity that the consumer credit order which was very important and valuable to a vulnerable section of the community was not in force from March right up to last week because it was not possible to find time here in the House to debate it.  I am not making any reference as to why that happened. It is really irrelevant.  We know that the House is pretty busy and there are pressures on the Government Whip to get other legislation through.  I am not trying to cast any aspersions on him or anyone else.  It could have happened under any administration.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking however is an improved procedure.  There is a value in having these orders debated somewhere, if not in the Dáil, at least in the Seanad. The debate serves the purpose of highlighting the fact that the order is actually being made.  Therefore, I have an amendment drafted which is the one I would prefer and which I hope is the one the Minister will be able to accept.  I agree that what I am proposing is radical in the sense that it has never been done before. It provides for the retention of the requirement for a debate on an affirmative motion in the Seanad but that as far as the Dáil is concerned the order could be made simply by the laying of the order before the House, and if it is not annulled within 21 days it takes effect.  I hope therefore that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment to that effect allowing for a debate in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably agree that in regard to a new order of this kind a certain value is served by having the thing debated, in that public representatives become aware of it and there is some measure of publicity.  But that debate can <Col N="1529" /> take place just as easily in the Seanad as in the Dáil.  There is certainly no need for two debates, one in the Seanad and one in the Dáil.  I therefore urge the Minister to opt for the amendment that would allow the debate on the requirement to continue in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of what the Deputy is saying.  It was brought home forcibly to both of us and to the whole House.  But the order in relation to consumer credit was made 13 months ago and it took that long to find its way into the House in the first place, and finally got through last Friday.  It certainly would have been a great help to a very vulnerable section of the community, especially in the times in which we live when we hear and read enough in the papers about people being misled in relation to the true cost of credit.  In debating that order we agreed that it was ridiculous.  We are not passing the buck of blame around between one side and the other.  I had it on the Order Paper for ages and I just could not get it here.  I am certainly not against it, as I have shown throughout this Committee Stage.  I am here to improve anything we can improve.</P>
      <P>In response to what the Deputy is saying, I agree with the principle in (a) and (b).  This will be brought forward on Report Stage with very minor changes in the wording and we will all be doing a better job for passing these orders which are important.  We are not trying to bypass the Dáil or otherwise, as the Deputy remarked the last day, the way it stands at the moment is to the advantage of the Minister of the day because he is assured of some publicity but there are other ways and means for Opposition Deputies to get their say as well.</P>

      <P>The Opposition will always have an opportunity of putting down an annulment motion in the House, <Col N="1531" /> which can create the debate, if they so desire at any stage.  Under the Consumer Information Act of 1978, the order must be published and there will be plenty of attention and notice drawn to it as it has to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and at least one daily morning newspaper.  It is printed at least two months before the date of the making of the order.  Attention will be drawn to it and when it is published a statement will be issued about it and the Opposition will have the opportunity of putting down an annulment motion.  That would streamline the operation, rather than what we have seen here on the credit order for the last 13 months.  It is a move in the right direction. I could never understand why the old procedures had to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one problem. That is, that although the Opposition can do that, the Government have taken the view in the past in regard to motions to annul orders under this procedure that they must be debated in Private Members' time.  Originally, there was an obligation on the Government, as I understand it, that if a motion to annul an order were put down the Government provided time from their own time for that, on the basis that it was an important enough issue and something that an individual Deputy could bring up if he objected to a particular order, to get it debated.  That was the case when I came into the House in 1969.  Sometime, I think in the early seventies, the Government changed their view and said that if an annulment motion was put down it had to be debated in Private Members' time. The Minister probably knows very well that there is great competition in regard to Private Members' time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>And growing competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to what is put in. There is a desire on the part of various people to put in only matters which have a high political profile.  That means that some little order that has been made and that is foolish in some respects will not <Col N="1532" /> be allowed time within so-called Private Members' time.  This is, in fact, not really Private Members' time &mdash; it is Opposition party time.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is possible for the Minister to change the order of the House in this matter.  As he is inclined to accept this amendment could I ask him if he could inquire, through the Government Whip, whether in the unlikely event that an order is made under the new procedure and there is a motion to annul it, that motion would qualify for an hour's debating time from the Government, or would it be required to go in for the fulldress, three hour debate in Opposition party Private Members' time?  It seems that many of these annulment motions would probably contain one point that the Deputy wanted to make.  The whole debate could be over in half an hour if the Government were to provide that time on, say, a Friday or a Thursday.  I understand that the policy of precedent has been in recent times that such orders are not dealt with in that way.  They have to take their place in the queue for Private Members' time, which means never.  Perhaps the Minister could look into that, in consultation with the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, to see what would be the policy at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly do that, but would not like to be taken as in any way committing the Government to provide time.  We are trying here to improve the existing situation.  By going along with 9a and 9b we would be going a long way towards it.  In relation to Private Members' Time, I know that there is growing competition for it.  I shall inquire from the Chief Whip.  The Opposition have Private Members' Time and I am not going to enter into the argument as to what they should use it for.  They will always use it to their own best advantage and that is what we expect them to do.</P>

      <P>Since I became a Member of the House I have been struck by the annulment procedure, that it is so restrictive. If it is written into legislation that it is open to any Member of the House to put a motion forward to annul an order and that order is brought in through Government business, then it seems that any motion to annul should also be seen as Government business rather than Private Members' Business and I shall be putting that case very strongly.  I do not know if it is in Standing Orders or a precedent.  If it is a precedent, it should be challenged and challenged strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Section 10 of the Act of 1980 is hereby amended by the substitution in the Table for section 14 of the following new section:</P>
      <P>`14.&mdash;(1)  Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the contract are of acceptable quality.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Act, goods are of acceptable quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as acceptable, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate <Col N="1535" /> cases aspects of the quality of goods&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied,</P>
    <P>(b)  appearance and finish,</P>
    <P>(c)  freedom from minor defects,</P>
    <P>(d)  safety, and</P>
    <P>(e)  durability.</P>
    <P>(4)  The term implied by subsection (1) above does not extend to any matter making the quality of goods unacceptable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  which is specifically drawn to the buyer's attention before the contract is made,</P>
    <P>(b)  Where the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, which that examination ought to reveal, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a contract for sale by sample, which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a little complicated.  It relates to the definition of merchantable quality in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  As the House is aware, there is an obligation on the seller of any goods under that Act to ensure that the goods are of merchantable quality.  There is an implied term to that effect in any contract. Merchantable quality is defined in various places in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and I quote from section 10 (3) of the new section 14 which contains the following definition:</P>
    <P>Goods are of merchantable quality if they are as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought and as durable as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied to them, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances, and any reference in this Act to unmerchantable goods shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> A similar definition is contained in section 15 (3) of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  The definition merchantable quality which is used in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, is similar to the definition which is used in the British legislation. Section 14 (3) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1979, in Britain refers to there being an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is the purpose for which the goods are commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the buyer did not rely on or it was unreasonable for him to rely on the skill or judgment of the seller or broker.</P>
    <P>I understand the definition of merchantable quality in the British Act is the same as the definition contained in the Irish Act.  However, the adequacy of this definition from the point of view of consumer protection has been the subject of an examination by the British Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in a report presented to the Houses of Parliament in May 1987.  They found a number of deficiencies in the definition which this amendment is designed to remedy in so far as Irish law is concerned.  The definition of merchantable quality in the British legislation did not include explicitly the appearance and finish of the goods in question, it included only that they be fit for their principal purpose.  In other words, a car could have scratched paintwork or have oil stains in the inside but so long as it could travel along the roads safely it might be deemed to be of merchantable quality and hence not capable of being rejected by the consumer.</P>
    <P>This deficiency particulary arises from a British court case, Millars of Falkirk and Turpie, in connection with a car which was reported in the <i>Scottish Law Times, 1976</i>.  There have been a succession of other judgments which have dealt with this subject but the conclusion of the Law Commission in Britain was that the question remains open as to whether every small matter which might <Col N="1537" /> be required to be corrected in a complicated new artefact, such a car, renders the goods unmerchantable.  The commission recommended an amendment to the British law along the lines of the amendment I have tabled here to include appearance, finish and freedom from minor defects as being qualities which should be present for a product to be deemed to be merchantable.</P>
    <P>The amendment also seeks to include the safety of the goods and this was not explicit in the existing British law.  To the best of my knowledge, it is only explicit in our law in respect of motor cars.  It is not explicit in respect of any other goods sold.  There are special sections in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act which contain a safety requirement in regard to motor cars but that is not a requirement in regard to any other goods. The new section which I propose also includes a reference to the durability of goods.  A motor car may be of merchantable quality on the day you buy it, in other words, it may travel the first 100 miles, but if it is not going reasonably well 5,000 miles later it could be reasonably argued that it was not of merchantable quality in the first place.  That is not explicit in the definition of merchantable quality currently used.  My amendment would introduce the concept of durability explicitly into the law.</P>
    <P>There are a number of exemptions contained in the amendment and these would not allow the consumer to rely on the law if the defects were specifically drawn to his attention or if he had examined the goods before he made the contract and thus should have seen the defects.  There are exemptions but they are not automatic in all cases.  That is one of the recommendations of the British Law Commission. In the nature of things it will probably find its way into British law in two or three years time and in the nature of things it will probably be considered for introduction into Irish law in about ten years time, as things tend to follow their imitative course.  I do not say that in any smart-aleck way because it is only normal that people look to other jui <Col N="1538" /> dictions where the legal systems and language is similar to see what is happening there, but it would be useful and something of value if we could have acted on a particular matter first and have the British finding out how it worked here and following us rather than the other way around.  It is in that spirit that I put forward this amendment.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that our provisions are, in fact, stronger than those contained in the original British legislation which was enacted the year before ours but my reading of the legislation suggests that the wording is very similar and if there are deficiencies in the British legislation in the matters I referred to these deficiencies would apply here also.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister, if he is making the case that the British legislation is different, would deal <i>seriatim</i> with the specific matters contained in the amendment and show how our legislation deals with those because it is probable that some, if not all, of the matters contained in my amendment are not dealt with in our definition of &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo;.  This amendment is an enhancement of consumer protection. It is not an amendment introduced off the top of my head.  It is based on a fairly extensive study which is contained in the document which I have here.  I know the Department will have received a copy of this document and have probably studied it as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad for once to be able to tell Deputy Bruton and the House that we are not behind but ahead of UK legislation.  I am satisfied that our definition is stronger than that in the UK legislation. What Deputy Bruton is proposing to replace is a provision in section 10 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, which itself replaced an earlier provision, the Sale of Goods Act, 1893. The provision essentially provides that, where a seller sells goods in the course of a business, a term will be implied into the contract of sale that the goods are of &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section goes on to define &ldquo;merchantable <Col N="1539" /> quality&rdquo; as meaning that the goods are as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought and &mdash; this is important &mdash; as durable as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied to them, the price if relevant, and all the other relevant circumstances. Under the other relevant circumstances, safety as expressed by Deputy Bruton is contained therein.  The effect of this term being implied in a contract for the sale of goods is that the term will apply to every such contract whether the contract is written or not and whether the term is expressly stated to be included in the contract or not.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Bruton is proposing is that the provision described above should be replaced by a new provision which would insert a new phrase that of &ldquo;acceptable quality&rdquo; for the present &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo;.  This new phrase he proposes should be defined as follows:</P>
    <P>Goods which are part of a contract should meet &ldquo;the standard that a reasonable person would regard as acceptable, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all other relevant circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy proposes that the term &ldquo;the quality of goods&rdquo; should be defined as set out in subsection (3) of the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment appears to be based, as the Deputy said, on a recommendation contained in a joint report recently published in the United Kingdom by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission on their examination of certain aspects of the law relating to the sale and supply of goods. However, it is important to realise that our definition of &ldquo;merchantable quality&rdquo; as presently contained in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, is considerably more beneficial to the consumer than its current equivalent in UK law.  The essential difference between our provision and that contained in the UK Supply of Goods and Services <Col N="1540" /> Act, 1982, is the inclusion in our law of the provision that goods, if they are to be considered to be of merchantable quality, must be &ldquo;as durable as it is reasonable to expect, having regard to any description applied to them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This element of durability is contained in subsection (3) of Deputy Bruton's proposed amendment.  So, it can be seen that a provision on the lines proposed by Deputy Bruton, and recommended in the UK by the law commissions, would considerably strengthen UK law in this area. It is not considered, however, that the adoption of this amendment in this country would provide the consumer with any greater protection than he has at present.</P>
    <P>I should point out, furthermore, that the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton which would, effectively, remove section 14 of the 1893 Act, as inserted by the 1980 Act, would have the effect of repealing other aspects of section 14 which are of value.  In particular, the removal of subsections (4) and (6) would be undesirable.  Subsection (4) provides that where a buyer of goods makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied. This, it is considered, is an important provision from a consumer protection point of view and should not be removed.  Similarly, subsection (6) should remain as it imposes liability on an agent to the same extent as liability would be imposed by virtue of section 14 on a principal.  Here again, the removal of these subsections would reduce the protection available to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I think that our definition is stronger than the UK one and the consumer is better looked after here than he is in the UK at present.  Maybe they should amend their legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to accept what the Minister said.  There is the reference to &ldquo;appearance and finish and freedom from minor defects&rdquo; in my amendment which is not contained in <Col N="1541" /> their existing definition.  I will consider whether or not it is worth attempting to incorporate those in a Report Stage amendment.  I am not sure, but I will consider it.</P>

      <P>Recently I spent time reading the annual reports of the past several years by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It seemed obvious from looking at the statistics in those annual reports that his powers of prosecution are mostly under the Consumer Information Act where he takes the case himself, as opposed to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act where it is up to the individual to take up the case.</P>
      <P>There were a number of instances dealing with holidays and different items where he brought the cases to court and lost a minority of them.  That would suggest to me to have less confidence than the Minister might have in the existing law. I would like if the Minister could respond to the query about whether he and his Department have any analysis of unsuccessful prosecutions since the passing of the 1980 Act and any areas where there are loopholes that could possibly be tightened. The Minister will be aware that the ban on advertising of low cost goods was found to be defective because of a loophole.  It might well be the case that Deputy Bruton's similar definitions might have a lot more clarity about them, given their source &mdash; the Law Reform Commission &mdash; and are worthy, therefore, of greater consideration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Section 20 of the Act of 1980 is hereby amended by the insertion in the Table thereto of the following new section:</P>
      <P>35A.&mdash;(1)  If the buyer&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  has the right to reject the goods by reason of a breach on the <Col N="1543" /> part of the seller that affects some or all of them, but</P>
    <P>(b)  accepts some of the goods, including, where there are any goods unaffected by the breach, all such goods,</P>
    <P>he does not by accepting them lose his right to reject the rest.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the case of a buyer having the right to reject an instalment of goods, subsection (1) above applies as if references to the goods were references to the goods comprised in the instalment.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of subsection (1) above, goods are affected by a breach if by reason of the breach they are not in conformity with the contract.</P>
    <P>(4)  This section applies unless a contrary intention appears in, or is to be implied from, the contract.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is also based on a recommendation of a report of the same UK Law Commission. The general rule under British law &mdash; I think it is the case here from my inexpert reading of our legislation &mdash; is that the buyer who accepts some of the goods which are part of a contract is treated as having accepted all of them and, having accepted some of them, he is unable to reject any of them even if he finds that some of the goods he receives subsequently are defective.  For instance, he is not allowed to reject any of the defective goods and keep the remainder. He will have to choose whether to reject the whole lot or accept them all.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to give a general right of partial rejection in cases where some of the goods delivered to the buyer do not conform with the contract requirements. The buyer would then no longer be compelled to reject all the non-conforming goods; he would have the freedom to reject some of them and keep some of them.  My amendment is in line with the US uniform and commercial code and with the proposals made for the reform of the law in Canada.  In my view <Col N="1544" /> it is worthy of consideration and I hope the Minister will give us his views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Bruton is proposing is that a new provision be inserted here to provide that where a buyer has a right to reject goods, by reason of a breach of contract on the part of the seller, but accepts some of the goods, he does not by accepting them lose his right to reject the rest.  As with amendment No. 10, amendment No. 11 seems to be based on a similar recommendation made in the UK by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission. The Deputy's amendment is based on one recommendation and to take it out of context is very dangerous. We are all aware of the size of that report.</P>
      <P>The question must be asked whether the type of situation to which Deputy Bruton's amendment relates is, in fact, a real problem in practice.  What would normally happen in such a case is that when a buyer receives goods and finds some of them faulty or unacceptable, he will communicate that to the seller.  It would then be a matter for agreement between the parties as to whether all of the goods or only those which are unacceptable should be returned.  If the buyer agrees to accept some of the goods it would be open to him in doing so to make clear that he reserves the right to reject others.  Furthermore, sections 34 and 35 of the 1893 Act, as inserted by section 20 of the 1980 Act, contain a number of safeguards for the buyer in the acceptance of goods and there must be some doubt as to whether it is necessary to go any further than this.  It has not been possible to examine all the recommendations in the report I have referred to and I would not be inclined to take one of them out of context.  I hope the Deputy appreciates my point.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that is a good thing?  On the basis of common sense it does not seem to me to be a good thing.  There is the risk that, if we do not take the opportunity of this Bill to deal with such matters &mdash; I agree that that recommendation was picked out of context because it seemed easier to draft it than others in the short time available to me &mdash; it will probably be five years before we will get around to dealing with it again, given the reluctance there would be to review such an Act.  We have an opportunity to make a few small and valuable amendments which would enhance the consumer's position.  In my view the Minister has not advanced any arguments against my amendment.  I propose to resubmit my amendment on Report Stage but, in the meantime, I hope the Minister will have another look at it to see if it is worth while incoporating it in our law.</P>

However, we will have to be very clear and confident of what the legal position will be if we adopt such an amendment.  We will have to have the consequences clarified.  I should like to remind the Deputy that there are a number of safeguards for a buyer in sections 34 and 35 of the 1893 Act, as inserted by section 20 of the 1980 Act. However, I am prepared to look at the amendment but I will not go beyond that at this stage.  I would not like the Deputy, or the House, to hold up this Bill if legal <Col N="1546" /> problems are thrown up along the way.  I do not think that is what the Deputy has in mind.  If we can accept the Deputy's amendment on Report Stage we will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 18 of the Consumer Information Act of 1978, local authorities were given the power to prosecute for false trade descriptions.  This included the offence of sale of short weight/measure.  In practice, the only local authority who perform this duty are Dublin Corporation as this is the only local authority with an enforcement agency in the consumer area, namely the weights and measures inspectors.  This system of enforcement raises a number of practical problems including: (1) the legislation in so far as short weight is concerned is being enforced only in the Dublin area &mdash; weights and measures inspectors outside Dublin are Garda sergeants acting as <i>ex officio</i> inspectors and do not have powers under the Consumer Information Act; and (2) by allowing them power to prosecute for false trade descriptions &mdash; weights and measures inspectors in Dublin Corporation now have considerably more powers over and above their weights and measures duties. In effect, they have similar powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it was decided that the powers of local authorities to prosecute for false trade descriptions under the Consumer Information Act would be removed.  However, in order to retain the power of Dublin Corporation weights and measures inspectors to prosecute for short weight and to extend this power to all weights and measures inspectors this new section has been included.  There is no general offence for sale of short weight in existing weights and measures legislation except in the case of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of subsection (1) was amended to clarify the definition of &ldquo;sell&rdquo; so as to avoid possible difficulties in proving an offence under the section.  A new subsection (4) was inserted so as to provide powers of entry to weights and measures inspectors for the purpose of checking compliance with the section. Subsections (5) and (6) were inserted to replace the provisions of the old subsection (4) in regard to prosecutions and <Col N="1548" /> the definition of an &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; under the section.  Those two amendments were brought forward to Seanad amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In EC law a provision is operated whereby penalties for commercial offences of this kind are related not to an absolute sum but to the size of turnover of the company in question. Therefore, a company engaging, for instance, in large scale commercial malpractice would suffer a penalty related to the size of the damage done to the community at large rather than a specified amount.  I understand that the provisions regarding these fines are dealt with in Article 15.2 of Council Directive 204/62 under which, and I quote: &ldquo;The Commission may by decision impose on undertakings or an association of undertakings fines of from 1,000 to 1,000,000 units of accounts, or a sum in excess thereof but not exceeding 10 per cent of the turnover in the preceding business year of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Fines should reflect the seriousness of the offence in financial terms and we are dealing with offences which essentially impose a financial penalty on those who commit the offences in question.  It seems that the provisions of Article 15.2 of the Directive which I have just quoted are preferable to the type of provision in this section and, indeed, in other sections of this Bill which simply impose maximum fines.  The same maximum applies whether the offence is committed by Quinnsworth or the corner store and whether it is committed over a large range of locations or in just one place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want competition law and consumer protection law to be effective, the punishment should fit the crime.  The size of the fine should relate in some sense to the turnover of the company committing the offence, and I think the provision there is reasonable.  I ask the Minister to consider between now and Report Stage the possibility of introducing a provision similar to that in the Article I have quoted in respect of all fines under this legislation, not just fines in respect of short weight but in respect of other offences <Col N="1549" /> under the Bill.  That is a fairer way of doing things.  Obviously, an £800 fine is far more severe for a small shopkeeper than it is for a very large multinational corporation.  The reference to turnover is a more appropriate way of setting the fine.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously.</P>

      <P>This is a very minor amendment to close the gap that was there.

      <P>I have a straightforward query in relation to section 37 (6).  In my county of Wexford we have, as other rural areas have, a weights and measures sergeant who covers the whole county. The whole thing is quite antiquated. There are no great facilities and all the rest of it, but I will leave that for another day.  However, do I take it that under the terms of the 1878 Act, and so on, an inspector's terms of reference of employment are completely unchanged by this in every way?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, in the same vein <Col N="1550" /> as Deputy Bruton, not dealing with a technical gap but with a slightly wider question, let me ask if the Minister is aware of the farcical situation in regard to legal metrology and weights and measures at present.  I know somebody who opened a big supermarket in Athy recently and at the meat counter he met with gross dissatisfaction because he put the weight in kilograms and it seemed to the consumer to be much more expensive compared with everyone else who was doing it in pounds.  He was observing the law and he gained a reputation for having high prices because of that.  There is a total lack of enforcement in relation to the sale of meat in supermarkets by kilograms. He put up both the kilo price and the price per pound.  Anyone who goes to the trouble of adhering to the law becomes pretty cheesed off when he gets a bad reputation on account of it.  This is an enforcement point rather than a legislative point.  Will the Minister consider very strongly getting some degree of uniformity as regards grocery meat sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of Deputy Yates's constitutent in Wexford are not being changed one iota in relation to that so the Deputy can rest happily with that assurance.  In relation to the supermarket in Athy and declaring weight in kilos, the EC Directive provides that it must be quoted in kilos.  It can also be declared in pounds but must not be more prominent than the kilos declaration.  Food regulations are being enforced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1551" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 18, before the First Schedule, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;39.&mdash;(1) Section 15 (as amended by section 17 of this Act and as applied by section 8 (3) of the Act of 1978) of the Principal Act and section 16 (as amended by section 28 of this Act) of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, shall not apply to accounts maintained by a financial institution.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Director considers it necessary for the excercise by him of any of his functions, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the Commission consider it necessary for the exercise by them of any of their functions,</P>
      <P>to examine accounts maintained by a financial institution, the Director or the Commission, as the case may be, may apply to the High Court for an order under this section.</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever the High Court is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so and is satisfied that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, it may make an order authorising an authorised officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  at all reasonable times to enter and inspect any premises of a financial institution where he reasonably believes that there are accounts maintained by it,</P>
      <P>(b)  to require any director of or person employed by the institution to produce to him any specified accounts maintained by it that are in the power or control of that person or director and to give to the officer any information that he may reasonably require in regard to the accounts, and</P>
      <P>(c)  to inspect and make copies of or take extracts from such accounts,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>subject to such conditions (if any) as <Col N="1552" /> it thinks proper and specifies in the order.</P>
    <P>(4) (a)  In this section reference to accounts maintained by a financial institution shall be construed as reference to any accounts maintained by or for or on behalf of any person in the institution, either solely or jointly with another person or persons, or any books, documents or other records maintained by it relating to such accounts;</P>
    <P>(b)  in this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>`authorised officer' means, as may be appropriate, an authorised officer within the meaning of section 15 (6) (as amended by section 17 of this Act and applied by section 8 (3) of the Act of 1978) of the Principal Act or an authorised officer within the meaning of section 16 (as amended by section 28 of this Act) of the Consumer Information Act, 1978;</P>
    <P>`books' means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  bankers' books within the meaning of the Bankers' Books Evidence Acts, 1879 and 1959, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  records and documents of persons referred to in section 7 (4) of the Central Bank Act, 1971;</P>
    <P>`director' includes any person occupying the position of director by whatever name called;</P>
    <P>`financial institution' means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a person who holds or has held a licence under section 9 of the Central Bank Act, 1971, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  a person referred to in section 7 (4)  of that Act;</P>
    <P>`records', for the avoidance of doubt, includes records recorded and stored electronically.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to require the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade and the Fair Trade Commission to apply to the High Court for an order if, in the course of the exercise of their functions, they consider it necessary <Col N="1553" /> to examine any individual bank accounts. Up to now banks were excluded but now they are included.  This is a protection measure for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The amendment arises primarily as a result of the inclusion of banks for the first time under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  The proposed amendment is a consumer protection measure and its objective is to ensure the continued confidentiality of a person's bank account.  Thus, if, for example, the director is investigating a possible restrictive practice in relation to a particular bank, or in relation to banks generally, and if in the course of that investigation the director considers it necessary to examine individual bank accounts, he will not be entitled to do so unless he has first obtained a High Court order and then, only in accordance with the conditions laid down in the court order.</P>
    <P>The provision will apply not only to banks but to all financial institutions within the meaning of the Central Bank Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>Thus, besides licensed banks, other financial institutions such as building societies, post office savings banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation will also be covered.</P>
    <P>The amendment provision could arise also in the context of the director's or commission's investigations or inquiries into an ordinary business enterprise.  For example, if such an enterprise was making claims in their advertising in relation to their turnover or end-of-year results, the director may consider it necessary, in addition to his general investigation into the matter, to examine the bank account of the company.  At present, he would be permitted to do so under his general powers of investigation contained in section 16 of the Consumer Information Act.  Similar powers are contained in section 15 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  The proposed amendment would, however, modify those powers where the examination of individual bank accounts is concerned <Col N="1554" /> and the director would have to obtain a High Court order.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Consumer Information Act, I am very concerned about, what are in my view, the sharp practices which are taking place in the area of life assurance policies and investment-insurance policies which are supposed to yield a certain rate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 19, Part I, third column, opposite &ldquo;Postal Telecommunications Services Act, 1983&rdquo;, to delete &ldquo;and 52 (1)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, 52 (1) and 88&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to remove the exemption of Telecom Éireann from consumer protection legislation.  Section 88 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, contains the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Subject to subsection (3), the company shall be immune from all liability in respect of any loss or damage suffered by a person in the use of a <Col N="1555" /> service referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) by reason of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  failure or delay in providing, operating or maintaining a telecommunications service,</P>
    <P>(b)  failure, interruption, suspension or restriction of a telecommunications service,</P>
    <P>(c)  any error or omission in a directory published by the company or any telegrams or telex messages transmitted by the company.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann, who claim to be operating in competition with other commercial operations, have quite neatly got this section in here and nobody can sue them for almost anything because they are immune.  Like the king who was supposed to be immune, from prosecution in the past this royal prerogative now extends to Telecom Éireann, and it also, I imagine, applies to a number of other State companies.</P>
    <P>This abuse was brought to my notice by a constituent whose business suffered substantially through the fault of Telecom Éireann.  They failed to insert his telephone number in the form agreed in their directory.  He pursued the matter with Telecom Éireann and they made him offers to remedy matters which he considered unsatisfactory.  He consulted his solicitor to see if he could take the matter further and he collided with section 88 which told him: &ldquo;Sorry, mate, you have no rights in this matter.  We have them all.&rdquo;  He even raised the matter with the office of the Ombudsman but, for obvious reasons, the results were not particularly satisfactory.  Telecom Éireann were hiding behind section 88.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to remove that protection.  This is only reasonable because Governments have prided themselves on the fact that bodies &mdash; such as Telecom Éireann and An Post are operating in the commercial area.  In this case they have a chairman who is one of the great advocates of private enterprise. He believes in competitiveness and the refreshing breath of fresh air in <Col N="1556" /> respect of all aspects of commercial operations. I am sure he would have the same bracing attitude towards the operation of Telecom Éireann as he would to his own business.  If that is the case, I do not believe he or his board should have the slightest objection to Telecom Éireann operating on the same basis as every other business in that they are liable to sue or be sued in respect of wrongs committed against them or by them.  All this amendment would do is put them on the same basis as other commercial businesses. There is no need for this exemption.</P>
    <P>I would point out in this Republican assembly that the exemption goes back to the old common lawprinciple that the king can do no wrong.  If the king's horse ran you down on some medieval road you could not sue him, even though you could sue anybody else, because he was the king.  In this modern era that throwback to regalism has little relevance to the operations of Telecom Éireann, that most modern and technically advanced of all our State companies. Surely we have no need to rely on this modernised version of the old maxim that the king can do no wrong?  In this case, the king should be liable to sue and to be sued, the same as anybody else.  I appeal to the Minister's interest in the consumer, as well as perhaps to his sense of doing away with some of the vestiges of imperialism, to accept my amendment.  I am sorry that no other members of his party are here to have their cockles stirred by the prospect of removing yet another remnant of the oppressor from our law. I am sure it would be something that would have them granting press and radio interviews <i>ad lib</i>, not to speak of photographic sessions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come down to a more mundane level.  There is no justification for this exemption.  Telecom Éireann try to make settlements with <Col N="1557" /> people when they feel they have been genuinely injured but they do that out of grace and favour, not because of any statutory rights that exist against them. They should be subject to the law like everyone else so I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree generally with Deputy Bruton's remarks.  We should not draw a comparison between a company such as Telecom Éireann, which was set up by legislation and a company which was set up on a commercial basis.  If we were to find among the articles of association of a company such an exemption from liability it simply would not be allowed and I do not see why it should be allowed in relation to State companies, particularly those who engage in commercial business and who say, as Deputy Bruton said, that they are intent on competing on the same footing, providing the same kind of service and backup.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the ESB think they are the only organisation about which I have reservations I support this amendment. Not only is the legal immunity unfair, large semi-State organisations, because they are so big, are very powerful when it comes to litigation.  They can afford the best solicitor and barrister and can face down in an intimidatory way, because of those resources, any humble consumer who might wish to take them to court. Even if you try to reverse the legal immunity which was wrongly given to them, they would still be in a very powerful position.  It would be a very reluctant consumer who would charge into court to avail of any changes in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that we are dealing with a monopoly and that you cannot get a telecommunications service other than from Telecom Éireann.  Therefore, the public must have some rights.  The important point is that it is up to the Members of this House to look after the public because we are the only people who speak for their rights.  We have all seen the charade whereby Telecom Éireann <Col N="1558" /> said, following a complaint about an account, that their accounting system is in order but later admitted to the Ombudsman that a mistake had been made.  Clearly, mistakes are made, not to speak of differences in quotations for installations.  I am having difficulty in trying to get my telephone number included in the directory, they put my mother's number in instead&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give Deputy Yates and others a verbose three pages of technical reasons for not accepting the amendment.  As a former Minister for Communications, I have a deep appreciation of the problems they had to take on board as the system was on the point of collapse.  They have come a long way but not as far as we would have liked. They are continually improving their accounting system and they are at the point of releasing a printout of telephone bills.  I recognise that there are serious problems which will take some time to resolve but this matter was debated at Government level.  That was the case when the previous Government were in office and we have not been able to transform Telecom Éireann in nine months. <Col N="1559" /> The previous Government agreed to give this immunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At any rate, Telecom Éireann have come a long way although they still have a distance to go.  We have already had discussions with the Minister for Communications in this regard and he is not prepared to accede to it at this stage because there are problems and Telecom Éireann must be given the opportunity to modernise totally.  When they are as sharp as we would like them to be I agree that the exemption should be taken away but now is not the time to do so.</P>
      <P>We must also bear in mind that, under the International Telecommunications Convention, 1973, to which this State acceded, liability is not accepted towards users of international telecommunications services.  In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to remove this immunity from liability which applies to Telecom Éireann in regard to the provision of international telecommunications services.  That is the basic position.  It is not practical to change at this stage of development although I agree that it should not stay forever.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister or the Minister for Communications put a time limit on Telecom's exemption from responsibility?  We are talking about consumer protection legislation and if we are not for the consumer &mdash; but for Telecom &mdash; we are against the consumer.  If there are acknowledged problems in Telecom Éireann which result in consumers having problems and suffering as a result, it is not good enough to say that they have come a long way, that they will go further in the future and that we will look at it some time.  I acknowledge that some work has been done to bring Telecom up to date but there should be a definite time limit on the exemption they have.</P>

      <P>I may not be very long in this House but I cannot see why the Minister for Communications should have any part in this matter.  It is a question of right and wrong.  It is appalling that the Minister can say that, because the Minister for Communications said it is not yet time to do something, it is not going to be done.  That is the worst form of special pleading in vested interests in Government that one could have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to say that is the reality.  The reality is, as Deputy Colley has rightly said, that the superior interest of a State company is being put before the public interest.  We are taking sides in this matter.  The Minister for Communications should not have that arbitrary role in deciding on such matters. That is an even stronger case for the Minister to redouble his efforts in this area.</P>

      <P>I cannot believe I am hearing what the Deputy is saying.  He is a member of a party who granted this immunity when in Government.  Now that there has been a change of Government they want the immunity removed. There are international obligations and we cannot throw those out the window, let Telecom pay all the bills and raise the telephone charges which would mean the consumer would have to pay more.  Let us be realistic.  I would like to see the exemption removed in the morning but I do not think Telecom are in a position to operate without the exemption.  International obligations should not have to be changed.  The Deputy's party when in Government made a decision and now they want the position changed overnight but I cannot do that.  I am not the Minister for Communications.  I am not passing the buck on to him.  I have done as much as I can in relation to this matter.  The Minister for Communications accepts the merit of what I am saying and of what this House is saying today.  I will ask him <Col N="1561" /> how soon he thinks we could consider removing the exemption but I will not go into the realms of unreality and say anything more.</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Minister to be a little more specific as to why Telecom Éireann cannot stand on their own feet in the same way as other small companies in regard to being liable to being pursued for damages for any breach of contract?  What are the defects in the existing Telecom system that are so inherent that the Minister for Communications feels they are an impediment to allowing Telecom Éireann to be put on the same footing as everyone else? The Minister has simply spoken in very general terms and has not given the House any indication as to what exactly is preventing Telecom Éireann at the moment from undertaking normal legal obligations which he feels that at some unspecified time in the future they might be capable of undertaking.</P>

I have pressed the case for the consumer in this matter.  I have no intention of getting involved in that area as I am not qualified to do so because it is five years since I was involved in that area.  I cannot be any more helpful to the House than I have been on this aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a reasonable answer to the question I am putting. There is an amendment down to this Bill and it is in order.  The Minister and the Minister for Communications have had more than ample notice of it, as it was <Col N="1562" /> first circulated about 14 days ago.  If there are good reasons why Telecom Éireann cannot be subject to the law those reasons should not be kept secret.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce who is relying on those reasons as a basis for rejecting this amendment should be able to say what they are.  I do not believe he does not know the reasons.  Neither do I believe that he could be accused &mdash; I doubt if he is very fearful of this &mdash; of treading into other people's territory by answering this simple question, because this is an amendment to a Bill for which he is responsible.  It is an amendment that is in order and one that he has been called upon to reply to.  The factors which he is adducing for rejecting it are not reasonable ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing when it might be possible for this exemption to be removed it is important that we know the exact reasons for it.  Is it that Telecom Éireann do not yet feel any sense of confidence in their telephone network and that there are going to be so many faults they are afraid they will be put out of business by all the legal actions that they will be prey to?  I cannot understand, particularly in regard to the directories which they are producing, how there could be any need for them to be exempt because their production is not a highly technical process and they are not subject to gremlins getting into the electronics as far as the preparation of the directories is concerned. People have been producing directories of one kind or another for the last 200 years and there is nothing obscure or unusual about the technology involved.  Therefore I do not see why if I produce a legal directory for reward, make a false statement in it and somebody acts on that statement and loses money, I am liable for it while at the same time Telecom Éireann who are producing a telephone directory are exempt from a similar pursuit for damages.  That directory is produced for reward.  It is not given as a gift from Telecom Éireann. Part of our telephone rental goes towards payment for it.  As we all know we are now getting a less generous provision than in the past; we now get a directory <Col N="1563" /> only for the area in which we live and we have to buy the others if we want them whereas previously we used to get the directory for the entire country.  There should be a legal obligation on Telecom Éireann to produce correct information in the directory and if it is not correct they should be liable to be pursued for damages in the same way as any other commercial operation would be liable to be so pursued.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said in a sort of mysterious way that the Minister for Communications said that Telecom are not quite ready to face the bracing winds of normal legal liability.  They need this antique protection of exemption from normal law to continue for some time more.  We should be told the reason for this.  What are the inherent problems in Telecom that require that they be exempt?  It is not a mystery or a secret, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister said they will probably be able to be subject to this liability in a few years.  If that is the case at least we know, in our search for the reasons, that they are circumstances that in the view of the Minister exist at this time but are diminishing in their importance and will not exist to the same extent in a few years time.  What are the inherent problems in Telecom Éireann?  What are the peculiar characteristics of Telecom Éireann?  The House is entitled to this information.  I would press the Minister to give us the information.  I have no doubt that it is Telecom Éireann and not the Minister who feel they need this continued protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is now talking about the liability for omission in directories but that is different from what is contained in the amendment.  If that is what the Deputy is saying I will pursue that item between now and Report Stage. If the Deputy is saying more than that, all I can say is that the reasons for continuing the immunity now are as valid as on the day when the Deputy's Government gave it to them and are as valid as on the day not so long ago when the <Col N="1564" /> Deputy sat down and drafted this Bill.  I accept the validity of the arguments then and I am standing over them now.  I am amazed that the Deputy would change his position so quickly from the time when he drafted this Bill.  He knows as well as I what Telecom Éireann have to contend with.  If the Deputy is simply talking about an omission in a directory I will pursue that between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the ways in which Telecom Éireann will not be accountable under this legislation? The areas referred to by all Opposition Deputies refer to matters such as the directory, accounts and quotations.  None of those things have anything to do with the Minister's reply which had to do with international obligations.  That makes our position a lot more reasonable.  It was unfortunate that the Minister came along with the big leaf at this stage &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nature of things one daily grows in wisdom.  I do not accept the Minister's reason as being genuine. In relation to the position of Telecom Éireann we all accept that the accelerated development programme and other aspects of bringing our telecommunications infrastructure up to date has led to changes relative to the Irish versus the European telecommunications system.  That is why our rental costs are £33 per quarter which is 64 per cent above the European average.  We accept that but what is not acceptable is that Telecom Éireann should hide behind the law.  If the consumer has to pay a bit more because we need more development so be it, but Telecom Éireann should not be <Col N="1565" /> given the cloak of protection now being given.  The Minister's response on the politics of it and in relation to international obligations does not answer the central points raised this evening.  I would ask the Minister to give a commitment to go back to Government on this.  I do not believe that the relevant section of the Department of Communications who have responsibility for Telecom Éireann should be judge and jury on this issue.  It is a political decision and the Minister has a genuine input to make on that.  Telecom Éireann should be treated in the same way as it is now proposed to treat the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be realistic.  That is basically what the Deputy is saying.  If what Deputy Bruton started off by saying, that there is an omission in the directory which caused a problem, we can get somewhere, but if the Deputies continue on the wider issue, I have made the arguments again and again.  The arguments are as valid now as they were at the beginning.  The Deputies understand that as well as I.  If we lived in the ideal world we could do everything we wanted, but that is not the case.  In relation to the ESB, they would be subject to section 39 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  They will have to supply their services with a due scale of care and diligence.</P>

The Minister gave a variety of reasons as to why he could not give the evidence but I am not convinced.  I am somewhat heartened that the Minister has indicated a willingness to perhaps remove the exemption in respect of directory entries which would mean that my amendment could be amended to refer to section 88 (1) (c), but the difficulty with that is that paragraph (c) also contains a reference to telegrams and to telexes.  I hope that the fact that telegrams and telexes are included in paragraph (c) would not prevent the Minister from accepting the amendment if it is made on the more limited lines I have suggested.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> In page 3, subsection (1), line 18, to delete &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Line 18 deals with the definition of an officer of the Customs and Excise and it includes a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  That is cast too widely.  It is totally appropriate that the Garda Síochána should have exactly the same powers in this area as officers of the Customs and Excise.  I have no quibble with that.</P>
    <P>Anybody who is serving to prevent the illegal importation of goods as a Customs and Excise officer is equally entitled to exercise these powers because that is the intention of the Bill.  It has been the practice in the past but as the Government in a more major way are redeploying civil servants right across the public service it is conceivable that somebody from another Department could be assigned to Revenue; in fact a number of officers have been assigned already this year to the Revenue Commissioners and that is in order.</P>
    <P>I am trying to ensure that somebody who exercises these wide powers should be a permanent member either of the Garda Síochána or of the Customs and Excise.  I do not think the definition section as framed is appropriate.  It seems that on a day-to-day basis anybody could be assigned to the work of preventing the illegal importation or exportation of goods and I do not think that is adequate. Very serious powers are being given in this Bill which I claim we would not dream of giving if it was not for the horrific reaction we feel towards the victims of drug abuse.  If these powers were being sought even by the Garda Síochána or any other branch of the public service in relation to any other area of activity, we would not concede the powers without many safeguards attached.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are trained in the exercise of their duty.  Permanent officers of the Customs and Excise have some training as well and have a great deal of experience in this area.  The net is being <Col N="1569" /> cast far too widely when a person in the public service who is for the time being employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods is covered and is empowered to act under every section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether my amendment meets my concern.  I am simply asking that the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; be taken out; in effect, any member of the public service who is permanently employed in the job of preventing the illegal importation or exportation of goods should be covered by this measure. I agree that all members of the Garda Síochána should be covered by it.  In my opinion the powers are stronger and wider than the powers we would confer in other areas of criminal law even on the Garda Síochána.  I do not think they should be allocated to somebody who could be nominated as an acting officer of Revenue on a Monday morning at 9 o'clock and would have the powers until that evening or for the rest of the week.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot of discretion would be required in carrying out searches, especially searches on persons, and intimate body searches which are now envisaged in the Bill in view of the amendments accepted in the Seanad.  It is not appropriate to employ people on a casual or temporary basis and to give them the very wideranging powers in this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to accept my amendment or, if he feels that the drafting of the amendment does not meet the case I am making, to come back with an appropriate amendment on Report Stage to meet the objections I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party support this amendment as being a reasonable one and would ask the Minister to consider taking it on board.  The Bill envisages granting very wide powers of search of the person and of property, of vehicle and vessel and of the home of anybody suspected with good cause to be in contravention of the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  As the Bill stands, there are few additional regulatory provisions. <Col N="1570" /> The Garda Síochána who are fulltime law enforcement officers are subjected to far more rigorous supervision than anything envisaged in regard to customs officers.</P>
      <P>It is important that there should be clarity as to who can exercise the powers conferred under this Bill and at what stage, it is hoped the Minister will tell the House that he will be directing his officials in the area of Customs and Excise to engage in very stringent training regarding the exercise of these powers.  Anyone involved in the area of law enforcement and the exercise of powers of arrest, detention and search will say that training is essential in the exercise of these powers and in understanding the limits to which one can go. It is a worry that people who might be employed on a temporary basis would come within the definition of &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; as given here.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will outline the need for the expression &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;.  In what circumstances are persons brought in and out of the service and for what purpose?  From what Department or other duties are they brought? The Bill appears to be drafted to accommodate a standard or regular practice of persons moving in and out of the service at peak holiday times or when Customs and Excise staff are on annual leave. Auxiliary forces appear to be brought in on these occasions.  There is concern about the granting of exceptional powers without the same regime that exists for members of the Garda Síochána in the exercise of similar powers.  The amendment seeks to delimit clearly the persons who may exercise the powers conferred in the Bill and the circumstances in which they may do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and I assure the House that there are no draconian measures proposed in this Bill.  There will be no intimate body searches.  That is not envisaged and I have given that categoric assurance to the Seanad.  I have also given it on Second Stage in this House and I <Col N="1571" /> reiterate it now.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;officer of Customs and Excise&rdquo; here is identical with that set out in existing legislation, in particular in the Customs Act, 1956 and the Customs (Amendment) Act, 1942.  &ldquo;Officer&rdquo; means an officer of Customs and Excise or any person acting under the orders of such officer or any member of the Garda Síochána or Defence Forces assisting such officer.</P>
      <P>If the State in the persons of the Customs and Excise officers is to fulfil its proper role in combating smuggling or curtailing the import of drugs they must be given some flexibility.  The phrase &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; is designed solely to allow a degree of potential flexibility in the deployment of public servants where, for example, circumstances might require the drafting of public servants with particular expertise to assist in the fight against smuggling, including drug smuggling. There is a permanent corps of Customs and Excise officers.  If for any reason or acting on any information, evidence or observation, a senior officer or officers feel it is necessary to bring in members of the Garda Síochána or members of the Defence Forces or other personnel from the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners or from any Government Department we must give them that flexibility in particular situations, otherwise we would fail to implement the provisions of this legislation. This would happen only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal day-to-day running of the system will involve the permanent staff of the Customs and Excise who act honourably and vigilantly week after week in the exercise of their duties.  In order to implement the law in its entirety and to be able to respond to any particular eventuality we must allow flexibility to ensure that if people are apprehended the law governing those responsible for their apprehension is strong enough to bring these people to full conviction in the courts.  There must be no loophole in the law to prevent officers of the State from assisting the <Col N="1572" /> permanent officers designated to implement these rules and regulations on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>For that reason I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.  I hope the House will agree.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister of State says no draconian powers are being given to anybody under this Bill.  If we think of Draco as the great dictator who spilled a lot of blood in his time, we accept that no blood is being spilled in this Bill but as the term is modernly construed the powers are very strong and the exercise of those powers could fall very severely on people.  There are powers of search here of a very wide nature.  There are powers of unlimited detention, which are not contained anywhere else in criminal law.  The powers are draconian in the Bill in the accepted modern meaning of the word and I would justify the draconian powers because of the nature of the problem.  We are all agreed on the nature of the problem. We know that Governments all over the world have taken to themselves the most draconian of powers to combat drug smuggling and drug abuse and the misery contingent on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has said that there will be no intimate body searches.  The copy of the Bill I have is the one which was presented to the Seanad but I was reading the Bill as it emerged from the Seanad.  The Minister accepted there a series of amendments after the powers of search where it is required that a designated medical officer would be present.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree. Surely the Minister would not accept the necessity, even in a minority of cases, for a qualified medical person to be present if all that was involved was searching somebody's pockets.  The whole basis of accepting medical supervision, in a situation such as this, is because it envisages searches of the orifices of the body, and rightly so, because drugs have been <Col N="1573" /> brought into this country, and other countries concealed in that way.  I cannot understand why the Minister is now saying in subparagraphs (D) and (B) that a search of a person may be carried out by a designated medical practitioner, and that a person detained shall not be searched by an officer or person of the opposite sex.  Why do we need to have these subparagraphs in the Bill &mdash; they were amendments accepted in the Seanad &mdash; if there are not to be intimate searches?  I do not think anybody would object to being searched by a member of the opposite sex unless the search was intimate.  I do not think anybody would object to being searched without the presence of a qualified medical person unless the search involved an intimate search which would include an examination of the orifices of the body to see if an illegal drug was concealed.  If the Bill means anything it means that and especially in light of what the Minister accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> With respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, my amendment deals with the definition of a Customs and Excise officer.  That is extended to include all members of the Garda Síochana and also include anybody who from time to time is involved in the work of preventing the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  In order that the House might judge whether it is appropriate that somebody on a casual basis, or from time to time &mdash; to use the words of the Bill &mdash; is the appropriate person to be empowered with what is contained in the Bill, the Minister was quite right in pointing out the nature of those powers.  If the power was to stop traffic and redirect it I would not be worried about the definition but since the powers are draconian, and rightly so, because they are combating the greatest scourge of the 20th century, it is necessary <Col N="1574" /> to talk about the nature of those powers before we can adequately judge the appropriateness of the personnel who will exercise them.  The Minister, quite rightly, replied to me in that context.  He gave a commitment on Second Stage, and he gave a commitment in the Seanad, that there would be no intimate body searches.  The Minister's commitment, with all due respect, is not worth much in a court of law.  The text of the debates of this House are not produced in the Central Criminal Court.  What the Bill says is one thing and what the Minister says is different.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not want to give the impression of stubbornness. If we were dealing with a definition section in isolation it could look very stubborn of me not to agree with the Minister but we are not dealing with it in isolation.  We have a situation now which could be reminiscent of the classic western movie: a crime occurs, there is a lack of personnel, the sheriff swears in deputies on the street and then they are empowered to act.  Under the definition section of this Bill the officers <Col N="1575" /> of the Revenue Commissioners, or people acting on their behalf, could, the day after this Bill becomes law, nominate half a village as people who, for the time being, would be involved in preventing the illegal importation of drugs.  They could all be led by the local sergeant and could search every house and everybody in the village under the powers of this Bill.  That is too wide.</P>
      <P>I am quoting what is in previous legislation. The definition of Customs and Excise officers in previous legislation does not meet the case.  I intend to come back again, on the advice of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to the whole question of body searches, to the powers of search and detention under the Bill and to the question of whether the powers are draconian or whether they are appropriate to the evil we are trying to combat. I believe they are but we would want to be absolutely certain about the nature of the powers and on whom we are conferring them.  I am not happy with the Minister's explanation because, as far as I can see, the sheriff in the town can deputise anybody and while they are deputised they can exercise all the powers of this Bill.  I do not think that is acceptable and I plead with the Minister accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that my amendment is the best way to get around this difficulty. I would like the Minister to take on board and give a commitment that he will have a look at it and come back on Report Stage with the advice of his Department. Members of the Garda Síochána obviously must have the same powers as officers of the Revenue Commissioners. I have no problem with that.  Whatever powers we decide to give here must apply to all officers of the Revenue Commissioners but I want an amendment from the Minister which confines it to that.  I do not want a Bill to emerge from this House where it looks as if the cohort of people who could exercise the powers under the Bill could be indefinitely extended by administrative act.  That is not the proper way to put legislation through this House.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1576" /> most sincerely to look at this problem. I think most people in the House will concede the powers requested but we would like to know at this stage of the debate precisely who will be empowered to exercise those powers.</P>

      <P>This will be a very brief contribution.  Obviously we are dealing with a Bill which concerns striking a balance between the need to tackle smuggling and particularly drug smuggling and the need to protect the rights of the vast majority of citizens and travellers who are not involved in any way in that kind of practice.  As has been said already this Bill is conferring on customs officers very wide powers of search and arrest.  I should like to know how many customs officers on average are employed at present so that we might know how many additional people we are conferring powers on.  Might I also ask the Minister whether those powers conferred on a customs and excise officer are valid only while on duty &mdash; whatever may be their hours of work, say, between 8 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock in the evening &mdash; or whether they are equally valid while they sit at home watching television or whatever?</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last evening, we on this side of the House also welcome an opportunity to discuss this motion which, as he said, is opportune.</P>
      <P>All Members of this House are concerned about the plight of Irish immigrants in the United States who have no legal status and we understand their fears. Fine Gael speakers on the motion last evening referred to the Fianna Fáil manifesto and our party's commitment to giving priority to the status of Irish illegal immigrants in the United States.  That matter formed a major plank in our overall policy.  As the House is well aware, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been very active in the United States regarding the plight of Irish immigrants.  As the Minister said last evening, Congressman Brian Donnelly and Senator Ted Kennedy have been more than helpful as well as other Members of the American Congress in understanding our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the March visit of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Washington there has been close contact maintained with Irish-American politicians on the question of reforming the existing law on immigration.  As the House will be aware, a Bill was co-sponsored recently by Congressman Brian Donnelly and Senator Kennedy.  The committee of which Senator Kennedy is chairman had its first hearing before the Immigration Sub-Committee of the <Col N="1578" /> American Senate Judiciary Committee on 23 October last.  I understand that a further hearing of this committee will be held in the near future.  Furthermore, I understand that the kernel of the Bill is to provide for an extra 50,000 visas annually which are to be made available to citizens of countries who were disadvantaged under earlier legislation, that is under the 1965 Act.  It is my understanding that applicants will be chosen on a points system which is somewhat biased in favour of English-speaking, skilled immigrants.  It is our belief that this will result in an additional 9,000 visas annually being granted to this country, not for one year or two years but on a permanent basis.  This proposal is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While accepting the Fine Gael motion the Government argue that a certain portion of it should not necessarily be pushed, that is, that portion which calls for the establishment of other centres. We believe we have adequate facilities in our Consulate Generals' offices throughout the United States.  We have made these offices available, as centres, to all interested parties over there which, we believe, offsets any need to establish new offices.  People commented on the position in Philadelphia.  I might remind the House that Philadelphia is one hour's travelling time from New York which, by American standards, is not very much, and will be covered by the New York Consulate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the advisory and welfare services I should say that this matter is being tackled at home by way of dissemination of information about living and working conditions in the United States.  This is being done through the National Manpower Service.  The thrust of the advice of the National Manpower Service is to discourage people who are inadequately prepared from emigrating in the first place.  The National Manpower Service lay particular stress on the necessity to have a proper United States visa. Most Irish people who go to the United States are well aware that they should have a proper visa.</P>
    <P>Following visits to the United States in <Col N="1579" /> August and September the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had advisory and welfare committees established based at our Consulate Generals' offices.  These committees consist of representatives of the main groups involved in the illegal immigration issue, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Catholic Charities and the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, the latter &mdash; as the House will be aware, being a body formed exclusively by Irish illegals in the United States.  The committee have met several times, exchanged views on the position and are examining practical steps which might be taken to help our citizens in the United States.  In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has appointed a special liaison officer attached to the Consulate General in New York who is available not only to interested groups but to individual Irish citizens.  I understand that the opening hours of that consulate have been extended to allow for greater access on the part of those people who cannot contact them during normal working hours.</P>
    <P>Current United States legislation provides for an amnesty for illegal immigrants who entered the United States prior to 1982.  There have been many calls for an extension of that amnesty date which, of course, would benefit those Irish citizens who emigrated since 1982. However, given the difficulties surrounding the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the advice from all sides &mdash; that is the United States administration, the Congress and from our Embassy there &mdash; is that we should not complicate matters, that we could complicate the Congressional discussions and render our objectives more difficult of achievement if we try to push this aspect too hard.  We must be advised by them because, as this House is aware, there is tremendous goodwill towards us in this country, way beyond our size and population.  I understand the anxiety of the American Congress because, in fairness, we must remember there are other ethnic minorities from other western European countries who are very anxious <Col N="1580" /> to take up residence in the United States.</P>
    <P>The Irish Immigration Reform Movement, as I have said, were established earlier this year by young Irish illegal immigrants, initially in the New York area.  Since then they have set up branches in Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. They drew up a list of demands in July last which was circulated to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  These were mainly as follows: a statement of public support for the IIRM on the part of the Government, the establishment of an Irish centre in Manhattan manned by IIRM staff to provide welfare and advisory services to new Irish immigrants; the provision of 20,000 dollars towards the cost of a hot line; total liaison between the IIRM and the Government on the manner of lobbying in Washington; that facilities of Irish State and semi-State agencies should be made available to the IIRM on demand; examination of the legality of credit unions so that illegal immigrants can bank their money because &mdash; under the American system &mdash; one cannot bank unless one has a social security number; examination of ways in which the VHI might extend their cover to illegal Irish immigrants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs met representatives of the IIRM on 24 August last and discussed those demands with them.  Following that meeting and discussions with other interested groups, the Government decided that the advisory and welfare services sought should be provided.  The inclusion of the IIRM in the committees provided them with a framework within which they could present their demands.  That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>Questions relating to banking and health insurance have been actively discussed in the New York committees and practical steps are being taken to deal with these problems.  Most of the other demands seem to have been dropped by the main body of the IIRM because they seem to be satisfied with the fact that they are in full consultation with Government bodies abroad.</P>
    <P>Recently an Irish American newspaper called <i>The Irish Voice</i> edited by a Mr. <Col N="1581" /> Niall O'Dowd carried out a survey of Irish illegals in New York.  Only about 200 were interviewed, but the main findings were that nearly all had jobs: 77 per cent of men in construction and 54 per cent of the women as nannies; 50 per cent of the men earned between $400 and $500 a week and a further 30 per cent earned between $500 and $750 a week.  The women were less well paid with only 51 per cent earning $400 or more; 32 per cent of them had third level education while a further 37 per cent had finished their leaving certificate.  So we are talking about emigrants with a high standard of education.  Interestingly enough &mdash; this is the figure that will catch all of our eyes &mdash; 82 per cent had jobs before they left Ireland and 42 per cent said they would definitely return to Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious arguments in our favour is the highly skilled, educated quality of our young people.  We recognise that it is tragic that many of them cannot get employment here.  However, the US Ambassador has been trying to operate a scheme whereby young Irish people can go to America for a period of two years to learn business techniques and other skills which they can bring back and use here.  We all wish her well in this project.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to one or two more items here.  I would say a word of caution to those Members of the House who argue that the Government should adopt a higher public profile than we have so far done.  It is important for Members of this House to know that we are dealing with the passage of legislation in another State's legislative process.  We have to be careful not to disturb the sensitivities of our friends in the United States.  This is particularly relevant when there are other groups in the US who take a different attitude from ours to any measure in this field.  The Government, when taking office, also recognised that we could not wait for a reform measure to be passed before addressing the more immediate problems of the out-of-status Irish.</P>
    <P>I would mention here that in relation to the figures that are spelled out about the number of emigrants in the US they <Col N="1582" /> vary from 150,000 to as low as 97,000 but we know there are tens of thousands of Irish emigrants in the United States. They should know by now that we do care about them and that we are moving heaven and earth to get something done about their situation very quickly.  One of the big problems is the penalties which now fall on employers who employ illegal immigrants and this is causing considerable problems to some of our young people.  I understand that in New York 79 young workers were let go from a construction company because of this. However, it is important to state that in the lottery 1,800 have been offered permanent visas for the United States and there are more to come.</P>
    <P>The committees which are operating very satisfactorily at the moment in the United States have produced a booklet. Since their establishment only a few months ago they have addressed several key questions facing the Irish community. They have prepared a booklet listing sources of assistance and advice to newly arrived Irish immigrants, identifying low cost health insurance and carrying out research into the banking problems of the out-of-status Irish.  I understand that 10,000 copies of the booklet have been run off initially and as soon as it is available they will be circulated to Members of this House. They will also be distributed by the Department of Labour to the offices of the National Manpower Service here.</P>
    <P>Health insurance is a serious problem: with the high cost of medical care, which is three or four times what it is here, it can pose real problems for our young people who fall ill.  However, in that regard we understand that there are forms of insurance available and some of these can be cheaper than the VHI.  As the cost of hospitals here are three or four times lower than in the US, VHI premiums must be prohibitively high. Since most of the income of the Irish illegals in the US is in excess of what they would be getting here, it would be cheaper for them to take up insurance in the United States.  The problem has also been tackled in the States.  The hospitals <Col N="1583" /> of the New York Archdiocese are, thanks to a decision by Cardinal O'Connor, open to immigrants regardless of their status, and they are only assessed where necessary; a similar system obtains in Boston due to the public spirited initiative of Mayor Flynn of that city.  The Minister said last night he wanted to record the Government's appreciation of those two moves.</P>
    <P>The consulate-based group has researched and identified sources of relatively low cost health insurance during discussions they have had with representatives of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield organisations.  These organisations can provide basic cover for about $200 a quarter which seems affordable given the levels of earnings in the United States according to a recent survey, and most Irish immigrants obtain money which would allow this to be possible.</P>
    <P>The question of banking has been referred to.  Under US law one cannot open a bank account unless one has a social security number.  As out-of-status immigrants do not have a social security number effectively, they are blocked out of the banking system.  Again, discussions with figures in the banking world have taken place but given the status of US law in this respect no short term solution is available.  The subject is still being actively examined.  Recently the New York based committees visited Washington and had talks with legislators about recent developments in immigration law.  These committees are monitoring developments in areas of current US immigration law, particularly the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, with reference to three important areas: the amnesty for those in the US prior to 1 January 1982, the allocation of the so-called Donnelly visas and the employer clauses.  However, since most of the Irish emigration to the US took place after the date in question this amnesty is of limited importance.  The consulates, however, are monitoring its implementation and have ensured that any developments were publicised.  A recent and very welcome development <Col N="1584" /> was a relaxation of the original ruling by the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service about the length of time somebody could stay outside the United States on holidays since 1982.  This has been of considerable help.</P>
    <P>I want to allow other Members to contribute to this debate.  There are certain organisations which are doing exemplary work in relation to the immigrants in the United States.  There is an organisation known as Catholic Charities which is a branch of the administration of the Archdiocese of New York, which operate a programme for the Irish called &ldquo;Outreach&rdquo;. As well as addressing the medical needs of immigrants, this organisation also addresses problems of accommodation, family questions, legal assistance, mental health services and child services.  Then there is the Ancient Order of Hibernians which provide free immigration counselling once a week, the United Irish Counties' Association and the New York GAA.  All these have provided assistance in individual hardship cases.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Spring in the House.  He is probably aware that the Kerryman's P &amp; B Association in the Bronx comes to mind in this context and its assistance is much appreciated by the Government. Several of these groups have branches in other cities of the United States and the groups based in Philadelphia have organised the establishment of an Irish centre in that city which serves as a focal point for many of the newly arrived Irish in that area.  The newcomer on the scene is the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, set up in the past 12 months.  These people are now taking their full part in committee with the other organisations.</P>
    <P>The question of setting up centres in America similar to those in Britain has been voiced and again the Labour Party are looking to this.  The Tánaiste stated last night that one of the reasons why it is not necessary to set up offices for Irish immigrants in the United States in the same way as in Britain is because in Britain there is a different ball game.  In the United States the establishment is much more friendly disposed towards the <Col N="1585" /> Irish community, probably because of the fact that we have 45 million plus IrishAmericans there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  From the cost-benefit point of view the very availability of the Irish Consul General's office in the United States being made fully available by the Government is well worthwhile.  The Government have more than lived up to their promise to take this as a high priority.  We have taken it as such since we came into office.  It is not something about which we should argue among ourselves but on which we should work together.  Once our people go to the United States they are not concerned with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, The Workers' Party, the PDs or the Independents. They say that we are all Irish, that we are concerned about our brethern in the United States, that we should all be working together and having as big an input as we can towards helping those people, at the same time recognising that when your are bringing pressure to bear, it is not the kind of pressure which you can exert from a distance.</P>
      <P>We go to the United States frequently &mdash; and I am looking at Deputy Barry and Deputy Spring and, of course, the Tánaiste.  I have been there every year for the last four or five years, meeting people over there.  There is a great awareness among the Irish community and on St. Patrick's Day as many Members of this House as possible should go there to meet Congressmen, Senators, and State representatives in every State that they reach, to get the message across that we want goodwill towards maximising the number of visas which will be allocated to the Irish.  We must all try to relieve the post1982 illegal people of this tremendous concern.  I shall conclude on that note.</P>

    <P>(vi)  undertake a major programme of education and information, particularly among schoolleavers, aimed at spelling out the reasons (a) why Irish people should remain if at all possible here at home; (b) the positive benefits of living and working in Ireland; (c) the need for young people in particular to stay and fight for all our futures rather than allow themselves to be driven out, or to drift into unplanned and frequently glamourised emigration; (d) the facilities and resources available for encouraging indigenous enterprise and opportunity; (e) the difficulties that Irish emigrants will encounter abroad; and in general to counter the myth, now being propagated by the Government among others, that Irish people should regard emigration, even when it is involuntary, as having positive benefits&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In moving the Labour Party amendment to the motion in the names of Deputy Barry and his Fine Gael colleagues, I welcome the opportunity of addressing the contents of this motion in this House.  As one who formerly worked in the United States as an illegal immigrant, I am perhaps in as good a position as anybody in this House to speak on this <Col N="1587" /> very topic.  Ten years ago the circumstances were a lot easier for the illegal Irish in the United States than they are at present.  There certainly was goodwill, as mentioned by Deputy Briscoe. There is tremendous goodwill in the United States towards Irish immigrants, be they legal or otherwise, in comparison with countries not that far away from home, in the way they treat the Irish. However, goodwill itself is not sufficient and it may be the old story that it is all well as long as nothing happens.</P>
    <P>In those days ten years back, work was readily available.  In fact, employers were quite glad to be in a position to assist Irish students or former students when it came to providing jobs for them.  The problems arose when accidents happened or illness struck, in relation to the enormous cost of health care in the United States and if any problems followed in relation to finding work.  Unfortunately, the problems have increased since then and, if anything, they are now reaching crisis proportions, for two reasons, first, because of the number of people who have been leaving this country and, secondly, because of the new regime now in position in the United States.  Heretofore employers were quite glad to get cheap, reliable labour, as they would have looked upon it, and take their chances with the system.  However, now with the imposition of the new fines obviously they have to make a calculation and I believe that the calculation is fast becoming that it is not in their interest to take on Irish people who do not have legal status in the United States.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of talking about this topic because action is long overdue.  Despite efforts by the previous Government, of which I was a member, to bring this up at the highest level with our counterparts in the United States, despite the fact that every possible opportunity was taken with visiting politicians and certainly in the course of visits to the United States, unfortunately the response for which we were looking has not been forthcoming.  I would not underestimate the domestic difficulties facing <Col N="1588" /> the United States politicians in relation to solving our problems because obviously there is a plethora of problems which have to be solved in tandem.  However, it is our prime function and duty to address the problem as it affects Irish immigrants.</P>
    <P>Obviously, emigration is not new to this country.  We have had phases of it over the last 150 years.  There have been lulls and there have been increases and for the last 15 to 20 years, in particular, we have had hopes and aspirations that it was no longer going to be a very serious problem here.  However, time has passed and it is becoming a very serious problem for young Irish people leaving this country once again.</P>
    <P>The motion that we are discussing is perhaps a sad and perhaps even a bitter commentary on all of us here in this country. We are faced with a massive human tragedy, the sight of thousands of young people being forced to leave this country, which obviously is their country.  In some cases they are forced to live like fugitives abroad and that certainly is the message coming home.  The hardship they are suffering is matched in many cases by the hardship they left behind.  It is a sad tale of broken families, broken communities, of friendships left behind, uncertain futures and a shattering of expectations. Despite the figures which we can trot out in relation to the successes which people have had in regard to their earning capacity in the United States, there is no doubt that it is a tragedy, a tragedy which at this stage has affected every community, every village and every sports club in this country.</P>
    <P>Some years ago one would have felt that this problem would only have manifested itself in the lack of availability of members of football teams on the western seaboard, but I can assure the Members of this House that the problem is now so acute that in this city rugby teams are finding it hard to fill their teams at under age and under 19 levels at the start of the season.  In some cases where the opportunities occurred to leave, whole teams have left and that is a sad <Col N="1589" /> tale.  The plight is getting worse as time goes on.  The dismantling of the educational system, in the cause of which 30,000 people were on the streets of Dublin today, will ensure that those who will go will now go unqualified and illequipped to cope with the rigours of life in an alien environment.</P>
    <P>Above all, the fact that forced emigration exists and is growing is a reflection on all of us both inside and outside of this House and on our political system.  Faced with that reflection it is tragic that the best we can do is discuss a motion like the one before us.  That motion does not seek to change the system which has caused this human tragedy.  It does not even seek to address the causes and it contains no reference to unemployment, unfair taxation or the absence of opportunity. It ignores the problems of access to education and, rather surprisingly, it does not in fact tell us where the costings are going to come from which is so unlike the Fine Gael Party.  In the past they have had difficulty in supporting resolutions in education without having costings specified but perhaps the former Minister for Foreign Affairs will inform the House in his contribution as to what well thought out costings the Fine Gael Party have put together if this motion is accepted by the House.</P>
    <P>Instead of looking at the problems which are causing emigration, the motion in its complacency seems to say that emigration is acceptable to us as a society in the 1980s.  It seems to say that we want people to leave to relieve the pressure on social spending and to enable us to put a cosmetic finish on our unemployment figures.  For these reasons I say on behalf of the Labour Party that this is a grossly inadequate motion and in saying that I know I will offend some Deputies who mean well when they seek additional services for those of our people who are illegal immigrants in the United States.  I recognise the good intentions behind this motion and I welcome the motion in that a discussion in this House on this very topic is long overdue.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the plight of emigrants, then we must be equally <Col N="1590" /> serious about constructing the only solution which would be of any help to them and that is the solution which would bring home those of them who wish to come home and to provide them with a brighter future in Ireland.  I do not believe that we are doing that at present and we have not been doing it for the past 12 months. Instead we have been sending the message to more and more young people that they are not welcome here.  That is the message we have to change, and I do not believe this motion of itself will succeed in changing that message.  Neither will the complacent response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to this debate last night.  He accepted the principle of the motion before us subject, as he put it, to having the right to work out some of the details in his own way.  In other words, we should be under no illusions: the Government do not intend to do anything. I have to dispute the comments of Deputy Briscoe when he said that the Government are doing things.  Certainly, the message at present coming back from the United States from the groups involved with illegal immigrants and from the immigrants themselves is not that the changes made are as a result of the efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs following his visit some months back but one of dissatisfaction.  They feel not half enough is being done on their behalf by the Department of Foreign Affairs under the auspices of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that message is going to continue to be brought home.  They feel much more has to be done.  There is a responsibility upon us to ensure that much more is done in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for all the resources of the State to be used.  The spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats last night said in this debate that her party were going to support the motion on the understanding that it did not cost anything.  I sometimes wonder whether we spend too much time in this House and not enough time in the real world.  The Irish Immigration Reform Movement are living in the real world.  They have already reported that when the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill was discussed at hearings of the <Col N="1591" /> Senate judicial committee that the Irish Government were silent on the issue. They report that only one liaison officer has been appointed and that even in Boston, where some of the most powerful Irish-American politicians are prepared to commit themselves, the Irish Consulate has been largely indifferent and that despite what the Minister said here last night there has been no assistance from the Irish Government for a hotline for illegals or for cheaper medical insurance or in respect of banking facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us last night that the issue of banking facilities was only a matter of changing the law.  As he would say himself, it was no problem, just change the federal law of the United States &mdash; which we in this House have no power to do &mdash; and everything would be all right.  He did not tell us how this was going to be done or whether he had started having discussions with representatives of the United States administration or whether there was any prospect of it being done.  If this debate is to achieve anything I would like to feel that these serious complaints and weaknesses being found by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement at present would be addressed by the Government and by the diplomatic representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I question whether our diplomatic corps as presently established are the right organisation to deal with these problems. I question whether they in fact are streetwise as to the problems facing our emigrants in New York, Boston and other cities of the United States.  Perhaps, the Minister should consider whether we should send out officials from other Departments who would be familiar with their problems because speaking from experience somebody in the Bronx would not consider contacting the Embassy or the consulate without a great deal of thought.  It would only be as a last resort on a very serious problem.  From their experience of the diplomatic service in the past illegal aliens are not going to regard our diplomatic service as being a <Col N="1592" /> service which would establish their cases with the administration in the United States.</P>
    <P>I say that with respect to our diplomatic corps and to the consular and embassy officials who work on behalf of this country in the United States because I know they work very hard and very effectively on many issues but I also know that if there are deficiencies in their handling of the problems of Irish illegals, and I say there are, those deficiencies in the large part spring from a lack of direction and a lack of resources.  They arise because the Government are not particularly serious about this problem.</P>
    <P>I have not heard anything on behalf of the Government or the Department of Foreign Affairs during the past 24 hours which would make me feel that the Government are serious about tackling this problem.  The attitude &mdash; and certainly that which was reflected in the interview which the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave to <i>Newsweek</i> magazine &mdash; is basically that Irish illegals are off our hands and that they are someone else's problem.</P>
    <P>I knew that if I put down an amendment to this motion calling for a fundamental reappraisal of our approach to economics and fundamental changes in the structures of our society, it would not have been accepted by this House.  The mood of this House over the past 12 months has not been one to suggest that a majority of Deputies are interested in fundamental change.  Nevertheless, it is the truth that unless we face up to the need for fundamental change we will continue to send our young people abroad by whatever is the cheapest form of transport available.</P>
    <P>Since we knew that we would not get the agreement of a majority in this House to fundamental changes in our economic system, the amendment we tabled includes a series of practical statements aimed at increasing the strength of the message of concern which we want to come from this House.  The first part of our amendment asks the House to recognise that involuntary emigration causes <Col N="1593" /> hardship both directly and indirectly.  As someone who has lived abroad I can testify, like many thousands of others, that hardship manifests itself in many ways. For an immigrant often the hardest thing to bear is the hardship of loneliness.  That is a hardship all the committees, the liaison officers and the hotlines in the world will not cure.  I am sure this part of our amendment is non-contentious.</P>
    <P>The second part of our amendment asks the House to direct the Government, rather than simply asking them. This part of the amendment, in the light of the comments made in the contribution by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night, has to be a direction to the Government.  Otherwise I do not feel that we in this House will get the sort of action which this debate requires.</P>
    <P>The third part of the amendment requires the Government to take certain steps.  First, we are entitled to know the scale of emigration month by month and the Government should be compelled to ensure that we do.  This is especially the case when emigration is being used to suggest that unemployment is falling at a time when, in fact, unemployment is rising.  The unadjusted live register figures fell by about 13,000 from January to November 1987.  Adjusted for seasonal factors, the figures have fallen by less than 1,000.  If they were adjusted to show the effects of emigration the figures would have risen.  In my estimation they would have risen by at least 25,000 persons. We would be able to see much more clearly the failure of policy and perhaps even be provoked into doing something about it if we were given the true figures on a month by month basis.  If nothing else, it might remind us, as we continually need to be reminded, that even though emigrants are off our hands they remain our responsibility.  They retain the right to be regarded as Irish citizens even if some of us want to forget that they exist.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a far more effective way of dealing with the problems on the ground than working through over stretched consular resources is to make funding available to reputable organisations.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has met <Col N="1594" /> some of these organisations and had discussions with them.  He even made them some promises over the past number of months.  I take it from all that that it is safe to assume that all of the organisations he met with are bona fide organisations. If they are not, the Minister should tell us.  If they are, the requests they have made for assistance are very modest and it would not stretch the Minister's budget to make a grant available to them.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is an urgent need for education, not when it is too late when the emigrants have already left, but throughout the educational cycle.  Every day we hear stories about the entrepreneurial skills that are flourishing in the States side by side with the stories about our young people who are drifting into problems.  Young people with problems need our help and we need their entrepreneurial skills in this country.  It is long past the time when we should be educating our young people to know that there is a future for them here and that the grass is as green in their own country as they will find it anywhere.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was very fashionable for politicians and industrialists who were trying to attract industry to this country to speak of our greatest asset &mdash; our young people.  That was the slogan for a period of years but it does not seem to be used so often any more.  The official policy now seems to be that we do not have the resources, the ability and the dynamic to ensure that our young people remain our greatest asset.  Whether or not we like it, as the wheel turns these young people are the future of this country. We must fight with them for a future. If we do not fight with them to give them a future, the confidence that is necessary and the opportunities to use their talents for the benefit of this country, we cannot blame them if they come to the conclusion that we are the ones who have let them down.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I urge the Government to accept the Labour Party amendment to this motion.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs might pass on the request to the <Col N="1595" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs that we in this House should have an opportunity to monitor, on a continuing basis, exactly what is happening in the United States in relation to this problem.  All the good will in this House towards solving the problem should have channelled, developed and fostered.  While we might argue and disagree about the actual remedies being proposed and the lack of resources which are being given at any one time, at the end of the day we are talking about a very vulnerable group of people.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset these people are now far more vulnerable than they were ten years ago during my time in the United States.  They are threatened from all sides.  They no longer have the comfort of considerate employers who are glad to avail of their labours and talents in many facets of industry in the United States, ranging from the construction industry to the service industries.  Despite the enormous good will which exists and this must be acknowledged in this House, for the Government and people of this country, and which we should cultivate and foster, the difficulties are now becoming insurmountable.</P>
    <P>I have itemised the main problems as I see them.  They range from lack of health care to a total lack of security for our young people.  The previous speaker said that as many Deputies as possible should go to the United States for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and other celebrations, but I do not believe it is good enough.  A five minute meeting with conviction in relation to looking for solutions to these problems would be far better than the presence of every Member of this House on the streets of New York during St. Patrick's Day parades.  We should be looking for responses from the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a lot of goodwill towards the Irish exists there and we should tap it.  We should ensure that the services offered to us by the Irish American politicians, some of whom command tremendous respect in the political arena in the US, are taken up.  We should provide <Col N="1596" /> a facility, perhaps in the form of a committee of the House, for discussing a topic like this.  There is no doubt that a debate on this matter is long overdue.  In the past there was a tendency to say that either the problem did not exist or that by highlighting it we were drawing attention to the many illegal aliens in the US.</P>
    <P>Our approach to solving the problem must be two-pronged.  We must address the fundamental problem associated with unemployment here and provide all assistance possible to Irish immigrants in the US.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the names of Deputies of The Workers' Party reads:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in the second line to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and realising that our exceptionally high level of unemployment, which has continued under successive Coalition and Fianna Fáil Governments, has been the main contributing factor to renewed emigration, calls for a properly planned programme of job creation, based on a major expansion of the productive State sector, to ensure that nobody is forced to emigrate through lack of job opportunities,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not disagree with the objectives of the Fine Gael motion but any debate on the forced emigration or economic extradition of young people and young families &mdash; indeed, some of them are not so young &mdash; cannot take place without referring to the root cause of that forced emigration.  Our party have consistently made the case that our economy has the capacity to provide work for all at home. We argue that we have the land, the timber, the minerals and, above all, a young willing workforce to put those resources to good use and create the jobs and wealth necessary to keep all our people in Ireland.  It has been the abysmal political failure of successive Governments, Fianna Fáil and Coalition, that <Col N="1597" /> they took economic decisions to throw good money after bad and into the pockets of private speculators who did not have any serious commitment to the development of our economy or the creation of full employment.  Emigration will continue for as long as we pursue such economic policies.  It will continue for as long as Irish Governments fail to change their economic approach.  If those policies are pursued the views expressed last night and tonight on this motion will measure very thinly in regard to expressing concern for our young people who go abroad in search of work.</P>
    <P>It is important in the course of a debate on the conditions and rights of people who go abroad in search of work that we dispel the notion, or inclination towards that notion, as expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in an interview with the American magazine, <i>Newsweek</i>, earlier this year, that it was a good thing to have so many young people going abroad, it was something we should not be worried about and it was a matter that did not require immediate Government action.  It must be emphasised that the departure of any person, whether willingly or not, from home and family in search of a livelihood abroad is traumatic. To have to do so out of necessity is all the more traumatic.</P>
    <P>Such departures represent the loss of young workers to our own workforce and a huge loss to our economy in terms of the investment that went into the education of those young people to attain the skills they will develop abroad.  Many of the young people who emigrate to America do not have a proper permit with the result that they must work under deplorable conditions.  They do not have social insurance cover, health care cover, or the right of redress for any injury they might suffer at the hands of callous exploiters in the work place or elsewhere.  They must hide out of fear of being detected and as a result suffer all forms of exploitation at the hands of employers many of whom in turn make their contributions at functions like Cairde Gael of 100 dollars per plate or fund raising dinners for <Col N="1598" /> Fianna Fáil and the other major political parties in this House.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that as long as the problem exists for Irish immigrants our Government have an obligation to be actively involved on their behalf and concerned about their plight.  The reaction to the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs should have brought it home to the Government that their attitude will not be tolerated.  The formation of groups like the Irish Immigration Reform Movement should bring home to the Government that there is a need for active involvement and a positive reaction to the plight of Irish immigrants.</P>

      <P>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but I must point out to him that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is anxious to participate in the debate and that I am obliged to call the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Peter Barry, at 8.15 p.m. to conclude.  Will the Deputy be kind enough to facilitate the Minister of State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I appreciate being given the opportunity to comment on our amendment.  There is a great need for active involvement by the Government in regard to the plight of Irish immigrants in the US.  I am not satisfied that the efforts to date in meeting the demands of people like the Irish Immigration Reform Movement are adequate. There is much that they sought in their charter that the Government have not responded to in this whole debate on the economic extradition of so many of our young people.  There is a <i>prima facie</i> case, but it condemns this and successive Governments here to the charge of neglect and lack of care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and I intend to do so in the manner in which it started last night and continued then and for most of this evening. I welcome especially the way Deputy Spring started and, let me say, <Col N="1599" /> finished the debate.  However, between start and finish he seems to have forgotten that the Labour Party, in whose name this amendment is down, were in Government for about six of the last eight years.</P>
      <P>Before I comment on the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party let me say that what is needed is to make certain the economy can sustain properly the number of people who now, unfortunately, have to emigrate.  I was a little worried by the fact that Deputy Spring seemed to indicate that quite a large number of non-status immigrants in the US for some reason or other do not want to go to the Irish Embassy or consulates. It should go out from here tonight that they should be encouraged to go to the embassy and the consulates because there they will get the information and help they need.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs last night accepted on behalf of the Government the terms of the Fine Gael motion before the House.  He said there were certain things he would like to see not pushed, but he has accepted the terms of the motion in general.</P>
      <P>It is most desirable that there be as broad a range as possible of national agreement on issues such as emigration. This issue does not arise due to any one Government policy or lack of it but to a series of events some, at least, of which are outside the power of any Government. As the Minister said last night, emigration is a fact and we all accept that fact.  We must change the root causes of emigration by doing everything we can to bring about an economic atmosphere in which jobs, the only real antidote to emigration, can be created.  Simultaneously, however, we must face the fact of emigration and try to alleviate its harsher aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since their election to office the Government, in line with their pre-election promises in this context, have faced the unpleasant fact of emigration particularly to the US and have tried to improve those structures within which our emigrants <Col N="1600" /> there currently live and work.  As we are all too aware, there are tens of thousands of young Irish men and women in the US today whose status is unclear and uncertain.  They fear they might somehow come to official notice.</P>
    <P>For our part we have attacked the problem on two levels.  In the first place as a direct result of the very prompt diplomatic initiative undertaken by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, almost immediately after their election, good friends of Ireland in the US Congress, Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman Brian Donnelly, set to work and produced a draft Bill which has already had one hearing before the relevant sub-committee of the powerful US Senate Judiciary Committee.  I would like to join with other speakers in paying tribute to these two US political leaders for the initiative they have shown in this matter.  I take some pride in recalling how in a speech I made in the Seanad in June I expressed the Government's appreciation for what Senator Kennedy and Congressman Donnelly had earlier done in the context of the passing of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 when the famous so-called lottery visa provision was passed.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows whether the US legislative system, which is a great deal more complex than ours, will in fact pass this measure and if so in what form.  I believe, nonetheless, that it might be helpful if I outlined briefly for the benefit of Deputies the key provisions in this Bill.  Before doing so I would like to explain the main features of the current US permanent immigrant system.  Under a US law of 1965 already referred to by many Deputies 270,000 such visas are granted annually. There are six classes of potential beneficiaries among whom the 270,000 visas are divided.  For the purpose of the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill the key categories are numbers 3 and 5 which refer to professional and skilled workers respectively.  At present 50,000 visas are allocated to each such class.  What this Bill would in effect do would be add a special subcategory of 25,000 visas to each of these categories.  The basis for <Col N="1601" /> applications for visas under the existing category would remain the same, that is first come, first served.  However, for the two new subcategories, eligibility would be determined by success under a points system.  There are 11 headings under which points are allocated.  The headings and the points allocated to each are as follows:</P>

    <P>As Deputies see, the maximum number of points comes to 147.  The Bill proposes that a minimum score of 70 points must be attained before an applicant can be considered for a visa.</P>
    <P>The proposed system is so geared that well-trained English speaking workers from one of the countries disadvantaged under the current law stand a good chance of passing the 70 point threshold and being considered for a visa. However, the Government are not confining their efforts to Washington but are also facing up to the harsh facts facing the individual out of status immigrant. Clearly such an immigrant has difficulty getting a job &mdash; a process made much more complicated under provisions of a <Col N="1602" /> US law passed last year.  When he or she gets one he or she could be easily exploited by unscrupulous employers, a matter mentioned by a number of Deputies. Their health insurance situation is unclear partly because they have difficulty relating to the US system, partly because being out of status they are excluded by the US social welfare system, they are charged high rents.  I could go on with this depressing litany.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to make the point that there is already a system in place which acts as something of a safety net for the new arrival.  The media coverage of the plight of the out of status Irish has unaccountably lost sight of the efforts of several very influential and sympathetic Irish-American bodies who have constantly done tremendously good work over the years and are really rising to the challenge the present problem has created.  I refer to the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the United Irish Counties Association, the Irish American Labour Coalition and the GAA in particular. These have, either directly or via bodies affiliated to them, given great moral and sometimes financial support to individual Irish citizens who are suffering personal hardship.  They give advice about jobs, accommodation and, most importantly nowadays, legal aid to those who wish to regularise their position.  In several cases they have fund-raised for migrants who ran up costly medical bills.  For example, as Deputy Briscoe said, the Kerryman's P &amp; B Association of the Bronx provided considerable financial aid in five tragic cases of young Kerry people who died tragically in New York in the past year. I would like to place on the record of this House the Government's deep appreciation for all their efforts on behalf of fellow Irishmen and women.</P>
    <P>The efforts of these Irish-American bodies have been supplemented by decisions made in New York by the church authorities there and in Boston by the Mayor.  In New York Cardinal O'Connor has set up a special programme called &ldquo;Project Irish Outreach&rdquo; which is run by the Catholic Charities, a part of the administration of the Archdiocese of <Col N="1603" /> New York.  Under this project free medical care is being provided in the Catholic hospitals of the archdiocese to all migrants, irrespective of status, who are without funds.  The project also addresses questions of accommodation, family matters, legal assistance and child services. In Boston, Mayor Flynn has provided that the hospitals under the care of his administration are also open to migrants and he has also set up a legal advice service which, when fully operational, will have no fewer than 60 lawyers involved.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with this aspect of the situation because I do not believe it is fully appreciated here.  As Deputies are aware, the families of all these migrants are most concerned at the vulnerability of their sons and daughters, particularly when they are excluded from the local state health benefits that we take for granted in this country.  However, I have tried to show that though that is so, there are a number of private safety nets which are there to take care of our citizens who run into particular problems and that while the out of status nature of their stay in the United States is a matter of the highest importance, and is so regarded by the Government, solutions do exist for other problems they may have.  Indeed, the way is open to them to seek low cost legal aid which may help individuals resolve this basic problem as well.</P>
    <P>Naturally close links have developed over the years between our offices in the United States &mdash; our embassy at Washington and our consulates general at New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco &mdash; and the representatives of the Irish-American, church and local state bodies in their consular areas which I should explain cover not only the city in which they are based but several of the neighbouring states as well.  In fact, the whole of the United States is covered by one or other of our offices.  Accordingly when the Government were seeking ways of tackling the problems individual Irish <Col N="1604" /> citizens were facing on the ground, so to speak, we naturally turned to our consulates general and the informal framework that has already existed as providing the best possible base for a really effective organisation geared to meet the needs of our newly arrived out of status immigrants.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, following visits by the Minister in August and September of this year when he met with the representatives of those Irish-American bodies, to set up more formal arrangements when needed and as a result immigration working committees have been set up based on our consulates general at New York and Boston.  A further reason for using the consulates general in this way was that they had official and diplomatic standing <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United States Government agencies at the federal level such as the United States Immigration and Naturalisation Service and at the State and city level and had already contacts in these agencies.  Indeed, in Boston the city administration is represented on the working committee.</P>
    <P>The agencies I have mentioned plus the Irish Immigration Reform Movement which was set up by some of the newly arrived out of status Irish citizens, have all been invited to join.  Since September &mdash; and I would remind Deputies we are only talking of a period of three months &mdash; they have met several times, set up sub committees to deal with individual problems and are already producing results.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday outlined the work that had already been done particularly in the information, health and banking areas by the New York Consulate Committee.  If I may, I would like to recapitulate very briefly what he said. Following a pooling of information in the New York Consulate Working Committee, an information booklet giving essential information to newly arrived migrants has been drawn up.  The New York City authorities have agreed to print 10,000 copies of this and we will arrange for as wide a distribution of this booklet as possible.  On the health front, the provision of health insurance is most important, particularly as United States <Col N="1605" /> hospital expenses are three to four times higher than here.  Following research into the question, the committee have identified a number of low cost insurance systems that should be affordable to the average migrant.  The committee will see about publicising the existence of these schemes.</P>
    <P>The question of banking is another difficult one as out of status migrants cannot open a bank account.  The working committee have also looked into this but quick solutions are not easy to come by. The committee will, with the help of contacts in the banking world, continue to seek solutions in this area.</P>
    <P>I will not be able to finish my speech because of sharing time.  We accept the Fine Gael motion in general.  In the very short time this Government have been in office they have done a great deal for these people.  They have given the problem the priority they promised, and they will continue to do so.  I will put before the Minister and the Government the matter mentioned by Deputy Spring as regards continous monitoring. However, I can assure him that this is a problem the Government are taking very seriously and that there is ongoing monitoring of the out of status immigrants in the United States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everybody who contributed to this motion, and in particular the Minister of State who made a very constructive contribution.  This motion gives the House an opportunity to present to the outside world a unified voice on a subject which is of concern to the whole country.  The last time this happened was when we were dealing with the motion relating to the Arias Convention on Central America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a motion on emigration in the broadest sense.  It is a carefully drafted motion to deal with the Irish out of status immigrants in the United States. It is designed and worded in such a way that every Deputy and all parties should have no problem supporting it, to show people outside this House, and particularly the Irish out of status immigrants in the United States, that all parties are <Col N="1606" /> concerned about their plight, are behind the Government and the Minister, and will do everything they can to try to bring about a change in their status.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Labour Party and The Workers' Party have, from an argumentative stand in one case, and an ideological stand in another, put down amendments to this motion, neither of which I propose to accept.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion, no doubt well meaning, contains many pious aspirations. Deputy Spring spoke about mobilising the good will in this House and said it should have a channel.  That channel is the Fine Gael motion before the House.  I am sorry The Workers' Party should use this occasion not to express concern about the plight of these illegal immigrants in the United States but to give another airing to that party's aged ideological horse.  It would be far more constructive if they had supported our motion and given the necessary support to those many agencies in America, as well as this Government, who are trying to do something to help these people who are in such an unfortunate position.</P>

      <P>We have no intention of embarrassing the Minister in this regard because I recognise he has done his best with this very difficult job.  We want him and the people in America, who will be reading with cynicism some of the contributions made from some of the parties here, to recognise that they have our support and goodwill.  We want something done for these out of status Irish immigrants in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a debate on emigration in <Col N="1607" /> the broad sense.  I would very much welcome the opportunity of having a debate in this House on emigration in its broadest sense and on the kind of argument made by Deputy Spring and Deputy McCartan.  They would have a place in such a debate but not in this one which is for a separate and different purpose and is narrow in its application.</P>
    <P>I should join with other speakers who have thanked in particular Congressman Donnelly because he was the initiator of the 1986 Act known as the Lottery Act. This was valuable and Congressman Donnelly told me that he had introduced this Act to demonstrate to Government in its broadest sense in America that there was still a demand and a need for immigration from these countries. Having established that, by his 1986 Act he intended to bring forward another Bill on a much broader basis to deal with a whole lot of other issues and the numbers who would be allowed in.  The Kennedy-Donnelly Bill at present being debated in Congress is the product of Congressman Donnelly's original Bill last year.  We all hope that it will be amended as little as possible because, from the Irish point of view, it was very helpful legislation.  We should express our very warm thanks to Senator Kennedy and Congressman Donnelly for what they have done.  We should also thank Senator Damato who also introduced a Bill in the House and we should not forget that Congressman Kennedy has another motion before the Senate.  All these people recognised the very serious problems and are attempting in their various ways to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Tributes have been paid here to Mayor Flynn of Boston and I do not want to take away from what he has done but long before he did anything Cardinal O'Connor and the Executive Director of the Catholic Charities organisation, Monsignor Murray, who was here in the last fortnight, recognised the need to do something.  They have done excellent work in arranging legal status for immigrants and have issued instructions to the 13 Catholic hospitals that if anyone is <Col N="1608" /> in the unfortunate position of needing medical care, they are to be treated free in those hospitals.  They should be thanked for their work in that regard. While Cardinal O'Connor and Monsignor Murray dealt with the illegal immigrants, all the other initiatives in Congress have been dealing with legal immigrants.  If the Donnelly-Kennedy Bill goes through, there will be an increase in the quota of nationals from other countries who can live legally in America.  However, that still leaves in limbo people who went to the United States post-1982 and, therefore, cannot avail of the 1986 amnesty.  They will not be able to avail of the Kennedy-Donnelly Bill and it is to their situation that the Fine Gael motion is addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a great problem in regard to emigration and perhaps we could do more about it in this House.  However, our prime concern at the moment is the illegals.  We also want to ensure &mdash; this is more a subject for a broader debate &mdash; that all immigrants from this country should maintain in whatever way possible their links with this country.  If I may give myself a little plus, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I put in an enormous amount of work with regard to emigrants to the United Kingdom.  I hope it was fruitful and gave them the sense that, even though they were living and working in another country, the Government here were interested in their plight and wanted to do something to help them to maintain that link.  For the reasons I outlined and because of our concern for emigration generally, especially for the illegals in America, we decided to form a committee on emigration.  Illegal emigrants to all countries, Australia, Germany, Britain and America, should be helped.</P>
    <P>The problem in dealing with the illegals in America &mdash; they should more correctly be referred to as out of status people &mdash; is that it is difficult to get precise figures as to how many are involved.  The Taoiseach, replying to a Dáil Question about two weeks ago, gave a figure of 99,000 emigrants over the last five years but, of course, this includes people going to countries all over the world, legally and <Col N="1609" /> illegally.  Another report said that 35,000 people had emigrated last year, so, obviously, there are different views in that regard.  The general belief in America is, on the basis of somewhat imprecise surveys, that there are about 125,000 illegal immigrants in America.  All those figures do not add up but, no matter what the figure is, it is clear to all sides of the House, and particularly in America, that there is a large body of Irish people living and working in America who are out of status and about whom we want to do something.</P>
    <P>It has been said a number of times here tonight that the conditions under which they live and work are appalling.  They face not only the difficulty of coping with a differently structured society but also have the major handicap of having no legal status in the eyes of the United States authorities.  This is a huge difficulty for young people who sometimes are out of this country for the first time.  Sometimes it can be dangerous for them because the United States does not have a developed welfare system such as they are accustomed to in Ireland.  The churches here take a lot of interest in people who are emigrating and point out the pitfalls they are likely to meet when they get there.</P>
    <P>Illegal immigrants have no access to health insurance, so even a relatively minor accident can prove a threat to their livelihood and well-being.  Illegals cannot manage their incomes sufficiently well to cope with the lifestyle of that society. It is impossible for them to open bank accounts and lines of credit.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to report crimes, robberies or attacks on them for fear of attracting official attention to their status. There was a horrifying account on the radio and in the newspapers last week of a young girl who was raped in New York and who did not report it because she would draw attention to her illegal status. That situation must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Employers have to be careful about whom they employ and if they knowingly employ illegals they are liable to prosecution. In the Minister's circulated <Col N="1610" /> speech &mdash; which he had not time to complete &mdash; he said that the employer clause is causing this Government most concern. Under the terms of the 1986 Act, the onus is on employers to ensure that all their employees are entitled to work and that failure to do so could result in increasing amounts of levy being imposed on offending employers.  It must be recognised that this provision is part and parcel of US law and that the US immigration and naturalisation service is obliged under US law to implement it. The embassy in Washington and our consulates general are, however, under instruction to monitor this situation most closely and to take whatever action can be taken should its implementation affect the interests of Irish citizens.  The Minister added that he reserved the right to intervene when necessary in this context. I hope I am not reading more into those remarks than there is and that the Minister has some basis for believing that he does have the right to intervene and that he can solve the problems of people who are threatened with loss of employment because their employers have discovered they are out of status.  If the Minister can stand over that paragraph it will have been the most significant part of this debate in the past two nights.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer lastly to our self interest in this &mdash; I do not intend this to be taken in a selfish way &mdash; in ensuring that the status of these people is changed.  We do not want to see them drift into the clutches of IRA support groups in the United States who would exploit them for reasons that would not be in the interests of anybody in this House or on this island.  We all have a common interest in sending a message to the illegals that they should not lose hope and that we in this House and in this country are concerned for their welfare and want to do something about it.  That was the spirit in which I had hoped this debate would be conducted.  Everybody in this House is concerned that the Minister should get our full support in using his influence, not just among the very valuable friends of Ireland who have been such true friends to these people but also <Col N="1611" /> at another level which is available to the Minister but which is generally not available to other Irish politicians, that is, the State Department in Washington.</P>
    <P>I thank the House again for their contributions <Col N="1612" /> to this debate and I hope that at some future date we can avail of a full debate on emigration in its broadest sense.</P>

I also wish to know whether the customs officers concerned will carry the powers at all times or whether they will only be entitled to exercise them while on duty?  For example, if their period of duty is from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., will their powers only be conferred on them for that period or will they have the powers 24 hours a day and have the right to exercise them at any time, even though they may not be in uniform or on duty specifically in the port at the particular time?</P>

We will be conferring the powers on the 2,000 staff in line with the Misuse of Drugs Act.  In tandem with the legislation pertaining to drugs in the Misuse of Drugs Act, we will be conferring the same powers on the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces who would be present on any given occasion on the front line assisting in the enforcement of Customs and Excise law, the Misuse of Drugs law or whatever other laws they would be operating under or for whatever reasons they would be there.  We are conferring the powers on the Customs and Excise staff, comprising 2,000 in all, with 700 in the front line and on those who assist them, the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.

Once conferred with the powers, will the principle apply of once a customs officer, always a customs officer, whether on duty or not?  That principle applies to members of the Garda Síochána and whether on duty or not they are vested with all of the powers conferred on them by law, statute or otherwise.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Instead of answering my anxiety the Minister is making me more anxious.  The Minister appears to say that members of the Defence Forces and/or the FCA could be designated from time to time as members of the public service who in the course of their duty would be expected to prevent the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  However, there is another principle by which we work and that is that the Defence Forces will only be involved in aid of the civil power.  If the Minister <Col N="1617" /> is correct, he envisages a direct role for the Irish Army and for the FCA, not in the aid of the civil power but acting directly and exercising all the powers of the Bill on their own at any time anywhere in the State provided they are involved in the activity of preventing the illegal importation or exportation of goods.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of this Bill an officer is a member of the Customs and Excise's 2,000 staff, is a member of the Garda Síochána or is a member of the Defence Forces assisting in any situation at that time, but it does not confer powers on the Defence Forces in an open manner. It does it in a confined manner when they are present actively supporting and assisting customs officers in the execution of their duties.  It is only then that the powers are conferred on them.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is all very well but this Bill is conferring new powers on Customs and Excise officers and I presume that the power is <Col N="1618" /> confined to officers of Customs and Excise as explained in lines 17 to 19.  I cannot see how that includes members of the Defence Forces.  I do not follow it.  It adds greater anxiety to the point I made earlier.  Is it the situation that any public servants who are instructed to prevent the illegal importation or exportation of any goods will be conferred with all the powers contained in this Bill, even if they are only acting as such for an hour, a day or a week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up the Minister's earlier remarks.  I accept his definition of customs officer for the purpose of the Acts of 1942 and 1956 and the fact that the definition there includes a person acting on the order of a customs official or a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces acting in support. I can fully appreciate in operations in certain locations, particularly along the land frontier, the importance of having the back-up assistance of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána. Am I not correct in thinking that in this new Bill, which is conferring wide-ranging new powers on Customs and Excise officers, a specific definition is being sought to be introduced exclusively for the working of this Bill?</P>
      <P>It includes a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service who for the time being is employed in the prevention of the illegal importation or exportation of goods.  Am I correct that we are talking about this definition in the context of this Bill only and that it is only on these people that the powers contained in the Bill will be conferred?  I ask the Minister to clarify the point made by Deputy Noonan.  It extends this Bill well beyond first observations to suggest that the powers it contains would be available to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to delete from the group of persons to be considered entitled to these powers those who are working on an <i>ad hoc</i> or temporary basis.  The Minister tells us that <Col N="1619" /> the core group of workers within the Customs and Excise amounts to about 2,000 people, 700 of whom are on active frontline duties.  I understand that some of these 700 are out on the road at frontiers, actively involved in detecting smuggling, and other officers are confined to buildings at airports, ports and elsewhere, engaged in occasional spot checks.  I also understand that these people are differently organised, work under vastly different conditions and consider themselves as carrying out very different duties.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with a number of staff members on an informal basis in the context of this Bill and I understand that those who are engaged in searching through baggage at airports and ports do not consider themselves concerned with the provisions of this Bill.  If that view exists throughout the Customs and Excise there will be unbelievable chaos, especially if the typists, the clerks and the other 1,300 non-frontline workers are to be considered part of the back-up group entitled to use these powers.  Many of these people will wake up tommorrow morning worried that they are now the conveyors of the remarkable powers given under this Bill.  The Minister has told us that the definition could apply to all members of the staff in the Department of Finance and perhaps to any employee in any Department whenever the occasion would call for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In law an off-duty member of the Garda Síochána has an active duty to prevent and detect crime whenever he or she observes it.  Is the same onus to be visited upon members of the Department of Finance or of any Government Department who for the time being are considered to be engaged in the operations of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more the Minister talks the more I believe the amendment deserves support, for two fundamental reasons.  We need to clarify exactly who are to be included and to emphasise that it is not the definition contained in the 1942 and <Col N="1620" /> 1956 Acts that will apply.  Secondly, we need to clarify that it will not apply to people who are brought in for the time being to cover an emergency.  It is regrettable that the Minister has sought to suggest to introduce the word &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; into the debate.  I am happy to see that Deputy Noonan of Fine Gael has taken that one squarely and we will do so if asked to provide a definition.  No one can say but that these powers are draconian though necessary.  It must be emphasised throughout this debate that there is no amendment from any Member of the House seeking not to confer or to create these powers.</P>
    <P>We all agree, because of the situation that exists, that the powers should be created and made available.  I hope we are not to be distracted by any suggestions in regard to this or, indeed, any other amendment, that we are seeking to do down the work envisaged in the Bill. We are seeking to tidy up the Bill and introduce safeguards where we believe they are necessary.  The previous Government spent upwards of a year or more debating the whole issue in the context of the Criminal Justice Act in regard to members of the Garda Síochána.  In the debate on the conferring of powers it was accepted that there should be a balance or a counterbalance safeguard procedure built in.  This amendment is in the same context.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the history of the powers of arrest, search, detention, retention of property and invasion of the home one does not have to go too far back in time to a stage when very few people had the power; it was the king's prerogative and his lieutenants only who could ever invade or interfere with the right to freedom of property of the servants of the State.  The development of police forces is a recent phenomenon.  Generally the fundamental position is that every person is entitled to their liberty, their property and to freedom from unwarranted interference such as search; that is the first premise.  It is with reluctance and only for exceptional reasons and concerns that society has ever given rights to individuals, such as the police or others, to <Col N="1621" /> interfere with these basic freedoms.  Look at what we have done with regard to the Garda Síochána, the cornerstone of policing in civil society.  We oblige the Garda to wear a uniform.  We oblige them to carry numbers on their shoulders.  We oblige them to carry cards of identity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's correction now.  My understanding was that members of the Garda Síochána, throughout the country, carried numbers on their shoulders.  I am sure I have met gardaí outside Dublin who had numbers on their shoulders.  The Minister says &ldquo;no&rdquo; while his officials, apparently, are saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The Minister had better consult before we get stuck on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that we require every one of them to carry an identity card, with name and photograph.  That is because every time a citizen is confronted by them they are entitled to be absolutely certain as to whom they are dealing with and that that person has the authority and power to do what he or she purports to do.  The citizen is entitled to immediate recourse to name, number, rank or position if called on by a garda.  Even in our most draconian legislation such as the Offences Against the State Act it is specifically and explicity laid down that a member of the Garda Síochána when requested, must produce identity.  All these practical realities are built in as safeguards recognising that it is exceptional, in any circumstances, to allow a citizen &mdash; a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; to stop, to question, to search, to detain or to retain property belonging to another citizen.  For those reasons it must be accepted that giving powers to members of society, other than the Garda <Col N="1622" /> Síochána, is extraordinary and are draconian in measure.  It is essential that we are absolutely clear as to whom we are giving these powers.  This debate has opened up a huge area of concern in terms of who is immediately considered to be included.  Deputy Noonan is probably correct, perhaps his amendment does not go far enough, but it is a useful one nonetheless.  We might be well employed between now and Report Stage looking more closely at a proper definition.</P>
    <P>One of the points the Minister has made is that he wants a flexible regime. I should like to say that in the area of extending powers of arrest, detention, search and retention of property belonging to a citizen a flexible regime is not desirable in the common good.  It is not good that unidentifiable people can drift in and out of a situation where these powers can be exercised and where an innocent member of the public will be involved.  It is not desirable that a member of Customs and Excise staff can make the decision that it is time to call in extra support by way of staff from wherever within the departments available to them.</P>
    <P>In all our legislation in this area the Garda Síochána, the cornerstone of civil policing, are obliged to go to the armed forces.  If you look at the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, they must do so through the office of a chief superintendent or one of the higher rank.  It is considered in the context of emergency legislation a matter of such importance, and such a departure from the norm, that high ranking officers alone are entitled to take these steps and must prepare memoranda to that effect.</P>
    <P>If must be of concern that the definition which is opening up in this debate is far too wide.  Central to the arguments which will come later in regard to some of the amendments the Workers Party will be pursuing is the point that the Bill tends to lose sight of the fact that in any area of policing the first line of recourse must be to the Garda.  Recognising that Customs and Excise officers have a particular duty to do at the frontiers of our State &mdash;<Col N="1623" /> airports, ports and land frontiers&mdash;it is important that they are equipped with all the powers they need.  If they are pushed back, either outside of their usual place of work or if they are put into a bigger operation than they would usually be expected to cope with, the recourse must be to the Garda and not to the assembly of some motley crew, of for the time being officers who will come to their aid and will head off in pursuit of the powers this Bill gives them.</P>
    <P>What is being given to officers in sections 2 and 3 of this Bill must be briefly emphasised.  In the Seanad, as the Minister is well aware, the point was made that in a country as small as ours we are virtually talking about the whole of the country so far as section 2 is concerned. In sections 2 and 3 we are providing powers to stop persons in the vicinity of a port, airport or land frontier, to search and to detain for an unspecified period for the purpose of searching, to arrest where non-compliance arises and to retain property taken from a person suspected of involvement in the commission of an offence.</P>
    <P>In section 3 they are given the power by a district justice or a peace commissioner to enter the property of any person anywhere in the State and search, seize and detain the substance, article, document and so on.  Those are the powers we are giving Customs and Excise officers under the provisions of this Bill. I will make the point yet again, lest I be misinterpreted.  Nobody contends they should not have those powers; unfortunately they are necessary.  It is essential to reiterate that not alone are the powers draconian and wide-ranging but the extent of the people on whom we are conferring them amplifies all of that.  We are asking for a very small gesture on the part of the Minister in the balancing of powers and safeguards, which is, that he would specify much more carefully the persons on whom such powers would be conferred.  If it comes down to numbers I would suggest that the staff of 700, backed up by a fully equipped, well learned, and active police force of almost <Col N="1624" /> 12,000 is numerically sufficient to deal with the problems it is envisaged the provisions of this Bill will have to deal with.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board the genuine concerns of Members pursuing this amendment and give it consideration at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I take on board the genuine concerns of Deputies and thank them for their contributions.  I should not like any confusion to arise. We do not propose to have a major overhaul or to implement a major change in the functions of Customs and Excise officers.  We have 700 uniformed staff on the front line.  We propose to confer these powers on them.  We have a small number of staff in the investigations branch, ununiformed, and we propose to confer these powers on them.  We are dependent on other agencies and organs of State for support and back-up services and for professional assistance and advice in particular circumstances.  The provisions of the Bill confer on the Garda the same powers they have under the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  The provisions of the Bill also confer on senior officers of Customs and Excise the right to be able to designate, at the land frontier, similar powers to members of the Defence Forces in a given situation.</P>
      <P>There must be allowance for flexibility. In the case of agricultural or health matters specialist staff from the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health&mdash; and here we are talking about perhaps one to four &mdash; may be called in on foot of certain information and come through to adjudicate on a particular circumstance pertaining to goods prohibited from entering the country.  Therefore, we are talking only about the powers being conferred on a certain section.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Noonan understands this fully but I want to assure Deputy McCartan there is no danger in the world that we are conferring powers on, say, typists, clerical assistants, clerical officers and so on.  We are not doing that.  They are not in the front line of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked a question about the number of staff we have.  I told the House <Col N="1625" /> the number we have.  I have told the House the staff we have on the front line. We must synchronise the powers under this Bill with those contained in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, taking into account the definition of officers of Customs and Excise and the various other ranks.  It is a very clearly defined position. We are not talking about conferring of powers <i>ad lib</i> across a whole range of the public service which they never had before.  It is very clearly defined &mdash; Customs and Excise officers on the front line with a right to senior Customs and Excise officers to designate certain key personnel at any given time, in the event of certain eventualities only.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept everything the Minister says about his intention and that of his Department. We are not questioning the motives or intentions of the Government, the Cabinet, the Minister, the Department or of the Revenue Commissioners.  All we are questioning is the manner in which the definitions section is drafted.</P>
      <P>With respect, regardless of the Minister's intention and on whom he proposes to confer these powers, it will be this House and this Bill, when it becomes an Act, which will confer the powers.  The Minister will have no control over the exclusion of anybody from the exercise of those powers if they are given those powers under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has just said one extraordinary thing, at least it sounded extraordinary to my ears.  He said that he would envisage that senior officers of Customs and Excise working at the land frontier, would have the authority to confer such powers on members of the Defence Forces.  That is an extraordinary statement.  I do not accept for one moment that the provisions of this Bill do that.  I cannot envisage circumstances, under this definitions section, in which a senior Customs and Excise officer on the Border can, one morning, say to 25 soldiers: &ldquo;You are now, for the time being, involved in the prevention of illegal importation or exportation of goods and, consequently, you have all the powers <Col N="1626" /> under the 1987 Act, even the powers to search&rdquo;.  I do not envisage circumstances in which a member of the Irish Army will have the power to search an individual person.  I do not think the provisions of the Bill, as drafted, intend that.  The Minister has just said what he has said which would bring about what to my mind would be an extraordinary situation. I am very unhappy about this. The matter has been very well aired.  I ask the Minister to reflect on it again.</P>
    <P>I will not press this amendment this evening but I will certainly put down an amendment on Report Stage, either this one or, on consideration one along these lines to meet the fears I have expressed. I hope the Minister with his officials, on consideration also, will come back and meet the points we have raised.</P>
    <P>This is a tough Bill.  One has to be tough with people who are smuggling drugs.  One has to be tough with smugglers in general.  There is no objection about that.  But there is a duty on us to ensure that we know what we are doing. That is the minimum requirement of a legislator, to know what one is doing, to know precisely on whom one is conferring powers, and the exact nature of those powers.  That was my intention in tabling this amendment.  It has been well aired and I shall be returning to it.</P>

The Minister says that the powers conferred under the provisions of the Bill will be available to 700 and a small number of un-uniformed officers.  Then he went on to say that the powers would be available to senior Customs and Excise officers at the land frontier to call in members of the <Col N="1627" /> Defence Forces.  Is that stated specifically anywhere in this Bill, or is the Minister stating how he would envisage the provisions being implemented?  Is that in legislative form or is it an intention the Minister is indicating to us which will be the manner in which the provisions of the Bill will be implemented in the future?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It seems to me that the Army would come in in aid of the civil power, whether it be the Garda or Customs and Excise officers, as they have done to date, that they would not have direct contact with the public and would not exercise the powers conferred under the provisions of this Bill. They would be there performing a protective role in aid of the civil power.  But that is not what the Minister has said or anything like what he has said.  It warrants the Minister's clarification being put on the record.</P>

      <P>I will be only too delighted to clarify the matter.  I regret if I created any confusion.  In reply to a point made earlier by Deputy McCartan &mdash; when he talked about identification by the Garda, clear identity and so on &mdash; Customs and Excise officers have to have the same thing.  They all carry their identification, the commission is conferred on them by the Revenue Commissioners in exactly the same way as the Garda.  What I hope I said &mdash; but perhaps it was misinterpreted &mdash; is that Customs and Excise officers working at the land frontier would have the right to call on the Defence Forces to come to their aid, to assist them, not conferring powers of search or anything like that on them. These powers are specifically conferred on the Customs and Excise officers by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason I referred to the Defence Forces is that under the land frontier regulations, if they are called in to give assistance they would be regarded as officers in the exercise of Customs and Excise duties, but the Bill does not confer powers of search or anything like that on <Col N="1628" /> them.  They are only coming in to aid the civil power.  But in any given situation discretion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In any given case, where there is another officer of the State available, he would be there observing, to give evidence if necessary to create a successful prosecution.  But this does not confer on him the powers that a customs and excise officer has, although he is doing similar duties to the customs and excise officer for a given time.</P>

It would be unfortunate <Col N="1629" /> if we did not tease out the issues that have emerged in the course of this discussion. The Minister said earlier in response to a question of mine that there were 2,000 customs staff.  Can the Minister explain to me where the distinction is drawn between customs staff and customs officials?  I take it the typist is customs staff and what the Minister refers to as frontline officers are customs officers. Could the Minister tell me where the distinction is drawn and whether or not that kind of distinction is defined in law either in previous legislation or in present legislation.  It is not satisfactory that we should be conferring powers of this kind on people who, so far as I am aware, do not want it.  I am not even sure who exactly will have these powers.</P>

If they are acting and working, in any given situation, for frontline staff at any time, I would hope we would have enough commonsense to ensure, in the interest of the State that there will be some flexibility. Laws are passed and commonsense must prevail.  We are only asking for the same powers for customs and excise officers as the Garda already have under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and we are talking about the 700 frontline staff and the investigation branch and the right of the customs and excise officers to have assistance from the other agencies of State.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> With respect to the definition section, it includes a member of the Garda Síochána and any person in the public service who is, for the time being, employed in the prevention of illegal importation or exportation of goods.  According to the Minister for Finance, there are 187,000 public servants.  Under the definition section of this Bill, it is possible for any <Col N="1631" /> one of 187,000 public servants to be designated as people who, for a particular day or for a particular weekend, are involved in the prevention of illegal importation or exportation of goods.

      <P>No, the Minister never used the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; and he never used the word &ldquo;specialist&rdquo;.  My <Col N="1633" /> point is that he now constantly seeks to use those words.  The Minister has used the words &ldquo;senior member of the Customs and Excise&rdquo;.  There is no reference anywhere in the definition section to the word &ldquo;senior&rdquo;.  It can be any member of the Customs and Excise, any officer. There is no definition for use of the words &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; or &ldquo;professional&rdquo;.  That is exactly the point we are making, that the current drafted form of the definition, whether similar to 1956 legislation or otherwise, is capable of such a wide construction in its current drafted form so that it also includes any member of the Defence Forces, because all of them are persons in the public service.  The definition says &ldquo;any person in the public service&rdquo;. If you couple that with the wording &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; and the Minister's own remarks about the need for flexibility, to draw assistance in from the Department of Finance or any other Department, it certainly conveys to us in the Chamber a very untidy definition basis for giving powers.</P>
      <P>Certainly, the Minister makes the point that they are equivalent to the powers the Garda have been given under the Misuse of Drugs Act, but there can be absolutely no doubt about the precise definition of who is a member of the Garda Síochána and how many at any one time exist in this country.  We know it down to the last man or woman.  That must be so.  Persons with powers to interfere with your liberty and mine must be clearly established and identified so that we all know.  That is the point we are trying to make here today.  In a definition giving powers to whatever extent but certainly to the extent involved here, it must be precise.  I honestly think it needs to be tidied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister took out the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; and left it as &ldquo;any person in the public service employed in the prevention of illegal importation&rdquo;, he would have to concede there would be sufficient men and women to deal with any eventuality, coupled with the powers to call in the aid and support of the Garda Síochána, who have all the necessary powers <Col N="1634" /> under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and the further aid and support of members of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we come to an amendment in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and other Deputies that a new section be here inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Sections 2 and 3 of this Act shall not come into operation until provisions relating to the investigation of complaints for the public against officers of Customs and Excise, and the adjudication by a body other than the Customs and Excise of such complaints have been enacted by the Oireachtas and have come into operation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is simple in its terms and seeks to insert before section 2 a proviso that neither section 2 nor section 3 shall come into operation until a body is established outside of Customs and Excise, to deal with complaints that might arise from the exercise of the powers conferred in sections 2 and 3 on members of Customs and Excise.</P>
      <P>This provision is exactly based upon the corresponding provision in the Criminal Justice Act of 1984, when the extensive powers introduced by that Act for members of the Garda Síochána of arrest, detention and questioning were being debated and considered by the House.  The powers were prefaced under section 1 (2) of the Act with a provision similar to what we are proposing in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> To refer to it briefly, in that Act sections 4 to 6, 8 to 10, 15, 16, 18 and 19, all confer wide-ranging powers of stop, search, detention and questioning on the Garda.  At that time the House agreed that these powers should be counterbalanced by the provision of an independent complaints body.  This was a counterbalancing provision the Legislature felt should apply to a body of men and women whose organisation had been in existence since the foundation of the State who had as a force been trained, educated and experienced in the exercise of their powers through long years of service, who had as their frontline primary duty the prevention of crime, the maintenance of peace, the securing of public order and who were and have been the cornerstone of our civil ordered society since the foundation of the State. Despite the important job which they had to do and despite the fact that serious crime was increasing, the Legislature felt that even with all of their expertise and their own internal disciplinary procedures, in order to maintain the common good and confidence in the Garda Síochána it was important that an independent complaints body should be considered.</P>
    <P>One of the important features which was acknowledged in the debate in the context of assisting and enabling the Garda Síochána to do their duty was that they should enjoy the confidence and support of the community in whose midst they worked.  One of the ways in which the Government of the day considered that this could be done&mdash;and they were supported by the Fianna Fáil Party who were in Opposition at that time &mdash; was through an independent complaints procedure. Exactly the same arguments must be applied to the Customs and Excise service in the job which they have to do in stopping, questioning, searching, both vehicles and persons, detaining for the purposes of searching, seizing goods which, as I have indicated previously, are powers not just given to them under this Bill but in Bills going as far back as the 1870s and beyond.  If this is to work with the confidence, assistance and goodwill <Col N="1637" /> of the community, it must be done in a climate in which the community can be assured that, if there are excesses or abuses of the powers, they will have the right of redress and an opportunity to seek access to an independent lay tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill on Second Stage indicated what he considered to be sufficient safeguards and stated in relation to safeguards that the 1876 Customs Consolidation Act provides that before any person is searched by a customs officer he or she can ask to be taken before a justice or before a senior official of the customs who must determine whether or not reasonable cause for the search exists.  It was very good of the Minister to highlight that provision in his speech because many people who travel to and from our jurisdiction and who have been subjected to a search by officials of the Customs and Excise service are not aware of their entitlement to recourse to a senior official within the Customs and Excise service or, indeed, to a justice.  I doubt that there ever has been one instance where a member of the public looked for a justice to adjudicate on whether or not the action being taken was reasonable and I wonder whether it still exists in law as a remedy. It is important that these safeguards are known to people and that they are available to them in a meaningful way.  Does the Minister consider that is an important safeguard and how does he envisage a justice being summoned to either a port or an airport to adjudicate at short notice on an issue such as this?</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that any person who has a complaint against an officer of the Customs and Excise service can complain to a superior officer or to the Revenue Commissioners and can also seek redress through the Ombudsman or the courts.  That is the extent of the facilities which the Minister considers adequate to deal with excesses or complaints. We must accept that inevitably, and I use that word advisedly, causes of complaint will arise.  When these powers are made available there is no doubt that, <Col N="1638" /> inadvertently or by design, there will be excesses perpetrated on innocent people or otherwise and complaints will arise. The Minister by adverting to it at all in his speech acknowledges this.</P>
    <P>What we need to ask ourselves is whether the indicators of redress are sufficient. When we speak about a senior official in the Customs and Excise service or a member of the Revenue Commissioners we are effectively talking about the same notion of the Customs and Excise service or the Revenue Commissioners investigating themselves. That is not adequate and can never be considered to be adequate.  In addition, it is suggested that there is recourse to the Ombudsman or the courts.  In all instances of excesses by the Garda Síochána there is and always has been the right of access to the courts.  In giving extended powers to the Garda Síochána in 1984 we considered that the Garda Síochána should be subject to an independent complaints procedure.  Surely, the same must apply in this instance?</P>
    <P>To suggest that the Ombudsman is a means of redress again does not deal with the matter adequately.  We argue that if there is an independent complaints tribunal for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána, there should also be a similar forum or tribunal to deal with persons who exercise analogous powers.  On the previous amendment the Minister underscored a number of times that what he was trying to do in this Bill was to give them exactly the same powers which the Garda Síochána have under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, in this area.  If they are to have the same powers, we argue that they should be subjected to the same regime of regulation, control and review whenever complaints or cause of complaint arise.</P>
    <P>It was very brave of the Minister to suggest that the Ombudsman's office would be available as a means of recourse in this area.  Only a few weeks ago we received a very worrying report from the Ombudsman's office which indicated that because of or lack of resources and staff, he is over 18 months behind in <Col N="1639" /> dealing with complaints.  From memory, we are talking about almost 1,500 complaints outstanding.  Even if they had nothing else to do it would take his office and staff a further 18 months to clear those alone.  The suggestion that the Ombudsman is a source of recourse or redress is simply not on in the current circumstances.  In any event we get away from the point of like for like.  The Garda Síochána have a greater job of dealing with crime control and social order than Customs and Excise officers will ever require and if we say to them that they should be regulated by an independent tribunal, then it is only right and proper that it should apply to Customs and Excise officers also.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution in the Seanad indicated that there was no major extension of powers and today I think he suggested that these are not draconian.  I hope that the point has been made forcibly enough that they are wide-ranging powers.  They cannot be considered as simply commonsense rules being given to people with a job to do.  That cannot be the yardstick upon which we should seek to apply an appreciation of this kind of powers.  We must look at them and recognise their potential impact on the innocent in any debate on whether or not they are desirable or how far they should be allowed operate.</P>
    <P>It has to be emphasised that none of us argue that the Customs and Excise officers should not have these powers but what we are concerned about is that they are exercised in a proper and reasoned fashion.  If the Minister intends to stand by the very loose amendment of the category of persons who are entitled to use these powers, as we have somewhat exposed in our previous discussion as contained under the definition of the section, there is all the more need for a very useful regulatory power to control the operation and effect of these powers. We are hopeful that in this debate the House will remain consistent about checks and balances and of extending powers to the civil authority and protecting the right of persons affected by <Col N="1640" /> them to seek redress.  I hope the House will accept this amendment as a useful way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to comment briefly on this amendment. I was very interested in what Deputy McCartan has said.  He spoke on the general principles of civil liberties and the checks and balances which we should have in our criminal law.  I think most of us would agree with him.  It is a matter of some surprise to me, as I remarked on Second Stage, that now that the House is discussing this Bill with its draconian powers which has emanated from the Department of Finance that there has been an empty press gallery since we started tonight; that those great guardians of law and order, the Progressive Democrats, have not thought it sufficiently worthwhile to be here; and those self-styled guardians of civil liberties, the Labour Party, are equally absent.  As I commented on a previous occasion, I am convinced that if this Bill came out of the Department of Justice we would be here for six months debating it.  We would want to reflect on that.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that we should put this Bill through on the nod.  The powers that are being requested by the Minister for customs and excise officers are along the lines of the powers that the House should grant.  However, they should be adequately debated and I am not going to be harried by any suggestion that we are soft on drugs or drug pushers and that in case that tag is attached to us we should nod the Bill through.  The drug problem is one of the severest problems facing this country or any other country.  The powers being requested by the Minister for Customs and Excise officers are reasonable but we must look at the extent and scope of those powers, on whom they are conferred and at what checks and balances are in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view on this amendment is different from Deputy McCartan's.  The precedent he referred to was the 1984 Criminal Justice Bill.  The sections contingent on an amendment along these lines in the Criminal Justice Bill were <Col N="1641" /> sections which gave extensive powers to the Garda Síochána which they did not have previously.  The Bill did not, contrary to the conventional wisdom, confer on the Garda Síochána the powers of arrest.  They had those powers already and the Bill did not confer any new powers on them.  However, it did give them the power to detain for extensive periods of time persons whom they arrested on reasonable suspicion.  It also gave them power to search, fingerprint and photograph those persons and more than anything else it gave them power to question those persons over an extensive period of time.  If the questions put resulted in a statement made and the powers were properly carried out, that statement was admissible as evidence in court.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not go that far.  I understand that it does not confer on Customs and Excise officers the right to stop people.  They have that power already.  It gives them power to detain people but only for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out a search.  That seems to be a reasonably short period of time. If section 2 (1) (b) (i) of the Bill was abused in any circumstances, it is so closely drawn that the powers of redress available to an individual through the courts would be adequate.  It is confining to write into the Bill that officers exercising the powers under this Bill, whoever those officers may be, have only the right to detain persons for such time as is reasonably necessary for carrying out a personal search.  There is no suggestion that Customs and Excise officers have the power to detain people for questioning or to fingerprint or photograph people. The detention powers, in so far as they are conferred, are detention powers but I think it would be possible to search someone in a short period of time and I think the courts will construe that as a short period of time.</P>
    <P>Another point worth making is that we should try to envisage a real situation where there is a reasonable suspicion that somebody coming through an airport is importing drugs into the country.  This section is confined to searches in relation <Col N="1642" /> to the control of drugs.  It does not relate to television sets coming in from the North or four bottles of whiskey in a suitcase.  This section is confined to the detection of drugs.  That person may be brought into a room by the Customs and Excise officers and his luggage and pockets may be searched.  There may be a more extensive search, and if a substance is found which could be construed as a controlled drug or some other material which would give rise to suspicion that they are in the process of importing controlled drugs into the country, I think that the Garda Síochána would take over very quickly in that series of events.  It is likely that the powers to detain, search, fingerprint, photograph and question a person could occur subsequent to the search initiated by the Customs and Excise officers.  If that is the sequence of events envisaged, the requirements of the amendment that an outside body should adjudicate on any complaints against Customs and Excise officials in exercising their powers may be unnecessary because, if the complaint were to be made, it would be made against members of the Garda Síochána and the independent complaints board is in place to deal with such complaints.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there will be complaints.  A person as pure as the driven snow, totally innocent of any trafficking in drugs, going through customs may be searched by a customs officer exercising the powers under this Bill in a bona fide fashion because of a reasonable suspicion.  A complaint may follow but, as the Minister pointed out, that complaint can be made in the first instance to superior officers or the Revenue Commissioners. I do not think that is adequate and recourse to the Ombudsman and the courts would be a strong safeguard in that instance.</P>
    <P>If I were sure that these powers will be exercised by the 700 uniformed officials, as the Minister has put it, I would be more opposed to the amendment.  If we got the definition section right there might be no need for the amendment. The independent complaints board <Col N="1643" /> applies to the Garda Síochána and if complaints against any of the other 700 people involved could be referred to the Ombudsman or to the courts that would meet the case.  If the Minister could accommodate us on the definition section I would not be looking for this safeguard. It is not on all fours with the provision in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  It is not a question of treating like as like; it is different and for that reason I will not support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the anxiety of Deputy McCartan.  Deputy Noonan has summed up the position very well. There are already substantial powers of personal search available to officers of Customs and Excise.  The net effect of section 2 is to permit personal searches of meeters and greeters, people at an airport who may be suspected of having received drugs or other illegal articles from travellers within the vicinity of the port, or airport, or the land frontier. Powers of search available to customs officers without warrant include permission to search any person who has entered the State by land, sea or air, any person suspected of an offence in relation to exportation of goods.  They may search without warrant aircraft and ships, vehicles within 20 miles of the land frontier, vehicles anywhere else in the State upon reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  They may search under warrant any house, shop, cellar, warehouse or other place.  Those powers have been available to officers of the Customs and Excise for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan may be surprised to learn that officials have no recollection of any member of the public seeking to go before a district justice.  A person may request to be brought before a justice for his or her case to be heard against a search being carried out.  The public have requested to be brought before senior officers of Customs and Excise before a search was carried out.  The public use the various structures available to them in the complaints procedure against staff of the State and Customs and Excise <Col N="1644" /> officers.  I should like to point out that out of a total of 2,434 complaints against the Civil Service dealt with by the Ombudsman in 1986, only six related to the customs service.  None of those complaints related to abuse of powers.</P>
    <P>What is being sought in sections 2 and 3 is a relatively marginal extension of the existing powers of search enjoyed by the customs service.  Those powers date back to 1876 and have been exercised with great care and discretion.  As matters stand, an aggrieved person can complain to a senior customs officer, as they have done; to the Revenue Commissioners, as they have done; to the Ombudsman, as they have done; and ultimately, can have recourse to the courts.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, it would be a mistake to draw a comparison between the powers of the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise service.  The powers of the Garda Síochána are very broad, covering as they do the whole range of criminal legislation.  I am sure Deputy McCartan understands that.  The powers of customs officers are more circumscribed. Based on the fact that for the first time since the foundation of the State a Garda complaints body came into operation this year and the wide range of powers the Garda have, it would be wrong of us at this stage to extend powers to an organ of State whose role, functions and powers are clearly defined and limited. I regret that, based on our performance to date and the information available to me, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister of State, referring to the right to detain and so on, said that more extensive powers of detention were not being sought but he assured the House that, if the need to increase the powers available to customs officers in relation to a period of detention arose, it would be given careful and detailed consideration.  Clearly, it is envisaged that the powers being given to customs officers may not be adequate.  What we are dealing with here is an attempt to balance the duties and responsibilities of <Col N="1645" /> the customs officers and the Garda and to safeguard the public from over zealous officers or breaches of the law by officers charged with applying the law.  For instance, the Garda Síochána have their own internal system of discipline but I am not aware of the type of internal disciplinary procedures there are for customs officers, if there are any.  I do not know if there are any sanctions for breaches of discipline, what rules and regulations there are, if they are covered by way of statutory regulation or if they are voluntary terms of employment applied by the Revenue Commissioners. It is important that the Minister clarifies this matter.</P>
      <P>Our amendment may appear to be a bit heavy-handed because, obviously, the powers and responsibilities of the Garda are a lot wider than those of customs officers.  I spent a long time in this House when the Criminal Justice Act was being debated.  The argument about the complaints procedure then was that the powers were being extended.  Subsequently the Minister agreed to introduce the complaints procedure, but that procedure now applies to and is available for breaches of regulations, mistreatment or complaints of all kinds not just relating to the Criminal Justice Act.  For instance, presumably if the Garda were operating in a port area or an airport in pursuance of the powers conferred on them in this Bill and a member of the public had reason to complain &mdash; or no reason to complain but wanted to complain anyway &mdash; that person would have access to the Garda complaints procedure.  It seems unreasonable, therefore, to say that because a customs officer rather than a member of the Garda Síochána is carrying out his duties under this Bill the member of the public has not the same access to the complaints procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point relating to the complaints procedure made very strongly during the debate on the Criminal Justice Act was that in many cases people do not want to go to court to get redress for their complaints, that an informal, non-legal-istic procedure is preferred in the vast majority of cases.  The case was made <Col N="1646" /> also that where people had complaints concerning the activities of the Garda they were not necessarily happy to go and have their complaints investigated by the force against whom they were complaining, and that holds true in relation to this Bill.  It is not satisfactory to expect that the only options open to the member of the public who wants to complain are to go to the senior officer of customs or else to court.  The Minister may well argue that the person can also go to the Ombudsman, but the report of the Ombudsman makes it clear that that office is totally overstretched in terms of the resources it has.  We sought recently to have a discussion on that report which we have yet not succeeded in achieving. It would be important to have a debate on that kind on the Ombudsman's report so that we can see precisely how that office is operating, what kind of resources it needs, and if this kind of amendment which we are seeking to insert into this Bill is not successful, what additional resources it would need in order to cope with whatever complaints might arise from the Bill which we are debating.</P>
    <P>The customs officer will have the right to arrest a person who does not comply with a request for a search.  What restrictions are there on the length of time for which a person may be detained while arrested by a customs officer?  Can the Minister tell us whether a customs officer in the normal course of duties who has a suspicion of a person whom he sees coming through an airport or to an airport to meet someone, when he approaches that person can tell him or her what are his or her rights?  The Minister of State said in response to a question raised by Deputy McCartan that there is no recollection of a person requesting to be brought before a justice with regard to that person's refusal to be searched.  Is that simply because the person was never informed he had that right?  Can the Minister indicate how often people who were approached to be searched refused and sought to have their case brought before a senior officer?  The Minister pointed out <Col N="1647" /> that of the more than 2,000 cases before the Ombudsman relating to the Civil Service only six related to the customs service. How many complaints in total are received by the customs service with regard to searching or otherwise?  We want to get a proper picture of the state of play with regard to the operation of existing powers by the customs officers.</P>
    <P>The amendment we have down is a fairly strong one.  We will be quite happy to see the Minister bring in an amendment of his own which would perhaps fit more neatly into this Bill, but we feel there is a need for some independent complaints procedure in view of the fact that these very wide-ranging powers are being given to what is basically a civilian service which in the normal course of events would not be expected to deal to any great extent with criminals of one kind or another.  We are putting down these amendments because we are concerned to ensure that adequate safeguards are there, not for the criminal but for the innocent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what the Deputies have said. Let me re-emphasise the fact that in relation to meeters and greeters, the law is not adequate and that is why we have sought to change it in that situation. Deputy De Rossa has asked many statistical questions on which I do not have information and to which it might not even be possible to get answers.  Nobody has asked to be brought before a district justice.  Regarding the relatively low number of body searches that have taken place, there have been no complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is discipline in the public service in all areas and rigid discipline in the Customs and Excise area.  An internal disciplinary system operates and appropriate penalties are applied across the board depending on the gravity of the offence or the mishandling of any situation by an officer of Customs and Excise.  There is loss of increments, recording inefficiencies in personal files which would militate against the officer's future promotion, transfer to another <Col N="1648" /> area of similar work or of different work; depending again on the gravity of the offence it could be a direct transfer or a transfer to a different area of work.  There could be reductions in grade to a lower grade, and in serious cases final and ultimate dismissal.  There is a strict disciplinary code and that is applied in all Government Departments particularly in Customs and Excise.</P>
    <P>I think the powers being sought are reasonable and vitally necessary.  The Customs and Excise service has served us well for many years.  We should judge them on their performance and give them an opportunity to serve fully and even better in their efforts with us to ensure that illegal drug trafficking does not occur and that goods and objects are not brought illegally into the State.  I hope the House will accept that.  I suggest, with respect to the Deputies, that they withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister of State for his presence here tonight.  This matter is of grave concern locally, to the Presentation Sisters, the parents concerned and teachers of Listowel primary school.  Listowel convent primary school was built in 1883 and the building has remained almost unaltered since then.  Over the past ten years major structural defects have appeared.  The roof is sagging in places and the slates are loose and present a constant threat to pupils and teachers in times of high wind.  Because of their concern, the school authorities commissioned an engineer to present a report on the condition of the building to determine its safety.  The report was very critical of the structure and recommended its replacement.</P>
      <P>In the early seventies the building was condemend by the Department of Health.  It was considered at that time to be a health hazard and a fire hazard. There is no fire escape from the upper floor where there are three classrooms and an office.  There would probably be 120 students and four staff there at any one time.  I do not have to point out the scramble there would be down a very narrow stairway if there was a fire.  This fire hazard aspect must be considered. The classrooms are very damp and very uncomfortable for the pupils and the teachers.  The Minister will agree that this is not an environment conducive to learning.  It is unfair to expect pupils and teachers to get the best out of the learning process under these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise there has been a considerable time lapse since the grant application was first made for this school.  I appreciate <Col N="1650" /> that access arrangements gave rise to some complications when the project reached the planning permission stage and took much longer to clear up than usual.  However, at this stage, all arrangements have been made.  The contractor has been appointed and all that remains is to have this contract signed.  I ask the Minister to ensure that minor details, such as changing windows, would be sorted out with the builder as the project gets under way so that the building of the school is not unduly held up.</P>
    <P>At present there are 376 pupils attending the school, more than 100 of them in the two prefabs at the back of the school. These prefabs are divided into four classrooms.  The buildings are porous and dilapidated and are not suitable for pupils or teachers.  The parents are very concerned about the condition of the school and are anxious that the contractor comes on the site as soon as possible.  I am sure these parents have made similar requests to Deputy Foley because they have been continously reminding me of the urgency of building this school.</P>
    <P>Last February they were given some hope when the then Minister of State, Deputy Enda Kenny, approved the contract for this school and they were hoping the building would commence in the summer.  They find it very hard to understand why this work has not started since work on other schools, which had gone to contract at the same time, has been started.  I understand there was a problem with numbers, that numbers in the school have fallen, but there is another arrangement which compensates for that.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Presentation Sisters and the teachers for their wonderful contribution to education in Listowel town and the surrounding area over the years.  This order have been running this school for over 100 years and they must be congratulated for their commitment to education in the area.  Again I appeal to the Minister to sanction the contract and ensure it is signed as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Deenihan for giving me some of his time <Col N="1651" /> to discuss this very important project for North Kerry.  I endorse the points made by the Deputy as regards the delay in placing the contract for the proposed new building for Listowel girls' convent school.  Deputy Deenihan outlined the present condition of the school and the conditions under which the sisters and the teachers have to work.  It is most disappointing that this project has been ongoing for ten years.  The school and the facilities are most unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The Presentation Sisters made a suitable site available almost seven years ago.  As I said, this new school was first mooted in 1980 and tenders were invited towards the end of 1985.  A contractor was selected in 1986 but to date the work has not been started.  I accept that problems arose as soon as the tender was accepted, but I understand they have now been resolved.</P>
      <P>Having made representations on this project over the years, I am satisfied it has progressed to the stage of making a start, and I thank the present Minister for this.  I appeal to him to give this project the green light before Christmas because it will serve a twofold purpose for Listowel.  First, it will satisfy the board of management, the sisters, the teachers and the people of Listowel to know that the building of the new school will start in the new year.  Secondly, it will give much needed employment to the town and surrounding area.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his personal interest in this school since taking office. Again I endorse the sentiments expressed by Deputy Deenihan as regards the Presentation Sisters and the teaching staff but particularly the sisters who have done tremendous work over the years under terrible conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's agreement in principle was given in July 1980 to grant-aid a new building for the Listowel Convent girls' national school to replace their existing unsuitable building.  I do not think it necessary to recount in detail the development of <Col N="1652" /> events, through the various architectural planning stages and the legal formalities associated with the provision by the convent of a new site for the proposed building, as I am sure both Deputies are fairly familiar with the early history of the project.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the project were invited in the latter half of 1985 and were duly received in and examined by my Department. It was, however, noted that the average enrolments at the girls' national school were declining, and it was necessary in accordance with normal procedure to review and assess the implications of the trend.  It became apparent that the original expectation that a 14 classroom school as designed and tendered for would not be needed, and that a ten classroom school would be adequate for the school in the long term.</P>
      <P>In the light of the enrolment figures, the chairperson and members of the school's board of management were invited to meet officers of my Department to discuss the implications.  It was put to them that having regard to the nature of the architectural plan which proposed two two-storey classroom blocks &mdash; one with eight classrooms, four up and four down, and another with six classrooms, three up and three down, with a general purposes area linking the two blocks &mdash; the best option, if construction work were to be begun in the immediate future, and if the architectural plans were not to be completely redrawn, would be to omit from the proposed contract the six classroom block.  This would have had the effect of leaving a shortfall of two classrooms, but it was felt that this omission could very readily be provided for if necessary by the design and construction of a small classroom annexe to the new building at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of these discussions, the idea emerged and was subsequently put to my Department, that the block proposed to be omitted could be redesigned with a view to accommodating the pupils of Lixnaw Special School which is located some miles away.  The provision of accommodation for this special school <Col N="1653" /> had also been approved in principle for grant-aid by my Department.</P>
    <P>The delay referred to by the Deputies arises from the work which has had to be carried out by the Department's professional officers to establish the feasibility of the proposal to accommodate the two schools on the one campus.  I hesitate to embark on a discussion of the technical problems of taking an existing plan which has been designed for one purpose, and indeed is the subject of a tender, and adapting it to suit the purposes of an altogether different type of school.  One of the main problems was concerned with an attempt to provide some additional facilities required by the special school <Col N="1654" /> without, at the same time, overshooting the budget for the original project and some compromises on this are being worked out.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the feasibility study on the special school accommodation will be completed as early as possible.  In view of the Deputies' interest I am asking that the matter be expedited and am making arrangements to communicate further with them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 December 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>A sustained fall in the value of the US dollar would have both short and long term effects.  In the short term the principal beneficial effect is that each one percentage point fall in the value of the US dollar would reduce Exchequer interest payments by approximately £2 million in a full year and would reduce the Irish pound value of the foreign debt by about £23 million.  Gains or losses on the Irish Pound value of the foreign debt are realised only when the debt is paid off.  The impact on the cost of servicing debt of a change in the value of the dollar may be offset to a significant extent over a particular period by changes in other exchange rates and interest rates.</P>
      <P>In the short term a fall in the dollar makes it more difficult to export to the US and could have an adverse impact on US tourism to Ireland.  It also makes imports from the US more competitive here.  The scale of the impact of such developments on Exchequer revenue is difficult to quantify but should be small. However, in the longer term a more balanced world economy should encourage the growth of world trade and be beneficial in terms of Exchequer revenue.</P>

These sheriffs are now operating on a countrywide basis.</P>

These measures have been successful, but the continued legal operation of the reduced &ldquo;frontier zone&rdquo; allowances, which were not encompassed by the 48-hour rule, has sustained a certain level of cross-Border shopping which does impinge adversely on southern traders in the vicinity of the Border.  The Government are concerned at this and are keeping the situation under review. There is, however, evidence to suggest that the 48-hour rule has had a general <Col N="1442" /> beneficial effect on trade in the southern Border counties.</P>

      <P>An arrangement somewhat similar to that suggested, involving a lease/ purchase basis for acquiring property is the most recent innovation in the provision of new Government accommodation. It is intended that this should be the basis for the provision of accommodation under the decentralisation programme. This procedure should achieve the objectives proposed by the Deputy; a reduction in demand for scarce capital, reasonable annual rents with the bonus of ultimate ownership by the State.  The extension of this procedure to other capital projects will be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider amending the Finance Act, 1968 and any amending Acts or Regulations which govern exemptions from road tax or excise duty on cars for disabled drivers, except where they are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, to include such exemptions for other disabled drivers where disablement consists of loss of one or both arms or portions thereof, in view of the circumstances of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford, who was severely beaten and raped as a result of which, one of her arms was amputated below the elbow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy for persons who find themselves in the situation referred to by the Deputy.  The difficulty arises from the wording of present legislation <Col N="1448" /> which requires that a person be &ldquo;wholly, or almost wholly, without the use of each of his legs&rdquo; in order to qualify for road tax exemption.  I am not satisfied with this provision and I am having it looked at with a view to adopting a more rational approach.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that relief provisions benefiting disabled drivers should be rationalised as far as possible to produce a better service for the disabled and cut down on unnecessary administration. Tax repayments of the kind currently operated by the Revenue Commissioners are not the most effective way of providing such reliefs.  On my initiative discussions are taking place with the Department of Health with a view to establishing under the aegis of the Minister for Health a comprehensive restructured scheme of assistance for disabled drivers.  Disabilities such as those mentioned by the Deputy will be borne in mind when any amendments of legislation or regulations required as a result of these discussions are being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are convinced that all farmers should be taxed on the same basis as other taxpayers, through the income tax system.  This means that farmers are required to supply the Revenue Commissioners with adequate returns, sometimes in the form of accounts, to enable the tax to be operated fairly and efficiently.  Within the limitations imposed by this requirement, every reasonable effort is made to reduce the demands of tax compliance on farmers.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners accept a simplified form of tax accounts from small enterprise farmers.  Furthermore, the simple farm profile form which is currently being used to bring smaller farmers, hitherto effectively exempt, into the income tax system, is so designed as to allow inspectors of taxes to assess the liability, if any, of such farmers to income tax, without recourse to formal accounts in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should also note that no farmer is obliged to retain an accountant <Col N="1458" /> to prepare tax returns.  The only requirement is that the returns be of a standard acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners consistent with the fair and efficient administration of income tax. In any case, commercial farmers would require accounts for management purposes and, in that context, the requirement to prepare tax accounts is not unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of prisoners who are addicted to drugs but the best estimate is that about 200 offenders at present in custody were abusing drugs prior to their committal. This estimate is essentially based on self-reporting by offenders and, accordingly, should be treated with some caution.</P>
      <P>The most immediate medical need of a drug abuser committed to custody can be detoxification and this is arranged by the prison medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the <Col N="1463" /> question of the provision of treatment for prisoners addicted to drugs is a complex one and that the prison service cannot offer some ready made cure for an offender's drug addiction.  It has to be borne in mind that in the case of many of these offenders the attempts which have been made in the community to turn them away from drug taking have not been successful &mdash; despite the best efforts of the various agencies involved.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, while in prison, drug abusers &mdash; as with other offenders &mdash; have an array of services available to them such as medical, psychiatric and psychological, welfare, chaplaincy and educational.  In addition, a number of community-based agencies involved with the problem of drug addiction visit the prisons and work with individual offenders.  The key factor, however, is the offender's commitment to giving up drugs.</P>
    <P>I should add that, where there are indications <Col N="1464" /> that an individual prisoner has the necessary commitment and appears to pose little risk to the community, successive Ministers have been prepared to consider release at a relatively early stage of sentence for such a prisoner to attend at a community-based treatment centre such as Coolemine.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit since 13 October 1987, the fourth day of incapacity, and is currently being paid at the weekly rate of £52.55.  This is made up of £42.30 personal rate and £10.25 which is half rate child dependant allowance in respect of two qualified children.</P>
      <P>Payment of child dependant allowance was not initially issued to the person concerned because she did not claim for her children.  However, following inquiries, the Department established that she was entitled to payment in respect of two qualified children.  All benefit payable to her has been issued to 30 November 1987, the date of the latest medical evidence received.</P>
      <P>From 4 January 1988, her husband's entitlement to disability benefit is based on his contribution record for the 198687 tax year.  According to the records of the Department he has only 45 contributions in that year and will, therefore, qualify for benefit at £71 a week comprising of a reduced personal rate of £40.70, half the allowance in respect of two qualified children, and £20.00 temporary alleviation payment arising from the introduction of equality of treatment measures in November 1986.</P>

      <P>When, following an examination by a medical referee, a person is disallowed further payment of disability benefit, he or she is notified of the decision and advised of the right of appeal.  In addition, the claimants are also advised that if they are unable to meet their needs or the needs of dependants, supplementary welfare allowance may be claimed.  The notification goes on to state that persons who are unemployed and available for work may claim unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
      <P>It is thus a matter of choice for each individual as to what they wish to do following receipt of a disallowance notice.

He appealed against the disallowance of benefit and an appeals officer, after holding an oral hearing at which the claimant was present, decided on 2 September 1986 that he was capable of work during the period from 2 January 1986 to 10 July 1986 and so not entitled to injury or disability benefit in respect of that period.</P>
      <P>He continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity for work and was examined again by a medical referee on 3 February 1987 who confirmed the capable findings.  Medical evidence was submitted to 25 August 1987 after which date he was certified fit to resume work by his own doctor.</P>
      <P>Representations made on his behalf in October 1987 were treated as an appeal against the disallowance of disability benefit from July 1986 and the appeal has now been referred to an appeals officer for determination.  A decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Due to the sensitivity of the results to the underlying assumptions there are significant difficulties and hazards in measuring the net cost of Manpower programmes.  The enclosed table contains the best estimates available to the Department.  The data are presented on a &ldquo;man-year&rdquo; basis to take account of the differing lengths of programmes.</P>
      <P>These estimates do not take account of the following factors: (i) Deadweight: the extent to which activity funded by the programme in question would have been carried out in the absence of the programme; (ii) Displacement: the extent to which activity funded by a programme displaces economic activity elsewhere in the economy; and (iii) Survival rates: the rate at which participants leave schemes prematurely.</P>
      <P>These factors, together with changes in the profile of participants, can have a very significant impact on the net cost of a programme.  My Department are currently engaged in a systematic evaluation of all manpower programmes and, as this proceeds, our knowledge of the full costs and benefits of programmes will be enhanced.</P>
      <P>Particular problems arise in relation to providing unit costs for the community enterprise programme.  In the case of jobs in business directly supported by the programme, the Exchequer funds are paid back through taxes etc. within three and a half years and thereafter the Exchequer gains from the business subject to displacement, etc. considerations.  In the case of jobs in business indirectly supported by the programme, the gross cost per job is less and Exchequer payback in gross terms will be over a shorter period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Teamwork is a community managed scheme designed to help local voluntary non-profit making organisations provide temporary community based employment for young persons (under 25 years of age) on projects of a finite nature to the mutual benefit of both the young persons concerned and their communities.  The performance of the scheme, in relation to its objectives has been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Social Employment Scheme (SES) is to assist people in the over 25 age group who have been unemployed for a prolonged period to make a worthwhile contribution to the development of the community by breaking a period of long term unemployment and motivating individuals with a view to their reintroduction into the labour market.  It provides the discipline of working together with the opportunity to learn new skills or practice existing skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 2,843 projects in operation providing employment for 11,000 participants.  The scheme has received universal favourable comment from sponsors and participants alike with participants' attendance, productivity <Col N="1495" /> and enthusiasm for work surpassing expectations.</P>
    <P>Sponsors, who include local authorities, health boards, educational authorities as well as voluntary organisations have carried out work of a high standard which, without the scheme, they would have been unable to consider.</P>
    <P>The goal of the Community Enterprise Programme (CEP) is to help community based groups and worker co-operatives to generate extra income and employment by either setting up businesses directly or helping individuals and groups to set up businesses.  The programme is particularly geared towards disadvantaged groups and areas, and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Performance of the programme has been positive on these goals.  Some 350 groups are currently being worked with, of whom 120 are at the stage of developing businesses, trading as businesses or helping other people to set up businesses. The other 230 groups are at earlier stages of development.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1986, 320 people were employed in businesses directly supported by the programme and during 1987 a further 34 businesses (with job potential of over 200) will have been approved funding.  The Youth Employment Agency through the programme also provides assistance to some 20 groups who provide incubator workspace (currently 185 people working with a total potential of over 600) and to groups who help individuals into self-employment (helps provide extra income locally, notably in mariculture, tourism and forestry).</P>
    <P>Over 40 per cent of groups are catering for particularly disadvantaged groups and some 75 per cent of jobs provided in businesses directly supported are taken up by unemployed people.</P>
    <P>The enterprise scheme is designed to assist eligible unemployed persons to set up their own businesses and to become self-reliant economically.  Since its introduction in December 1983, the scheme has assisted over 18,000 unemployed persons to set up their own businesses.  The <Col N="1496" /> Economic and Social Research Institute are currently engaged in research work on the scheme.  The scheme will be reviewed in the light of any recommendations which may emanate from the ESRI Report (which is expected to be published early 1988).</P>
    <P>The objective of the Employment Incentive Scheme (EIS) is to provide long term permanent employment.  The performance of the scheme in relation to its objectives has been satisfactory. Approximately 70,000 recruitments have been notified to the Department of Labour since the inception of the scheme in 1977.  The ESRI is also engaged in research work on this scheme and the scheme will be reviewed in the light of any recommendations which may emanate from this report.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Work Experience Programme (WEP) is to help young people (under 25 years of age) who have left the educational system but cannot obtain employment because they lack experience.  Over 65,000 young people have participated in WEP since its inception and the majority of these obtained employment (usually with their sponsors) when they left the programme.  (The placement rates in 1985 and 1986 were 65 per cent and 63 per cent respectively).</P>
    <P>Despite the high placement rate there has been growing concern about the programme. The proportion of well qualified young people on WEP has always been high and it is believed that many of these could have found jobs for themselves without any State intervention.  It is for this reason and because I consider that the moneys saved can be better spent in other areas that I decided to suspend recruitment to the programme with effect from 30 September 1987.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to make substantive changes in the above programmes. One of the major functions of FÁS will be to provide a better integrated service for the unemployed.  In this connection it is possible that FÁS will decide upon changes in the present conditions of schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Teamwork scheme provides for participation by young persons under 25 years of age.  A budget of £5.4 million was allocated for 1987 and this provides for an average weekly participation of 1,674 participants on the scheme.  The total number on Teamwork at the end <Col N="1498" /> of September 1987 was 1,293.  It is not anticipated that this figure will change appreciably by the end of 1987.  The takeup of the scheme in 1987 was not as great as anticipated.</P>
      <P>A budget of £4.6 million has been allocated for 1988.  This will provide for an average weekly participation of 1,600 participants on the scheme when account is taken of the reduction in the grant towards wage costs from £70 to £60 in April 1987.</P>
      <P>All participants in the social employment scheme (SES) are over 25 years of age.  A budget of £43.5 million was provided for the scheme in 1987.  This would generate 8,900 man years of employment (an average of 8,900 participants each week) in 1987.  There were 8,500 participants on the scheme at the start of 1987 and at present there are 11,000 participants.  It is not expected that this figure will change appreciably between now and year-end.  A budget of £43.41 million has been provided for the scheme in 1988.  It is estimated that this will generate approximately 9,550 man years of employment (an average of 9,550 participants per week) during 1988.</P>
      <P>In 1987, the employment incentive scheme (EIS) will cater for approximately 7,000 notified recruitments of whom 69 per cent are under 25 years of age.  The figure of 7,000 for recruitment is equivalent to an average weekly participation of 3,500.  The allocation for 1988 will provide for the same number of recruitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work experience programme (WEP) is aimed solely at the under 25 years age group.  Prior to the suspension of the programme, with effect from 30 September 1987, the recruitment target for 1987 (full year) was 6,400.  The figure of 6,400 for recruitment is equivalent to an average weekly participation of 3,200. The number of new entrants to WEP in 1987 was 5,058 and the number on WEP at 31 October 1987 was 2,602.  The likely year-end figure is approximately 1,500. It is not intended, at this point, that there should be recruitment to WEP in 1988. However, the programmes which finish in 1988 are expected to generate up to <Col N="1499" /> 185 man years in 1988 (the equivalent of 370 participants).</P>
    <P>The total number of places available for recruitments to the enterprise scheme in 1987 is 3,500.  It was estimated that 2,845 of those recruited would be over 25 years of age and 655 would be under 25 years of age.  The actual number of recruitments to date in 1987 is 2,264 of which 1,844 are over 25 years of age and 420 are under 25 years of age.  It is expected that the total number of recruitments in 1987 will be approximately 2,360 of which 1,920 will be over 25 years of age and 440 will be under 25 years.  Take up on the scheme in 1987 has not been as high as was anticipated.</P>
    <P>The number of recruitments feasible in 1988 in the context of a £7 million allocation is approximately 3,700 of which 3,000 will be over 25 years of age and 700 will be under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>In addition to financial considerations, recruitment to employment schemes are influenced by a number of other factors. These include the willingness of sponsors to mount Teamwork and SES projects, recruitment practices of employers in the case of EIS and the willingness of the unemployed to start business under Enterprise.  It should be appreciated that the number of admissions-recruitments in any year is not a true reflection of the actual participation in that year due to the carry over of persons recruited in the previous year.</P>

      <P>Under the enterprise scheme, a business <Col N="1500" /> must be potentially viable and participation may be refused if the services or products proposed are in over supply. Accordingly, a placement officer may insist on a feasibility study and evidence of demand for the services or products being offered before approving an application.</P>
      <P>The enterprise scheme is essentially concerned with job creation and the survival prospect of businesses is of considerable relevance in reviewing a person's application to participate in the scheme.  There would be no economic justification for admitting persons to the scheme unless there was some reasonable prospect of viability of the business chosen.</P>
      <P>I should add that the examination of viability is as much in the interests of the applicant as of the economic administration of the scheme.</P>
