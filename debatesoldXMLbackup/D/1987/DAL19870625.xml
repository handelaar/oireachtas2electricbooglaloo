      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that matter in conjunction with the other committees the Government are considering setting up.  As the Deputy knows I suggested that we would proceed immediately to set up a limited number of committees, get them up and running and then have a look at what other committees we need.  I will be glad to discuss the establishment of further committees. including a health service committee, during the summer so that we can be ready to establish them when we return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Taoiseach that there is already agreement in principle on the setting up of certain other committees.  I would not wish to see any move back from that position.  This additional committee will certainly be useful in the context of further work that this House will be doing in the autumn.</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's comments in reply to Deputy Dukes what is the status in the Government's mind now of the foreign affairs committee?  The Taoiseach said he is considering the formation of committees in addition to those already formed.  I am not aware of any discussions that have led to an agreement in principle that includes a specific number of committees, that excludes any committees or includes others.  All I know is that a number of committees have gone through the House without debate.</P>

It is outside the Chamber on the table, yet it was agreed last Tuesday to take it without debate in advance of anyone in this House seeing its contents.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not involve any extra expenditure.  It is simply a regrouping of moneys in the Department of Industry and Commerce to enable some very desirable matters including science and technology and the Cork Enterprise Board and things like that to be catered for.  It is more technical than anything else.  The Deputy knows from his experience in this House that at this time of the year frequently as many as 10, 20 or 30 Estimates go through this House without debate at very short notice.  That is a practice which unfortunately is necessary by virtue of our parliamentary process and furthermore it happens in every other parliament in the world.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this short Bill is to close the loophole in fisheries legislation as disclosed by a recent judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3662" /> The background to the matter commenced in 1982 when an Enniscrone. County Sligo fisherman was convicted in the District Court of using a &ldquo;fixedengine&rdquo; contrary to section 97 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act. 1959.  He appealed his case to the Circuit Court which sought the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether the fisherman's net was a &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; within the meaning and for the purpose of the Fisheries Acts. 1959 to 1983.</P>
    <P>It was the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court that the net was undoubtedly fixed to the soil but that it could not rank as a &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; unless it was also &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; which it was not.  Accordingly, the net was outside the statutory definition of &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; and so the conviction of the fisherman had to be set aside in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is desirable to close the loophole in the legislation as otherwise some salmon fishermen might attempt to avail of it and use nets that under the existing legislation cannot now be deemed as &ldquo;fixed engines&rdquo; and, consequently, their use would not be prohibited under section 97 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  This could pose a serious threat to salmon conservation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will no doubt see from the explanatory and financial memorandum which I circulated with the Bill, three changes have been made in the amended definition as compared with the existing definition.  In order to deal with the defect disclosed in the judgment of the Supreme Court.  I have deleted the expression &ldquo;or held by hand or made stationary in any other way&rdquo; and replaced it by &ldquo;or by any other means&rdquo;.  I have added the expression &ldquo;or a drift net&rdquo; so as to make it clear that drift nets which were not fixed engines under the old definition, continue to be excluded by the revised definition.  Finally, acting on the advice of the Attorney General.  I have made a slight change in the reference to &ldquo;anchors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regard the Bill as an important conservation measure.  Deputies will be aware of the continuing necessity to conserve salmon stocks.  For some time past <Col N="3663" /> fears have been expressed regarding the salmon stock situation.  While this year there is some evidence of an improved run of salmon into the estuaries and the rivers, nevertheless the wild salmon stock position is still at a critically low level and every precaution must be taken to conserve and manage this very valuable resource.  The salmon catch in 1986 was valued at about £5.5 million.  When one takes into account the value to the economy in tourism revenue and earnings &mdash; a very substantial amount &mdash; people will recognise that the best management, legislation and procedures should be adopted to deal with the critically low salmon stock situation which we have at present.</P>
    <P>Following my appointment I had meetings with the regional managers of all the fishery boards and I am now having meetings with the conservation boards. At these meetings I have impressed upon the protection staff, the regional managers and the conservation boards the necessity to ensure that illegal activities in relation to salmon fishing will be stamped out.  Every means at the boards' disposal should be availed of to ensure that as far as possible illegal activities which are damaging to the salmon stock, would be dealt with.  The purpose of the Bill is to restore the position which existed in relation to salmon conservation prior to the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us concentrates our minds yet again on the whole vexed area of salmon conservation versus drift net fishing.  It also raises yet again the role of the fisheries boards and whether their financial allocation allow them to carry out their statutory functions of management, conservation protection, development and promotion of inland fisheries and sea angling resources as far as the 12-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland our inland surface water of 350.000 acres of lakes and 8.600 miles of main channel rivers comprises a far greater percentage of our total area than, <Col N="3664" /> for example, in England or other continental countries.  Our inland fisheries are an extremely valuable self-renewing resource when exploited rationally and sensitively.  There are no imported raw materials.  It may come as some surprise that the value of our inland fisheries is of the order of £50 million, £30 million of which is from tourist angling and £15 million from Irish anglers.</P>
    <P>The lack of interest in such an economically valuable resource, the lack of direction, the lack of policy, the lack of political motivation by successive Administrations in this area to face the inevitable decisions that must be taken before they are forced upon us by others is nothing short of scandalous.  Perhaps the facts have not been highlighted in a language that can be easily comprehended. While we as politicians have obviously failed the industry &mdash; even if only by sins of omission &mdash; the interested parties themselves, apart from the fishermen who. quite rightly, have well articulated their own point of view, have been noticeably silent.  We need more groups like the Southern Salmon and Trout Angling Association who are articulating the needs of inland fisheries and fishermen, the anglers, and who are concerned with the continuing commercial exploitation of salmon in particular by drift net fishing at sea and the whole business of illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>We all await with eagerness the reporting of the Salmon Review Group set up by the last Government.  The interim report is not now to be published.  It has been suppressed.  We must await the final draft.  Will we as politicians have what it takes to make the difficult but necessary decisions in this whole area?  The question must remain unanswered for the time being.  Will the report remain as &ldquo;an action plan, away from action&rdquo;, as a colleague of mine once put it?  We know without any report from any review group that drift netting at sea is taking far too high a proportion of salmon catches.  We know without any report that it is cropping mixed stocks, affecting the requirements of individual rivers such as the Slaney in my own county of Wexford. <Col N="3665" /> We know that the drift net fishermen follow the main runs of salmon at sea and that their large hauls devastate the renewable resources of the rod anglers as insufficient salmon make it to their native rivers to regenerate and so ensure a future for those interested in our stocks of wild salmon.</P>
    <P>Drift nets are not causing enforcement problems so much in our estuaries as at sea.  There are 820 drift net licences held by fishermen trying to make a living in difficult conditions.  The Canadians are phasing out all drift netting at sea and compensating their fishermen.  Could we, should we, or would we even consider the same approach?  Norway is banning all drift netting at sea from 1989.  If we do not bring order into the chaos which exists in this area we will soon be forced to by NASCO, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation.  Will we wait until we are pushed?  Will we enforce any changes realistically?  The list of questions is endless that will have to be answered and faced up to when the salmon review group reports.  If we are honest with ourselves most of us know what is going to be put before us and I hope we all have the gumption to act and do what is right in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the technical nature of the Bill before me and how and why it has become necessary to tighten up the definition of a &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; to prevent further abuses and illegal fishing, due to a loophole in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which became evident as a result of a Supreme Court judgment.  As virtually all fixed engines, stake nets, bag nets, fixed draft nets, head weirs, fixed to the soil or rock and secured in one or more places are now illegal, any loophole not rapidly closed could be devastating in a particular area.  Very few licences are still in existence for fixed engines.  They were those granted before 23 December under the Salmon Fishery (Ireland) Act, 1983.  The number of official licences under this Act which exist is in the region of 127 even though far fewer of these are now used.</P>
    <P>If this legislation was not given the urgent resolution it is now receiving there <Col N="3666" /> would be an enormous temptation for some of the existing 820 drift net licensees to stake those nets.  This, hopefully, will now be prevented.  At least there will not be a legal provision for it to happen. While I fully respect the traditional rights of fishermen, including the estuary men and the rights of the few remaining operational fixed engine licensees, such as in Bag-in-Bun in County Wexford, in Kerry, Achill and the Moy fishery.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation as an indication that the Minister may be prepared to go even further in protecting our native wild salmon stocks in the future when the salmon review group reports.  I will rest my case in relation to the drafting of the Bill before us and trust that the Minister and his advisers and the parliamentary draftsman have done the job intended.  I give my support to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that we welcome this Bill and its contents.  Once again it focuses our attention on the specific problems caused by drift netting as referred to by the previous speaker.  While this legislation was necessary, it focused on the easiest prey to get at and the big fish, to coin a phrase, are still breaking the law and abusing the system on the high seas.  This is the inherent problem we are facing today. The Minister in his opening speech made the point that our salmon stocks are at a critical level.  We are all aware of what the solution should be.  The question is, have we got the courage to see through the type of legislation and to back up the necessary legislation to ensure that the law is not broken, as it is being broken up wholesale at present?  Many people who have traditional fishing rights operate in small boats, or currachs and they are not the big culprits.  The larger vessels running miles of drift nets off our coastline are flagrantly disregarding the law as it stands.  They have no interest in the long-term survival of the salmon industry because when the stocks run dry they will move on to different areas and as a country we will be left without one of our very few natural resources.  The Government have to decide what resources they <Col N="3667" /> must put at the disposal of the fisheries boards to ensure that the law is implemented and adhered to.  I sincerely hope that the report to be published will show the areas that are necessary for curtailment.  I regret the interim report was not published: I do not know why it has be suppressed but it is easy to make the obvious guess as to why that has occurred.  It does not need much elaboration or thought to look at that.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister referred to the aspects of the fishing industry which are relevant to tourism.  I am very interested in this area.  The Minister said that the salmon industry is worth some £5.5 million in direct terms to the tourism industry.  However, we do not realise the true potential of the angling industry in respect of tourism.  It would be a pretence for anybody in this House to make the point that we have a sound angling industry.  We do not, but we have the potential and we are not paying serious attention to it.  We should examine the angling industry in Scotland, a country that is near to us and which provides a very good example.  In Scotland the angling industry alone is worth over £250 million in external revenue. That has been achieved because they had the courage to implement a fair system which gives an opportunity to protect the industry and enable it to grow.  In Ireland we have rivers and stocks equal to, if not superior to those in Scotland, but we are not taking the opportunities afforded to us.  It is another example of the will not being there because of too many vested interests holding sway to prevent the industry flourishing in a proper and constructive manner.  That is not occurring in this country today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said he was having meetings with the fisheries boards at present and in the coming weeks.  It does not need any imagination on my part to guess what the Minister will be told.  The reality is very stark.  The fisheries boards do not have the resources to implement the law today.  The situation is so bad that I believe the system has <Col N="3668" /> completely and utterly collapsed.  If something is not done in the immediate short term to countermand this the consequences will be extremely serious.</P>
    <P>In the broadest sense, this Bill has highlighted the problem areas that must be dealt with in a courageous and radical way.  I agree the Bill is a small step along the way, but I believe we as an island nation need a far more urgent approach to build a serious fishing industry, which sadly we do not have at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I am disappointed the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to bring in an entirely new fisheries Bill to cover all aspects of fishing.  Having listened to the different speakers, one would gather that the genuine fishermen are criminals and gangsters who are only raping the salmon stock.  I do not accept that.  It is very significant that there was no mention of the big industrial concerns or the big farmers who pollute the estuaries.  There is no question of penalties for those people.</P>
      <P>Irish fishermen have caught salmon for generations and they are entitled to catch salmon.  Some people like a nice weekend off; they may have a six hour day, two or three company cars at their disposal and would like to go out fishing in the evening. If they catch a salmon, they go to the local hotel and boast they have caught a 20 pounder.  They are entitled to their fun but the people who have depended on fishing for their bread and butter for generations are entitled to live too.  It is reflection on everybody that they do not get the necessary facilities to carry out their jobs.  I know fishermen who have to get out at 3 o'clock in the morning and who come in at 9 o'clock in the evening having spent 15 hours in small boats, taking their lives in their hands.  If a sudden squall came they were gone. Those people are genuine fishermen; they have families to rear and educate and they are entitled to their living, as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cowboys in every walk of life, but the genuine fisherman is entitled to his living.  We have heard much this <Col N="3669" /> morning about the famous review which is going to do so much for the fishing industry.  Perhaps the review will recognise that a genuine fisherman who has used the drift net for many years is entitled to use it.  Admittedly, the cowboy who has a net which is too long and too deep should be put out of business. Nobody has any respect for him.</P>
    <P>There was no mention this morning of the Spanish and French who are out in Dingle Bay 20 miles off the Skelligs with miles of drift net raping the bay week in and week out.  There is no mention of those people, or the French fisherman who is coming right up to the Skellig Rock with his drift net and raping the fishery.  His is OK as he is a foreigner, but if the local man goes out and catches fish he is a blackguard, a criminal who should be dragged before the courts.  We have to get our priorities right.  I hope the Minister, who is a west coast man and who in my opinion has the interests of the fishing industry at heart, will take the opportunity to go around and meet the drift net fishermen.  He should make out a set of rules and anybody who does not abide by the rules should face the law of the land.  At this time we should not blame the Irish fisherman because the foreign fisherman is doing far more damage to the salmon industry.  Nobody can tell what they have landed, as the fish are landed in the Isle of Man, in England, France and Spain and there is no mention of that.  A wrong impression is being created about drift nets.  The vast majority of drift net fishermen are law-abiding, seafaring men but I would nail the part-timer, the school teacher or industrialist who goes out fishing for the weekend with a drift net.  He is not entitled to be there if he has not a licence. I make no excuse for that type of individual.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to go from coast to coast to meet the fishermen during the summer recess.  He should meet the fishermen who have genuine grievances and who are prepared to put their proposals before him.  If it is necessary, we should regulate to have a four day week or so many hours a day for drift netting. <Col N="3670" /> At this time we cannot ban drift net fishermen from the Irish seas when the foreigners are doing it a couple of miles outside the limits.  You cannot take away their livelihood from them.  Where would we get the money to compensate hundreds of people?  We have not the resources like the Canadians to phase out drift netting.  The Minister has a golden opportunity during the summer recess to meet the fishermen.  As there is so much talk about drift netting, why are drift nets legally for sale in Ireland?  That is the only net fishermen can buy.  What are we talking about?  The net is legally for sale in this country.  If it is illegal to sell it why is it sold here?  Let somebody answer that.  The same drift net is for sale in England, France, Spain and all coastal countries.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  He has a difficult job.  At the moment he has the goodwill of the fishermen, and I know from meeting them that they are as good citizens as any.  In regard to conservation, let the Minister think of the vested interests who are polluting our estuaries. Nail those people.  They have influential company directors in the right places. There is no talk about the big boys but plenty of talk about the small boy.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in this Bill, and when last there was a Fisheries Amendment Bill before the House, I spoke about drift and draft nets.  I am not satisfied that this Bill gives a clear definition of the use of drift nets on rivers and drift nets at sea.  The Minister referred to the case in Enniscrone, County Sligo, but in other cases when the question of these nets arose the judges were unable to properly define what was really intended.  I suggested at that time <Col N="3671" /> that draft and drift nets should apply on rivers and drift nets at sea.  Despite what Deputy Begley says I believe that gross discrimination is practised by sea fishermen. What I suggest should control that and prevent the rape of salmon stocks at sea.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked a question about the number of times the fisheries vessel patrolled the Donegal and north-east fisheries.  In February, March and April I noticed that there were a number of patrols but in May and June when most of the young peel and salmon are running Donegal gets away with only four visits from the patrol vessels.  Are the Department of the Marine making sufficient requests to the Department of Defence to see that fishermen behave themselves? I am told that normal fishermen who have genuine licences behave themselves, but we have cowboys, numerous unlicensed people in the north-west and Donegal making huge catches.  I have heard of half deckers landing 400 and 500 salmon per day in recent weeks.  I wish genuine licensed fishermen well, but if the State has respect for itself and for the future of the salmon stocks, surely the fishery vessels should be asked to patrol this area during this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken in this House about the rape of the Shannon estuary and people coming from other fishing ports in the south and probably from the north to the Clare coast.  I am certain the Minister is aware of the complaints we have received about this.  Indeed if what I hear is true, some come from even the far south and take the livelihood of the people and prevent stock from going up the river. Most of the restocking is done by the ESB and the ESB hatchery is sited on the Shannon at Parteen.  Off the river Fergus we have a private conservation unit run by a local industry, Syntex.  What a sad reflection on the State that it will not take action against these intruders at the appropriate time.  I was appalled to read that the secretary of the fisheries board in Donegal said that they had no money to guarantee the control or patrol of the fisheries under their jurisdiction.  I appeal <Col N="3672" /> to the Minister to have another look at that.</P>
    <P>The time for the conservation of salmon is fast running out.  I know that in this Bill the Minister is making a reasonable effort about fixed engines, but the real culprits, the people who have not got licences, who are uncontrolled, are getting away lightly.  I understand that incidents occurred at sea and that there are difficulties off the Aran Islands.  I appeal for more frequent inspection of these fishery grounds.  I ask the Minister to consider whether draft net fishing on rivers and drift net fishing at sea should be included in the definition the Minister is bringing in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points on this Bill and to refer to the comments made.  This is very simple and necessary legislation in view of the Supreme Court decision some time ago in relation to the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  The expression &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo; is difficult to understand because one can get the impression that a fixed engine is some type of engine that is fixed.  The term does not even relate to an engine, it relates to a stake net, a bag net, a fixed draft net, a head weir or &ldquo;any net, implement, engine or device, fixed to the soil or secured by one or more anchors&rdquo;.  One would have thought at that time that that legislation would have been sufficient.  I would have thought that any net could not be fixed in the real sense of the word, that it would have to fluctuate somewhat in the water. However, we must respect the decision of the Supreme Court, thus the necessity to introduce and have this legislation passed as quickly as possible.  As the Minister said, it will help to ensure greater conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary to elaborate on this. It is simple legislation and I am pleased that it has support from all sides of the House.  I have referred to comments by some of the speakers.  I would like to think that there would be unanimity among the Members opposite.  However there is division there, but, at least they <Col N="3673" /> came into the House and many of them contributed to the debate on the Estimates here.  On many mornings on the Order of Business some parties in this House stated that they do not have an opportunity to speak in this House.  Let me put on the record that on that night when we had a very constructive debate on that Estimate our friends the PDs did not think it worth their while to become involved in that debate.  There are people in this House who are genuinely interested in the matter.  When we look at the press gallery we see the interest that is there.  The Minister and Deputy Doyle referred to the importance of the industry and I fully endorse what they say.  At times we get plenty of criticism. Last week in one of the national papers there was criticism of our attitude towards the Spaniards who fish off the south-west coast.  That statement was full of inaccuracies.  The officials of the Department, the Minister, myself or indeed the Opposition spokesperson were not asked for comments on the matter.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister instructed me to visit the south-west.  I went down in one of the Army planes, surveyed the whole area and photographed all the foreign vessels fishing there, one of which was apprehended that same day.  Every effort is being made within the constraints in which we must operate to solve this problem.  That same week an irresponsible journalist stated that we were taking no action, that we were allowing the Spaniards themselves and the British Spaniards to come into the country and to rape our seas.  As late as yesterday, boats were apprehended in that area.  Of course the injunction which was obtained by the British Spaniards is not mentioned. That allows them, until their case is heard, to continue with the 75 per cent crewing.  We hope that case will be heard some day next week.  This will not deter us from continuing to police these waters and to apprehend these vessels.  It is not just a question of 75 per cent crewing.  It is a question of the size and the type of nets that are being used and of taking in small fish.  We will continue to ensure <Col N="3674" /> that if those boats are going to fish off the coast they will do so legally and will not continue raping the waters off any part of the coast.  It is unfair to the Ministers and the officials involved to give the wrong impression and to say that everything possible is not being done to solve the problem.  It is also unfair to the Army and the Navy who are doing an excellent job in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley referred to pollution. This is an extremely serious problem.  A spill into any of our rivers can be detrimental. There is also the question of drift net fishermen.  These are traditional fishermen from whom the right to supplement their income, whether it be from small farming, by way of unemployment assistance or small farmers' dole, as it was, cannot be taken.  There are some people who break the law and they will not receive support from any side of the House.  However, it is unfair to give the impression that these people are almost millionaires.  People should educate themselves better as far as drift net fishermen are concerned.  It has been suggested that drift net fishing is wrong at sea but is all right in the estuaries.  I would like to know what is meant by that.</P>
    <P>There is a salmon review group in existence and there is no question of suppressing them in their work.  Ironically, that review group were set up after the previous Minister made a statement in Howth that he would legalise monofilament. We all have an opportunity of expressing in this House our views on monofilament and the various interests and groups in the industry have an opportunity to express their views to the salmon review group who will then make a decision.  Unfortunately, it was only three weeks after the former Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, stated in an interview with the press that monofilament would be legalised that the salmon review group was set up.  The terms of reference of the review group are much too narrow.  They should have a much wider scope.  We respect the setting up of that group and we will not be afraid to grasp the nettle at the opportune time.  All the interests of the industry will be taken into account <Col N="3675" /> inland fisheries, drift net fishermen, anglers and so on.  I fully appreciate the importance of angling to the economy and to tourism.  It is wrong to say that we must immediately ban the use of drift net fishing and compensate those fishermen. There is a wide range of problems in this area and we should not rush to issue a report until we have established all the facts.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that salmon fishing is a renewable resource.  Deputy Collins has stated that in ten years time there will be no salmon but we heard that ten and 20 years ago but thanks to the many angling associations throughout the country who contribute to the restocking there is a good supply of salmon this year. They do not think we give them full credit for it.  They receive no monetary return from that investment.  We should consider giving them assistance to help us in restocking salmon.  The ESB also do their part.  It is important to remember that in some parts of the country a levy of 1 or 1.5 per cent is collected by the co-ops and goes towards restocking purposes.</P>
    <P>The Northern Regional Fisheries Board was mentioned.  It is not very long since a payment of £10,000 was made to that board and was welcomed by the chairman, Pat Foley, and the manager, Alan McGurdy.  That money will be used for restocking purposes.  This should be done throughout the country, whether the fish is sold through co-ops or sold directly.  A certain percentage should be retained for restocking purposes.  This is a renewable resource and we should be assured that it continues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey alleged that there are no patrol vessels in various part of this country.  This is a matter for the Minister for Defence and his officials.  I assure the Deputy that three patrol vessels that are in the water at all times make an even distribution around the coast.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy speaks with his colleague, with my constituency colleague, Deputy McGinley, who has an interest in the industry, who is <i>au fait</i> with it and who realises the importance of it to the small fishermen off the west coast, he would be briefed as to the presence of naval vessels along the west and north-west coast.  The Deputy might also be interested to learn that a case of a small vessel which was taken into Rathmullan was brought before the court yesterday.  If the facts do not suit some Deputies, I cannot help that.  Many more people will be able to give the Deputy a full report of all the cases along the coast which were brought to court.</P>
      <P>I hope the report of the review group will be available in the next few months. I say to Deputies and to the Opposition spokesperson that we should not rush into having this report ready just for the sake of that.  We should consider it carefully in relation to the use of the nets and the use of monofilament.  Deputy Deasy suggested that we should consider a mix of monofilament and traditional nets or the use of monoace and multimono nets. He also asked if there should be a tagging system or a quota system.  All these questions must be addressed.  While it is popular to knock people, if there are difficulties individual Deputies should try to prevail upon the fishermen in their own constituencies to stay within the law. Whenever the Department get the opportunity they will ensure that there will be no harassment of the authorities and that cases will be brought before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country illegal fishing takes place after the fishing season.  It is not just the fishermen who are to blame because they can only dispose of the fish if people <Col N="3677" /> are prepared to buy them.  We should try to stamp out this practice immediately because it results in illegally-caught fish being sold at half price but at any price it is a bonus to the fishermen concerned. It is certainly a major bonus to the buyer who can sell his fresh, smoked or frozen fish at the same price as others.  It is unfair competition to those genuine fishermen and genuine buyers who have to pay the premium price throughout the season. That reflects on the price the following year.  We must look at this, if we get an opportunity, at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to hear reports that there has been a good run this year and that prices are holding up well particularly in view of the suggestions made inside and outside the House that farm fish will have a serious effect on salmon. In my view there will always be a premium for white fish.  It has been established that farm fish, whatever its quality, will never match the quality of wild fish. Wild fish, with the price holding up, will always attract a premium price as against other fish.  I do not hold the same concern as some people in the industry that we should be very careful in regard to our policies on farm fish.  We have the right circumstances with pure clean water off our coast to pursue not only farming salmon but farming white fish.  I do not wish to open up that debate when we are considering the question of fixed engines but if we could do that in years to come we might be able to overcome the problem of continuity of supplies of white fish.</P>

      <P>I am conversant with the laws governing inland fisheries but I am not totally familiar with the legal definition of a &ldquo;fixed engine&rdquo;.  To me a fixed engine was always a staked net which was more often than not staked at both ends. The Minister should have explained in the explanatory memorandum in layman's language what is involved.  He should not have used the language of a parliamentary draftsman or a barrister. He should tell us what the expression means.  Is it a net staked at both ends by anchors or stakes or is it a net staked at one end by an anchor or a stake while the fisherman goes off to the pub to have a couple of pints or goes home to bed for a well deserved rest?  I am not clear what it is and I do not believe anybody could be clear from the jargon that is used in the explanatory memorandum which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3679" /> ...held by hand or made stationary in any other way...</P>
    <P>That explanation is for the birds.  It should be clarified.  The people who compiled that are talking through their hats and do not know the text of the Bill or the contents of the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>This is a small technical piece of legislation but it does not address the problem that has beset our salmon industry in the last 20 years, ever since the advent of drift netting at sea.  Deputy Doyle, in the course of her contribution, reckoned that the value of the salmon and angling industry was between £40 million and £50 million but that includes all aspects of inland fishing, salmon and brown or white trout fishing by rod and coarse fishing by rod whether it is on the lakes of Cavan and Monaghan or on the Blackwater River. It is a very diverse industry which is an integral part of the tourist business.  We should differentiate between the value of the inland fishing in the sporting context and in the context of drift netting at sea. However, while they are poles apart in many ways one is dependent on the other. If drift netting at sea is not controlled or curtailed we are not going to have any inland fisheries where salmon angling is concerned.  It will be wiped out and we have been warned often enough about that.  We need a radical change in the law to see that that does not happen and this technical adjustment does not matter a tráithnín because it will not make any great difference.</P>
    <P>This is the season for high jinks on the high seas and unless the law is changed quickly and dramatically we will have a real problem where all our salmon industry is concerned, whether it is drift netting at sea or the livelihood of thousands we are concerned about.  Those involved in catering for angling visitors will be at risk. We must do something quickly.  In the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Marine I outlined to the Minister what I felt should be done and I expected a positive response but I have not heard anything since.  From now <Col N="3680" /> until about the middle of August we will have a series of running battles around our coast between the law enforcement agencies, the bailiffs, the Garda Síochána and our Naval Service in direct conflict with people who are trying to eke out a living under impossible terms of reference. I am referring to the hard pressed fishermen who have been fishing since the month of March but whose return would not pay the cost of running the boats they are using.  Those fishermen depend on their catches in the next month to make sufficient money to keep them going for the next 12 months.  A regime should be introduced under which people can expect to get an opportunity to make a reasonable living.  At the moment our fishermen are in direct conflict with our law and that is a regrettable state of affairs.  I am asking that the law be changed so as to permit people to make a decent living without being harassed or forced to break the law.  Those fishermen do not want to break the law.</P>
    <P>Disciplines will be introduced within fishing communities if the law is amended to give all our fishermen a reasonable chance to make a decent living. However, as long as the present archaic law governing the length of the net and the type of material used is maintained the law will be broken.  The law will be broken because fishermen will have nets in the form of &ldquo;fixed engines&rdquo; blocking the estuaries of major and minor rivers. In doing so they stop fish from going up the rivers and thereby prevent the anglers from getting any fish at all.  There has been a massive decline in real terms in the value of the angling portion of the tourist industry over the past 20 years. That fact is not being faced up to.  Tourism should be one of our major industries. We talk about the tourist industry being our second largest industry.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport introduced an Estimate here on Tuesday night last and he said that by the end of the century tourism would be the single largest industry in the world.</P>
    <P>It should almost be the single largest industry in this country but it is not.  We are falling far short of targets to which <Col N="3681" /> we aspired years ago.  One of the reasons is that our inland fisheries industry has declined rather than progressed.  It has declined for a number of reasons but a major reason is that the mouths of rivers are being blocked by a vast mileage of these nets and the fish are not getting up. The tourists are not coming and our native sea anglers are fed up to the teeth with the present system.  I am asking for a little bit of sanity and commonsense to be introduced.  A limited amount of monofilament net should be allowed to be used when drift netting for salmon.  I believe that the fishing communities will adapt to that discipline and the law enforcement agencies will not have a great problem if there is a compromise on this situation. Of course there will always be poachers. Will Shakespeare was a poacher and even some of our conservators are poachers, from what I am told, and some of our bailiffs have had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of our politicians too I am told.  I know of a county councillor who was apprehended last year, It is a way of life with some people and they would not be happy unless they were breaking the law to some extent.  I am not too worried about people who get a thrill from a slight manipulation of the law; what I am worried about are the people who are fishing commercially with nets.  These nets can be five or six miles long and the engines are in the form of fixed engines in most cases.  A trawler man can put out a net a couple of miles here and a couple of miles there, go away and come back in a day or two and get a couple of thousand pounds worth of fish. That is ruinous to the salmon industry, to the tourist industry and to the overall economy.  We are at loggerheads for no good reason.  I am asking that a limited amount of monofilament net be allowed in conjunction with a certain amount of nylon net and then let us see how the law, when changed, will operate.  I am sure it will enable people to make a reasonable living from the sea and I am sure it will <Col N="3682" /> allow a huge amount of salmon to go up the rivers to spawn.  That is the essence of the whole inland fisheries regime.  You must let the fish up the river to spawn. There has been an alarming drop in the number of spawning salmon going up certain rivers.  It can all be put down to the damage that is being done by the blocking off of estuaries by miles and miles of nets which are nothing more than fixed engines to which this Bill refers but does not attempt to solve.  I would ask the Minister to leave a legacy.  He will be remembered for evermore as the man who saved the North Atlantic salmon as it applies to Ireland.  Would it not be a great epitaph to have on his tombstone over there in Doonbeg or Miltown Malbay or wherever it is?</P>

It is so obvious and it will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned the people living by the estuaries.  They have not got a chance.  The traditional net salmon fisherman resides by the estuary.  He made a living going back into the 1960's and for centuries before that in a nice, civilised, regular way but with the advent of the drift netters at sea he has been poverty stricken because the fish are not getting into him.  Whether he has a drift net licence or is a snap net salmon fisherman he has no hope and the only way he can make a living is by breaking the law.  He has to use monofilament net and he has to use a greater length of net than is allowed under the existing regulations.  You are making law breakers of people who have been models of good citizenship over the centuries. Those people never broke the law but <Col N="3683" /> they are being put in a position where they either starve or break the law.  I know a few of them who have gone hungry rather than break the law because you do still have this basic decency in our society.  There are people who will not go out and break the law but they have had to give up fishing because they could not make a shilling.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister and we as legislators should see to it that such people are protected.  There is no protection for them and that is an enormous reflection on all of us here.  We all know it is a fact, so something will have to be done.  What better time to do it than now when we are entering the season of high conflict on the high seas?  Last Tuesday morning on my way to Dublin I was listening to a report of an incident off the Aran Islands. The manager of the Western Fisheries Board was being interviewed and he detailed how members of his staff had been attacked the previous day with a boat hook, which is a fairly lethal weapon, when they went to collect some monofilament net.  We have seen this over the past six or seven years.  Constituents of my own have gone to prison in recent years for breaking the law by the use of monofilament net or fixed engines or a combination of both.  It is a ritual every summer now.  We have massive conflicts between the law enforcement agencies and the fishermen. It should not happen.  They do not just use boat hooks, they are using slashers, iron bars, and even shotguns have come into use on occasions.  It is dreadful and if it continues there will be loss of life sooner or later.</P>
    <P>It is a highly emotive and dangerous situation and there is an onus on the Government and on the Minister to see that the situation is rectified.  We need changes quickly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, referred to after season fishing.  Of course it is prevalent. All laws relating to salmon fishing at sea and in estuaries are being broken.  It is not just after season fishing, it is weekend fishing as well.  As Members know, the salmon fishing week is a five day week, <Col N="3684" /> and people are not supposed to fish on Saturday or Sunday, and the closing date for the season varies from one part of the country to another &mdash; 15 July in some areas and 15 August elsewhere &mdash; but those dates are a joke.  They are not complied with.  As the Minister said, the end of the season should be one of the dates I mentioned, but people often fish well into September.  The August and September fish are going up the river to spawn and unless we stop all this illegal fishing &mdash; in terms of the length of net, weekend fishing or after end of season fishing &mdash; the salmon fishing industry and many thousands of jobs will be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not just to bring in a tiny piece of legislation which had to be brought in because of a Supreme Court decision, but to bring in legislation which is useful and meaningful and which will give the salmon fishing industry an impetus to grow, as well as helping our tourist industry and providing worthwhile employment for thousands of Irish people at home.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Deputy should have had a chat with the then Minister to see if something could have been done.  I believe there is a considerable amount of ignorance about drift net fishermen.  Whether you are a legal or an illegal drift net fisherman, in the eyes of many people you are a drift net fisherman and probably doing something wrong.  The truth is quite different.  There <Col N="3685" /> is a considerable number of small fishermen who would not be living here today were it not for the fact that during the season they are able to fish for salmon.  There is a certain amount of cynicism about these people but it has to be remembered that they and their families are dependent on this industry and if they could not fish for salmon they would have to emigrate.  As I said in this House before, meanwhile back at the ranch, the rape of Irish waters continues.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the recent arrests of Spanish boats fishing in Irish waters.  It is clear that he is taking considerable interest in this scandal which has been going on for far too long. The time has come for legislation to be introduced for the compulsory acquisition of a foreign boat fishing in Irish waters and caught for the second time. Far too often one boat comes with a Naval vessel while other foreign vessels fish on.  The fines have become meaningless. Fines of up to £50,000 and £75,000 do not make a difference to these fishermen any more because they are operating in fleets.  While one boat is in the harbour facing fines, the remainder are outside more than making up for any fines which may be imposed.</P>
      <P>There have been instances of foreign boats being captured, brought into Irish harbours, going out again having obtained bonds and carrying on as if they had never been captured.  It is time for a rethink and for the introduction of legislation for the compulsory acquisition of these boats if they are found guilty of a second offence.  If that does not work, let us introduce legislation which would mean that boats would be confiscated for a first offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of the drift nets is not one that can be easily solved.  You have to marry the interests of the genuine fishermen with the necessity to conserve. You have to marry the absolute necessity of these drift net fishermen to fish, as has been their traditional right for generations, with the interests of the inland fisheries.  In this respect legislation would have to be introduced, if necessary, so that a national restocking programme <Col N="3686" /> would be undertaken.  It is incredible that even though we have some of the finest rivers and lakes in Europe, we have not undertaken a national restocking programme financed by the Department. That is very much needed.  Anything else is a hit and miss affair, and in this business hit and miss affairs are not good enough.</P>
    <P>I believe that if there was a national restocking programme and if legislation were introduced to provide for the compulsory acquisition of foreign boats found guilty of illegally fishing in our waters, the necessary infrastructure would be laid for the Irish salmon industry, there would be greater co-ordination, and, to use Deputy Deasy's words, a new regime set up.  The Irish fishing industry and those involved in drift net fishing for salmon are more than anxious that there should be a new regime and a more co-ordinated approach to the industry.  They are more than anxious that the industry would survive. Let us not kid ourselves.  It is not in the interests of any drift net fisherman to bring about a situation where there would not be sufficient salmon, but it is fair to say that the scare about the scarcity of salmon has always been laid at the door of the drift net fishermen and, worse than that, it has been laid specifically at the door of Irish drift net fishermen whose average boat size is only 36 feet.</P>
    <P>National pride, if nothing else, demands that we get at the truth.  The boats which are consistently fishing in Irish waters and raping the seas should be informed that the penalties will be far more severe in future.  It is ironic that our trading partners in Europe are some of the worst offenders in this regard.  If our boats were powerful enough to go into other waters we would hear a lot about it, I would go so far as to say that the fishermen would be jailed for a long time. We have been too soft on these people. They are only laughing at us and it is time we realised it.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries are crucially important to our tourist industry.  A salmon caught in a river or lake by a tourist generates a considerable amount of money.  In this respect, voluntary agencies and people <Col N="3687" /> who have been restocking the rivers and lakes should be congratulated.  However, they need assistance.  Other factors causing the depletion of salmon stocks must be looked at.  Pollution is a major source for the diminution of salmon in lakes and inland rivers.  The indiscriminate taking of gravel from river beds is also a reason for lack of spawning in the rivers.</P>
    <P>To solve problems facing the fishing industry, we will have to take serious measures against foreign boats fishing in our waters and we will also have to concentrate on protecting our own fishermen instead of very often criticising them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My party agree with the terms of the Bill and have no criticism to make.  Our main criticism is in regard to what is not in the Bill.  It is a very small Bill dealing with a limited problem which has arisen from a court decision and the Minister is obviously right to have it attended to as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Bill is so limited.  I know this Bill must be passed quickly but we should accept that there is a far larger problem in the fishing industry with which we must deal.  For the very short time in which I was in that Department we were aware of the many problems in the industry and its future.  It is one of the areas which has been targeted by the Government for development in an orderly fashion over the years.  Everyone, from the Minister down to the smallest fisherman, knows that there are many problems caused by the different pressures and needs of the industry, including legislation introduced from time to time by the EC and larger boats fishing in deep waters for white fish and other species. Perhaps also the limitations placed on the industry by the EC has stopped the industry from developing as fast as we would have liked.  Nevertheless, over the past few years there has been an acceptance in the EC of greater need for larger quotas for our fishing industry.  This was achieved at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers which I attended in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spokesmen for the various parties are <Col N="3688" /> concerned about drift netting, inland fishermen and the problem of the industry as it affects tourists.  I hope the Minister will give us some idea of his policy for the fishing industry.  When I was Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the greatest problem was the illegal use of monofilament nets which must be tackled by the Government as a matter of urgency.  To do that and in fairness to everybody in the industry, I felt it necessary to set up a committee in the Department drawing from personnel in other Departments and agencies who dealt with the catching and sale of salmon so that a total input from all areas could be given to the Minister as a guideline for future legislation in regard to catching salmon.</P>
    <P>It has been said that monofilament net is the modern aid to fishing and that it cannot be ignored.  When I made a comment in Cork that I was prepared to look at modern methods of catching fish and that they should not be condemned, I was not saying I was in favour of monofilament nets being used to catch salmon. I was well aware that the vast bulk of salmon caught around our coasts is fished illegally with a monofilament net.  It is not illegal to fish with monofilament net except in the case of salmon.  It is also illegal to use nets beyond a certain length and depth and which exceed the proper mesh size.  There are also laws in regard to fishing at certain times of the year and if they are ignored very strong measures must be taken.  The Minister is well aware of all these problems from his own constituency and from his position.  Order must be brought back to fishing around our coasts.  There is a feeling that the numbers of salmon caught in draft nets have adversely affected the draft and snap net fishermen who generally work in the estuaries around our coast.  The angler &mdash; tourist or local &mdash; should also be considered.  We are famous for our fishing rivers and lakes but many of them have been depleted of salmon stocks not just, as the previous speaker said, by someone taking gravel from the river bed but simply because salmon never reach some of our former famous fishing rivers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3689" /> Deputy Doyle lives on the same coast as I do and will agree that the east coast has suffered from over fishing of salmon on parts of the west coast.  I am not saying that one group of fishermen are to be put out of business but the law must be applied as it stands and if the law is inadequate it should be changed.  The committee I set up to give me professional information as to how the law should be applied, will, I hope, soon have a report on the Minister's desk.  The Minister has indicated that he has not yet got that report.  There is an urgency about getting that information.  It is not just a matter of putting a limitation on fishing but there is also the sale of illegally caught salmon. That must be stopped.  There would not be an industry for illegally caught salmon if there were not receivers who are obviously making very large sums of money because they can dispose of the salmon very easily.  When the Minister gets this report I hope he will act on it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The monofilament net, as well as being illegal, has had no limitation placed on it as regards length, time of year or time of day or night.  These nets can be used at night whereas the old fishing net could be used only in the day time.  That means that salmon can be taken from the waters around our coast at night time also.  The resources of the fishery board are inadequate for their work.  This was so when I was Minister and I know the pressures as regards finance in every Department. It is impossible to expand surveillance and do the work that needs to be done to make good the shortfall in the board's activities.  The cutbacks have operated to the benefit of those who are involved in illegal fishing.  During Hurricane Charlie we lost a fishery surveillance boat on the east coast which to my knowledge has not been replaced.  There would be very little salmon surveillance needed because of the depleted stocks but the surveillance boat needs to be replaced.  I realise the problems the Minister has with regard to the amount of money available to him. Unless there is surveillance and a proper application of the law, even as it stands at the monent, we will not have an <Col N="3690" /> improvement over the chaotic conditions that prevail as regards the taking of salmon around our coasts.  There is a need for more stringent legislation, even purely because of the operation of the monofilament net.  All of us should give the Minister a reasonable time to settle into his Department and sort matters out. In the absence of the report I have mentioned we must accept what is in the Bill before us today.  It is to cover a leak which was there as a result of a court judgment. The Minister is right to act as quickly as he did.</P>
    <P>Fish farming is a very important area for the future and all Governments are totally behind the efforts to expand in this area.  Fish farming will have an effect on the taking of salmon around our coasts because, due to the law of supply and demand, as the fish farmed salmon become plentiful there will not be the same attraction to catch salmon illegally &mdash; the price will drop.  Fish farming has been placed on a good footing but, of course, a great deal more will have to be done.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern among communities around the country who feel that the larger concerns coming into the industry will cut off traditional operations. People will no longer be able to fish the traditional lakes or rivers from which they got their living.  I hope there will be a coming together of all the interests who are moving into various areas in the country, to ensure that the traditional communities, both wholetime and part-time, will have their needs taken into account.  They would be the first to benefit from employment in these new industries that are very important to the expansion of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably very well aware of a little sales trick that seems to be operating here at the moment, when we have a scarcity of salmon.  It is possible to bring in salmon from other parts of the world and one of the areas mentioned to me has been the Pacific.  Such salmon has been described, when it is smoked, as Irish smoked salmon.  Many will buy that and assume on its face value that it is a product of this country, salmon caught in <Col N="3691" /> Irish waters, whereas smoked Irish salmon should be underlined on packaged fish to indicate that the salmon has been caught in these waters.  There is a great difference between the quality of one and the other.  The presentation of our goods is very important, whether it be in the shops or at any of the outlets such as our ports and airports.  Where fish are caught should be clearly indicated, not just where they are smoked.  I may be straying a little beyond the terms of the debate in saying this.</P>
    <P>Taking into account my experience of the last two debates, this is an opportunity for me to get more than five minutes to speak on this subject.  I wish the Minister and his Minister of State well, both are very well versed in the industry.  I know they have the interests of the industry at heart.  We must all give our co-operation in this regard.  I hope they will bring some measure of order back into an area which is now in a certain amount of disorder due to the catching of salmon around our coast to the detriment of the estuarial fishermen and of the very large and important tourist industry of fishing with rod and line in our rivers.  It is very important to us.</P>
    <P>One case is not more deserving than another.  There is enough for everybody to make a good living in this industry and both this Government and the previous Government are aware of that.  The Minister should try to prise a little more money out of the Minister for Finance to contribute to the expansion of our fishing industry.  I wish the Minister well in EC negotiations which are always very tough.  It is sometimes misunderstood as to what we can get for this country in relation to the expansion of the various quotas of species available to us.  I am totally in favour of this Bill and look forward to new measures being brought in as quickly as possible to deal with the problems which I have indicated in my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions, for their constructive support for this <Col N="3692" /> measure and indeed in the whole area of fisheries development.  Anyone reading the report of this debate will learn of the conflicting interests involved in such a varied industry as the salmon industry. Perhaps the Department of the Marine is the only body with no axe to grind in relation to the development of this industry.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Doyle's point that one of the factors which is possibly detrimental to development of inland and salmon fisheries relates to the lack of direction and policy.  The absence of a defined policy in relation to the management, control and conservation of our resources is probably the most inhibiting factor in the development of this resource.  The new Department of the Marine will have a division to deal with the exploitation of inland fisheries and with the development of overall policy. We will have a policy planning division which should pay special attention to policy, planning and long-term strategies to develop fisheries.  These resources have up until now been relatively under-exploited as a result of the absence of forward planning and policy.  It is vital to have forward planning.</P>
      <P>One of the major reasons for establishing this Department was to develop a co-ordinated overall approach towards developing our marine industries so as to exploit to the maximum the potential for jobs and for revenue for the State.  We have often been deflected from our main purpose by dealing with details and we have lost sight of our overall policy objectives. The main thrust of the commercial development division of Roinn na Mara will be to cut itself away from the details and conflicting interests and produce long-term policies to develop this huge resource.</P>
      <P>This industry offers prospects for job creation and tourism revenue.  We are fully aware of the potential of the inland fisheries in relation to tourism.  That potential has been identified in the document published by the Central Fisheries Board in consultation with the regional fisheries boards.  It is being examined in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3693" /> Deputy Doyle indicated that more attention needed to be given to developmental aspects of inland fisheries.  The fisheries boards have worked adequately within the limits of the resources available to them on conservation aspects of inland fisheries but the developmental potential was never adequately dealt with by the boards.  In my recent consultations and discussions with the regional board managers I pointed out that under existing legislation the boards have a statutory responsibility in the overall framing and presentation of development plans for inland fisheries in their areas.  I advised them of the desirability of producing at the earliest opportunity development plans for each of their areas as to how we should develop inland fisheries.  I pointed out to some of the regional boards the shortcomings in the way they are structured and financed and in their powers and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The financial allocations available from central Government is not adequate to meet their needs.  The boards will have to undertake self-financing developmental programmes so that they can do much of the work which up to now they have asked the Government to fund.  Within our financial limits it is not realistic to expect that we can undertake developmental programmes unless there is some method of financing at local level. In my discussions with the boards not only did we talk about reviewing administrative arrangements which are now in place bearing in mind that certain changes that took place in recent times have to be taken into account, but we discussed overall development of the administrative structures.  We will be setting up a new research institute to deal with marine research.  This will co-ordinate the activities at present being undertaken by various organisations.  Bearing all this in mind, there is a necessity to look at the funding of the boards to see how best they can undertake self-financing developmental programmes.</P>
    <P>In each board area at present there are companies and organisations in the private sector who are willing to make investments in this type of development. <Col N="3694" /> As Deputy Kavanagh pointed out the fish farm development which has taken place during the past number of years and which is very exciting because of the forward looking policy in that area, would scarcely have been possible if there was no private industrial investment.  I instanced the case of Carroll Industries. They are an Irish company who have invested substantially in the development of fish farming and aquaculture in coastal areas, especially along the west coast.  I compliment industries like Carroll Industries who have the courage to invest substantial amounts of money in a new and exciting venture, in the fish farming area. This area has been relatively underdeveloped up to now.  Its potential in terms of job creation and so on can only be realised by way of successful private investment.  Opportunities are available in the fish farming area for private investment from companies like Carroll Industries but there are opportunities for such investment also in inland fisheries within the regional board areas.  I would encourage Irish companies to get involved with the regional agencies and with Roinn na Mara in organising and exploiting possibilities for development and job creation in these areas.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to close a loophole in the existing legislation.  I support fully the views expressed by Deputy Begley in relation to traditional fishermen.  The livelihood of fishermen who have been involved in traditional net salmon fishing for generations is fundamental and paramount.  Not only should we take into account the possibilities for exploitation of our resources for people who have been traditionally involved in salmon fishing but we should recognise also the contribution they have made to traditional salmon fishing in the areas of conservation, restocking and protection. It would not be possible for the regional boards to protect inland fisheries were it not for the co-operation of traditional fishermen.  We have to recognise that traditional salmon fishermen have a legitimate right to be involved in this business. We cannot contemplate the total demise of the traditional salmon fisherman.  They <Col N="3695" /> are a very valuable part of the industry and have to be protected.  We have to ensure, by taking the necessary measures, that they will have a livelihood even if it is only to supplement the incomes from their smallholdings.  We place a very high value on the co-operation of the traditional salmon fishermen who have been involved in this industry for generations. We hope that through the rational exploitation of the stock there will be a future for them.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Carey is concerned about illegal activities in drift net fishing off the coast.  I compliment the previous Minister for the action he took in protecting exclusive areas along the west coast, including the mouth of the Shannon. I assure Deputy Carey that we are equally concerned about the activities of the cowboy operators, as he describes them.  They are of no benefit to the industry and this has been recognised by every Deputy who has spoken this morning. They appreciate that the so-called cowboy operators are no asset to the industry.  Every effort must be made to stamp out their activities.  It is my belief that within existing legislation we have sufficient legislative powers to deal with these illegal operators.  Not only will this illegal activitity have to be dealt with at sea where it is creating tension and anxiety but it has to be dealt with on the shore also.  I have directed the regional fisheries boards to ensure that the illegal activities which are taking place off shore are monitored and dealt with at the point of the sale and disposal of these illegal catches.  Within existing legislative controls we have adequate power to deal with this.  I have issued an instruction to the boards to deal with this problem to the best of their ability and within the limits of the resources available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey will be glad to know that there is an improvement in the salmon catches in the Shannon Estuary this season.  This is a welcome change from the position which obtained during the past number of years.  I compliment the boards and staff and assure them of our <Col N="3696" /> support for the work they are undertaking in very difficult circumstances in this respect.  We have had the support of the Navy and will continue to have it in protecting salmon catches.  I have spoken to the Minister for Defence in that regard and he has assured me that the resources available to the Navy and to the Minister for Defence will be utilised to the maximum advantage so that we can protect inshore fisheries to the best of our ability.  There will be breaches of the law and poaching and we would be naive in the extreme if we were to think that because we are going to make a determined effort we would stamp out these activities.  We will do the best we can to deal with these problems both through the utilisation of our resources and through co-operation with the Garda Síochána and the Navy.  Through this measure has been described as a minor one, I assure Deputies it will have very major consequences for the salmon fishing industry.  Within the limits of the resources available to us and through this legislation we will endeavour to stamp out illegal activities this season.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley referred to reports about pollution.  From reading today's papers I have to compliment the IFA and the ICMSA for the constructive views they have expressed in relation to the indiscriminate polluting of some of our major rivers and tributaries by way of silage effluent and so on.  Much of this pollution happens through a lack of foresight and planning and through carelessness. We cannot tolerate this.  I take this opportunity to appeal to the farming organisations to continue the support they are now giving to the regional fishery boards and the inland fisheries protection services in encouraging farmers to be more cautious about farming developments in the vicinity of rivers because silage pollution can cause enormous damage that is far beyond the comprehension of people who cause the pollution. It is an alarming problem and one on which we have to take some action.  I assure Deputies that we will take action in the most effective way we can to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3697" /> I am reasonably happy with the progress we are making this season.  If the Deputy checks &mdash; and we can supply the information &mdash; he will find that the run of salmon into the tributaries and into the catchments this season has been up on last year and there has been a substantial improvement.  That is not to say that we are satisfied, but catches in the lower Shannon area, which is the area with which I am most familiar, have been very much improved on last year and indeed improved on many years.</P>

      <P>We will have a look at what needs to be done in the Slaney.  If the situation improves on the west coast and in the Shannon estuary I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time until the runs which we are experiencing in the Shannon now get on to the Slaney.  The river Slaney has been a very valuable fishery and we would be very concerned to ensure that whatever action is necessary will be taken to protect the Slaney fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the need for a national restocking programme. That is a very laudable suggestion. I am aware that some action has been taken by individual organisations and by many voluntary organisations.  I take this opportunity to thank the voluntary organisations and associations who have undertaken restocking programmes of one kind or another and I assure them of our support.  I congratulate Fergus Salmon Anglers who have opened the first salmon hatchery which has been organised by a voluntary organisation in that area.  They are doing valuable work in the development of salmon stocks in the Fergus catchment which is a very valuable salmon fishery as Deputy Carey is aware.  The work of the Fergus Salmon Anglers has been well <Col N="3698" /> recognised.  This is the kind of activity we would like to see taking place in many other areas.  We will offer them every scientific advice possible and some financial assistance within the limits available if we can encourage voluntary organisations like the salmon anglers associations and organisation to get involved in this type of development programme which we hope to be able to support.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to the European Commission in Brussels I indicated the desirability of a programme for the development of inland fisheries.  I hope, when the Commissioner comes here at the end of July, that we will be in a position to discuss in more detail the prospects for some Community interest and involvement in the whole area of inshore fisheries restocking and perhaps work out some development programme which will be supported by the Community to deal with this very important area.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the issue of monofilament nets and the control and protection of our salmon industry I would like to await the views of the review body before making any more definite statements about it.  Apart from my responsibility in the ministerial sense I have had a personal interest in salmon fisheries for 30 or 40 years.  I have been involved with the Shannon Fisheries Board and the Limerick board of conservators for a number of years.  As an ex-employee of that board and as a member of the board we have a good idea of what needs to be done.  We will await the findings of the advice that is available from our own technical and professional people and from the review body which was set up by the previous Minister.  I assure the Deputies that we have to be realistic enough to know &mdash; I think all of us here are &mdash; that with the best will in the world and with the best conservation laws and with the best protection measures we can devise and implement, we will always have salmon problems connected with the conservation area.  It would probably be a much duller country for us if we did not have it.  All we can do is give undertakings that we will, within the limits of the financial and the legislative <Col N="3699" /> resources available to us, endeavour to ensure that the valuable salmon fishery, and the valuable inland fisheries are carefully managed, conserved and developed to ensure that there will be a future for those who have traditionally made a living from it and it would benefit the visiting angler, to the tourism industry and our community under the national development of this huge resource which has remained relatively underdeveloped. I thank the Deputies who contributed to this constructive and useful debate.</P>

      <P>In pare 6, subsection (1), line 1, to delete &ldquo;In&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of section 4, in&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 seeks to provide the basis upon which relationships should be deduced between a child and its parents.  It makes <Col N="3700" /> particular provisions in that regard.  Basically the section provides the relationships between every person and his father and mother (or either of them) shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be determined irrespective of whether his father and mother are or have been married to each other, and all other relationships shall be determined accordingly. The section then goes on to deal with the question of adoption which we can deal with at a later stage when dealing with the section itself.</P>
    <P>The problem with the section is that there is an assumption built into this provision which in most instances &mdash; I suppose, in the context of 99 per cent or more &mdash; of children born is correct, but in a particular area does not apply at all. It is assumed in using the terms &ldquo;father&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, that on all occasions when a child is born to a couple, be they married or unmarried, the child has been born as a result of the couple having sexual intercourse in the usual way and the conception taking place.  In the vast majority of instances those are the circumstances in which children are born. The section recognises in certain other circumstances a couple may have a child that they have not given birth to in that way themselves.  The section makes express provision for adopted children, so as to ensure that an adopted person is to be deemed from the date of adoption to be the child of the adopter or the adopters and not the child of any other person or persons.</P>
    <P>In recent years, and even since the publication of the Law Reform Commission Report on Illegitimacy, there have been dramatic advances in medical science, some of which are now being applied in this country which enable a couple to have a child in circumstances which do not coincide with the usual circumstances in which a child is conceived. For many years it has been possible for a couple to have a child by way of artificial insemination.  There are now an increasing number of childless couples resorting to artificial insemination as a means of having children.  The technique of artificial insemination is being used in St. <Col N="3701" /> James's Hospital in Dublin and in other medical institutions in the country.  It can be used in two contexts.  First it can be used where for some reason it is not possible for the wife to conceive, although both the husband and the wife appear to have no physiological problems or there might be a minor physiological difficulty and artificial insemination takes place as a result of the use of the husband's semen, and a wife conceives.  In those circumstances it seems to me that under this Bill, there is no problem under the concepts of father and mother.  But a child can be conceived by a couple by the use of the technique of AID, which is artificial insemination by donor.  There is also in Ireland a sperm bank which is being used by couples for artificial insemination in circumstances where that technique cannot result in a child being conceived if the semen used derives from the father.</P>
    <P>I am proposing an amendment to section 3 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 2 is simply a consequential amendment which would become necessary if the new section 4 which I propose is accepted.  The substantive amendment is amendment No. 3 which proposed to insert a new section 4 as follows:</P>
    <P>In deducing any relationship for the purposes of this Act or of any Act of the Oireachtas passed after the commencement of this section, where a child is born as a result of the artificial insemination of a woman who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) was at the time of insemination a party to a marriage (being a marriage which had not at that time been annulled); and</P>
    <P>(b) was artificially inseminated with the semen of some person other than the other party to that marriage,  </P>
    <P>then, unless it is proved to the satisfaction of any court by which the matter has to be determined that the other party to that marriage did not consent to the insemination, the child shall be treated in law as the child of the parties to that marriage and shall <Col N="3702" /> not be treated as the child of any person other than the parties to that marriage and the husband of the marriage shall be regarded as the father of such child. </P>
    <P>An extraordinary legal position exists at present whereby if a couple who are married to each other and who cannot have children use artificial insemination by donor, the technique that is known as AID and if with the consent of the husband this technique is used and to the great joy of both husband and wife successfully results in a child being born to them, under the law at present that child is illegitimate because it has not been fathered by the husband.  This is something which is not generally known or understood, but which can give rise to all sorts of legal difficulties for this child in the future and which can in law differentiate that child from other children. For example, if there are already two children born to the couple and if for some reason they cannot have another child, and wish to do so and they resort to this technique and successfully have a child, their first two children under the current law are legitimate, while the third child under the current law is illegitimate and is in a legally inferior position to the other two children.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, this Bill is designed to place all children in a position of legal equality.  The implications of what I am saying are that unless we deal with this issue, we will, in trying to remove the legal disabilities that apply to children who are currently termed &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; remove those legal disabilities with regard to one set of children, but we will copperfasten them with regard to the child born as a result of AID.  This is a serious issue for another reason.  Up to four or five years ago couples who could not have children of their own experienced very little difficulty in adopting.  The number of children available for adoption by a childless married couple has been drastically reduced, despite the substantial increase in the number of children born outside marriage. Whereas at present 10 per cent of the births are of children born outside <Col N="3703" /> marriage, the majority of unmarried mothers retain custody of their children. The effect of that has been that up to about five years ago there were in excess of 1,000 adoption orders made in respect of childless couples per annum and at present there are only in the region of 500 to 600 such adoptions made.  The remaining adoptions made in recent years have been where unmarried mothers have adopted their own child, often jointly with a husband whom they have married.  Many adoption societies have closed their doors to new applicants because they have far more applicants seeking to adopt than they have children available.  The result of this and the effect of the advances in medical science, which have made the technique of artificial insemination and other related techniques far more effective and efficient than they were in the past means that there will be an increased number of childless Irish couples resorting to this technique in order to have children. Unless the amendment I am proposing is made to the Bill a child born to a couple as a result of AID, where in real terms the mother has contributed towards the conception and birth of that child, will be in a legally inferior position to an adopted child.  That seems illogical.  In Irish terms this would be regarded as a sensitive area and for too long this House has sought to ignore such matters rather than deal with them.  It has taken too long to bring in legislation to place children in a position of legal equality.  In doing so we should not bring in legislation that has obvious and too stark defects and that has not kept pace with the realities of Irish society and modern scientific development.  Unless we deal with this issue at this stage in this Bill it may be 50 years before another similar matter comes before this House.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, this measure seeks to ensure that where a couple who are married to each other resort to the technique of AI no doubt can arise as to either the status or legal position of that child <Col N="3704" /> born as a result of the use of this technique within his family and that no doubt can arise as to the position of the father. It is to ensure that we do not create a new class of children against whom we preserve a discrimination.  Unless this amendment is made in this way it would seem that many of the good things in the Bill which seek to provide protections to children will not be extended to a child born in these circumstances and I can foresee many court cases where people seek to determine what is the meaning of a father in the overall context of this Bill and of children born in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I ask that this amendment be accepted. I hope it will have the support of the House.  It is an amendment along the lines of similar legislation introduced in a number of other jurisdictions to deal with this issue.  It is not a unique, redrafted measure confronting this issue for the first time.  Similar measures have been introduced in parliaments and legislatures in many other countries.  We tend to be very slow in legislation making provision for modern scientific developments. AI has been a possibility for many years but only in recent years did it become generally available to people in this country and begin to be used by couples who found themselves childless and who, because of social developments, regard adoption now as a less possible alternative.  Many of these couples would wish to have their own child in this way instead of having to resort to adoption.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this amendment is a matter of great controversy.  It is trying to provide in a sensible way for a delicate issue to ensure that when the legislation is enacted all children will be treated equally regardless of the circumstances of either their conception or their birth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are opposed.  The Law Reform Commission in their 1982 report on illegitimacy dealt with this subject briefly and they considered that it raised important moral and social issues <Col N="3705" /> that were outside their terms of reference. The previous Government felt that this question should be considered as a whole and separately from the question of removing the discriminations in the existing law on illegitimacy.  I am in full agreement with that approach.  This subject is extremely complicated and raises many difficult issues with ethical, medical, moral, sociological and legal implications and clearly calls for separate and comprehensive examination apart altogether from the Bill.  I am aware that the recently enacted English family law reform legislation dealing with the status of children contains a provision on the status of paternity of a child of a married woman conceived by way of AID with the consent of the mother's husband. There was considerable controversy in the English Parliament about that provision as it dealt with only one aspect of a very complicated problem before the general issues involved had been fully gone into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  The Labour Party support the amendments.  I do not know how frequently the sort of issue raised here arises.  I imagine that it does not arise very frequently, but it is a very human one, and it behoves this House to have a sympathetic approach to it.</P>
      <P>The urge to be a family and to have a child is a great natural instinct.  I do not know why we have to stand back from these issues.  Surely we can face up to a very human problem that affects families. Where there is consent between the husband and wife to this procedure, a child is born into and grows up as part of a family unit.  Why can we not be progressive about such an issue?  Why can we not look forward and say that this is primarily the concern of this family?  Who else does it involve?  It involves this unit of three people, the husband, the wife and a child born as a result of this arrangement. It is primarily their concern, a private matter.  Are we in this House to set high flown moral standards that really do not concern the community at large?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family is the ideal sought under <Col N="3706" /> our Constitution.  We pay great respect to the institution of the family.  It is referred to in the Constitution.  This is a family unit, and why not recognise it as such?  That is the intent of the exercise. A voluntary arrangement is entered into and it is an understandable one.  Why do we not have sympathy and understanding for that?  These amendments, if passed, would give great legal backup and standing to that family unit.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach appears to be a sidestepping of the issue, an unwillingness to face up to it.  We must ask if it will help anybody or do any good to deny the status of a family to this group.  Will this proposal harm anybody?  Is it going to cause any difficulty for anybody?  Is it going to affect anybody other than this family grouping?  It is not, and when we in this House have a chance to assist in such a matter by giving the designation, legally speaking, of a family to this grouping without interfering with anybody else's rights and doing some good on this issue, why do we not just do it?  All right, it is a forward looking notion, but we have been backward looking on too many such issues for far too long.  Why do we not give an example now and take a step forward on this issue and maybe be ahead of the posse in some respects for once? There are plenty of countries where we would not be ahead of the posse in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is a good pair of amendments and Deputy Shatter should be complimented for introducing them.  We support them. I urge the Minister to think again on this issue and consider accepting the amendments either at this Stage or perhaps at a later Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendments.  They are excellent amendments and I am surprised and disappointed at the Minister's dismissal of them.  He indicated there are serious problems in relation to them but he has not outlined those problems.  Amendment No. 3 very clearly states that where the husband was not a party to the agreement to have the insemination technique used, this would not apply where this is <Col N="3707" /> shown to be the case in court.  There seems to be no valid objection to moving in the direction which is being proposed here and I would be interested to hear what are the Minister's objections.  We are not talking about moral, theological or other issues but simply about trying to improve a very forward looking piece of legislation which has been agreed so far by the Seanad and by this House.  It would be a pity if these very necessary amendments were opposed by the Government. I would like to hear the Minister's specific reasons for not accepting them.  He said there are grave reasons but he did not specify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am very disappointed with the Minister's response. My understanding of this Bill is that we are trying to equalise the rights of all children irrespective of the circumstances of their birth, that we are trying to remove from our Statute Book legislation which is insulting and discriminatory against a certain category of children and which placed upon them a certain stigma.  If we do not accept the amendments put down by Deputy Shatter &mdash; I congratulate him for putting them down &mdash; we will continue to discriminate against a category of children who, through no fault of their own, were born in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a father consents to this method I see no problem in recognising the rights of that child.  The Minister referred to the moral, the ethical and the social consequences and he said we need more time to study the matter.  That is usually the classical political response when we want to do nothing.  The kind of people who might be opposed to this are the people who for so long prevented us from removing this stigma from certain categories of children.  They are the people who want us to continually look backwards and who are more concerned with property rights, sucession rights and division of land than they are with the rights of certain children. For years they prevented progress and prevented this House from bringing forward this kind of legislation.  We now <Col N="3708" /> have all-party support for this Bill and that is a very welcome and a very unusual step given the progress that has been made in this area in the past couple of years.  Here we are again wanting to turn the clock backwards.  We do not want to face up to reality as it is in 1987.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is passed, as Deputy Shatter said it will probably be years before we will have an opportunity to consider it again.  There will be no excuse to put down amendments to it.  We are missing an opportunity now if we do not make the amendments that we know are necessary even if they are controversial. We are legislators and it is our job to deal with reality and not to continue to discriminate against any category of children.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission on this matter.  I was not surprised at their comments because that same body said we should not remove the criminal conversation provisions but instead we should extend them.  Instead of abolishing the degrading and insulting legislation which gave husbands the right to sue other men who went off with their wives the commission said we were to extend it so that wives could equally sue. That was the kind of recommendations that body made and, therefore, I am not surprised at what they have to say in regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>It would be regrettable if we let this opportunity pass but obviously the Government are not going to accept the amendments.  There is a majority of Deputies in this House who do not belong to the Government party and I hope they will be here to vote on these amendments. I hope we will be able to use our collective political muscle in the Opposition because the Workers' Party, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael Party support these amendments and I hope they will vote for them.  From my knowledge of some of the Independent Deputies in this House I think they too might do so.  I hope they will vote for what I think would be a very progressive amendment to this <Col N="3709" /> legislation.  It would be a step forward and it would help many couples who perhaps feel that this method is not in some way acceptable to Irish society.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Shatter said about adoption.  Many adoption societies are not taking applications and it is almost impossible to adopt a child because of the lack of availability of children for adoption.  We should not moralise to parents in that situation and tell them they are not entitled to use all the modern scientific methods that are available to them to have children.  It is highly moralistic of us to preach to others that it is wrong simply because it might be the views of one particular church.  In a republic we have to get away from that kind of narrow attitude.  We have to allow ourselves to be able to avail of the modern scientific methods that would allow so many mothers to give birth to children in circumstances that a couple of years ago would have been unthinkable. Given that we are aware of these scientific developments, why should we, for whatever reason, close our minds as legislators to making provision in this Bill which deals with the status of children for children born in those circumstances?  If we make these changes, we will help people to think in this way.  We should not put them in a position where they feel secretly ashamed that they are in some way breaking the moral law or the legal law or that they are doing something that is not acceptable in Irish society.  We should not continue to behave in that way.</P>
    <P>I fully support the amendments and this party will vote for them.  We had considered putting down similar amendments to this Bill and we were very pleased when Deputy Shatter did so because he is in a better position than most to be able to frame the kind of amendment that is acceptable in these circumstances.  Rather than confuse the issue by a number of parties putting down similar amendments and all of them falling because everybody wants to vote for their own amendment, we decided to agree with these amendments and <Col N="3710" /> thereby have a collective input into this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Artificial insemination by a donor, surrogacy and <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation are comparatively recent developments in this country.  It is not true to say, as was said here by Members who contributed to this debate, that there is a general agreement on how these matters should be approached and what our attitude should be.  I am convinced that we need much more debate on these matters.</P>
      <P>The whole subject of artificial insemination is a very complicated one and I would welcome more debate on it because there has been very little debate on it up to now.  It raises many controversial questions about the legal relationships of children born of artificial insemination, whether by the husband or by other donor.  The whole subject is a matter for decision on its own merits and in my view is outside the scope of this Bill.  It would be better to await a greater debate on the matter and the issues it raises before tackling any problems that might appear to arise.  I am not saying that nothing should be done in regard to artificial insemination by donor.  My point is we need to have a much wider debate on this complicated subject and that is a matter for another day.  I am not alone in holding that viewpoint because the previous Government, which Deputy Shatter and Deputy Taylor supported, arrived at the same conclusion when they discussed this matter in Government at the time this Bill was being discussed.  That is the position.  Today is not the day to make a decision on this important matter. It is for another day and we can do it when the matter has been discussed more fully by a far greater number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed by the response of the Minister.  Deputy Harney and other Deputies were correct in referring to the fact that when this Bill was going through the Seanad something unusual happened for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  People did not thump the party political drum.  The previous <Col N="3711" /> Government were open and amenable to amendment.  There was a very constructive discussion in the Seanad which resulted in a much improved Bill coming from there to this House.  The legislation produced by any Government is limited by the skill and insight of the parliamentary draftsman and the improvements the previous Government saw fit to make in the Seanad were made because they listened to the constructive comments made by Senators.  The Minister who was steering it through, my colleague, Nuala Fennell, saw fit to take on board many of the proposals made for improving the Bill and so we have an improved measure.  That does not mean that the job of this Chamber has been fulfilled.  We have a duty also to tease out the provisions of the Bill, to improve it where it needs to be improved and to rectify omissions.  I was not privy to the deliberations that went on in Government, and I assume neither was Deputy Taylor, on the framing of the exact provisions of the Bill that first appeared in the Seanad.  It could very well be that this particular issue was an issue to which nobody directed their attention at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now a very serious issue.  The Minister has referred to matters of controversy such as surrogacy. This proposal has nothing to do with matters of controversy such as surrogacy. This proposal deliberately omits some of the more controversial areas that we could look at and which have received a great deal of publicity in other countries where in unusual circumstances or by the use of other medical techniques children have been conceived and born.  I have not heard in this country any great public outcry resulting from the fact that within Ireland there are Irish couples who are childless, who cannot adopt, who cannot conceive, for whom artificial insemination cannot work as between themselves and who have to resort to artificial insemination techniques by the use of a <Col N="3712" /> donor.  I have not heard any major public outcry about that.  It is something that has been in place in Ireland for some time and Irish couples have for many years before it was in place in Ireland were able to use such techniques or benefit from them outside Ireland and give birth to children.  Indeed there has been a lot of publicity in our national media on occasion where children have been conceived and born as a result of some of the new scientific techniques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how one can rationally extend the provisions of this Bill to adopted children in the way, of course, they should be and say that if the child is adopted the equality provisions will apply but if the child is actually conceived by one party to the marriage the equality provisions should not apply at all.  I also think the point needs to be made that there is nothing, for example, in our current law which prevents married couples from resorting to AID as a technique by which to have a child.  It is not illegal, not a criminal offence, not anything that our law in any way prohibits and indeed it is not anything I believe our law could constitutionally prohibit.  I would take it so far as to suggest that a child born to a married couple, having been conceived as a result of AID and to whom the equality provisions of this legislation were held not to apply, would be regarded as a child constitutionally discriminated against because there is no doubt that he would be regarded within the Constitution as a child born to a marital family and as part of that family.  That child would be in a different position constitutionally from the child born to someone outside wedlock.  This is a subject that the Law Reform Commission in 1972 did not address.  There are aspects of the areas that the Law Reform Commission referred to in their brief concluding remarks relating to this and a number of related issues which are a matter of great controversy.  In many countries around the world these are issues that have been the subject matter of a vast amount of religious, theological, philosophical, legal and sociological writings. They have been the subject matter <Col N="3713" /> of a great many reports and indeed some of those issues, at some stage, must be considered by this House and as a preliminary issue should be considered by a committee established, be it of this House or a mixture of this House and others.  These are controversial issues on which there is a diversity of opinion validly held on different sides.  For example, there is the issue of surrogacy on which I would expect that there would be a similar view among all the parties in this House.  That is clearly a separate issue about which I would expect most Irish people to have a similar view.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone in this House would support the idea of people being paid to conceive children and then handing them over as if in some sort of slave market.  That is not an issue that relates to this.  I know the Minister was talking generally but I regret that it should be seen in this light.  This is one very simple issue.  The simple question that arises here is, if a couple themselves cannot conceive and if they can, as they are free to do within our law, resort to AID in order for the wife to conceive and give birth to a child that both the husband and the wife wish to have as part of their family, is there any valid reason for suggesting that that child should in some way be treated differently, should be kept legally apart from the family, should be the subject of discrimination and placed in a sort of legal limbo that we choose to ignore because we do not want to make decisions on it?  This amendment was tabled so as to enable this House to look constructively at this issue.  I accept it is an issue that the Minister's officials may not have looked at in detail on this Bill. I do not know the extent to which this issue was addressed in the Seanad.  There were various other issues addressed which resulted in very good and constructive amendments being made to this measure.  The availability of this form of technique to allow people to conceive children is clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 14, 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>As announced in the budget, the Government have decided to extend the existing social insurance treatment benefits scheme to the dependent spouses of qualified insured persons from October 1987.  The extension embraces the entire treatment benefits scheme which includes dental and optical benefits and the provision of hearing aids.  I am pressing ahead with the necessary arrangements to ensure implementation by mid-October this year.</P>
      <P>Those newly qualified under the extension will include dependent spouses of PAYE workers and dependent spouses of insured unemployed, of disability benefit recipients and invalidity, retirement and old age contributory pensioners.  The extension is primarily aimed at providing the benefits of the scheme to wives working in the home.</P>
      <P>I recently met with representatives of the Irish Dental Association to discuss the implementation of the extension in relation to dental benefit.  In the course of the meeting I agreed that, in the context of the arrangements for the extension, a review could take place in order to consider if improvements could be made in the dental benefit scheme.  Arising from that meeting, I invited the Irish Dental Association to participate in discussions with officials of my Department to discuss possible improvements in the dental benefit scheme in the context of the October extension.  The association did not, as yet, take up that invitation.  It appears from their public statements that they have decided not to support the extension of dental benefit to dependent spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the social insurance <Col N="3716" /> dental benefit scheme, which has been in existence for a number of years is a scheme which provides a good service to the insured worker.  I accept that certain minor improvements could be considered and I agreed with the Irish Dental Association at our meeting that I and my officials would be available to meet them and to discuss such improvements.  I am, therefore, disappointed at the failure to date of the Irish Dental Association to co-operate in the extension and in the working out of improvements in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, who has responsibility for dental services provided by the health boards has also agreed to meet the Irish Dental Association shortly to discuss the services provided by the health boards.  These are separate from the services provided under the dental benefit scheme operated by my Department for insured persons.</P>
    <P>The implementation of my planned extension will involve revision of the formal agreement under which dentists contract to provide these services to eligible persons.  A new version of the agreement, providing for the inclusion of dependent spouses in the eligible category, is now virtually ready and will shortly be sent for signature to the dentists on the Department's panel.  Other dentists who are not on the Department's present panel may, of course, also apply to sign this agreement and thereby become members of the panel.  In the circumstances in which the Irish Dental Association has so far failed to co-operate in the extension to dependent spouses, I will shortly have no option but to send the new agreement to individual dentists for signature without further consultation with the association.  I would welcome the co-operation of dentists in the extension of dental benefit to so many women working at home who are not at present in a position to provide dental treatment for themselves.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I hope that the Irish Dental Association will agree soon to meet with myself or my officials to discuss potential improvements in the scheme. I, and my <Col N="3717" /> Department, are available for such discussions at any time at short notice and this will continue to be the position even after the new agreement has been issued to dentists generally.</P>
    <P>I also recently met representatives of the association of Optometrists, who represent the opticians, in order to discuss the extension in relation to optical benefit. That association have agreed fully with my proposals to extend optical benefit to the dependent spouses of insured workers.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate how many people will qualify under the extension of the scheme; the specific objections to the scheme by the Irish Dental Association and the steps being taken to ensure that the extension of the scheme, which I welcome, will not simply result in longer waiting lists and longer queues for women and children seeking optical and dental care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the scheme will result in shorter waiting lists in that those who are not entitled to benefit under the general scheme will now be entitled to benefit and, therefore, will not have to wait for approval from health boards. That element has not been referred to very often but it is a cross-over that will occur.  I should like to tell the Deputy that approximately 300,000 dependent spouses of insured workers will come into benefit.  With regard to his question about the specific objections of the Irish Dental Association, I suggest that it would be more appropriate for them to list their objections.  They have circulated their views.  They want a review of the two schemes together, that operated by the health board and this scheme.  In their circular they say they want priority given to certain categories such as the handicapped and children who come under the health board schemes.  They want any funds available allocated in that direction. That is a separate matter to the insurance scheme and I would like Members to be clear about that because it is being confused in the public mind for particular reasons.  When I said I was <Col N="3718" /> looking at improvements in the scheme I was referring to improvements in the social welfare dental benefit insurance scheme.  When they are talking about combining the two schemes they want it done in a way which would not be particularly advantageous to people on the social welfare insurance scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the niceties of the differentiation the Minister is making between the social schemes, and the health schemes, it would strike the ordinary citizen as peculiar that a priority which seeks to extend a scheme, which I welcome, at the same time is not making provision for dental benefit for handicapped children.  Is the Minister aware that due to the £500,000 cut back in the South-Eastern Health Board region that both the dental and optical benefits available under the GMS scheme are no longer in operation in the south-east?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What is being done in this scheme will lighten the burden at the health board end and this should improve the position.  As I listed in the early part of my reply, a large number of unemployed and their wives will benefit, the wives of old age pensioners will benefit and people on low incomes.  In the middle income group, the woman working in the home will also benefit and this is something most Deputies were anxious to see happening. We are talking about the PRSI insurance scheme and I am loath to see this put at a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the Irish Dental Association envisage the application of conditions to the award of dental benefit which would be broadly equivalent to <Col N="3719" /> those applying for eligibility to the GMS schemes.  I would be very concerned about that because that would exclude a number of people who are already covered by the insurance scheme.  This would have the result of reducing significantly the number of persons entitled to benefit and correspondingly increasing the numbers in the private dental practice areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that what was announced in the budget was the postponement until October of the introduction of a scheme which was to have been introduced in July? Would the Minister spell out how much spouses of insured workers will have to pay for extractions, fillings, cleaning and crowns, and in the other area, for spectacles and hearing aids?  It is important that people know what is involved.  Secondly, has the Minister made provision to deal with a flood of claims in the early days of the extension of this scheme?  I expect many of those who will be eligible are waiting to have their dental and optical treatment until this scheme is introduced.</P>

      <P>If I remember rightly, I think I set up this committee in 1981.  The Clinical Dentistry Treatment Scheduled Subcommittee have met on a number of occasions and agreed lists of treatments <Col N="3721" /> etc. which were sent to the Irish Dental Association for their views.  The committee have not received a response from them yet.  The second committee, the Admnistration Organisation Subcommittee, have also had several meetings and a number of documents prepared relating to eligibility, options, costings, administration and monitoring. These were discussed but no firm conclusions were reached.  In April 1985 the general secretary of the IDA undertook that his association would submit a document for discussion which would outline their views on eligibility.  The IDA have not done so yet.  That is where that review stands at the present.  Meanwhile, a decision has been taken in the House to extend the benefit to dependent spouses of insured workers.  I have a draft agreement ready and I will very shortly be in a position to circulate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 2 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3722" /> I would like to make it clear that Jobsearch is a programme of positive action to assist the long term unemployed in particular in their search for work.  It also ensures priority placement in Manpower schemes, in AnCO training schemes and in special Jobsearch courses operated by AnCO for a number of these.</P>
    <P>The initial interviews under the programme are conducted by the National Manpower Service placement officers. Distance from a course or placement, the skills and experience of the individual and particular financial circumstances are factors considered, <i>inter alia,</i> by the placement officer in assessing persons for placements.  Creche facilities are not provided by AnCO on any of their courses including Jobsearch courses.  The factors I have referred to would also be taken into account by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers in their examination of cases referred to them for review of entitlements under the Social Welfare Acts.  In reviewing any claim the general child care arrangements made in each particular case, which could include the use of creche facilities, are taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputy Kenny that there is no justification for feeling that the Jobsearch programme is either deliberately or inadvertently discriminatory against married women.  All married persons are eligible in the same way as any other unemployed persons for consideration under the Jobsearch programme and are treated similarly under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the intention of the scheme is not to create jobs or to train people to seek jobs but to drive people, by harassment and third degree type interviews, off the live register of the unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree, nor do I accept the Deputy's language in relation to officers in my Department or the Manpower Service.  There is no harassment and statutory rights are observed.  The scheme is designed to be of positive help <Col N="3723" /> and we have had many reports from individuals and groups telling us that they found it a positive help and who want the programme continued and extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said when announcing the scheme that those who would not co-operate would be dealt with by his Department.  This seems to mean that people who regard the course offered as unsuitable are reported to the Minister's Department, cut off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister directed the employees in his Department to cut off benefits to these people?  Can he tell the House how many people have been cut off as a result of the Jobsearch programme? Is a register being maintained of the areas where people are interviewed and employed through the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do Jobsearch officers get a list of jobs which are offered to interviewees?  It has been brought to my attention that the Manpower office do not have such a list in Dublin and I wonder how the Jobsearch people manage to get a long list of jobs including engineers, draftsmen and all sorts of professional jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is facetious.  He is trying to suggest that a list of jobs is not readily available.  The whole purpose of Jobsearch is to assist people to seek jobs themselves and to give facilities to those who have been unemployed for months or even years to look for employment.  It also arises in the next question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that interviews are conducted in privacy? Because of the complexity of the problems which his Department would like to address, is he aware that several interviews have lasted less than ten minutes?  Is he further aware that a short interview, in conditions of less than privacy and the failure to offer a specific developmental opportunity, has a massive psychologically depressing effect on those who are given a greater burden to carry than they had when they came for interview?  Are people told why they are knocked off the social welfare recipients' list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a whole series of questions.  The last is the subject of another question later relating to people who do not comply with the conditions required for payments of social welfare.  With regard to the short interview, of course it would be very satisfactory if more time could be made available for a comprehensive interview but it is to make an initial determination of a person's position and to offer placements on available jobs and on training courses or social employment schemes. That would not take a very long time; generally the time for interview was to be about 15 minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 3 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>To date over 36,000 people have been interviewed under the programme and 650 have found jobs directly as a result. Some 4,000 have been placed on employment schemes or programmes and over 2,000 have been placed on the Jobsearch course.  The benefits in improved employment prospects for those in training programmes, including the Jobsearch course, will be seen mainly in the medium term rather than the short term.  The initial effect of Jobsearch is to increase the confidence and motivation of the long term unemployed.  This has been borne out by a review of the pilot Jobsearch courses held in Letterkenny, Tallaght and Limerick.  The review indicated that over 80 per cent of those who attended found the course worth while and 76 per cent felt it improved their confidence.</P>
      <P>It is still too early to provide accurate estimates of the likely effect of the Jobsearch programme on the live register. However, apart from those placed in Manpower schemes and AnCO training courses, preliminary figures show that, arising from the programme, 187 were disallowed and a further 1,252 left the live register.  The 4,000 or so persons placed on Manpower schemes and AnCO training courses have also left the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the Jobsearch programme is concentrated on the long term unemployed and its main purpose is to be of personal assistance to those who are six months or more on the live register in their search for work.  It is, of course, recognised that in addition to some people being placed in employment and in Manpower and training schemes, an assessment of the needs of those on the live register will also result in others, who may not appear to satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlements under the Social Welfare Acts, having their entitlements reviewed.  Furthermore, a number may cease signing rather than face a review if they are aware that they do not satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlements under the Acts.  These are <Col N="3726" /> factors which would lead to some reduction in the live register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister's figures correctly, about 4 per cent of those interviewed have been disallowed or have ceased to sign on the live register.  Could the Minister extrapolate that for the entire register and tell us the cost of a 4 per cent overclaim of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a danger in taking these figures at this time.  I would advise Deputies against trying to make too many calculations based on them, the reason being that there is a time lag, of necessity, partly because of the way in which the claims are being handled and partly because of the individuals who might not turn up are being dealt with.  They are being given an opportunity to go back for another interview if this is considered necessary.  Consequently there is some time lag and the figures will not become very clear until later in the year.  For example, one can take the referrals to schemes and programmes, there being 7,415 who have been thus referred.  The figure I gave earlier was only for those actually placed.  Obviously more of those referred will be placed.  There have been 2,615 people referred to job vacancies but the figure I gave of 650 is the number that have been confirmed in job vacancies. That was up the middle of June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in the pipeline and at any point there will be more people coming along who have actually got jobs and more who have actually accepted placings.  The figures do not relate to one another.  We can tell the Deputies today the number interviewed because that is an absolture figure.  We cannot say the <Col N="3727" /> number who have taken placings or who have left the register because those who leave the register will not be known for some time.  One would want to be slightly careful about extrapolating too much from some of the initial data which is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider 650 jobs out of 36,000 for interviews as derisory, especially in view of the fact that those jobs would almost certainly have been filled without the Jobsearch programme?  In view of these very disappointing figures, does the Minister consider it worthwhile continuing with the Jobsearch programme?  Does he still believe it will have the achievements claimed for it when it was announced? Would he not agree with what Deputy Stagg said earlier, that this is just a programme to hunt people off the live register?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the House, 2,615 have been referred to job vacancies.  I appreciate that it is difficult to follow the way in which statistics work. There is a time lag in the reporting back from Manpower and from employers of the people who have actually accepted vacancies offered to them.  One would be leading oneself very far astray if one started doing the kind of extrapolation which the Deputy is doing at present.  The scheme is being handled in the interests of the long term unemployed and the figures will be clearer at a later stage.  The figure of 1,200 in respect of people who have left the live register is one which must be of interest to Deputies in the House.  The 650 people who have got the jobs so far are people from the long term unemployed who have been looking for jobs for a long time and they have got these jobs through the Jobsearch programme.</P>

If 1,252 persons have been removed from the live register, as the Minister has told the House, and 650 have gone to jobs, we are anxious to know what happened to the balance, the difference between 1,252 and 650. How many have actually left the country? Can the Minister tell the House whether the officers in charge of these interviews make inquiries as to the residence of the persons so that we can calculate the emigration effect of the Jobsearch programme?</P>

      <P>Deputy Stagg referred to a case with which he said I am familiar. I am aware of one case where a person went on the Jobsearch programme and then got a job in London.  The same person told me that it was a great inconvenience to come on the programme and he felt he was too highly qualified for that kind of programme.  After two weeks he phoned me to say that it was not such a bad idea after all because he found that there were people there with high qualifications who had never considered other things they might have approached.  They had some specialised training and had not considered management.  The tutors advised them and they found a niche for themselves in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3729" /> Another interesting thing that this gentleman told me was there were two people on his right at the programme who were working and drawing benefit all the time.  It was an education to him because he did not really think that this went on. There was another person on his left who had been eight years on unemployment and this was the first two weeks in that time that he had not been working.  I shall not mention the area in which he was working, although it was told to me.  This was the first two weeks in eight years that he had been so inconvenienced that he could not work.</P>

      <P>May I come back to my supplementary question which was not answered?  I am sure you will agree, Sir, that I am making an effort to avoid references to individual cases.  That is advice that the Minister might well take. If 1,252 people have gone off the register and 650 have been sent to jobs, of the remaining 602 people, the Minister's phrase, in answer to a previous supplementary, was that they do not turn up for a few weeks and the Minister then proceeded to give me a list of individual cases.  I asked a simple question.  Are procedures being taken in the offices to try to ascertain what happened to the other 602 people and will we be able to know the number of them that have emigrated?  That is the question which the House would like answered and it has nothing to do with individual cases.</P>

      <P>I explained that as far as possible.  We do not have an ocean of <Col N="3730" /> officers.  On other occasions the Deputy would challenge me and say that I was pursuing people.  We do surveys on these matters but it would be impossible to give the Deputy an answer because there are 246,000 people on the unemployment register and 80,000 people on disability benefit.  Some people will move from the unemployment register on to disability benefit and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is an indirect effect.  I have tried to explain that on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>The problem is that these statistics do not tally and it is difficult for the Minister to indicate what the figures include.  Will the Minister agree that there is nothing new in this, that the numbers who have got jobs are more or less the same as those who would get jobs in any case?  The numbers who emigrate are approximately twice the number who get jobs.  Will the Minister agree that the only new factor in this is the Jobsearch course?  Will the Minister agree that on these Jobsearch courses participants spend two weeks on how to write a CV and the following two weeks searching for jobs and that the whole operation is farcical and humiliating for both participants and AnCO personnel? Will the Minister agree that that is what happens on the four weeks Jobsearch courses?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can look at the figures afterwards and study what they mean.  There are 4,000 on the long term register of unemployed who were offered opportunities on social employment schemes and other manpower schemes who have accepted them to date. Many more will presumably accept these places and they have been reserved for them.  We will not have full information on the numbers who have left the register until later.  That figure will only emerge after a period.  Some people may leave the register for a short time and come back.  I have given the Deputies the number who have been disallowed to date.  Obviously more will be disallowed when they go through the process but the process of disallowance is lengthy as it ensures that individuals have a full right to be heard and to make their case and if their case is reasonable they are given other opportunities and they are not struck off.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Social Welfare Payments.</Title>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare as social welfare payments in Ireland are only 70 per cent of the average payments in other EC countries, the steps, if any, the Government are taking to provide the other 30 per cent; if this will be part of the Single European Act; if the EC will insist on the Irish social recipient being paid at least the equal of EC payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Treaty of Rome nor the Single European Act contain any provisions which oblige member states of the EC to provide similar social security schemes or the same level of payments under those schemes.  As far as social security is concerned, Article 51 of the Treaty of Rome provides for the protection and maintenance of the social security entitlements of workers moving from one member state to another.</P>
      <P>The EC regulations are co-ordinating measures which enable a worker's employment record as determined by national legislation to be maintained by aggregating periods of employment in various member states for the purpose of retaining rights to benefit and which also lay down procedures for determining the national institutions liable for payment of benefits.  The regulations do not have any provisions for deciding the level of benefits. This is entirely a matter for the individual member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy has possibly misinterpreted a statement in my reply last month to a question on the level of poverty in this country and, in particular, how that level compares with the levels of poverty in other EC countries.  In that reply I stated that Ireland's gross domestic product per head at present stands at around 70.7 per cent of the EC average, and so inevitably the general standard of living of all sections of the <Col N="3733" /> population in Ireland is bound to be significantly below the standard of living in most of the other EC countries.</P>
    <P>As our general standard of living is lower, the actual level of social welfare payments which we can afford to provide is also lower.  A more significant basis for comparison with other EC countries would be the degree of redistribution, in the form of social protection sevices, to the weaker sections of the community.  In this regard in 1983 the percentage of GDP devoted to social protection in Ireland was 23.9 per cent just 4 per cent below the average for the 9 EC countries, excluding Greece, Spain and Portugal for whom information is not available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agrees that our standard of living is 70.7 per cent of the European average therefore our social welfare provision has to fall below that level and then he introduces the notion of social protection which is really dealing with the most distressed category. Will the Minister acknowledge that the thrust of this question was to ask whether we would use the opportunity of having a non-tariff Europe, an integrated market, to significantly redistribute resources so as to give more to those in receipt of social welfare as was promised so often and in such a shrill way during the campaign on the SEA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations in this area had no provisions for deciding the levels of benefit.  It relates to the continuity of benefits and to the transferability of benefits between countries.  Neither the Treaty of Rome nor the Single European Act contain such measures, desirable as they would be.  I agree with the Deputy in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clearly understood, therefore from the Minister's reply that there is a legal inhibition following our adoption of the Single European Act on the placing of tariffs but there is no legal obligation for advantages in social welfare of a redistributive kind or, as it will transpire in the autumn, any legal <Col N="3734" /> obligations to have any redistributed regional funds.  That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of families in receipt of family income supplement at the latest date for which figures are available; if, in view of the relatively small numbers who have taken advantage of this, he will consider the possibility of the Revenue Commissioners being asked to circulate information on the scheme to married wage earners in the relevant income brackets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15 June 1987 there were 5,662 families in receipt of family income supplement.  Family income supplement is payable to families with one or more children and the rate is determined by the claimant's family income in the period immediately prior to the date of the claim.  The most recent earnings records available to the Revenue Commissioners at any time would be in respect of the last complete tax year and as no information would be available regarding changes of circumstances in the meantime this data would not be suitable for identifying potential FIS beneficiaries. Furthermore, since the tax allowance for dependent children was abolished, the Revenue Commissioners have no means of distinguishing between families with children and without children.  Consequently, it would serve no useful purpose for the Revenue Commissioners to circulate information on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent budget a considerable improvement was made to the scheme <Col N="3735" /> when the calculation of the amount payable was increased from one-third to one-half of the differences between the gross family income and the prescribed upper limit.  Also, the maximum amount payable in respect of family size has been increased.  A family with three children will now receive a maximum supplement of £30 per week as against £18 per week prior to the budget changes.  Similarly, a family with five children will receive £44 per week as compared with £26.  These improvements will take effect from 23 July next.</P>
    <P>Previous attempts at general advertising have not been particularly successful. For this reason I am considering measures aimed at providing the necessary information more directly to families likely to benefit from the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that this measure was brought in for poorer families, those on very low wages at the time the food subsidies were abolished, in order to supplement their incomes so that they would be capable of living and be able to buy food for their families.  Is it not true that the figure of 5,662 people who are availing of this benefit is much less than what is considered to be the number who are eligible for it?  The Minister pointed out the difficulties of finding out how many children people have.  My question does not relate to the number of children because that can be assessed very easily. It refers to the people who on the basis of their incomes would be eligible for this benefit.  There are people on incomes of £50, £60 and £70 a week who have up to five children.  Surely the Minister should be able to assess the number of people who earn these low wages and who possibly would be eligible for this benefit.  The people who are least able to afford this loss are the ones who know least about the scheme.  They are on low wages and in non-union jobs and there is nobody there to tell them about this scheme.  It is up to the Minister to find them and I would like to ask him if he has any scheme for doing that.</P>

      <P>The question related to the possibility of the Revenue Commissioners being asked to circulate information on the scheme to married wage earners, obviously directed towards the people Deputy Mac Giolla has in mind. However, that is not feasible.  I am trying to find ways of getting to those people but it is quite difficult.  Obviously generalised advertising is not working.  I am trying to target it more towards the people who would and should benefit from the scheme.  Whether any other factor is involved is another question.  I assure the Deputies that I will be giving attention to targeting the information to the people who would benefit most from it.  One of the possibilities is to use the child benefit scheme as a means of directing the information to the people who would benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course persons who are disqualified from receipt of social welfare payments for any reason are fully informed of the decision, and of the reasons behind the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, investigations of irregularities are carried out by social welfare officers who report the results of the investigation to a deciding officer.  That officer bases his decision on all the facts before him, including the social welfare officer's report, and any response from the claimant to the nature of the evidence against him.  Any decision to withdraw or reduce payment is then notified to the claimant in writing and the reasons for <Col N="3737" /> the decision are given in that written notice.  The claimant is also advised of his right of appeal.</P>
    <P>It may sometimes happen that payment may have to be temporarily suspended without notification where the claimant cannot be contacted because he is no longer residing at his notified address or he may be avoiding the investigating officer.  Formal notification of disallowance in cases such as these would have to be delayed until the claimant reestablishes contact with the Department.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular cases in mind which are causing him concern and would care to furnish my office with the relevant details, I will have them examined and communicate with him as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the advice of the Minister.  I want to ask him if he is satisfied as to the form of interview which leads to the disqualification.  I understand the appeals procedure is there to serve as just that &mdash; if a person is unhappy with the decision that has been taken he may adduce new information. Would the Minister not agree that in preparing for the appeal the fact that the person disqualified has not been furnished with the reasons for disqualification is a serious disability and it affects the appeal?  A practical example of this is where an individual who is unemployed for a long time through no fault of his own and who has not refused any offer of work is cut off from benefit and told he has the right to appeal.  If he has been given no grounds for his disqualification, how can he structure the appeal?  Will the Minister not agree it would be much better to state to the individual concerned the reasons for the disqualification?</P>

    <P>The deseasonalised average number over the period January to May 1987 was 247,540 compared with the projected average for the year of 241,000 on which the Revised Published Estimate was framed.</P>
    <P>The live register projection for the year has not been revised pending an assessment of the likely impact of the Jobsearch programme and of the Government's programme for national recovery.</P>
    <P>As regards cost, it is considered that the 1987 provision for unemployment payments will be adequate even in the event of some slippage in the live register projection, due to changes in the structure of the Live Register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the figures for the first five months of the year means that unemployment is running at 6,540 above projection.  He also says that he can meet the payments for these out of the estimates provision. Can the Minister tell us how he can perform that three card trick?  Would he not accept that there is not adequate provision in the Estimates and they are phoney?</P>

      <P>This is the information which is supplied to me by the experts who calculate these figures, year in year out.  The Deputy may not have heard the second part of my reply which related to the cost.  It considered that the 1987 provision for unemployment payments will be adequate even in the event of some slippage in the live register projection, due to changes in the structure of the live register.  The changes in the structure of the live register are the cost per head which is related more to such factors as the number of single people as against the number of married people and the number of dependants involved.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Government's claims of priority for employment are now hollow given that unemployment is now running at 6,540 per month over that provided for in their Estimates when excessive claims were made about what they were going to do about unemployment?  Is it not also true that the net effect of what the Minister said is that those on unemployment will be getting less money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The individuals will still get the same rate of unemployment payment.  As the Deputy will realise they will get an increase from July instead of from November.  There are changes in the structure of the register and these relate particularly to the number of single people claiming, without dependants, as distinct from the estimated numbers based on higher numbers of families with dependants which obviously will involve more cost.  This is one of the structural factors.  That is the reality in relation to the cost and expenditure element.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me for being sceptical.  When the end of year figures come out we will see if the Minister has misled the House. What we do know is that despite the hunting of people off the Jobsearch programme for which the Minister has given figures, there are still 6,540 more people unemployed per month than has been provided for in the estimates which is a grossly high figure.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me whether he will now accept that the Government's employment policies are disastrous and whether he would now stop forcing people on to the unemployment register in the education and health spheres.</P>

The present Government's plan for a national recovery could not have a major <Col N="3742" /> effect on the register until this time forward. Naturally that is an element which will have to be taken into consideration in any estimation of the figures from here forward.

      <P>Work on this project commenced in August 1986 and is being carried out in various phases.  I expect that all work on the current phase will be completed by early September and the final report will be available shortly afterwards.</P>
      <P>The consultants were commissioned to examine the major payment systems in my Department with a view to establishing where they are most at risk and to advise on the best cost-effective measures to keep these risks to a minimum.  The project covers all aspects of the schemes and the intention is to eliminate waste or abuse of any sort from the system.</P>
      <P>An interim report on disability benefit has been received from the consultants, but the final report will not be available until autumn.  The interim report contains a series of recommendations on policy issues, organisational matters, procedural controls and systems development. The interim report recommends for consideration, the transfer of responsibility for the issue of revenue and social insurance numbers, from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department, to strengthen control procedures. It also recommends that the payment of disability benefit by employers be actively considered, as the consultants considered such a transfer would be a more efficient means of paying sickness benefit.</P>
      <P>There is as yet insufficient evidence to justify any conclusion regarding the level of abuse in the disability benefit and unemployment payment systems. However, on the strict application of the legisaltive requirement for &ldquo;availability&rdquo; and &ldquo;genuinely seeking work&rdquo; it was found in a preliminary sample survey that claims for unemployment payments contained some element of fraud or abuse.</P>
      <P>Some of these persons may be among those who are currently signing off the register when invited to participate in the national Jobsearch programme introduced following this year's budget.</P>

    <P>As regards publication of the report, it may not be appropriate to publish it in view of the confidential nature of its subject matter as publication might prejudice the ongoing work of the Department.  This is a matter, however, on which I obviously cannot give a decision until I have received the report and had time to consider its implications.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,998,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1987, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach, including certain cultural and archival activities and for payment of certain grants-in-aid. </P>
      <P>It is necessary that I should avail of this debate to give the Dáil and the general public a progress report on the Government's performance since we assumed office in March last.</P>
      <P>Even before I came into office I had been able, by courtesy of the out-going Taoiseach, to receive a comprehensive briefing on the state of the economy and the public finances.  The story that unfolded then and subsequently was an intimidating one and the state of the public finances was clearly a cause of deepest concern.  Worse still, the general state of the economy was such that there was no immediate prospect of increased economic growth providing additional resources to help solve the problem.</P>
      <P>By the beginning of this year the country's national debt had risen to £25 billion and was continuing to rise steadily and inexorably.  We were heading in 1987 for the addition to the debt of still another £2 billion.  This process of going further and further into debt could not continue without threatening the future viability of the State.  Action could not be postponed. The realities had to be confronted. I would like to emphasise as strongly as I can that this was not a matter about which there was room for debate or disagreement.  There was no scope for compromise or temporising.  Remedial action of a major kind was urgently required.  It is not legitimate for any Deputy in this House to deny that reality; to try and gloss over the stark facts of the situation, to suggest there was some alternative or that we could simply go on as we were.  We could not.</P>
      <P>A few key figures give the picture clearly.</P>
      <P>In this year almost one-third of all tax revenue will have to go to service the public debt.</P>
      <P>In this year after all the cuts that have been imposed the State will still borrow over £1.8 billion.  That is not much less than the cost of servicing the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now essential in the national interest that Government action succeed in continuing to reduce the current budget deficit and that within a limited period the national debt should not rise any further relative to GNP.  If we are to achieve this, the total level of Exchequer borrowing for all purposes in any year should not exceed and preferably should be less than the total of estimated growth plus inflation, in other words nominal growth in GNP.  In this year growth is conservatively estimated at 1 per cent and inflation at 3 per cent.  Exchequer <Col N="3827" /> borrowing therefore needs to be reduced to less than 5 per cent.  In fact in this year it will be 10.7 per cent.  These figures clearly show that we have a long way to go to get on top of the problem.</P>
    <P>This Government have firmly set for themselves the following policy objectives which are interdependent and related to each other: to restore the public finances by reducing overall Government expenditure; to reduce Government borrowing and to stabilise and then reduce the growth of the national debt as a percentage of GNP; to restore confidence, bring down interest rates and maintain the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS; to stimulate and encourage economic growth, investment and employment in every possible sector of productive activity; to reduce the overall burden of taxation and in particular the level of direct personal taxation, and to reform the tax system to make it more equitable and to improve the cost-effectiveness and equity of our social services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first objective, the Government in formulating and implementing this year's budget had by force of circumstances to resort to the process of reducing Government expenditure right across the board, coming down more heavily on those areas which accounted for the greatest level of expenditure. There was no alternative to that approach.  Having been compelled, however, by the urgency of the situation to start the process of corrective action in the budget we proceeded immediately afterwards to set about tackling Government expenditure in a much more thorough and selective manner.  All expenditure is now being examined thoroughly and in detail during the remainder of this year.  In this way we hope to achieve further reductions in expenditure during the current year.  But the primary purpose of the exercise is to enable us, well in advance of 1988, to have taken decisions on a prudent and realistic basis on the estimates of expenditure for 1988.  This will represent a significant improvement in the <Col N="3828" /> administration of our financial affairs.  A high level committee in the Department of Finance are now undertaking this task with the full co-operation of the accounting officers in all the different Departments of State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stimulation of economic activity, I would like to refer Deputies to the comprehensive <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which Fianna Fáil published in advance of the last general election.  In that programme we gave an outline of specific measures which we intended to take in each different sector of the economy.  Since assuming office we have been following through on that programme in all the areas outlined.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxation it is obvious that the current state of the public finances has allowed little immediate scope for reductions in taxation.  However we are quite clear in our minds that two things are essential to get economic growth under way again, firstly a reduction in interest rates and, secondly, a reduction in personal taxation.  If we can succeed in our efforts in getting public expenditure down to a sustainable level it should be possible for us to start looking realistically at reductions in taxation.</P>
    <P>The budget introduced by the Minister for Finance in March is central to our approach.  The limits set for expenditure and borrowing are fundamental to our policy.  The discipline imposed by these targets is being and must be adhered to. Circumstances this year do not allow any room for slippage.  Budget limits are being carefully monitored.  So far, the signs are that the targets will be met, but the balance is a fragile one, and, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, if further action is required it will have to be taken.  I believe that the firm action we have taken and the discipline we have imposed is receiving widespread support. The belief that there is now leadership and control is bringing back confidence. One beneficial result is that the disastrous outflow of funds from our economy has been reversed.</P>
    <P>The high interest rates of recent years have been preventing investment and inhibiting the growth we need to provide <Col N="3829" /> jobs.  Of course, further downward movement will be strongly influenced by the trend in international rates as well as by the extent to which confidence at home builds up in our ability to solve our problems. This confidence in turn depends on our success in curtailing and reducing Government spending and borrowing. We have made a start.  Current Government expenditure had climbed in 1986 to 56.2 per cent of GNP.  This year it will be reduced to 55 per cent of GNP and that process must be continued.  There is no other way.  For too long we have been living at a rate we cannot afford, enjoying a standard of living we were not earning by our own efforts.  Until the time comes when we can generate greater growth in the Irish economy we must reduce State spending right down to the actual level of resources available.</P>
    <P>The whole tradition of Fianna Fáil Governments back to the early thirties is one of active intervention to promote economic and social development in accordance with the resources available. Since the late fifties much progress was achieved on the basis of economic plans or programmes, with increasing involvement and participation by the social partners. The philosophy behind <i>The Way Forward</i>, the reduction of Government borrowing to a sustainable level on the one hand and active sectoral development policies on the other remain at the basis of Fianna Fáil policy and was at the heart of our <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Substantial reductions in current expenditure were recognised as necessary by the last Fianna Fáil Government in <i>The Way Forward</i> in 1982.  The Coalition Government in 1983 took the wrong turning.  They relied instead on massive increases in taxation in an attempt to avoid the necessity of expenditure reductions.  We criticised this in Opposition. We also criticised the one-sided emphasis on the public finances which was not accompanied by any serious effort to promote economic development.</P>
    <P>The principal initiatives we are now taking as a Government are based on the <Col N="3830" /> policies we elaborated in Opposition and which we put before the electorate in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which took into account the circumstances in which this country found itself at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1985 I promised in my Árd Fheis speech to bring forward a major programme of national economic recovery.  Many of the important policy initiatives we are now implementing, the setting up of the Department of the Marine, a science policy for development with a Minister of State in charge, a horticultural development board, a Department of Agriculture and Food to build up a food processing industry, were first announced by me at successive Árd Fheiseanna in the years 1984-86 and in many cases were later elaborated in full-scale party policy documents.</P>
    <P>At the Fianna Fáil business conference on 18 January 1987, before the election, I set out our policy for the public finances. I stated:</P>
    <P>We see the level of interest rates as of crucial importance to our central programme of economic recovery... There is no doubt that the persistently high current budget deficits which the Coalition has incurred are a major factor in causing the present high level of interest rates. </P>
    <P>In the stringent financial framework set out at the front of our programme we were the first political party ever to place a firm ceiling on Government expenditure, and we committed ourselves both to the progressive reduction of the current budget deficit and the slowing down and halting of the growth of the national debt-GNP ratio in line with the NESC report of last autumn.  At the press conference to launch our election programme I stated that the estimates for every area of public expenditure would be examined rigorously and in detail &ldquo;and reduced to the irreducible minimum&rdquo;. We made no spending promises, and made it very clear that there could be no question of increased net public expenditure. The approach we have adopted as a Government is, therefore, firmly based <Col N="3831" /> on our published election <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which summed up all we had argued for in Opposition.</P>
    <P>That approach has as its other aim positive and determined action to stimulate growth and investment in every sector of the economy that offers scope for development.  Development in all such areas is the positive corollary to financial discipline.  It is vitally important that the dynamism and ability in all sectors in the Irish economy be harnessed to produce growth and jobs.  The Government are at present engaged in incorporating this approach in a medium term economic programme designed to tackle the problems and develop the opportunities.</P>
    <P>In formulating this medium term programme we have decided to seek a realistic consensus with the social partners and to avail fully of their expert knowledge and experience in the preparation of the plan.  The NESC study on <i>A Strategy for Development</i> provides the basic framework for this work.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a constructive dialogue with the social partners representing the main economic and social interests in our community, with a view to developing a programme for national recovery has been one of the most important endeavours of this Government.  As stated in our election manifesto, a consensus with the social partners is in our view an essential element in planning economic development.  Such consensus is all the more important in the face of the acute economic and social problems we face, problems probably unprecedented in the history of the State and problems whose gravity few other countries in the Community face.  The appalling level of unemployment &mdash; almost the highest in the European Community &mdash; must, alone, unite us all in a major combined effort to put our nation back on the road to economic and social recovery. In fact this kind of spirit exists among all the social partners.  The social partners, through the National Economic and Social Council, had already by an exceptional and determined effort, agreed on <Col N="3832" /> the principles of a strategy for national recovery.  The Government have accepted the broad thrust of those principles and the process we are now engaged in is to turn these principles into a practical detailed programme of decisive action by the nation as a whole over the next three to five years.</P>
    <P>A special impetus has been given to the discussions by a request from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Government to prepare, through discussions and consultations, a development programme which would balance the various requirements for economic growth and social justice in a fair and equitable way and which would launch a new period of economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Working groups have been established on employment and development measures, taxation, social policies, and the environment for industry, agriculture and construction.  These groups will examine proposals tabled by the social partners and by Government and will bring forward agreed proposals for policy initiatives which can be incorporated into our <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>No programme of national recovery can be easy which tries to tackle the fundamental causes of the lack of growth in the economy and to bring order and stability to our public finances and to bring about a better and fairer distribution of the resources and the opportunities in our society.  It is clear that the social partners understand the difficulties and are prepared to examine and discuss, in the interests of all, how Government and social partners together can formulate such a programme.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the medium-term programme are fourfold, covering macro-economic policy; development of the economy with particular reference to new employment; tax reform and tax equity; and reform of our social policies. These four elements are interdependent and interactive and the programme will contain specific measures and commitments in regard to each element.</P>
    <P>As regards macro-economic policies, we must succeed within the time-span of <Col N="3833" /> the programme, in first stabilising and then reducing the GNP-national debt ratio.  Otherwise interest on the national debt will continue to grow, as it has been doing, at a pace which consumes an ever-increasing share of our resources.</P>
    <P>Unless we halt that process, we will have less resources each year to spend on new activity.  The corrective process will not be painless.  We, and the social partners, consider, however, that such a corrective process alone is not sufficient and needs to be accompanied by measures to bring about greater growth in the economy and in employment.  In fact, such measures will also contribute to restoring the public finances.  The more people we can put back to work by our development measures, the more tourists and exports we can generate, the faster the economy will grow and generate greater buoyancy of revenue even at lower tax rates.  By bringing about a better balance in the public finances we will also bring down interest rates which in turn will reduce the burden of the public debt service.</P>
    <P>Our macro-economic policy also envisages maintaining the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS.  This stability will also help to reverse last year's outflow of funds.  This will increase the liquidity of the money markets here, again helping to bring interest rates down.</P>
    <P>These macro-economic policies are already working.  Interest rates have come down and the haemorrhage of funds out of the country has been effectively reversed.  I would recall in this context what we said in our election manifesto &mdash;&ldquo;A major priority will be to use all policy instruments at the Government's disposal to reduce the level of interest rates so as to encourage investment. In this context Fianna Fáil will seek by establishing trust and confidence in Government policy and intentions to attract back funds that have gone abroad recently&rdquo;.  That has been happening.</P>
    <P>Inflation is now down to its lowest level in 20 years, and has dropped below 3 per cent per annum.  Only excise duty increases and other price increases imposed at the beginning of the year have prevented it from being much lower still. <Col N="3834" /> This year's budget with its emphasis on expenditure reductions instead of tax increases has contributed to this low rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate is now lower than in most OECD countries.  Inflation is around 4 per cent in Britain, the United States and Italy and at over 3 per cent in France.  There is no inherent reason why we cannot bring inflation down close to zero, as is the case in Germany, Japan and Switzerland.  Our level of inflation can no longer be used as an excuse for lack of competitiveness.  Our present low rate helps to underpin the stability of the Irish pound exchange rate, and should help regain some competitive edge.  It is helpful also for those on social welfare who will be getting a 3 per cent increase next month.</P>
    <P>An inflation rate of under 3 per cent is something very valuable and important. It is of significance for those involved in wage negotiations or arbitration.  It fully justifies the firm guidelines on pay which the Government will be strictly adhering to.  We must aim at a situation where annual pay negotiations to compensate for inflation are no longer necessary, and where pay increases come from improved productivity and result in real income increases.</P>
    <P>In the public service many employees received substantial annual increments of between 2½ and 4 per cent.  We will not succeed in containing public expenditure as long as the public service pay bill, which is £2.8 billion this year, in spite of restrictions on numbers, continues to increase by several points more than inflation, as has happened in these last three years.  Agreements this year concluded by the previous Government have been honoured by us but we cannot again permit the public service pay bill to increase by double the rate of inflation as it did this year.</P>
    <P>It has been a notable failure of industrial policy to date that it has not succeeded in developing our indigenous manufacturing companies particularly those using our own raw materials.  All the other small countries of Europe have <Col N="3835" /> been able to develop their own manufacturing capacity, as distinct from the valuable input from overseas investment. So much so that it is clear that our manufacturing sector is significantly smaller that it should be if we were to succeed, as they have, in developing our own resources and abilities.  We believe that Ireland has the skills, the raw materials and the ability to develop much further its own domestic-based manufacturing capacity and our industrial policy must be directed to that end.  State support must be concentrated on the Irish companies that have a clear potential to increase exports and employment.  The development of our horticultural, forestry and marine resources which are now under way are other examples of this basic policy orientation and, what is more important, of the capacity and the determination of the Government to put it into action.</P>
    <P>The whole strategy for industrial development, the institutional arrangements for industrial development and the thrust and effectiveness of industrial policy are being reviewed.  Detailed discussions with the IDA are taking place. We have had many notable successes in terms of industries brought into this country. We have also had some major failures, and we must learn the lessons taught by both the successes and the failures.</P>
    <P>When all the existing grants and tax incentives are added together the overall annual cost to the State is a formidable figure and it must be acknowledged that the matching results particularly in recent years have been fairly disappointing.  On the other hand, it must also be realised that the international scene in this regard has changed dramatically.  The competition for mobile international investment between countries is now intense and other European countries and even individual cities are offering very attractive packages.  The IDA are now paying close attention to the Far Eastern market, to which resources have been reallocated where important opportunities are now seen to be arising.</P>
    <P>However, it is very encouraging that <Col N="3836" /> the first major industrial project to be approved by this Government, and the first large project to come along for some time has been launched by an Irish firm and is based on the produce of Irish farmers. I refer to the decision of the Goodman Group to invest £260 million in new meat-processing facilities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The underdeveloped state of our food processing industry has been apparent for quite some time.  In the early days of EC membership the continuous price increases and availability of intervention storage meant there was no great pressure to develop more sophisticated food products.  The main emphasis was on increased production.  Recent trends in the CAP have made it very clear that this heavy reliance on intervention must end and that we must process our agricultural produce into quality foodstuffs and find markets for them.</P>
    <P>In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we stated that Fianna Fáil would lead a market-driven approach to food-production, creating new opportunities for adding value.  We outlined our plan to integrate the entire agricultural and food sectors so that we can quickly adapt to changing patterns of consumer demand, and we expressed our ambition to make Ireland, &ldquo;a quality food producer of international importance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Government we have taken the necessary action in accordance with that concept.  The Department of Agriculture have been expanded into the Department of Agriculture and Food and a Minister of State appointed with special responsibility to fully develop the potential of the food processing sector.  The new Goodman project involves an investment in our beef industry of £260 million in 11 centres around the country and covers all the main regions.  It is the intention of the promoters to put our beef into world retail outlets as the premium market leader.  The grass-based methods of cattle production used here, the quality of our environment are factors we can capitalise on, by producing meat to the highest technical standards.  It is an early and welcome sign of that return of confidence <Col N="3837" /> which is needed for investment to start again.</P>
    <P>We have identified the financial services sector as an area where we have advantages.  Those countries in Europe which have made conscious efforts to develop their financial services industry have seen a major return in terms of jobs and economic activity.  We have the necessary ingredients in Dublin for a financial services centre &mdash; a prime city site in the Custom House Docks, an educated computer-literate young work-force, a favourable time zone location, and an excellent telecommunications system of international standard.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the development of the Dublin Financial Services Centre has been entrusted to a top-level committee representative of the financial services industry, the IDA and CTT.  A special unit to market the centre has been set up in the IDA.  The passage of this year's Finance Bill will put in place a package of incentives.  It is now clear from the level of inquiries we have received, both from domestic and international interests, that the demand to locate at the centre will be such that we may have to enlarge and extend it.</P>
    <P>This kind of illustration of this Government's capacity to make decisions and to implement them quickly and effectively is beginning to restore confidence in the management of the economy among the business community at large and to generate new investment and new business initiatives and enterprise generally.</P>
    <P>On another front we took swift and effective action to stop the abuse of the cross-Border travellers allowances.  Some £300 million annually was leaking out of our economy in artificial travel generated by these travellers allowances.  Our view was very simple and sensible.  It was unacceptable that these allowances should be allowed to cause a distortion of normal trade.  That this trade was entirely artificial and generated solely by the travellers allowances &mdash; which should properly be only a concession for normal travel &mdash; is proved by the fact that day shopping expeditions have now virtually ceased.  The economic importance of the <Col N="3838" /> measures we took is self-evident and highlights the determination of the Government to get to grips with problems and solve them.</P>
    <P>Export performance so far this year has been strong.  A 5 per cent growth for 1987 is now being forecast, compared with very weak growth in 1986.  Last month for the first time ever Irish exports exceeded £1 billion.  Because economic growth must be export driven however we are concentrating on improving our export performance still further. The new export trading houses which are being encouraged by tax incentives are designed to help small firms to export which do not have the resources or the expertise themselves.  Nearly all the development measures we are initiating, in financial services, forestry, food-processing, horticulture are export-orientated.</P>
    <P>We must constantly try to improve industrial relations.  A bad industrial relations situation in an area or an industry kills investment in that area or sector. It is tragic to see a town or locality devastated by the closure of a thriving business or factory because of some dispute that goodwill and commonsense could have resolved.  Jobs today are too precious to be gambled with.  Everyone, on the factory floor, in the office, in the boardroom must face the realities of the fiercely competitive world we live in today.</P>
    <P>We regard the semi-State sector as providing an important strategic resource for growth and development of the economy. We will restore to the State companies their role as development corporations.  I have already met the chief executives of all State-sponsored bodies and I would comment that they, together with their colleagues in each agency, constitute a formidable bank of talent, ability and expertise.  We propose to harness these resources as part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> now being elaborated with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies, therefore, have been asked to submit to their relevant Ministers by end-August any <Col N="3839" /> development proposals they could undertake which would increase employment and earnings.  These will be considered in the context of the programme.  Where legislative changes are necessary to enable such development proposals to be undertaken, consideration will also be given to these.</P>
    <P>The corporate plans of State-sponsored bodies will be given a new focus so as to ensure that these plans become the basis for constructive dialogue on policy and development between the bodies and their parent Government Departments. I propose to continue with these meetings so as to ensure that the full potential of the semi-State sector can be realised, their difficulties understood and any obstacles to their full contribution to the economy removed.</P>
    <P>Our failure to date to develop and implement a full-scale science and technology policy has been a serious deficiency in our economic development strategy.  It greatly inhibited investment in industry in particular.  This Government are determined to make good that defect.</P>
    <P>We need innovation, new products, applied research.  Science and technology must be consistently applied to natural resources, to produce new marketable products; third level institutions must be brought into an increasingly close working relationship with industry.  Spending on science and technology and on research up to now has been spread over a number of different Departments and agencies.  To ensure a new kind of central direction and co-ordination we now have a Minister with special responsibility for this area.  We have provided him with a budget of £2.5 million for the remainder of this year by re-allocating funds within the Department of Industry and Commerce. This modest budget has been prudently allocated to endeavour to get the best return and includes the key areas of bio-technology and micro-electronics.  I recognise this is only a modest beginning, but it is our intention that the science budget should be a permanent feature from now on.  The whole area of science <Col N="3840" /> and technology will occupy a central role in our plans for economic development. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> identified our national resources as a major source of development.</P>
    <P>We are putting a new emphasis on horticultural development, an industry which is labour-intensive, and which is far too import-dominated at present.  Following on the appointment of a Minister of State an interim non-statutory board, An Bord Glas has been set up, which will help to organise the industry.  The decision to extend the gas pipeline through north Dublin to Drogheda and Dundalk will be of great assistance to the horticultural industry in that catchment area.  Our target is to replace £37 million of imports and to generate £23 million in exports, which should create significant additional jobs.</P>
    <P>We plan to greatly expand production from our forests and to increase planting levels.  The Government have decided to set up a semi-State body on the lines of An Bord Post and Telecom Éireann to manage our forests along fully commercial lines, and legislation will be introduced in the autumn session.  There is enormous potential in forestry for import substitution, for exports to the rest of Europe for the foreseeable future and for further development in wood-processing. Our aim would be to increase employment in forestry and timber processing by several thousand between now and the end of the century.  Ireland has very real natural advantages, in particular, space and climate, we have the fastest growing trees in Europe, and there is a market for everything we can produce.  The aim of this Government is to give the whole sector a new commercial dynamic.  This year State and private planting will reach an all-time record of 11,000 hectares, 1,000 hectares in excess of the target set out in our election document, <i>Forestry &mdash; A Programme for Development.</i></P>
    <P>Another area to which we propose to give a new priority is our marine resources.  In accordance with our 1985 policy document a new Department of the Marine has been set up, and we are actively planning the setting up of a <Col N="3841" /> Marine Research Institute.  The wealth potential off our coasts has never been properly exploited.  We envisage a major expansion in mariculture to enable Ireland to catch up on our principal competitors.</P>
    <P>The Government will endeavour to have the question of Ireland's quotas reopened at Community level.  I am particularly disturbed by parliamentary evidence that fishermen of one member state of longstanding have been over-fishing their quotas with Government connivance both in Irish waters and elsewhere, and that false returns have been made to Brussels.  The implications of this and any appropriate action will have to be considered carefully.</P>
    <P>Ireland was left in a vulnerable situation following the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  To help re-establish an Irish shipping fleet we have extended the business expansion scheme and the 10 per cent corporation tax rate to the shipping industry.</P>
    <P>We have authorised the extension of the natural gas pipeline from Dublin to Dundalk.  As part of the Valoren Programme adopted by the EC we have approved a number of important peat development projects in the midlands and west, as well as a number of small hydro-electricity schemes.  No contribution that can be made by our natural resources, however modest, to an economic development, should or will be neglected.</P>
    <P>The Government are also concerned about the price of energy, especially electricity and oil products, which is higher than in most other European countries. The agreement recently entered into between the management and the work-force in the ESB, for instance, contained a range of measures to improve productivity. The Government wish to see these implemented and translated as soon as possible into lower prices for the consumer.</P>
    <P>1987 will, I believe, achieve a major breakthrough for Irish tourism.  The industry has now been given the priority which its enormous potential warrants. International tourist travel is expanding <Col N="3842" /> rapidly.  West Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and France are in that order the most important countries of origin of international tourism in terms of the total number of nights spent abroad.  Because of our links with the United States and our geographic location we are in a strong position to exploit these markets.  For some time, however, we have not done so and we have actually lost market share in key markets.  Immediately on coming into office this Government took action to reverse this trend.  We set up the new Department of Tourism and Transport and instituted a crash programme to boost this year's tourist season.  The central thrust of that programme was to reduce the price of access transport, accommodation and petrol.  Early indications are that in the first four months of this year, traffic will be up by about 17 per cent.  We are aiming for 20 per cent for the year as a whole.</P>
    <P>We intend to introduce later this year a major development plan for Irish tourism. The objective of the plan will be to achieve a major increase in net earnings and employment.  Four hundred thousand visitors bringing in an extra £100 million in revenue and creating 5,000 new jobs is what we are aiming at.  The initiatives which we have already implemented as well as a long-term development plan which we are preparing will ensure that this sector is enabled to make its full contribution to our economic recovery.</P>
    <P>The Government are proceeding with extensions to the runways at Dublin and Cork airports.  We have also given a subvention to the Cork-Swansea Car Ferry, which was long demanded by the tourist interests in the south-west region.  We have continued to give support to the B&amp;I company despite its financial problems and the prospects of a good tourist season will not be jeopardised by any lack of that service.</P>
    <P>In relation to infrastructure, a special priority must be given to road improvement where the pace of modernisation is still painfully slow.  Where private investment can be involved the whole programme can be speeded up.  The East <Col N="3843" /> Link Bridge was given the go-ahead in 1981 during my first Administration and it has been a very significant amenity.  A second wholly private financial project is going ahead, the West Link Motorway at a cost of £31 million.  The completion of a Dublin ring-road will have major priority.</P>
    <P>The Government have reviewed their decentralisation programme.  Within a month of resuming office we announced the decentralisation of sections of Government Departments to Ballina, Cavan, Galway and Sligo.  This is only a first phase.  The programme makes both economic and social sense.  Offices will be built by the private sector and rented at lower cost than offices in Dublin, and will help young people to find office work in their own home areas.</P>
    <P>The Irish film industry has yet to achieve its full potential.  To facilitate the development of the industry, the Government have brought forward section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, to complement existing tax incentives, so that it will in future be possible for corporate investors as well as personal investors to secure taxation relief on significant investments by them in the Irish film industry.  The Government have thus created for the first time a suitable framework for substantial investment by the private sector to help Irish film production become a genuine business activity and thereby facilitate a continuing process of production of a wide range of film projects.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that this new provision for a tax incentive for corporate investment in film-making &mdash; an incentive long sought by the industry &mdash; should replace the support given by Bord Scannán na hÉireann and that, accordingly, that body should be wound up from a current date.  As it happens, the mandate of the present board of Bord Scannán na hÉireann is due to expire on 5 October, 1987.  The chairman, Mr. Muiris MacConghail, tendered his resignation as chairman on 10 June with effect from end July.  The contract of the chief executive of the board is due to <Col N="3844" /> expire in mid-August and he has already indicated that he is not seeking the renewal of his contract.  I would like to acknowledge the distinguished work done by the chairman, members of the board and the chief executive and to thank them for the services they have so capably rendered.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council, which has a statutory function in relation to the promotion of knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts, including the cinema, has expended close on £1 million in the period 1981-87 on film-related projects. The council will be able to continue that work out of the increased funds being made available to it.</P>
    <P>The other essential element in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be tax reform and equity which we came into office pledged to achieve.  The programme will progressively reform and improve the equity of our taxation system.  We are currently engaged, in the programme discussions with the social partners, in ascertaining and articulating the necessary measures.</P>
    <P>We have already taken definite steps toward tax reform and tax equity since coming into office by establishing a special task force as a separate and additional arm of the Revenue.  This force is now making a significant contribution to collecting the arrears of taxes.  Further administrative action in this area is being considered, particularly the possible introduction of self-assessment.  Initially this will include corporations and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>We have brought to an end the interminable dispute about farmer taxation. Farmers will now be taxed on the same basis as everyone else and pay their proper contribution to the administration of the State.  The new withholding tax on professional fees paid by public bodies is a step towards bringing the tax treatment of those affected into line with the treatment of the PAYE sector.  Our most important objective in income tax is to bring two-thirds of taxpayers down to the standard rate.  This will be a major reform of the tax burden and will be achieved <Col N="3845" /> under the programme we are now elaborating.</P>
    <P>This is an example of the comprehensive and complementary approach we are adopting to putting the economy back on the path to growth and expansion. While, on the one hand, we must reduce Exchequer borrowing, priority must also be given to reducing the burden of taxation on income tax payers so that greater discretionary spending power can promote growth, pay increase expectations can be moderated and a greater incentive to enterprise and work generated.</P>
    <P>The other element in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be reform of our social services to bring greater equity into their application within the constraints of the public finances.  There are a number of problems with the social services which impede their efficiency and equity.  We must ensure that all services are operated in a cost-effective manner since the total spent by the Government in the health services, the educational system, social welfare, housing and on subsidies, amount to nearly £5.5 billion.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure that the access and opportunities these services provide must have full regard to the needs of those served.  In particular, the needs and requirements of the disadvantaged, economically and socially, must have priority. We are now at a stage in our economic and social development where we have built up in health, education, social welfare and housing publicly financed services which are very large and very costly. It is clear that there are inequities in the application of and the access to these services which we now propose to remedy in the context of the programme.  By remedying these deficiencies we can contribute to the general acceptance of the adjustments that may be necessary in these and other areas of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>This Government see themselves as an economic management team with the primary objective of managing the national economy back to recovery.  To ensure that we can do this effectively and <Col N="3846" /> expeditiously we have carried through a major reorganisation of the machinery of Government.  Government Departments have been restructured so that they can be more directly aligned to the needs of economic management and in a position to respond effectively to the economic priorities we have set.  Ministerial duties and functions have been similarly reallocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>To give a new priority to the development of our maritime resources we have set up the new Department of the Marine.  The tourist industry's nomadic departmental existence has been ended and the industry given the status it requires at Cabinet level.  The reincorporation of the Department of the Public Service back into the Department of Finance has been carried through.  The Department of Agriculture has been restructured to become the Department of Agriculture and Food, reflecting the vital importance of food processing to the further prosperity of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>Several Ministers of State have been given strategic responsibilities through the creation of special offices.  They have a special role and status as an integral part of the Government team.  There are Ministers of State with special responsibility for forestry, the food industry, trade and marketing, science and technology, and horticulture.  The results are already becoming apparent.</P>
    <P>A new board to develop the horticultural industry has been set up and a similar one for forestry is on the way. Export marketing, science and technology and food processing are receiving urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Our main concentration as a Government has been on the economy.  From every point of view that is essential.  A Government that is successfully managing the national economy and the public finances will have the ability and the confidence to confront all its other problems.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's basic position and long term aim in relation to Ireland as a whole continue to be as set out in the report of the New Ireland Forum.  As far back as 1980 at the Dublin Castle Summit, the <Col N="3847" /> Irish and British Governments clearly identified the Anglo-Irish framework as the basis for political progress towards peace, reconciliation and stability on this island.  We are continuing to use that framework including the more recent Anglo-Irish Agreement to try to achieve political progress and reform in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.  We made it clear long before the February election that, whatever our reservations, international agreements would be honoured, and could only be changed by mutual consent.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has already co-chaired a meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast, and the mechanism of the conference and the secretariat will continue to be used by us as an instrument to seek reform and to clarify problems and difficulties as they arise.</P>
    <P>We will through the conference strenuously pursue the achievement of equality of opportunity in Northern Ireland and the elimination of discrimination in employment there.  We see this as a fundamental issue, which arouses legitimate concern among Irish people both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>We will also be seeking meaningful reforms in the administration of justice so that the whole community there can have confidence in the impartiality of the courts, the laws and the police force. We will be giving special attention to economic co-operation between North and South, particularly in areas which will help to alleviate the unemployment problems being faced in both parts of this island, and we appreciate the assistance being given to a number of projects by the contributors to the International Fund.</P>
    <P>People, North and South, must be given hope that a climate of moderation can be realised so that the search for peace and agreement can take place in an atmosphere free from hatred, violence and suspicion.  The recent electoral success of the SDLP is a very welcome development and an encouraging sign that there can be no return to the failed structures of the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3848" /> I promised some time ago that this Fianna Fáil Government would be an environmentally conscious one.  In this, the International Year of the Environment, the Government can point to its continuing record of concern and action to ensure the protection of our environment and heritage.  In dealing with the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> threat and the rape of the oak woods at Coolattin we became very keenly aware of some glaring deficiencies in our legislation for dealing with environmental problems of this kind.  We will be proceeding expeditiously to remedy those gaps, and there are a number of Bills dealing with oil and maritime pollution which will be introduced in the Seanad over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is establishing a special working group to make recommendations on whatever legislative, administrative and organisational action should be taken.  This working group will have representatives of all the Departments and offices concerned as it is particularly important that the provisions in both the Planning Act in this regard, and the Forestry Acts are considered together.  The House can be assured that this review will be carried out as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I in Government are very conscious of the fact that in many areas legislation is urgently required. While our efforts in the months immediately ahead will, of necessity, be concentrated on dealing with the public finances and promoting economic development, we intend at the same time to pursue to the greatest extent possible a comprehensive programme of legislation.</P>
    <P>Even though the Dáil will be in recess it is our intention to press ahead.  For this purpose we intend that the Seanad will sit well into the summer and deal with as much legislation as possible.  A great deal can be achieved if legislation is introduced in the Seanad and subjected there to detailed and thorough examination, and to the greatest extent possible, difficulties teased out and any deficiencies or anomalies eliminated.  Legislation dealt <Col N="3849" /> with in this way by the Seanad during the summer can be available to the Dáil in the autumn and we could expect that because of the manner in which the legislation would have been dealt with in the Seanad, it could receive a reasonably expeditious passage through the Dáil. The Government would hope to have the following measures dealt with in this way: the Adoption Bill, the Companies Bill, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill and the Children Bill; the Agricultural Credit (Amendment) Bill, a Bill to improve the standards of hygiene of local abattoirs; the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which proposes to give additional powers to customs and excise officers to tackle drug smuggling; the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill which deals with the issue of supermarkets seeking unwarranted contributions from suppliers and outlaws below cost selling; the Air Navigation and Transport Bill to promote greater security at airports; the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill, which will enable the ratification of important international conventions and give us better protection from disasters like the wreck of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, and the Shipping Investment Grants Bill, the Criminal Law Bill, the Video Recordings Bill and the Data Protection Bill.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the progress we have been making in many difficult areas.  I invite Deputies to look at this stage at our document published in the general election, <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> They will, I believe, be surprised to see the remarkable progress that has been made already in undertaking the programme outlined.  In virtually every area our policies are being actively implemented.  In many of the strategic development areas, international financial services, tourism, food processing, science and technology, exporting, shipping, the film industry, decentralisation, to name but a few, this Government have already made key decisions that will give a major impetus to the sector or programme in question.  I do not think that <Col N="3850" /> anyone can point to a Government in recent times which published such a comprehensive programme in a general election and which followed through on that programme so thoroughly and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>This Government since elected to office have shown a firm and resolute determination to confront the financial realities and tackle the fundamental problems in the economy.  On assuming office we saw clearly what had to be done and we decided that we would not be deterred from doing it by any political or electoral considerations.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of a national political organisation like Fianna Fáil to face up to the task of the day; to recognise what is the national priority; to identify the problems and set about solving them. This duty takes different forms at different times in the nation's affairs.  The challenge to this Fianna Fáil Government was to tackle head on the crisis of confidence which had arisen, to combat the sense of failure which had developed and which manifested itself most clearly in the queues of young people outside foreign embassies.  Economic collapse was at the heart of the national malaise.  We saw this clearly and decided to act urgently and decisively.  We have demonstrated that our financial problems can be overcome with the necessary political will. We have shown that there are initiatives that can be taken by Government to promote new wealth and create employment.</P>
    <P>Political leadership must be concerned about the real problems of the nation and developing the will and capacity among all concerned to tackle and overcome them.  The difference between good Government and bad is often not so much a matter of different outlook as of relative determination.  The very best policies are of no avail if they are not implemented. We are beginning to get things moving in the right direction both on the economic and financial fronts.  Anyone, who for their own party political purposes, seeks to deflect us from doing the job that must be done will bear a heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago the leader of <Col N="3851" /> Fine Gael, the former Taoiseach, said at the outset of this Dáil: &ldquo;We are going to find it difficult at times to offer the degree of support which will be necessary for the Government to carry out their functions effectively and to overcome the great problems that face us and to take on the vested interests which are strangling this country.  It will not be easy for an Opposition to support some of the measures the Government will have to take.  Yet we will do so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have made visible and tangible progress in our first three months in office.  In practically every area determined action has been taken.  Confidence has returned and some of the basic economic indicators are exceptionally good.  Money has flowed back into the economy, interest rates have been reduced, and there is a new and healthier climate for investment. If ever a Government acted solely in the national interest this is such a Government. Our only concern is to restore the Irish economy to sound good health and to take all the measures necessary for this purpose.  The Irish people have a deep and long term interest in seeing the Government succeed.  They have a profound hope that we will succeed.  The sooner we can put our fiscal difficulties behind us, the sooner we can create new employment opportunities and commence a new era of development.  We have still a long hard road to travel but we have made a brave start and I believe that the revival of national pride we need to carry us on to complete recovery can already be emerging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Taoiseach's introductory speech to the Adjournment debate is a tapestry of fact, fiction and mythology which he hopes will become history.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach, as he has proved in the past, knows the correct thing to do.  In 1980 he illustrated very well on television one of the best and briefest economic analysis of the country's problems.  We have had a similar type analysis today although of greater length.  Will he do it this time and, if so, what are the implications?</P>
      <P>On a similar occasion in the Taoiseach's last administration in 1982, in the budget debate he said his Government intended to adhere to these targets through rigid control of the public finances and that should any additional expenditure become necessary, it would have to be made by a corresponding reduction in expenditure elsewhere.  We have heard exactly the same today, in almost exactly the same words.  In 1982 the current budget deficit overrun was £309 million which was 2.5 per cent higher than budgeted. We agree that the Taoiseach knows what to do but whether he and his party will do it is an open question on which the jury are still out.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach proposed six policy objectives.  I should like to examine each in turn and to try to separate fact from fiction.  Fianna Fáil policy is now Government policy and it will be interesting to see how it measures up to those objectives. The Taoiseach is committed to restoring the public finances by reducing overall Government expenditure.  So far, so good.  People all around the country are suffering from the effects of decisions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current budget deficit is supposed to come in at the end of the year at 6.9 per cent of GNP.  I hope the Taoiseach will be successful in doing that.  We heard the commitment again today that if the coach goes off the rails further action will be taken.  Is the train on the track?  I <Col N="3853" /> understand, for example, that the unemployment figures for the year are now calculated by the Department of Finance at 247,000, although the budget for Social Welfare allowed for 242,000.  There is a serious overrun there.</P>
    <P>The Government have been tardy in many of the expenditure cuts they introduced and will not get the full year effect for which they budgeted.  For example, the withholding tax will not yield enough and the Government are probably running over target by £100 million at present.  However, I take the Taoiseach at his word and I presume we will have some action next week when the Dáil is in recess or, alternatively, in the early autumn.  The half year returns will be interesting as they will be the first indication of whether the Taoiseach will do what he committed himself and the Government to do or whether we will have a repeat of 1982 in which there was the biggest overrun in the history of the State.  We will wait and see.  On this side of the House we can only encourage the Taoiseach.  He knows the problems, I hope he will have the courage to implement the policy necessary in the national interest and that he will not deviate from it for party political considerations. If he does that we on this side of the House will encourage him to maintain the targets he laid down. However, a seminar will be necessary for the Members of the House, particularly for Fianna Fáil backbenchers, if they think this will be easy.  I tabled a question two weeks ago to the Minister for Finance regarding the national debt which on 31 March stood at £25.380 billion.  The cost of servicing it is £2.146 million.</P>
    <P>There is a perception in the country &mdash; and certainly on Fianna Fáil backbenches &mdash; that the current budget deficit is being eliminated and that there will be no borrowing this year.  We know the Government will have to borrow up to £2 billion this year; £1.87 billion is the budgetary figure which I think the Government will overrun.  However, I will not quibble about it.  The money borrowed will be added on to the national debt.  Central to the way in which the public finances <Col N="3854" /> evolve over the coming year will be the rate of growth and the money value of GNP relative to the interest rate applicable to the national debt.  This relationship also provides an indication of how restrictive Government policy will need to be if the public finances are to be put back on a sustainable path.  At present, it seems unlikely that the rate of growth in the economy will exceed 2 per cent. Indeed I am being generous as it is unlikely that it will be exceeded in real terms in the period to 1990.  This is allied to a prospective inflation rate of 3.5 per cent annually which means that the money value of GNP is unlikely to grow by more than 5.5 per cent per annum in the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>The interest rate which currently applies to the national debt is not far short of 9.5 per cent and there is a good prospect that that will fall somewhat, by how much it is impossible to tell.  A lot will depend on international factors and movement in the exchange rate of the £ and on the ability of the Government to fulfil policy objective number one of sticking to financial targets.  On balance, it is reasonable to expect that interest rates on the national debt will come down to maybe 8 per cent over the period about which we are talking.</P>
    <P>The prospects for GNP growth in interest rates is such as to require significant further restrictions in relation to public finances to do no more than halt the growth in the debt relative to GNP. In theory there can be a number of adjustments, tax increases or reductions in the capital programme, but from what the Taoiseach has said he does not intend going down either of those roads so he is left with the area of current expenditure. It will require cuts of £350 million in the 1988 budget relative to the 1987 outturn just to stand still on present targets. Everybody in the House should note that figure and take it in &mdash; £350 million of expenditure cuts of the 1987 outturn is what the Government are faced with as they go into the budget in 1988.  You can run the numbers up and down, over and back and while you may gain £10 million here or £10 million there, you are still <Col N="3855" /> talking about cuts of £350 million of the 1987 outturn and that is to stand still, not to make progress.  I hope the Taoiseach now that he has the bit between his teeth will go from 6.9 per cent down to 6 per cent on the current side.  That is taking not even a full 1 per cent off it but we should encourage him to do that.</P>
    <P>Where does the £350 million come from?  There is another notion around, and I am afraid it has pervaded this House as well, that there is money there which is not being used at all if we could only find it, that the public sector and the Departments of State are flabby and that if they could have the fat taken out of them then we would have reductions in public expenditure, soft option reductions which would not hurt anybody. I can assure everybody in the House that any fat that was in the system has been long since taken out and to get a reduction of £350 million in the 1988 budget will be rough and tough.</P>
    <P>When we ally to that the fact that 70 per cent of our current spending is on health, social welfare, education and housing, that is £5.2 billion, we do not have to have very developed imaginations to see where the axe will fall.  There is the situation which is facing the Government.  When the Taoiseach promises as a policy objective to reduce Government borrowing and to stabilise and then reduce the growth of the national debt as a percentage of GNP, I am informing the House and his own back-bench Deputies that just to stabilise it will involve horrific decisions later this year and early next year.  I wonder will the Government stay on the rails to do that?  Are we in this House being honest with the people and are all parties in this House being honest with the people when they point the finger at the Fine Gael Party and say &ldquo;Why do you not vote the Government out?  Why do you not take every possible opportunity to vote them out?&rdquo;  Is that the reasonable position, or is that the direction in which we should be going, faced with problems like that?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Taoiseach is a connoisseur of western movies, but in <Col N="3856" /> the standard western when the tall dark stranger finally draws the gun, the street becomes littered with corpses and it is usually the layabouts in the saloon who are the first to hit the ground.  The aleckadoos who make the smart remarks about macho on this side of the House would want to think very carefully before they provoke the reaction which will put us all walking again and which will bring about a situation which is not in the national interest.  No matter what Government are elected, whether it is a Fianna Fáil one with an overall majority, or an alternative Government or a minority Government again, the figures will not change and whoever brings in the 1988 budget will be faced with the scenario I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I wonder at times if we are caught in the rigidity of our historic parliamentary systems and would we not be better, as we look at everything, to look at the way we operate in here also?  Would it not be easier to get Members of this House to do what is necessary in the national interest if we had a fixed term period for the life of this Parliament in which to do our work?  If we all knew there would be no election for the next four years, would not a lot of the play-acting stop?  Would not many of the positions taken, the posing and codology and the bar talk, all at total variance with the pretentious speeches in the House, stop?</P>
    <P>We have a real problem, the solving of which the Taoiseach set as his second objective.  His back-benchers should know what it means.  It means, for a start, £350 million off health, education, social welfare and housing, and I predict there will be a fair amount of screeching by the time that target is achieved.  One might say if we had a single party Government with an overall majority all our problems would be solved, but history is against us there also.  The worst Government this country ever had since the foundation of the State was that from 1977 to 1981, with the worst set of economic Ministers this State ever had.  They broke the country and we are paying for it since &mdash; and they had the largest majority ever in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3857" /> I should like to proceed to objective number three of the Taoiseach's speech. He says he will move to restore confidence, bring down interest rates and maintain the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS.  I shall say this to the Taoiseach: he would have less trouble in restoring confidence if for four years he had not systematically, day after day, undermined it in this House and around the country.  I remember the final session of the Dáil from October to December of 1986 when Fianna Fáil put down 13 motions, virtually one every second day, calling for an increase in Government expenditure in every one of them and voting in the lobbies to increase Government expenditure.  Now we are to believe there has been a consistent thread through his economic and financial policies since he first became Taoiseach in late 1979, that any of us who think there may have been a certain inconsistency between thought and action were simply misled and that we do not see the historic record correctly.  It would be a lot easier to restore confidence if the confidence had not been undermined in the first place by the Taoiseach and his party and the sensible voters know that quite well. That is why if there was an election now or in the immediate future, in the words of a distinguished Member of this House the Taoiseach's party would be &ldquo;haugh-eyed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is confidence being restored?  What are the signs of it?  Yes, there are some signs that there is a restoration of confidence and as long as this party on this side of the House generally support the policy objectives of the Government party confidence will be maintained.  It is as strong or as tenuous as that.  The Taoiseach has made great play about the visual signs of restored confidence, money flowing back into the country, he said.  Well, I do not know what the evidence is of money flowing back into the country but there was tenuous enough evidence of money flowing out of the country for any other reason except for valid trade reasons and for the purchase of currency abroad to make legitimate trading kills.  Obviously, when the Irish pound went very high <Col N="3858" /> against sterling people bought sterling in advance so that they could settle later. Certainly, much of that happened but now that the pound is down to a more reasonable exchange rate that has tended to stop.  There tends to be a flow back. We explained all that at the time, but the Taoiseach and his party said &ldquo;this is not trade at all, this is the Fine Gael Government wrecking the economy&rdquo;.  We were told that this is the DIRT tax and that when they got back to office they would abolish it as it was the cause of the outflows. The DIRT tax is still there and the Taoiseach and his party are glad of it. When they get the return on it at the end of the year their tongues will be out for it because they will have overrun on expenditure.</P>
    <P>If money is flowing back into the country it is not as a result of the DIRT tax because it never flowed out because of the DIRT tax. This was another attempt by the Taoiseach and his party in their no holds barred opposition to the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition to undermine confidence in the economy.  There is legitimate political opposition, but there has been a tradition here that Opposition did not undermine confidence in the national economy.  The Taoiseach broke that rule and he will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>One of the Taoiseach's objectives is to bring down interest rates.  We will see how that measures up.  Certainly there have been falls in interest rates since the budget and we are delighted with that, but the falls are not of great magnitude so far.  Between the budget of last year and the adjournment of the Dáil falls in interest rates were bigger and that went on up to June last year.  Our Government overran in the autumn, not by very much, a matter of £125 million at 1987 values compared to £309 million at 1982 values which the Minister for Finance Deputy MacSharry overran in the last Administration over which the Taoiseach had control.</P>
    <P>In talking about declining interest rates, about what happened last autumn and about confidence, there is another Deputy in this House who should be ashamed <Col N="3859" /> of himself and he is Deputy Brennan. Last autumn I heard him on radio systematically predicting overruns of £600 million and £700 million with no basis for that.  In undermining confidence in the Government, the Deputy had no hesitation in undermining confidence in the economy by deliberately talking up interest rates.  I was sorry that Deputy Harney was associated with that at the time.  These are the things which undermine confidence.  There is no point in coming back now with thunder storm repentance and saying that we are building confidence, when the main element in that build up of confidence is that they have stopped the things they were doing to destroy that confidence 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>There is a contradiction in the interest rate policy.  I wonder why it is there. Why would 10 per cent of the mortgage interest relief be abolished if the policy is to reduce interest rates?  Why not allow the benefit of declining interest rates go to the householder?  Why hoard it up back into the maw of the Revenue Commissioners by ensuring that people with home loans pay more interest?  Why would the Minister for Finance and the Government legislate to increase the tax rate from 35 per cent to 45 per cent on the profits which banks earn on the home loan sector of their business?  The banks, being sensible business people will not load their lack of profitability on to the home loans side.  They will spread the burden of that across the whole portfolio of their business and as a result there will be a break on the reducing interest rates in the banking sector, not simply in the home loan area but right into the investment side of their portfolios.  The Taoiseach should look at this again.  He is trying to ride two horses when it comes to interest rates.  On the one hand he is trying to get them down but the Finance Bill contains two measures which push pressure in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>I have talked about interest rates before.  Anyone with a home loan or overdraft immediately thinks of reduced interest rates as more money in the pocket.  All that is true and then there is <Col N="3860" /> a little boost in consumer spending and that might generate a little growth in the economy but the main effect of reduced interest rates is that people who have money or companies who have money will invest in the wealth creating area of the economy, the risk taking area, and this will lead to employment.  That is the main reason apart from debt servicing. To do that the Taoiseach will have to maintain his policy for at least 12 months and will have to be seen to deliver over the long term.  People with money do not make investment decisions on the basis of death bed conversions which may or may not last.  The Taoiseach will have to maintain the low interest rates and the curbs on public expenditure to which he has committed himself, right into the next budget and on to the one after before he will get the investment effect which falling interest rates will produce.  To get the benefits of the Government's economic policies for electoral purposes, the Fianna Fáil backbencher will have to swallow the pill so far as the 1988 budget is concerned because until their sincerity is proved by taking at least £350 million off the 1988 budget, interest rates will fluctuate.  They will not come down and stabilise, and people who watch interest rates will not make the investment decisions.  Obviously if one can sit at home beside the fire and get 13 per cent for buying Government paper, one will do that rather than taking risks.  But, if interest rates come down significantly and are perceived to be going to stay down over that long term, this can generate growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recommitted the Government to maintaining the stability for the Irish pound in the EMS.  The Taoiseach will have our full support on that objective.  Exchange rates should not be debated and I have no intention of debating exchange rates while the Taoiseach sticks to that policy.</P>
    <P>Another of the Taoiseach's objectives is to stimulate and encourage economic growth and investment in every possible sector of productivity.  That is painting with the broad brush strokes all right. <Col N="3861" /> There is a certain sense in what the Taoiseach says.  On the one hand one gets the environment right for productivity and investment and one then seeks to stimulate or fast grow particular sectors in the correct environment.  We do not object to that strategy, a strategy which the Taoiseach inherited from us in a situation which was different from the situation we inherited in 1982.  When we took office inflation was running at about 20 per cent. The inflation rate is running at 2.8 per cent when the Taoiseach's party has taken office.  Fianna Fáil should not start claiming credit for lower inflation rates because they are a couple of months in office.  We suffered hard to bring inflation rates down to that level.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also talked about a better environment for exports.  We are in surplus now for the first time since 1945/46.  The greatest monthly surplus ever was in May of this year with no credit due to the Taoiseach or anybody on his side of the House.  When they left office last autumn the balance of payments deficit was about 14 per cent of GNP.  The fact that we are now in surplus and have an export lead economy is due to the economic decisions taken on this side of the House.  I hope the Taoiseach will continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have a lot more to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider some of the sectoral policies being pursued by the Government. The Taoiseach made great play about tourism.  Does he expect us to believe that an initiative taken on the last day of March or in the first week of April and put into effect during the first week of May can effect this year's tourist season to any degree?  It is ridiculous to claim that the harmless bit of nonsense which was announced about the tourist industry and which upset the relevant Minister to such a degree that he had to visit the studios in Montrose to make sure it went out over the airwaves has led to a 17 per cent increase in traffic this year. <Col N="3862" /> That is the silliest claim in his speech. Listening to the Taoiseach was like watching a film one had not seen before but which was similar to four or five others one has seen and which were made by the same director.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial services I maintain that the 10 per cent tax regime will not apply to the Custom House Docks site in so far as it relates to American banks who set up subsidiaries here. When I said this here before the Minister for Finance told me I was wrong but he did not explain how I was wrong.  I would like to remind the Taoiseach that one of the development agencies in this country is giving that advice in the board rooms of North American banks.  When I had responsibility for industry and commerce I saw a detailed analysis of the effects on industrial development of the United States Tax Reform Act, 1986.  It stated clearly that the 10 per cent tax regime would not apply to subsidiaries of American banks or finance houses because they would be taxed in America on current year terms for any profits that accrued overseas.  If this is so, can the Taoiseach explain how he is going to achieve the targets for financial services he spoke about in the context of the Custom House Docks area?</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative on the food industry.  For a very short time I was responsible for development in that sector.  We all agree with the theory but the scope for development is limited.  The Taoiseach said there was to be an investment of £260 million in the Goodman case over five years.  We were told by the Minister for Agriculture and Food at Question Time yesterday that this would mean 600 permanent jobs.  If it costs £260 million to produce 600 jobs what is going to happen to the 250,000 people who are unemployed.  Where are we going to get the investment to produce the jobs for them?</P>
    <P>While the Taoiseach said we were getting the environment for development right and were fast growing certain sectors no concern was expressed for the unemployed.  This was the most disappointing feature of the Taoiseach's <Col N="3863" /> speech.  The only initiative on the unemployed at present is the Jobsearch scheme.  If the people who come to my clinics are representative of the way the scheme operates, it is obvious that it is an attack on the unemployed all right but that it is not much of an attack on unemployment.  There was nothing in the Taoiseach's speech which would give hope to the people who are on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will adhere to the policies he has outlined.  I am sorry I did not have more time to deal with the fifth and sixth policy objectives he outlined. In the sixth one he wants to improve the cost effectiveness and equity of our social services.  There is not much equity in them at present because of the way the cuts are being administered.  One of the most recent cases in my constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I cannot move a motion today, for whatever obscure reason, that the House should adjourn not for an unspecified summer recess, as motion No. 7 which we are discussing suggests and which I have not seen before but that the House should adjourn until 2 September 1987 nine weeks away.  That would be an adequate recess given the amount of business which potentially would be before the House and the large amount of business which apparently, accordingly to the Taoiseach, is being sent to the Seanad and which this House will not be able to deal with until the end of October.  It seems to me that a nine week recess would be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from any new business, of which there has been little or none, there is substantial business available and carried over from the previous Dáil which has not been dealt with.  Much of it is of considerable importance.  One Bill which is very important is the Courts Bill, 1986, which cannot but have a beneficial effect in an area of difficulty and great cost for many people, namely, the area of motor insurance.  There is a substantial Companies Bill, published earlier this year and republished again within the few months by both Governments.  It is not controversial but, nonetheless, it is difficult and will take some time to tease out.  It is vitally important because there <Col N="3867" /> are many areas of company law which everyone in the House knows are being seriously abused at present and have been for some years and clearly will continue to be abused.  The sooner this legislation, with whatever amendments are felt necessary, is brought in the better.</P>
    <P>The month of July could have been devoted to things of that kind.  If those two Bills alone had been passed in the month of July, it would have been a worthwhile month's work for this House. Since we are asked to go into recess on 26 June, which is the earliest date I recall in my 20 years in this House, I think it is not unreasonable to come back nine weeks later which would be early in September. That would accord with the sort of summer recess one would see generally. Apart from the business which has been carried over from the previous Government, which is substantial, there are a great many other matters which should be the subject of legislation which should be brought forward now.  It is extraordinary that this House would now propose to go into recess for one-third of the entire year when all these urgent matters are awaiting attention and where there is a great public need for them.</P>
    <P>Since it first met in March of this year, the present Dáil has seen some curious developments in its alignments and in how it does its business.  It has seen some strange new alliances and the disintegration of old alliances.  Once strong allies have become bitter foes and once bitter foes have become strong allies.  All these developments, in one respect or another, have been caused by the advent of and the success of the Progressive Democrats.  Our influence on the policies being pursued is clear for all to see.  Our influence on the procedure of the House may be less obvious but it is no less real. The changing of the fundamental rules of the House in relation to debate and the ordering of business is not some minor procedural change relevant only to the Members of this House, as some commentators would have us believe.  The decision of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael earlier this year to hold meetings only <Col N="3868" /> between their own two Whips dramatically breaks the precedent that has been in existence in this House since its foundation more than 65 years ago.  It is not even claimed that it is being done for any other reason than to exclude the Progressive Democrats whose arrival on the scene has disturbed the cosy club atmosphere of this House and threatens to rationalise and modernise the whole Irish political scene in a way that disturbs the vested interests of the two Civil War parties.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is the way the public parliamentary business is arranged and discussed.  The public parliamentary business of this country is the business of everyone in the country.  Every party elected to this House has both a right and a duty to have some say in these matters. What is happening is that the two Whips, those of the two main parties, at the behest of their respective leaders are meeting behind locked doors to arrange the public affairs of this nation in a surreptitious way, in collusion with one another, and to the inevitable detriment of the country.  The ultimate in connivance was reached on Tuesday of this week when a guillotine motion was put down to guillotine 11 items of business, some of which were of considerable importance, all of them to be passed in short periods and some without any debate whatever.  On top of that guillotine motion a further guillotine motion was moved, again with the agreement and collusion of Fine Gael, to guillotine any discussion on the guillotine motion.</P>
    <P>I could perhaps pursue matters which would be of more popular concern but I cannot pursue anything much more important than the independence and sovereignty of this House.  If by the collusion of a large majority of its Members for their own party political purposes this House is reduced to a rubber stamp for arrangements arrived at behind closed doors, then all is not well.  If this sort of conduct is appropriate now, why was it not carried on in this House during the past 65 years?  If it is thought appropriate and right now to curtail enormously the rights of the third and fourth parties in <Col N="3869" /> this House, why was it not though right to do so last November and December when the present set of Standing Orders were drawn up after long consultations between parties.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern for any parliament if its chairmanship comes in practice to be perceived as a perk to be distributed by the incoming Government of the day.  That concern should be greatly compounded in any parliament if the incoming Government in turn have to rely on the chairman for its election and, in the last resort, for its maintenance in office.  For these reasons the great majority of democratic parliaments, where the executive is drawn from the legislature, tend to have a continuity in their chairmanship and do not see the chairmanship change with every change of administration.  That was the practice and tradition in this House for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I am loath to go back over it in historic fashion.  I prefer to set out briefly what can be done for the future.  I will confine myself in looking back over the unhappy events of recent weeks to making the observation that one would have thought Deputy Dukes would have supped with a longer spoon when he sat down to sup with some <Col N="3870" /> people.  Surprisingly, however he does not appear to have learned any lessons. Even as recently as this morning, rather incredibly he put forward the suggestion that there should be a health committee of the House.  As I pointed out to him, he forgets that as recently as last week he not alone voted against my suggestion that there be additional committees including one on health but he even voted to guillotine any discussion on any such proposal.</P>
      <P>What concerns me about the control of health spending as we have seen it applied by the present Government, is not the principle of cutting health expenditure, or any other expenditure, but the crude and unthought-out and unscientific way in which these cuts are implemented which results in the genuine belief by many members of the public that it is not possible to control or curtail public expenditure without causing enormous hardship and anxiety.   A serious disservice has been done to the whole concept of the very necessary control of public expenditure.  It appears to arise from a lack of thought-out policy more than anything else.  Nobody can seriously deny that there is waste and excessive and unnecessary expenditure in many areas of health which is costing the Irish taxpayer so dearly.  There are many things that can be done that will not cause the anxiety and potential hardship we have seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our drugs bill is tens of millions of pounds higher than it need be because of the refusal of the Department of Health to insist that drugs should be dispensed under their generic name rather than under their brand name.  The international pharmaceutical industry is allowed to take tens of millions of pounds out of the Exchequer and out of this country quite unnecessarily.  In a huge number of cases the same drug is available and manufactured here but under a generic name or a different brand name and at a much cheaper price.  I think it is wrong that we do not have some nominal charge on a prescription.  That would not create hardship but would prevent a lot of the unnecessary prescribing and <Col N="3871" /> unnecessary visits to doctors.  The general medical service is considerably more expensive than it need be because doctors are remunerated on a fee per item of service basis rather than on a capitation basis, as is normal elsewhere.  This change could be easily achieved in a relatively short time and should now be done without further delay.  It will cause no hardship to anybody and will result in worthwhile savings.</P>
    <P>Everyone must be aware of how costly and unsatisfactory the consultant position is in Irish hospitals.  It should be speedily rationalised for the benefit of public patients in particular and for the incidental benefit of the Exchequer.  As medicine develops, equipment becomes more important than inpatient beds.  A great many procedures can be carried out in day wards and on non-resident patients.  Increasingly, this is the trend elsewhere and it should be properly worked out and developed here where the savings could be enormous.  What has happened in practice has frightened people because institutions have been closed in whole or in part without the alternative services being provided.  If people live too far away from the hospital to be discharged to their home at night, why not discharge them to an hotel and pay for them at a fraction of the cost of keeping them as an inpatient?</P>
    <P>On the question of waste, inefficiency and duplication which seems to be endemic in the health services, I would like to refer briefly to three quotations from public documents which bear out the views I have expressed.  The first quotation comes from the National Planning Board.  Proposals for plan 1984-87.  It says:</P>
    <P>Economies in health expenditure should as far as possible be achieved by reducing the inputs to the health services, (beds, drugs, payments to doctors, hospital buildings, administration, etc.) rather than by reducing the quantity or quality of beneficial and necessary care delivered to the public. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3872" /> I think that statement is reasonable and if it had only been taken into account over the past three or four months, look at the different atmosphere that would exist today.</P>
    <P>I will give a brief quotation from the Tussing report on the health services where Tussing is commenting on the Department of Health's method of managing their budget.  He says:</P>
    <P>How budget decisions are made is obscure and so necessarily is the degree of efficiency and rationality of the resulting mix of services. </P>
    <P>Put in the delicate and slightly genteel language that reports of this kind use, that is as strong a comment as could be made on the methods of the Department of Health managing their budget.  In the same document he describes the Department of Health's procedures as <i>ad hoc</i> rather than automatic and formula-based. That sums up in general terms the philosophy underlying a lot of what I have said in specific or in particular terms.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to State institutions generally.  It is valid at this juncture in our history to ask if it is not true in many instances that the empire which has been created has now become more important than the need which is was set up to meet. Is it not true that many of these bodies now exist primarily for their own sake? Have not the public purposes and needs become secondary?  These prolific quangos develop huge organic appetites of their own.  In some respects they resemble prehistoric monsters that become no longer relevant to their own surroundings but still managed to survive for a long time notwithstanding their voracious appetites.  Is it not time to have a serious look at reducing our public administrative and developmental bodies of all kinds, both in terms of their numbers, their cost, and their size to what is necessary and relevant today?</P>
    <P>Do we really need a dozen or more institutions dealing with different aspects of industrial development and economic promotion?  Was it appropriate when the previous and present Governments both correctly decided to amalgamate three of <Col N="3873" /> the Manpower and training agencies, that in each case their nerve should fail them at the last minute and instead of having a genuine amalgamation into one body the three bodies were preserved with the addition at the top of a holding company which, in practice, adds a further layer of bureaucracy to the several layers that were already there.</P>
    <P>From the start the Progressive Democrats put forward commonsense proposals in relation to many of the difficulties that have afflicted this country and its economy in recent years.  It is interesting to see even in the short time of our existence how many of these have begun to be implemented, and in other cases where ideas which we put forward and which a year ago or more were regarded as unthinkable are now the subject of public debate.  Among the latter is our suggestion for widespread privatisation. The debate has well and truly started.  The predictable knee-jerk reaction has come and, we hope, gone and the present Government, in spite of what they said before the last election, that they would have no privatisation, have, I am happy to say, begun in a small way to think in these terms.  Two recent examples were their announcement of the sale of some immature forests and the possible privatisation of the school bus service.  Both of these are obvious and necessary, and I would like to encourage the Government not to be so tentative about them but to get on with it.  However, they should not confine themselves to such relatively minor matters as these.  As often happens in this country when any concept is discussed, it is compared with what happens in Britain and with that only.  It seems that the British type of privatisation, of getting state companies into profit and floating them through the sale of shares on the Stock Exchange, is appropriate only to relatively small numbers of State companies here.  I hope that this development will take place rapidly where it is appropriate.</P>
    <P>In addition to that three other areas should be looked at seriously here.  These come under the same general heading. <Col N="3874" /> The first is the disposal of assets with a view to utilising the proceeds for the reduction of debt.  It makes no sense whatever for us as a country to hold assets in State ownership when the State is borrowing money that costs between 10 and 14 per cent and when an acceptable current yield to institutional holders of property would be somewhere between 4 and 7 per cent.  The economic argument for the disposal of fixed assets is more cogent here than in most places because of our abnormally high level of national debt. Every reduction we can make in that is invaluable to the country and to the economy as a whole.  We are afflicted here with a historic obsession about ownership. Use of assets is what counts, not who formally or legally owns them. Scarce and limited capital should go into the area of financing production and employment rather than into the unnecessary financing of capital assets. Successful commercial firms know that and practice it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the disposal of loss making assets, even for nothing, is a net benefit to the country if others are prepared to provide the service.  Frequently private people are prepared to provide a service on the basis that in their hands it would not be loss making.  Thirdly, a number of services at present are provided directly by the State through different institutions or local authorities.  There is no measurement of efficiencies or real costs and there is no accountability for value where this happens.  Private contractors will establish costs and in turn that will introduce competitiveness from which efficiencies will flow and the net result will be the provision of these services at a higher standard and much lower cost.</P>
    <P>The lack of accountability I mentioned underlines much of our ills in the public domain.  In Ireland accountability is regarded as being able to prove that you did not misappropriate public money. Accountability has nothing to do with getting value for public money.  In fact, there is no requirement that you get value for money.  It is considered appropriate to plough on in a way that seemed right <Col N="3875" /> 50 years ago, even though it has no commercial or commonsense relevance today.  Is it not now time to establish the principle that not wasting money is just as important as not stealing it?  Is it not time, therefore, to rethink fundamentally our entire public accounting system?  Can we afford to continue the structures and methods of a public service that has become so large and dominant that it bestrides the narrow world or all Irish economic, commercial and social life like a colossus?  Can we afford to continue with a system that makes the ability and dedication of those in it much less than cost efficient and far from rewarding in a personal sense?</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on Northern Ireland which the Taoiseach dealt with in just a passing way.  We have a Government here now in the Republic which, notwithstanding their previous statements, are apparently prepared to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement and we have the re-election in Britain with a substantial majority of a Government who clearly are very determined, and have shown in the last 18 months that they are very determined, that that agreement will work.  We have the election results in Northern Ireland which show an increase in support for parties of a more moderate view.  In particular we have seen an increase in the support for the SDLP and a decline in support for some of the more extreme Unionists.  In general the position is satisfactory in the context in which the Anglo-Irish Agreement exists.  What is important now is not simply to continue as you were but to realise that to make that agreement and the structures established under it work, it is necessary to encourage a much more positive outlook from the majority of the people in Northern Ireland, the Unionists.  I notice that they are not referred to in the Taoiseach's speech.  The matter is difficult.  There are sensitivities on all sides, perhaps most of all on the Unionist side, but with two Governments recently elected in two countries it is time that each of them should take within reason whatever moderate and reasonable steps are required to <Col N="3876" /> get the Unionists to accept the structures which have been set up and to become part of them.  It is necessary to allay their suspicions and their fears first, and when that is done there is now a significant body of Unionist opinion, on the ground at least if not among the leadership of that community yet, who are prepared to accept and recognise the reality of the situation in which they find themselves and are not prepared to continue the futility of their objections up to now. They should be given encouragement in a way that ensures that there will be no expressions of triumphalism of any kind, direct or indirect, in relation to them when they become more involved and when moves toward devolution of government on a power sharing basis within Northern Ireland begin to grow.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the tragic situation on the ground in terms of human life and human suffering in Northern Ireland is not improving.  The fact that every week several more people die in awful circumstances should suggest to all of us, in this House, in the British Parliament, in the Irish and British Governments, that it is not appropriate to stick to some of your historical aims if a little give and take would help to reduce the loss of life and the suffering which afflict people in that unhappy part of this country.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the developments in defence in Europe generally and to comment on what I think is an appropriate way of looking at it from the Irish point of view.  Within the past nine months, since the Summit at Reykjavik last September, there have been very considerable developments and potential developments in regard to the shorter range tactical nuclear weapons on the continent of Europe.  There is now a distinct possibility that the Americans and the Russians may agree to their withdrawal. There is a certain reluctance among many of our partners in western Europe because of the problems it will give rise to for them.  One can understand their reluctance because tactical short range nuclear weapons were almost their line of defence.  It is necessary for them and for us to rethink the situation if this <Col N="3877" /> fundamental change comes about.  They are doing so and I appreciate their difficulties.</P>
    <P>It seems to be quite unreal that when our partners in the European Economic Community and generally in the European continent discuss these matters among themselves &mdash; there can be few matters of more importance &mdash; we feel it necessary to absent ourselves from such discussions as if they did not matter to us.  What can matter more to us?  Should we, as a country that has sought to describe itself as neutral militarily, peace-loving and peacekeeping, not be among the first in Europe to welcome a situation if these nuclear weapons are withdrawn from the Continent by the Americans and the Russians?  Yet we seem to preclude ourselves for some obscure reason that has no logic but because of some kind of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;historical convention to this effect.  I would like to think that the day when an Irish Taoiseach feels it is incumbent on him either to take no part in a conversation on these matters or to absent himself from the room when such conversations are going on is at an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw my poor old former colleague, Paddy Lalor, who gets into a bit of trouble from time to time, getting into trouble again last week and he was reprimanded in the most severe way.  He was perfectly entitled to speak about the matters which he spoke about and to express the view which he expressed.  It is one of these untouchable areas but it had very rapidly better become not just touchable but should be the subject of debate in this country, in this House and by the representatives of this country in appropriate fora abroad.  If this development takes place &mdash; and we should universally welcome it &mdash; it will have a considerable bearing on the size of the conventional weaponry and armies which <Col N="3878" /> will have to be maintained in western Europe.  We had better think about that.</P>
    <P>Western Europe generally allowed itself to continue for many years in a situation where it was out-numbered conventionally by as much as six and seven to one but it did not matter because of the particular form of defence which NATO would use, and made it known they would use, after the first couple of days.  It may matter a great deal now.  We should begin to think about where we stand in this regard.  I am not entirely proud to be a citizen of the most defenceless country in western Europe.  There is something less than complete about a neutrality which is indefensible in the military sense when I contrast it with a neutrality which is very heavily defended by a number of neutral states in Europe.  Given our economic circumstances, some of the choices which we might have to make are not easy but I do not know how long we can put off making them.</P>
    <P>I found the Taoiseach's speech predictable but a little disappointing.  No effort is being made to come to grips with changing what needs to be changed. Everything is discussed within the context of matters as they are.  A matter such as the appointment of a new Minister of State is regarded as a major institutional innovation and of great political significance. Unhappily, these matters are quite peripheral.  We need to get to grips fundamentally with a public administrative system that has gone out-of-date. Many things in this country have gone out-of-date, not least this House and its procedures.  For example, I was told over a five minute period that I could not propose an amendment to a motion because the motion was an amendment to some other motion.  Many things need to be changed.  It is disappointing to find such conservative thinking in terms of the acceptance of so many things as they are and the belief that only marginal changes are needed in so many of these matters.</P>
    <P>One of the more interesting parts of the Taoiseach's speech was when he said: &ldquo;I do not think that anyone can point to a Government in recent times which <Col N="3879" /> published such a comprehensive programme in a general election and which followed through on that programme so thoroughly and expeditiously&rdquo;.  I did not like to interrupt the Taoiseach to ask him if he was referring to the 1987 general election.  If he was, his recollection of it is somewhat different from mine.  I can scarcely remember any political party ever producing less of a programme and what they did produce could hardly be described as having been followed through thoroughly and expeditiously.  I would hardly have thought that their attitude, for example, to the Single European Act was a thorough and expeditious following through of what they had said before the election.  The same applies to their attitude to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to &ldquo;the sick, the old and the handicapped&rdquo; and to the construction industry into which, in addition to all the existing grants, an additional £250 million was to be pumped forthwith.</P>
    <P>Last night I came across in a different context another undertaking in that manifesto which interests me.  It indicates how anxious Fianna Fáil were at the time to pick up every possible vote. They undertook during January and February to restore and revamp Bord na gCapall which was regarded as a vital body which had been shamefully deprived of funds at the beginning of the year by the outgoing Coalition Government. I do not know whether restore and revamp are the right words in all the circumstances.  In conclusion, I might invent a new word in this context, that is, &ldquo;remasculate&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Before calling on Deputy Desmond, perhaps I will endeavour to explain to Deputy O'Malley in layman's language the situation in respect of his amendment, in respect of the Labour amendment and in respect of the Workers' Party amendment. Vote 3, part of the miscellany of Votes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 36, is the only Vote that has been moved and that is the motion before the House.  Therefore, the <Col N="3880" /> amendments that appear are not in order because they are not amendments to that motion which has been technically moved.  That, more succinctly is the position I was endeavouring to explain earlier and I hope Deputy O'Malley appreciates that.  We are taking the motion for the Adjournment for discussion with Vote 3 that has been moved.  The motion for the Adjournment has not been moved.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party will be opposing the motion that the House should adjourn to a date which is not specified because the indications are that the proposal will be to adjourn the House until late October.  We will be opposing that motion because there is a great deal of legislative work to be done in Dáil Éireann in the remainder of the year. It is wholly inadequate that we should adjourn the House and resume late in October leaving a mere eight weeks before we adjourn for Christmas in mid-December. We are not ensuring that the work of running the country is controlled by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach intends that Seanad Éireann should meet during the months of July and September but that is not enough.  My party will be publishing next Thursday a revised Children Bill which will consist of 130 sections incorporating, in addition to the old Children Bill, major issues such as under age drinking, the sale of tobacco and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in that capacity for today.  It is our wish that our Children Bill should be enacted, or at least debated during Private Members' Time, during 1987.  However, that is unlikely.  I should like to point out to the House that that elementary piece of social legislation, the enactment of new provisions relating to the care and the protection of children, has gone on in Dáil Éireann under successive Ministers since 1974.  It has taken no less than 30 years to have a children Bill brought before the House.  That is one example of how desultory, tedious and ineffective the work of the House is. It is understandable, that the electorate should be disenchanted with the way the conduct of the nation is progressing.  They are disenchanted by the fact that we will <Col N="3882" /> have from the end of June to the middle of October with no formal parliamentary work to do.  Admittedly, our committees can meet during that time.  They were set up this morning but it is interesting to note that most of them have not met since 1986.</P>
      <P>We hope those committees will meet during July and September but if I know the process of tedium and the disappearing act that can go on they may not meet at all until September.  They may meet on one occasion in July, appoint a chairman and adjourn.  That is not the way to run the country or Dáil Éireann.  It certainly does not help the public esteem of Deputies.  For those reasons, which are legitimate we will be voting against the Adjournment of the Dáil.  The days are gone when we have morning lawyers and afternoon politicians or when the House adjourns early so that Members can go back to their farms to save the hay, go fishing for a couple of months or disappear to the Continent.  They were the good old days in the twenties and thirties when those with money, the elite, inhabited Leinster House.  I gather they were the only reasons for us following the Westminster model of prolonged adjournment during the summer period.  I ask the Taoiseach who has not announced the date of the resumption, to call a double bluff and come back in September.  That would be fair and reasonable and I am sure Deputies would thoroughly enjoy the months of July and August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of the Labour Party to this debate will be consistent with our attitude down the years.  It does not give me any great pleasure to say, in relation to the events of the last few weeks, that the only party in Dáil Éireann displaying a consistency on economic and social policies is the Labour Party.  If one examines the taxation policy one will see that we have been consistent in our views in the last seven or eight years.  An examination of social welfare policies will show that generally we have not deviated from our approach to the reform of the system of social welfare or the development of <Col N="3883" /> it where necessary.  For example, we supported the introduction of a child benefit scheme and it was unfortunate that it was frozen in the last budget.  We have been consistent in our policies in regard to the health services.  Since the early seventies our party have not deviated from a consistent and honourable policy in regard to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have been consistent in regard to our national resources.  I heard Deputy Bruton three weeks ago suggesting that we should change the terms for oil exploration and he was prepared to change the minimum royalty terms.  The Labour Party were under enormous pressure inside and outside of Government in regard to those terms but we refused to bend.  We have been proved right.  The Government were due to announce in two weeks major changes in oil exploration terms but I gather that the Minister for Energy has done a disappearing act because the oil is not out there and the oil terms could have been changed before the recent debacle of Atlantic Resources, and we would have been hoist with our own petard.  To his eternal credit the former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald who was under enormous pressure from very powerful influences to literally hand over oil resources to a small private group of people, to literally hand over the first 50 million barrells for nothing, resisted that and so did the former Tánaiste, Deputy Spring.  The Labour Party in Government or in Opposition have been consistent on the question of protecting our public enterprises.  At the same time, we have not been in the conservative mould, as alleged by Deputy O'Malley, of trying to maintain institutions simply for their own sake.  We have not succumbed to that malaise.</P>
    <P>On economic and social policy there has been a general consistency on the part of the Labour Party in their work in this House whether in Government or in Opposition but that consistency has flown out the window as various parties have endeavoured to accommodate themselves to the exigencies of the political situation.  There has been virtually no <Col N="3884" /> consistency on the part of the present Government party.  The real question now is to what extent will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance &mdash; I suppose that they are the two people who effectively run the party and run the rest of the cabinet &mdash; maintain the current policy.  So far, despite my profound agreement with the Government's policy on taxation measures and my profound disagreement with them on health cuts, there has been an absolute consistency.  The line has not deviated.  I do not agree with the line but it has not deviated.  How long will it last? That is the question.  Is it for real?  All the indications so far are that it is for real but there is a legitimacy in asking the question repeatedly because I do not know of one political correspondent, one financial correspondent or one business person who does not repeatedly ask me: &ldquo;Is the Taoiseach for real on this occasion?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On many a previous occasion, and I can go back to my entry to this House in 1969, there has been an innate tendency to change policy as the going gets rough, to change it rapidly and to change it in many directions.  That consistency has been manifestly evident in a whole range of areas.  So far in the past four months in Government Fianna Fáil have rapidly increased the PAYE burden.  We tend to forget there has been no tax relief this year and that is in marked contrast to the formal promise repeated time and time again.  Cast your mind back to the Burlington Hotel, to the launching of the plan for national recovery, the serried ranks of civil servants and the serried ranks of the business community who were going to put fat cheques into the hands of the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to fight the campaign. The promise was unequivocal: &ldquo;Within the framework of our return to Government two-thirds of the taxpayers of this country will be on the standard rate of tax&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an objective.  That is an interesting word.  In fact, it appears in the Taoiseach's speech today as if it had actually happened.  If you write this officialese often enough it will appear as if it has happened.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Our most important objective in income tax is to bring two-thirds of taxpayers down to the standard rate. This will be a major reform of the tax burden and will be achieved under the programme we are now elaborating.</P>
      <P>This is an example of the comprehensive and complementary approach we are adopting to putting the economy back on the path to growth and expansion. </P>
      <P>It is as if it has happened.  If you say it frequently enough people may well believe it.  What has happened?  In fact, this year there will be a very major increase in the burden of taxation on ordinary taxpayers because there is no indexation, there is no reduction, there is no increase in allowances.  That is after four months of Fianna Fáil Government. There is substantially increased taxation. For example, health contributions are now payable up to £15,000 and they are payable at an increased rate of 1¼ per cent.  In their four months in Government Fianna Fáil have abolished the farm tax. It would be interesting to know how many of the farm profile forms have gone out from the Revenue Commissioners.  I doubt if any have gone out.  It appears that the legislation dealing with health contributions is manifestly defective. Admittedly, this is an embarrassment for the Taoiseach because both he and the late Deputy Colley signed the health contributions commencement order on 6 April 1979, and the regulations were coming into effect on 4 April, thus rendering them null and void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Dáil is going into recess tomorrow and this is an out for anyone who does <Col N="3886" /> not wish to pay his health contributions. Because of the profound embarrassment facing the Taoiseach who signed this order when he was Minister for Health, the present Minister has not come into the House with a simple three line amending Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations in my time were not challenged but if they had been I know what I would have done. Within 24 hours I would have brought into the Dáil a three line amending Bill to make sure that those who are giving the two fingers to the health boards and saying they cannot be brought to court for arrears in health contributions, pay up.  As Labour Party spokesperson for Finance I would agree to amend those regulations because there are about £14 million to £15 million arrears uncollected. Meanwhile, every industrial worker will pay increased contributions from 1 per cent to 1¼ per cent.  He does not have any legislative mechanism open to him to avoid that imposition.</P>
      <P>In the past four months we have had increased health contributions, increased hospital charges, both in-patient and out-patient, and we have had a decision of the Government not to fill 2,000 vacancies in the health services.  This means that not one hospital in the country will take on any student nurses this year.  In my constituency, St. Michael's Hospital at this time of the year would normally take on about 35 student nurses, but they are not taking on even one this year.  The Government have decided to take £80 million out of the health services this year thus causing appalling hardship for many sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interesting thing about the Taoiseach's speech is that there is not one <Col N="3887" /> single reference to the health services. The Minister for Health has been hung out to dry, as is the tradition of Cabinets when they find the going rough.  The Taoiseach did not devote one line of this 28 page speech &mdash; if we cut out the rhetoric there would probably be about six pages &mdash; to a defence of the health cuts. The words &ldquo;Health services&rdquo; do not even appear in his speech.  <i>The Way Forward</i>, this basic biblical document of the Fianna Fáil Party, had plenty to say about health, but there is no reference to the subject in the Taoiseach's speech.  It is as if it does not exist.  That is why I must ask this question: is the Taoiseach's policy for real?</P>
    <P>Another Minister has done an interesting disappearing act &mdash; the Minister for Social Welfare.  He is much cuter at hiding cuts which are manifestly evident. Unemployment benefit has been cut causing serious hardship and the qualification for unemployment benefit has been increased to 39 weeks from 26 weeks.  I know part time teachers who at the end of the season have 30 stamps and some have 26 stamps but they do not have a chance of qualifying for unemployment benefit this year.  They will have to emigrate for the summer.  Many of these people are young with good academic qualifications, living in flats around Dublin.  There are many such people in my constituency who will have to emigrate. They pay their stamps but they do not get entitlement because they do not have 39 insurance stamps to qualify for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Is that the kind of society we want to develop here, where people's social insurance entitlements are cut over night?  From 5 April 1987 new claims were cut.  The same applies to disability benefit.  A person must now have been at least nine months in work, as against six months previously, before he qualifies for disability benefit.  The Minister for Social Welfare has got away scot free in terms of the cuts in social welfare which have been imposed.  Pay related benefit has been slashed in half.  When the Hyster workers go to draw pay related benefit <Col N="3888" /> with their unemployment benefit, they will find it has been cut by 50 per cent, despite the fact that up to 5 April 1987 they paid their full pay related contributions. Apparently contributions do not matter very much because their actual benefit is cut.  Every Hyster worker with a wife and two children will have a straightforward cut of £20 a week, and 240 of these people are now unemployed and getting reduced unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party pointed out all these matters before we left the last Government. We pointed them out in the Cabinet and on the steps of Government Buildings.  We told the Irish people this is what would happen within the framework of the health services, but we did not get much thanks in the election. Why?  Because the Fianna Fáil Party were saying two thirds of taxpayers would be paying the standard rate of 25 per cent within two or three years, the Progressive Democrats went further in a Dutch auction pretending they are good, solid, quiet, effective economists.  They proceeded to vary the bribes to the electorate. Deputy O'Malley said there would be cuts in income tax to 31, 43 and 53 per cent, three new but interesting rates, as part of the first phase of their tax reform programme.  He also assured us of the elimination of the 7½ per cent PRSI, youth and health levies on the first £3,000 income for all earners.  That was interesting, but how was he going to do all that?</P>
    <P>The cost would be met by adjustments in the PAYE and PRSI allowances.  He would also meet it by a reduction in life assurance relief, but primarily it would be met from matching cuts in public expenditure.  It is interesting to note that so far current Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP has been reduced from 56.2 per cent to 55 per cent.  That is the net outturn of this budget.  No sooner did the cuts in public expenditure appear than Deputy O'Malley said they did not agree with the way they were being implemented.  They accepted the bottom line but disagreed about the internal structure of the cuts.  That is total <Col N="3889" /> hypocrisy.  To bolster his argument he referred to the 1982 Dale Tussing report which is now acknowledged to be based on faulty household budget samples. Even the Irish College of General Practitioners, without much expertise in the field, were able to take it apart in terms of the surveys done and the work presented. There was not much response to the report because it was inconsistent. However, the report was the rationale for the rejection by the Progressive Democrats of the cuts in the health services. Indeed, their approach has been inconsistent because even in terms of the proposal put forward in the last general election on the basic taxation measures their costings were out by about £120 million.  On the carry-over to the 1987 budget they were wrong on the expenditure side of £400 million.</P>
    <P>It does not give me any pleasure to say that the Fine Gael Party have not been consistent in recent weeks in their approach, particularly to the Health Estimate. They know perfectly well they cannot have it both ways on the fundamental issue of the health services. Nobody knows better than the current front-bench of the Fine Gael Party that a net Exchequer provision for the health services of £1,111 million would result in mayhem.  It was evident when the Estimate was being put together in October, November, December and in January when it was published and it is not good enough to say in the House that they agree with the overall level of the Health Estimate but not about the way the budget is broken down and to suggest, as Deputy O'Malley did, that the Department of Health, do not know how to allocate the money is hypocrisy of the highest order.  If there is only so much money in an Estimate it must be broken down and inevitably will result in job losses and grave hardship for the electorate. It does not matter how you break down the Estimate, it will still impose hardship, even on mentally handicapped people, because you cannot ask a health board to protect them while penalising psychiatric nurses who look after them. Mentally handicapped people suffer in <Col N="3890" /> spite of the strictures from the Department of Health urging that they should be excluded from cuts.  Voluntary organisations got an increase of around 5 per cent this year.  They are protected but you cannot do the same at health board level because the services are totally integrated.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for Fine Gael to say there is incompetence in the health boards, among consultants, administrators, in the Department of Finance and in the Department of Health and that if the system could be overhauled and reformed there would be sufficient money.  That is a threadbare argument which is trotted out every day by the PDs. Unfortunately their health spokesperson succumbed to that argument in recent weeks and was in a totally untenable position in the past few days.  I reject such an approach just as I reject the statement in the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which said:</P>
    <P>We simply cannot afford a place among the leaders of the industrialised world when it comes to spending on health. </P>
    <P>Who said we cannot?  By what criterion can we not?  We are spending 6.4 per cent of our GNP on health which is a very low figure relative to any other European country.  Those who talk about getting the Government off the back of people and reducing taxation do not know what they are talking about.  There are not sufficient people employed to run the health services and the areas of health, education, environment and social welfare are all run down.  It also affects job creation programmes.  I am sick and tired of the shibboleths trotted out in this House, particularly by the PDs, who say it is time to eliminate unnecessary institutional structures and that we should privatise Mickey Mouse private forests, which would solve our problems.  The PDs also said they welcomed the statement by the Minister for Education that we should privatise school transport as if that would resolve the problem of providing a school transport system.  These <Col N="3891" /> are simplistic statements with very little basis in fact.</P>
    <P>The ultimate provision for privatisation, according to the PDs, is that we should sell Irish Life for £200 million which would put the country back on its feet.  Proposals of this sort will not resolve the fundamental problems facing us and they should be rejected by the electorate as they would not have a long-term impact.  The persistent statements by the Fianna Fáil economic Ministers that if we had an automatic reduction in interest rates the country would suddenly embark on a two stage process of recovery is pure, unadulterated monetarism.   We can have exceptionally low interest rates and still have very high levels of unemployment. The correlation between low interest rates and job creation is not interlocking or immutable.</P>
    <P>Equally we have had the nonsense trotted out by the Taoiseach today that because he was elected we have a massive inflow of funds into the country.  The inflow and outflow of funds on the capital markets of our country are profoundly influenced by factors other than a change of Government, whether it be the previous or present Government.  I suggest very strongly that we shall have a quite serious visitation upon us as interest rates will drop.  No doubt in the next four or five months they will drop by 1 or 2 per cent but it is not axiomatic that automatically there will be a reduction in the level of unemployment or that the economy will suddenly take off.  That has not been proved in any of the western European economies.  The reasons for the improvement in the south of England have very little to do with the dramatic drop in interest rates in the UK, any more than the substantial growth of the deficit in the United States could be directly related to the fact that interest rates have dropped there.</P>
    <P>The interlocking relationship which is assumed almost as one of the Ten Commandments of economic policy is rather an outdated 1960 monetarism which certainly became very popular with the British Conservative Party.  However, any <Col N="3892" /> self-respecting British Chancellor of the Exchequer would not refer to it even in a lack lustre after-dinner speech to a group of first year economic students. The analogy drawn by the Taoiseach and the constant reference to low interest rates by the Government will be regretted. Unfortunately, it has become entrenched in our general approach to economic recovery and when it will not come true the reaction will be all the more severe.</P>
    <P>I want to welcome &mdash; and again it is a matter of consistency &mdash; the statement made by the Taoiseach in relation to Northern Ireland.  He has shown no consistency whatsoever in this regard. However, I am pleased to note the change on his part and particularly on the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has shown admirable strength of purpose in his handling of Northern Ireland affairs.  Deputy Lenihan has surprised me and I want to put on record my support for his attitude to the Northern Ireland question and in particular for his attitude to the violence and thuggery which has gone on there and his firmness in responding particularly to the savagery imposed by the Provisional IRA.  I am glad to note that the Government intend to adhere to the mechanisms of the Conference and the Secretariat and that they will continue to pursue, through the Conference, the achievement of equality of opportunity and the elimination of discrimination in Northern Ireland.  I am glad to note that they will continue to seek reforms in the administration of justice and that all these approaches will be carried on in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach. That is entirely welcome.  If there has been, as unquestionably there has, a massive change of policy in the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this question, then that is to be entirely welcomed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to make one broad statement about the level of public finances because this is central to the Taoiseach's speech.  In endeavouring to stabilise our growing national debt, and it is a matter of profound consequence <Col N="3893" /> running at £25.3 billion, the crucial question of stabilising the national debt as a percentage of GNP is, first, the pace at which adjustments are made and, secondly, the manner in which they are made.  This year's budget has been excessively deflationary and in that sense has been a bad budget.  The cuts on the social services side have not been made in a fair or equitable manner.  The changes in taxation have been irrelevant in bringing a degree of equity into the exercise of stabilising the national debt as a percentage of GNP.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party feel that any review of expenditure must in particular take into account the very large State subventions which are in other areas of the economy, notably in agriculture. There are massive transfers to the agricultural side and, indeed, the many and indirect subsidies which are available to the relatively better off in our society. People write to me looking for an extra couple dozen of incontinent pads for a mentally handicapped child, as their allocation has been reduced to a couple of pads a day when five or six are urgently needed.  Families on low income are deprived of such an elementary social service while we continue to give, for example, tax relief at the maximum rate for those who want to join Plan D, Plan E or the other plans of the VHI.  Where is the equity there in our taxation system?</P>
    <P>Has any effort been made by the Fianna Fáil Party to assess the inequity of the changes in the reductions on the taxation side?  I do not at all go along with the alternative view that you can resolve a problem by bringing in prescription charges and get £12 million there.  It would be even more inequitable if one were to impose a burden on an old age pensioner living on £47 a week by imposing a £2 charge per prescription.  To say that such a person can approach the community welfare officer for help merely extends the problem.</P>
    <P>I repeat there are plenty of people, particularly the young, who will go into public houses this weekend and will not mind lashing out, £10 or £15 on three rounds of drinks for themselves and their <Col N="3894" /> pals.  Plenty of people will spend a fortune over the summer at race meetings and on foreign holidays.  Who could blame them when you think of the weather we are having at the moment?  Plenty of people will buy new cars and will spend plenty on petrol without giving it a thought. They are not that wealthy but they are relatively well off as compared with those on whom we are imposing very grave hardship by the cuts in social welfare and in health.  These cuts were really unnecessary because the £100 million gap could have been closed on an equitable basis.  Unfortunately Fianna Fáil in panic drifted to the right and became enmeshed in a budget which was inherently unfair.</P>

      <P>Because a date has not been specified for our return we have put down an amendment for a return on 2 September.  At a time of growing dissension among the public and when there has already been much discussion about the relevance of Parliament, this adds to the growing sense of irrelevance of the Dáil.  A four months Adjournment would be appalling.  As far back as <Col N="3895" /> November 1983 in a submission to Deputy J. Bruton who was in charge of Dáil reform at that time we said that the present length of the Dáil Recess had seriously undermined the credibility of the Oireachtas and its Members among the general public.  We said that the recess at Christmas and Easter should not be more than three weeks and that the summer recess should not be more than two months.  A number of submissions which we made were adopted, for instance having a different Minister on Questions each day and limits of 30 minutes on speeches but the motion in regard to the recess was not accepted. Perhaps the Taoiseach is considering an early return and perhaps that is why we are having this exceptionally early recess. Not since I have been in here anyway has the Dáil gone into recess on 26 June.</P>
      <P>Never before have a Government broken so many promises and betrayed the electorate in such a short space of time.  Never in such a short space has an Administration engaged in such a dazzling series of U-turns on almost every position it held while in Opposition and during the course of the election campaign. The people unfortunately now find themselves with a party in Government who apparently have cast aside all principles in regard to previously stated positions. They must have shocked their most ardent supporters by the turnabouts they have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December last the Fianna Fáil Party voted against the Single European Act on two occasions and without even blushing they exhorted the electorate to vote for the same Act in the recent referendum. Deputy Haughey, while in Opposition found the Anglo-Irish Agreement totally unacceptable and possibly unconstitutional but he now finds no difficulty in operating it.  The Fianna Fáil Party rightly opposed school bus charges when they were introduced in 1983 under the Coalition Government, but they were hardly in office when they raised the school bus charges.  Fianna Fáil opposed local charges and campaigned against <Col N="3896" /> them in the 1985 local elections, on various local councils and again in the general election.  They now find that these local charges are indispensable.  Most cruel of all were the posters Fianna Fáil put up during the course of the election with regard to the Coalition budget and to the health cuts.  The posters said that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped. Now that they are in Government they are hitting the old, the sick and the handicapped twice as badly as the previous Government proposed.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the Irish people are so disillusioned and cynical?  Is it any wonder that most politicians in this country are held in the sort of contempt that was once reserved for the bailiff and the landlord's agent?  The people are scratching their heads and wondering what they must do to get a change of political direction and not just a change of Government.  The attempt of the people to use their democratic rights to change Government policy has been totally frustrated. This is raising a new element of dissent among the people.</P>
    <P>In January last the former Government, one of the most despised and unpopular of all times, introduced a budget which led to their collapse and a subsequent general election.  The election was fought on the basis of the budget with Fine Gael defending it and Fianna Fáil attacking it vigorously.  Deputy Haughey and his colleagues donned the mantle of champions of the poor, defenders of the weakest sections of society, and fearless opponents of health and welfare cuts, simply to win the working class vote.</P>
    <P>The people voted on February 17 to give Fine Gael and their policies their marching orders.  Fianna Fáil and Deputy Haughey were returned to power, but within weeks the people found to their cost just how worthless a Fianna Fáil election promise was, when the budget they had voted so massively to reject in the election was reintroduced by Fianna Fáil in an even more severe version.  The intent of this Government was clearly signalled by the budget, and the cutbacks which have been imposed since then have <Col N="3897" /> been even more draconian, even more sweeping, even more damaging than those of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition. They were all shown in the budget and as Deputy Desmond pointed out the hypocrisy of the PDs in particular and of Fine Gael is evident in the fact that they voted for the budget, for the cuts, and are now attempting to show they are opposing them.</P>
    <P>Given the political history of Fianna Fáil, it is, I suppose not all that surprising that they should have done so many U-turns. But what I find astonishing is that so many commentators and leader writers in the media should now be lavishing such praise on Deputy Haughey for what we and his electors believe to be his despicable conduct.  Are we to believe that those who write these articles consider that saying one thing before an election and doing the direct opposite when in office, constitutes political leadership? Are we being asked to believe that to betray those who voted for you constitutes statemanship?  The St. Paul like conversion of Deputy Haughey to the policies he was opposing up to February last, has shaken all three conservative parties in the Dáil to their very foundations. Fine Gael, under Deputy Dukes, has proven to be the most cowardly and inept Opposition party in living memory.  They have totally devalued the meaning of the word &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;, and have more often than not run for the cover of abstention, having neither the courage to publicly vote with the Government nor the nerve to risk their own political skins by opposing the Government in the lobbys and provoking a general election.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dukes had any courage he would do the decent thing and move himself and his Deputies across to the other side of the House and accept ministries if they could get them and go into a direct Coalition on the policies they believe in and which Fianna Fáil are promoting.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Progressive Democrats have been running around like headless chickens having found that their political feathers have been stolen by Fianna Fáil <Col N="3898" /> who are now implementing basically the same policies the Progressive Democrats called for before and during the general election.  Deputy O'Malley and his colleagues have been reduced to calling votes on the Order of Business in order to remind people that they are an Opposition party.  That is not to say that the manner in which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have conspired to ram through important issues of business without adequate time for consideration is not deplorable or that it is acceptable for the two largest parties in the Dáil to exclude all others when arrangements are being made as to when particular items will be taken.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Deputy O'Malley, when speaking on this issue, talked about the exclusion of the third and fourth parties from their rightful positions.  He would have no hesitation, of course, in excluding the fifth party from anything.  I would find the protests of Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Spring with regard to the rights of the smaller Opposition parties more convincing if they had shown this concern when they held Cabinet positions.  The last Government, with the enthusiastic endorsement of the Labour Party made every possible effort to exclude The Workers' Party from all areas of activity.  During the term of office of the last Government we were excluded from every committee that existed in this House.  We were given no time whatsoever for Private Members' Business and the rules for Question Time were altered to allow for a priority questions' scheme.  That was to limit the impact of our party at Question Time.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new about agreements between Government and main Opposition parties.  The Coalition Government imposed guillotines and limited debates. They were a normal feature of life in the last Dáil and there is no doubt that the new arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael has meant that they have been used more widely and in a more severe form than ever before.  One of the worst examples of this was on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last week.  We tabled over 20 amendments and none of <Col N="3899" /> them was given any proper chance of being discussed on Committee Stage. During this week only 90 minutes was allowed to debate the National Monuments Bill on which more than 40 amendments were tabled, eight of which were put down by The Workers' Party.  On Committee Stage of that Bill in the Seanad 72 amendments were put down and there was a long discussion on the Bill while the debate in this House was limited to one and a half hours.</P>
    <P>One of the most frequent accusations hurled against TDs by the Press and the public is that they do not devote enough time to legislative duties and are far more interested in being messenger boys for the public and for their constituents. When TDs do take their duties seriously, examine legislation in detail and take the time and trouble to draft amendments to legislation they are more often than not, as in the examples I quoted, denied the time to have a proper debate or to have their amendments considered.</P>
    <P>There is a need to review fundamentally the way in which we carry out our duties and responsibilities as legislators. We are trying to run a country at the end of the 20th century and about to move into the 21st century on a model of parliamentary procedure which has changed little since the twenties.  The last Government came into office with major promises of Dáil reform, but little was done apart from some minor tinkering with Question Time and Estimate debates.  The standing of the Dáil among the general public is not high, and if it is not to be diminished even further, there must be an urgent and serious effort to up-date our procedures to ensure that legislation is properly examined before it goes through, to enable us to respond promptly and efficiently to issues that arise at short notice &mdash; there is no way we can do that at present &mdash; and to generally make our operation more relevant to the problems and difficulties of the people.</P>
    <P>The one area of Government policy which has met with particular criticism has of course been the health cutbacks. If anyone on the Fianna Fáil benches <Col N="3900" /> had any doubt about the depth of the opposition &mdash; not just among the health workers but among the community in general &mdash; to their attacks on the health services, then they must surely have had the position clarified very clearly for them by the huge demonstration in Dublin yesterday when 20,000 to 30,000 people marched in the biggest political demonstration since the tax marches in 1980.</P>
    <P>People from all walks of life marched and demonstrated because they realise that what is going on now is not simply another series of cuts, but a systematic dismemberment of the public health service. This service was painfully and slowly built up over the years and was improving all the time.  Now it is being savagely cut and destroyed into a two tier system. What we are witnessing is an attempt to end the concept of a public health service and replace it with an insurance-based health service so that the quality and speed of the service a person receives will depend on their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>The hallmark of any civilised society is its treatment of the elderly and the ill yet it is these categories, particularly those from the lower income groups, who will suffer most.  Those who can afford private medical care, those who can afford to pay for treatment in the luxurious surroundings of the Mater Private Hospital or the Blackrock Clinic will not suffer.  The elderly person living alone depending on a public health nurse, the child awaiting heart surgery in Crumlin hospital, the mother with an incontinent child or adult depending on a health board for nappies and so on are the ones who are carrying the burden of the health cuts.  It is significant that while 104 beds have been closed in Blanchardstown hospital the Blackrock Clinic is expanding by 100 beds.  There is very big money in private health care for the wealthy.</P>
    <P>Despite the assurances to the contrary given by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and other Ministers, there is no doubt that the standard of patient care has already fallen as a result of these cuts. There is no doubt also that it will fall even more if they are not stopped.  Despite <Col N="3901" /> assurances that the hospital out-patient and in-patient charges would be administered in a humane way we have had complaints from people whose children were refused treatment in casualty units in Dublin hospitals simply because they did not have the money with them to pay the £10 charge.</P>
    <P>Putting highly trained medical staff out of jobs is false economy.  The highly trained doctors, nurses and technicians who are being forced out of their jobs are unlikely to get alternative employment in Ireland and will have no option but to emigrate.  Their services and expertise will be lost to the country.  The money spent on their training will have been wasted so far as the Irish people are concerned. By the end of this year 3,500 jobs will have been lost in the health services. This is at a time when 250,000 people are already unemployed.  This is the equivalent of two Hyster close downs per month during the next six or seven months.  Blanchardstown which lost those jobs when Hyster closed will lose another 150 jobs in the hospital as a result of the health cuts.  These cuts, monstrous job losses and the danger to people's health are because other people will not pay their taxes.</P>
    <P>It is not just in the health area that the cutbacks are having a disastrous effect. The reduction in the allocation to local government is bringing the local authorities to their knees.  In the Dublin area, for instance, a halt has been put to the maintenance of local authority houses which will lead to a deterioration in the fabric of the houses and it means they will have to be replaced earlier.  In Dublin it now takes up to seven days to get a blocked sewer cleared.  There is no point in having local authorities unless they are given money to enable them to function effectively.</P>
    <P>The next area where I fear the cutbacks will have a devastating impact is in education. The effect has not been felt here yet but it will be after the summer holidays. This will be at a time when the Dáil will be in recess unless the amendments which are put down for an early return are accepted.  When the schools and colleges <Col N="3902" /> reopen in September parents, teachers and pupils will be presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> which will mean larger classes, reduced facilities, more charges, no funding for school building or additions to schools.  The recent increase in school bus fares is only the tip of the iceberg.  The most frightening comment of all, that of the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, was when she said on radio last Sunday that they &mdash; in other words, the Government &mdash; were quite entitled to introduce any charge unless they had specifically stated in their manifesto that they would not do so.  That is an indication of what will happen when we go into recess and the charges that are going to be imposed for education, the health services and local authority services and so on.</P>
    <P>The letter from the Taoiseach to his Government Ministers in May, which came into my possession, clearly shows that there will be many more cutbacks and that the Taoiseach's economic strategy is entirely Thatcherite and monetarist &mdash; the two things he condemned consistently in the Coalition Government's policies.  Yet, here he is so clearly demonstrating an even closer affinity to Margaret Thatcher and all her economic thinking in his implementation of economic policy.  The manner in which he does it is devoid of anything imaginative or innovative.  There are simply going to be more and more cutbacks.  There has been no attempt to stimulate growth, create more jobs, introduce new revenue raising areas or move towards tax equity. In his letter to his Ministers he asked that they submit the various cuts by 22 May. In arriving at their proposals he said all options should be considered including the elimination or reduction of particular schemes and programmes, rooting out overlaps and duplication between organisations, the merger of organisations, the closure of institutions, the scaling down of operations of organisations and institutions, the disposal of physical assets.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said a radical approach should be adopted and no expenditure should be regarded as sacrosanct or immune to elimination or reduction. <Col N="3903" /> What a prospect that sets out for the health services, for education, and in particular for those on social welfare which they have not yet got round to tackling. It is also significant in that letter of 13 May to his Ministers the Taoiseach set out a time table asking that these decisions be made on a weekly basis from the end of May so that they would be in a position to have the full programme of reductions agreed by the end of August or early September.  The end of August or early September could indicate the possibility of a further severe budget in the autumn.</P>
    <P>For how long more are the working-class going to be asked to accept cutbacks while the Government refuse to ensure that those who can do so pay their fair share?  When are they going to think about alternative sources of raising revenue? The Government have, in every case where they have come up against those who refuse to pay their taxes taken the easy option of cutbacks on those who are already paying.  Cutbacks in the health service could easily have been avoided if the Government had been prepared to go after additional revenue.  For instance, if the political will was there, the Government could decide to make health contributions payable on all income.  At present the 1 per cent contribution is payable on incomes up to £15,000.  They could decide to make the health contributions payable on all income.  They could also decide to collect all outstanding health contributions from self-employed people, farmers and so on. They could and should decide that all outstanding health contributions should be charged interest on arrears as is the case with income tax.  In this case there is no interest on arrears and if a person can avoid paying for four or five years he will pay no interest on it.  That is the great benefit.  Of course the people who refuse to pay the health contributions are availing of the health services just the same as those who are paying their health contribution. The 1 per cent health levy was raised to 1¼ per cent precisely at the same time as the services available for the extra <Col N="3904" /> 25 per cent increase were being cut and the £10 charge was imposed.  The very people who are paying their taxes are the ones who are getting fewer services.</P>
    <P>The Government could also abolish the tax on VHI premiums for luxury private hospitals.  That single part alone has cost £1.5 million in tax relief.  The whole VHI tax relief system has cost much more than that.  I do not have figures with me but it is in the region of about £35 million or £36 million.  Why should there be tax relief or subsidies for private hospitals, private clinics, private patients at the expense of the public health service?  That is precisely what happens.  As the private health care service increases and develops with subsidies from the State, the public health service deteriorates because the consultants do not give it the same attention.  The Government could also reform the general medical service system particularly by ending the fee per item system of payment for doctors and pharmacists.  They could also take on the common contract system of payment to consultants which has got to be altered.</P>
    <P>They could reform or introduce a drugs formulary to lift out the essential generic drugs from the 3,000 drugs on sale currently to a standard form which would be in the region of 700 or 800 generic drugs required.  That would cut the cost of drugs which are dearer here than in any other country in Europe except West Germany, and three or four times dearer than they are in France.  Substantial savings could be made in the drugs bill.  I ask the Minister to look at the drugs refund scheme.  In the GMS system at present the State will pay the pharmacist the wholesale price of the drug plus a prescription charge for each item.  In the drugs refund scheme, after the initial £28 per month which the patient must pay, the State pays not only the wholesale price and the prescription price but also a 50 per cent retail mark-up to the pharmacist. The end result is that the State in some instances pays the pharmacists more under the drugs refund scheme than it would pay both the doctor and the pharmacist if that patient had a medical card and was entitled to all services free.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3905" /> That is precisely what is happening under the drugs refund scheme because of the 50 per cent retail mark up which the pharmacists have.  There are major savings to be made here, none of them at the expense of the patient.  In addition, under this scheme pharmacists have an incentive to dispense the most expensive drugs because the most expensive brand of drugs prescribed will maximise their income.  The whole area of the payment to pharmacists for drugs requires drastic alteration and change but the Minister has not even mentioned the need to tackle this area of savings which would not interfere in any way with patients. The Minister should deal with this scandal in the general medical service scheme and the drugs refund scheme before closing hospital wards and axing jobs because it is here he could make major savings.</P>
    <P>The report published on Tuesday by two unions representing 2,000 staff in the Revenue Commissioners and which they call, The Sick Tax System &mdash; Proposals for Cost Effective Cure, show that there was more than £660 million outstanding in collectable taxes.  It pointed out that if tax evasion and avoidance was stamped out an additional £1,000 million could be taken in this year and another £500 million next year.  This shows that the cuts mania is not inevitable and that there is a better way, as the Fianna Fáil slogan had it, if the Government were prepared to take the political decision to follow it up and tackle head on the robbers and scroungers in our society who are responsible for the danger to the health of the community in general by their refusal to pay their taxes.  This £660 million in outstanding taxes is money that has gone through all the processes.  At present the Revenue Commissioners are processing £3,000 million, some of which is owed and some which may not be owed, but the sum of £660 million has gone through all the processes and is agreed by everyone, including the Auditor General, to be now properly due.  Included in that money is a figure of approximately £140 million which was taken off the PAYE workers by employers and not paid over to the State.  It sticks in my craw that an <Col N="3906" /> employer could take the money from his employees and not hand it over to the State and that the State does not regard him as a criminal or a robber worthy of ten years in jail, or seven years with good behaviour.  One would expect something in that region for robbing £140 million from the State.  The political will to do that is not there.  The problem with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats is that they will not face up to this issue, but it is no bother to put the jackboot down on the guy who is trying to crawl on the poverty line.  It is very easy to make that person pay a £10 hospital charge to make up for the people who are robbing the State, and who are not paying their due in taxes.</P>
    <P>As pointed out by other speakers, one of the most disappointing features of the Taoiseach's speech was his relegation of jobs to fourth place in his order of priorities. That is the greatest indication of the enormous change which has occurred in Fianna Fáil.  During the election contest the major issue by far was jobs.  Then came tax reform.  Surveys and so on put the jobs issue so far ahead of all others that even the next highest priority was in the halfpenny place.  In his speech the Taoiseach outlined the policy objectives of the Government.  He told us that the Government have now firmly set for themselves the following objectives: to restore the public finances by reducing overall Government expenditure; to reduce Government borrowings, stabilise growth, the national debt and so on; to restore confidence, bring down interest rates, maintain stability of the Irish pound; to stimulate and encourage economic growth, investment and employment in every possible sector &mdash; a kind of half hearted number four on jobs &mdash; and to deal with taxation.  That is the clearest indication of the level of change that took place within the space of a few days of Fianna Fáil being in Government. The dominant issue during the election was jobs.  There was overwhelming evidence during the course of the election that the country was crying out for urgent political action on jobs.  Even those who declared their disinterest in politics and <Col N="3907" /> politicians expressed their anger and frustration on the issue of unemployment and emigration which is an off shoot of that. Parents also expressed their concern and the stress they were experiencing about the future or lack of future of their children. There was a genuine desire to have the Government do something serious, irrespective of national debts or inflation &mdash; do not tell me it is a great thing to see inflation down to 2.8 per cent.  I saw it at nil right throughout the fifties.  When inflation is at nil progress is at nil.  This means just stagnation, it means that we are going down, it means emigration. Unemployment brings down inflation to nothing and that is where we are going now with inflation down to 2.8 per cent, inflation down to nil.  There was no inflation for about ten or 15 years at that stage but there was no progress either.  It is not a point of policy that anybody can be proud of when you have jobs at the stage they are at.  The people wanted the issue of jobs to be tackled irrespective of the books and budgets and what have you.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil is to have any relevance to the people it must make unemployment the number one priority.  This is the biggest failure both of this Government and the previous Government.  The priority of Government is still to satisfy the banks and to hell with a jobs policy.</P>
    <P>Our party believe that ultimate resolution of our economic problems requires a process of socialist planning. We acknowledge that it is unlikely in the immediate future that we would have a socialist majority in the Dáil to allow for such radical change, but notwithstanding that, we believe there must be a response to the call from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for a concerted national effort on job creation.  We believe there is a surprising degree of agreement among serious economists about what needs to be done if we are to begin the process of social and economic reconstruction. There are adequate economic reports to provide a sound basis for action on this task.  At this critical time our party are demanding a serious political initiative <Col N="3908" /> from Government to begin the process of tackling the jobs crisis.  We need a concerted national effort to formulate a national plan and then the political will of Government to carry it out.</P>
    <P>I must refer briefly to the Taoiseach's speech where there is a short reference to the abolition of Bord Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board.  The abolition of the film board was a grave mistake.  The new tax regime that was introduced in the Finance Bill is no substitute for the film board.  Films cannot be made on thin air and the role of the film board was to provide pump-priming finance, that is, finance at the early stage when a concept or an idea was being developed up to the stage where production could begin.  That is the crucial period and that is when support is needed.  It is only when the idea has been developed that private finance can be attracted.  Since the film board were established ten professional feature films and numerous documentaries and training films were produced.  This is one State agency who have been enormously successful on a tiny budget and their abolition was a senseless move.  It will do enormous damage to the prospects of establishing a genuine film industry.</P>
    <P>Next month is the 65th anniversary of the Civil War which marked the bloody and difficult culmination of the struggle for political independence for this part of the country.  After 65 years of self-government, it is surely time to stand back and take stock of what has been achieved in that period and to see how what has been achieved compares with the aspirations of the Proclamation of 1916.  Those who signed the 1916 Proclamation would hardly be impressed by the Ireland of today.  Certainly the Ireland of 1987 is not the sort of society envisaged by James Connolly.  His commitment was unashamedly to the working class, but what sort of freedom have the working class won?</P>
    <P>How can you be free if you have no job and are told that you never will have a job?  How can you be free if, like the Hyster workers in my constituency, you turn up for work one morning and find <Col N="3909" /> that your employers have done a midnight flit?  How can you be free if you are illiterate, as thousands are, or semiliterate, as tens of thousands are?  Where is the freedom of expression and communication we talk about among those people, let alone artistic or intellectual freedom?  Have we lost our understanding of the meaning of that precious word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; just as we have lost our understanding of the meaning of the word &ldquo;republican&rdquo;?  The rich owners of property have achieved their freedom but the working classes, the men of no property as Tone called them, remain exploited and enslaved as they were when James Connolly was shot.  We cannot consider ourselves to be free unless our people at least enjoy the basic freedoms, freedom from fear and from want, freedom for the elderly from fear of muggings, beatings and violation in their homes, freedom for women from fear of rape and assault and violent crimes growing in intensity, freedom for all citizens from terrorist attacks, kidnappings, bomb attacks, and the bullet when they answer their doorbell.</P>
    <P>That is the basic and minimal protection which citizens must expect from the State, but there are other fears which are part of the daily living of working class people.  If you have a job you are in constant fear of losing it or you must work harder for lower pay to hold on to it.  If you have lost your job you have the fear of losing your home through inability to pay the rent or the mortgage.  There is the fear of losing your health or even your life or that of a loved one through inability to pay for the care needed or through the long months or even years on waiting lists for heart surgery or other serious operations.  These are only some of the fears and tensions under which working class people must live because of the greed of the capitalist classes for whom profit is all and people mean nothing.  Is it not unbelievable that at the end of the 20th century after 65 years of independence we must today be still striving for that most basic freedom, freedom from want of food, clothing, shelter, health care and education?  What an <Col N="3910" /> indictment of our so-called freedom that there is less freedom from want down here than in the unfree part of our country which is itself by no means free from want.</P>

      <P>Tá sé i gceist agarnsa sa díospóireacht seo plé le Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta atá faoi mo chúrarn mar Aire Stáit.</P>
      <P>I mbliana tá beagnach £24.5 mhilliún á chur ar fáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta, d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus do Bhord na Gaeilge lena chaitheamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge. Anuas ar an £19,296,000 atá i Leabhar na Meastachán tá soláthar £5,120,000 a chur ar fáil ó fhoinsí eile mar seo a leanas: airleacan a íoctar díreach as an Státchiste leis an Údarás; £5 mhilliun ata i gceist i mbliana; iasachtaí as Ciste na nlasachtaí Áitiúla a cheadaíonn mo Roinnse do thithe sa Ghaeltacht: £120,000 ata i gceist i mbliana.</P>
      <P>Is iad na priomhshuimeanna atá i Leabhar na Meastachan na: £1,625,000 do dheontais tithíochta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht); £1,840,000 do Scéimeanna Feabhsúchain sa Ghaeltacht: áirítear £1,040,000 den tsuirn sin mar chaiteachas caipitil d'fhonn bunstruchtur na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt; £1,590,000 do scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha ar a n-áiritear Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, nuachtán agus irisí Gaeilge; £2,248,000 do Chiste na Gaeilge as a dtugtar deontais do Bhord na Gaeilge agus d'eagrais dheonacha Gaeilge; £10,842,000 d'Údaras na Gaeltachta idir chaiteachas reatha agus chaiteachas caipitil ar dheontais: chomh maith leis an airleacan a luaigh mé tugann sé sin iomlán an chúnaimh ón Stát don Údarás go £15,842,000.</P>
      <P>Is cúis shásaimh dom go bhfuil méadú i mbliana ar an solathar atá á chur ar fáil don Roinn i gcomparáid le Meastachán agus caiteachas na bliana 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá suim £15.842 mhilliún á cur ar fáil ag an Rialtas d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana i gcomparáid leis an £13.179 milliún a tugadh don eagraíocht sin anuraidh agus leis an teacht isteach a bhíonn acu ó fhoinsí eile, mar shampla, ó Chiste <Col N="3911" /> Sóisialta na hEorpa, tá súil agam go mbeifear in ann dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh i rith na bliana ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Baineann £10.842 mhillíun den soláthar iomlán le hairgead vótáilte, i.e., suim £2,322 mhillíun mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do chaiteachas reatha agus £8.520 mhilliun mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do chaiteachas caipitil a úsáidtear chun deontais a íoc mar chabhair chun tionscail nó scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bhunú, a fhorbairt no a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Anuas ar sin tá suim £5 mhilliún údaraithe don Údarás mar airleacain ón bPríomh-Christe chun monarchana a thógáil, scaireanna a cheannach i bhfochuideachtaí agus i gcomhchuideachtaí agus chun maoin a cheannach. Faoi mar is eol don Teach ritheadh an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 1987, le déanaí faoinar méadaíodh an uasteorainn d'airleacain ó £50 milliún go £60 milliun.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé áthas ormsa a fhógairt go raibh meadú, cé gur méadú beag é, arís anuraidh ar líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ó Ghaeltarra Éireann ón Údarás.  Is í seo an cúigiú bliain i ndiaidh a chéile a d'éirigh leis an Údarás an fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoina scáth a mheadú agus tréaslaím a saothar leo.  Ar 31 Nollaig 1986 bhí 4,694 dhuine fostaithe go lánaimseartha sna tionscail éagsúla, is é sin méadú de 35 dhuine ar an bhfigiúr ag deireadh na bliana 1985.</P>
    <P>Leis an airgead mór atá á chur ar fáil ag an Stát don Údarás tá sé riachtanach go mbainfear an sochar is fearr is féidir as an gcaiteachas sin cibé acu an caiteachas ar dheontais, ar thógáil monarchana le ligean ar léas le tionsclóirí nó mar inftieistíocht i gcuideachtaí i atá i gceist.  Tá céimeanna á nglacadh chun go mbainfear an sprioc sin amach.  Tá critéir dhochta leagtha síos chun measúnú a dheanamh ar iarratais ar chabhair le cinntiú gur i leith tograí inmharthana a cheadófar cunamh agus go gcruthófar fostaíocht ar an gcostas is lú is féidir.  Tá mionscrúdú a dheanamh ar na foinsí agus ar na hearnálacha éagsúla óna eascraíonn tograí le <Col N="3912" /> go mbeifear in ann díriú ar na deiseanna fáis is fearr le go mbaintear amach an toradh is fearr as caiteachas na heagraíochta.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an tuarascáil ar an Údarás, ón gComhchoiste den Oireachtas um Chomhlachtaí Stát-tionscanta Tráchtala tá moltaí tábhachtacha déanta inti nach mór a scrúdú go curamach agus tá an scrúdú sin idir lámha i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Tá béim ar leith á cur ag an Údarás ar fhorbairt acmhainní' nádúrtha sna ceantair Ghaeltachta le cupla bliain anuas.  Tá borradh an-mhaith faoi shaothrú na mara ar chósta an iarthair i láthair na huaire, rud a luíonn go mór le pleananna an Rialtais don earnáil áirithe seo.  Lena chois sin tá dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh ar chúrsaí taighde agus forbartha i gcás saothrú sliogéisc agus táthar dóchasach go mbeidh toradh fiúntach ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de agus na tíre i gcoitinne dá bharr.  Tá de bhuntáiste ag an gcaoi ina bhfuil an tionscal seo á fhorbairt ag an Údarás go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag baint tairbhe as ar bhealaí éagsúla toisc go bhfuil na gnéithe taighde, innealtóireachta, táirgíochta agus próiseálta á dtabhairt chun cinn le chéile.</P>
    <P>Tá an Ghaeltacht an-oiriúnach d'fheirmeoireacht éisc agus do shaothrú na mara i gcoitinne.  Is tionscal é a luíonn le nádúr na gceantar sin agus le meon na ndaoine a chónaíonn iontu a bhfuil seantaithí acu ar an bhfarraige agus ar chúrsaí éisc.  Tá dul chun cinn maith bainte amach ag an Údarás go dtí seo i ndáil leis an tionscal sin agus táthar sásta go bhfuil fás mór i ndán dó sna blianta atá romhainn.  Tuigtear ón Údarás go bhfuil breis is 100 duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha agus timpeall 40 duine go páirtaimseartha ar fud na Gaeltachta faoi láthair sa tionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc agus go meastar go bhféadfar suas le 500 post lanaimseartha ar a laghad a chruthú sa tionscal sin sa Ghaeltacht thar thréimhse 10-15 bliana.  Chomh maith leis sin d'fhéadfaí suas le 500 post eile a chur ar fáil i bpróiseáil éisc agus chun seirbhísí a sholáthar don tionscal fheirmeoireacht éisc.  Tuigtear ón Údarás go bhfuil deontais timpeall £8 milliún agus scaireanna de thart faoi £3.5 mhilliún ceadaithe ag an eagraíocht do bhreis <Col N="3913" /> is 50 tionscnamh fheirmeoireacht éisc agus chomh maith leis sin go bhfuil timpeall £2.3 mhilliún ceadaithe ag FEOGA i leith 17 dtogra fheirmeoireacht éisc sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá sé mar aidhm ag an Údarás go mbeadh baint mhór ag pobail na Gaeltachta leis an bhforbairt eacnamaíocht, shóisialta agus chultúrtha ag an leibhéal áitiúil.  Rinneadh an-dul chun cinn faoin Chomórtas Forbartha Pobal a cuireadh tús leis i 1974 agus a raibh mar chuspóir aige na pobail Ghaeltachta a ghríosadh chun páirt níos gmíomhaí a ghlacadh i bhforbairt a gceantar féin trína gcuid riachtanas, deiseanna agus acmhainí forbartha a aithint agus chun céimeanna a ghlacadh chun plean oibre realaioch a chur i bhfeidhm.  Chuir na pobail Ghaeltachta an-spéis sa chomórtas ó thús agus tá réirnse leathan tionscadal forbartha curtha chun cinn dá bharr.  Tá an cumas ag na pobail féin tograí forbartha pobail a chur i gcrích go maith anois a bhuíochas sin do shaothar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Tá scéim nua forbartha agus oideachais dar teideal &ldquo;An Pobal Beo&rdquo; fógraithe ag an Údarás le gairid a mhairfidh ar feadh tréimhse sé bliana (1987-1992).  Faoin scéim sin beidh sé riachtanach go mbeadh plean forbartha bliana, trí bliana nó cúig bliana ullmhaithe ag gach grúpa atá le bheith páirteach.  Molaim go láidir do na coistí forbartha sa Ghaeltacht bheith páirteach sa scéim sin ar mhaithe lena gceantair.</P>
    <P>Bhí áthas orm a fhógairt, tar éis na cáinaisnéise i mbiiana, go leanfaí leis na deontais fheabhsúcháin tithíochta atá le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Rinneadh méadú agus leathnú substaintiúil ar na deontais sin ag deireadh na bliana 1985 agus níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil borradh mór faoi oibreacha den chineál seo ó shin i leith.  Tá éileamh mór ar na deontais &mdash; go háirithe ar na deontais fheabhsúcháin speisialta chun tithe a tógadh roimh 1940 a fheabhsú agus a athnuachan.  Bhí drochbhail ar a lán de na tithe seo ach leis an deontas fial atá le fáil anois, tá feabhas mór curthu orthu agus tá caighdeán na dtithe ag dul i bhfeabhas i gcónaí dá bharr.  Anuraidh ceadaíodh deontais <Col N="3914" /> speisialta i gcás 180 teach a tógadh roimh 1940 agus táthar ag súil go gceadófar níos mó ná sin i mbiiana.</P>
    <P>£1,625,000 atá curtha ar fáil i Meastachán na bliana seo le haghaidh deontais tithíochta idir thógáil agus fheabhsúcháin. Anuraidh críochnaíodh 266 teach nua agus 760 cás eile a bhain le hoibreacha feabhsucháin, sláintíochta agus méaduithe (na tithe a tógadh roimh 1940 san áireamh) le cabhair chaiteachais £1,311,000.  Leis an bhfeabhas mór atá ar an gcaighdeán tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht táim sásta gur leor an soláthar atá ar fáil i mbliana chun freastal ar na riachtanais.  Ní miste a rá go bhfuil measúnú leanúnach á dhéanamh ar na deontais tithíochta atá ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht i bhfianaise an chinnidh nárbh fholáir a dhéanamh faoi dheontais tithíochta lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus an fheabhais sa chaighdeán tithiochta a luaigh mé cheana.</P>
    <P>Bíonn tionchar nach beag ar fhorbairt na Gaeltachta ag na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse agus is cúis bhróid dom go bhfuil méadú suntasach ar sholáthar na bliana seo do na scéimeanna sin &mdash; £1.8 milliún &mdash; i gcomparáid leis an méid a caitheadh orthu i 1986 .i. £1.4 mhilliun. Cabhraíonn na scéimeanna seo le feabhas a chur ar bhunstruchtúr na Gaeltachta trí sholáthar uisce agus saoráidí séarachais a chur ar fáil, saoráidí calaíochta a fheabhsú, bóithre a dheisiú agus mar sin de.  Measaim féin go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an gcúnamh a thugtar chun bóithre áise agus portaigh a dheisiú.  Tá liosta, in ord tosaíochta, de bhóithre den chineál sin a bhfuil obair de dhíth go géar orthu á ullmhú ag mo Roinnse faoi láthair agus meastacháin chostais á fháil ó na comhairlí contae cuí.  Ní gnáthach don Roinn deontas a cheadú mura mbíonn Gaeilge ag formhór de na daoine a mbíonn an bóthar ag freastal orthu agus an bóthar ag freastal ar dhá theach cónaithe ar a laghad nó i gcás bóthar portaigh ag freastal ar 10 líon tí.  Tá súil agam gur gearr anois go mbeidh an t-eolas uile agam atá á bhailiú i gcaoi go mbeidh ar mo chumas na deontais a cheadú.</P>
    <P>Tugtar cúnamh freisin chun hallaí <Col N="3915" /> pobail a thógáil agus a chóiriú agus áiseanna chaitheamh aimsire ar nós páirceanna peile, pinniúir liathróid láimhe, cuirteanna leadóige agus cispheile a sholáthar &mdash; rud a chuireann, ar ndóigh, leis na saoráidí sóisialacha ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bhíodh deontais fhorlíontacha anuas ar dheontais ó Bhord Fáilte ar fáil ón Roinn roinnt blianta o shin chun óstáin nó tithe aíochta nó saoráidí eile a fheabhsú nó a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht faoi Scéim na Cóiríochta Saoire a bhí dírithe ar chuairteoirí a raibh suim acu sa Ghaeilge.  Tá srian curtha leis na deontais fhorlíontacha sin, áfach, i ngeall ar chinneadh a rinne Bord Fáilte sa bhliain 1985 ag leagan síos nach mbeadh deontais le fáil uathu siúd feasta ach ag ostáin a bhí dírithe ar áiseanna a sholáthar do chuairteoirí iasachta.</P>
    <P>Cuirtear cúnamh airgeadais ar fáil freisin do chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta a bhionn ag plé le forbairt iomlán a gceantair fheidhme &mdash; forbairt eacnamaíoch agus shóisialach chomh maith le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus an cultúr dúchais.  Íoctar deontais reachtála do chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta mar chabhair chun a chumasú dóibh a gcostais riaracháin &mdash; ar a n-áirítear an tuarastal is gá a íoc do bhainisteoir oilte, cumasach - a ghlanadh.  Ní théann méid an deontais sin thar £20,000 (no £22,000 i gcás oileáin) nó 85 faoin gcéad de na costais sin.  Is cúis áthais dom go raibh ar chumas mo Roinnse modh íocaíochta an deontais sin a athrú níos luaithe i mbliana i gcaoi go n-íocfar é ag tús ráithe in ionad ag a deireadh feasta &mdash; rud a shabhalfáidh ús bainc ar na comharchumainn.  Ar ndóigh, cuirtear cúnamh caipitil ar fáil do chomharchumainn chomh maith i ndáil ie tograí fiúntacha a bhíonn ar siúl acu ina gceantair fheidhme.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na hoileáin Ghaeltachta, níl amhras ach go bhfuil feabhas mór taghta ar chúrsaí an tsaoil iontu mar thoradh ar an gcúnamh fial atá curtha ar fáil thar na blianta ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar chúrsaí tithíochta sna hoileáin; tá scéimeanna <Col N="3916" /> leictreachais curtha ar fáil iontu; tá aiseanna breise taitneamhachta agus sóisialta tógtha nó feabhsaithe.  I gcás cuid mhaith de na hoileáin, tá forbairt nach beag déanta ar mhuiroibreacha agus ar sheirbhísí farantóireachta agus tá deiseanna fostaíochta curtha ar fáil.  Cé go bhfuil feabhas mar seo taghta ar shaol na n-oileánach go ginearálta, ní hionann sin is a rá go bhfuil cúrsaí ar na hoileáin mar ba chóir go fóill.  Aithníonn an Rialtas go bhfuil fadhbanna ar leith fós le sárú i gcás na n-oileán &mdash; laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Dá réir sin, tá coiste speisialta bunaithe ag an Taoiseach ar a bhfuil Airí agus Airí Stáit chun na fadhbanna sin a scrúdú agus chun iarracht a dhéanamh teacht ar bhealaí chun iad a réiteach. Tá an Coiste faoi chathaoirleacht an Aire Comhshaoil, an Teachta Pádraic Ó Floinn, agus is é an Teachta Pádraig Ó Gallchóir (the Cope), Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Mara, atá ag feidhmiú mar Rúnaí. Tá mé féin mar chomhalta den Choiste i dteannta leis an Aire Turasóireachta agus lompair, an Teachta Seán Mac Uilliam; an tAire Stáit ag Roinn an Taoisigh, an Teachta Máire Geoghegan-Quinn; agus an tAire Stáit ag an Roinn Airgeadais, an Teachta Nollaig Ó Treasaigh.  Ag an gcéad cruinniú den Choiste, shocraigh na hAirí go n-iarrfaí ar na bainisteoirí contae sin a raibh oileáin faoina gcúram acu oifigeach ag ard-leibhéal a cheapadh le plé go díreach le fadhbanna na n-oileánach. Tá heart déanta dá réir anois agus tá oifigeach speisialta ceaptha sna comhairlí contae i gContae Dhún na nGall, i gContae Mhaigh Eo, i gContae na Gaillimhe agus i gContae Chorcaí.  Tá iarrtha ar na hoifigigh sin tuarascáil a ullmhú maidir leis na fadhóanna ar leith atá le sárú ag na hoileáin ina gceantair féin agus tá súil ag an gCoiste Airí go mbeidh na tuarascálacha sin á gcur faoina mbráid go luath. Beifear in aim an cheist a scrúdú tuilleadh ag an bpointe sin agus táim dóchasach go mbeidh dul chun cinn le feiceail go luath.</P>
    <P>Faoi Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge íoctar deontas le mná tí Gaeltachta a mbfonn foghlaimeoirí aitheanta Gaeilge ar íostas acu le linn dóibh bheith ag freastal ar chúrsaí Gaeilge.  Faigheann na daoine óga deis iontach chun saol na <Col N="3917" /> Gaeltachta a bhiaiseadh agus chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge trina dteagmháil le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Fuair breis agus 16,600 dalta cúnamh faoin scéim anuraidh, titim an-beag &mdash; thart ar 300 &mdash; ar an líon a bhí i gceist i 1985 agus, mar is gnách, rinne lucht eagraithe na gcúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht sárobair.  Is obair leanúnach í seo agus ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis na Coláistí Gaeilge faoin méid atá á dhéanannh acu ar mhaithe le leathadh na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>De bharr na géirchéime airgeadais is oth liom a rá nach rabhthas in ann an deontas a íoctar faoin scéim a mhéadú i mbliana ach de bhrí go bhfuil ísliú mór tagtha ar an mboilsciú táim sásta nach mbeidh na mná tí a choinníonn foghlaimeoirí thíos le is.  £1,120,000 atá á chur ar fáil sa Mheastachán i mbliana le haghaidh na scéime seo.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh ní leor do dhaltaí freastal ar chúrsa trí sheachtain nó mar sin sa Ghaeltacht chun go dtiocfaidís isteach go hiomlán ar an nGaeilge labhartha.  Cé go leagtar síos dúshraith ag na cúrsaí sin ni foláir freisin do na coláistí socruithe a dhéanamh chun go mbeadh imeachtaí sóisialta trí mheán na Gaeilge ar siúl i mbailte dúchais na ndaltaí.  Thabharfadh na himeachtaí seo deis dóibh an teanga a chleachtadh ó cheann ceann na bliana agus cheanglódh sé úsáid na Gaeilge le caitheamh aimsire agus le spraoi in ionad le timpeallacht na scoile mar a tharlaíonn go minic faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá an-chreidiúint ag dul do Choláiste na bhFiann atá ag eagrú imeachtaí mar seo le blianta anuas &mdash; le cúnamh ó mo Roinnse &mdash; i mBaile Átha Cliath agus i mbailte móra ar fud na tíre.  Tá súil agam gur gearr go mbeidh coláistí eile ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an ngnó seo agus go rneallfar daltaí chun cur leis an suim sa Ghaeilge a músclaíodh iontu nuair a bhí siad ar na cúrsaí Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>£75,000 atá a chur ar fáil sa Mheastachán i mbliana le haghaidh Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ar chostas an-bheag is scéim thábhachtach í chun muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh chun an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo.  Tríd an scéim tá teagmháil ag mo Roinnse le breis is 2,000 teaghlach sa Ghaeltacht agus tugann <Col N="3918" /> oifigigh na Roinne moltaí agus comhairle i gcásanna ina mbíonn deacrachtaí leis an Ghaeilge.  Tá na deacrachtaí sin ag dul i méid mar gheall ar na toscaí iomadúla atá ag brú Béaria ar theaghlaigh agus ar pháistí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá ár mbuíochas uile ag dul do mhúinteoirí scoile a chaitheann díogras agus dúthracht le forbairt na teanga sna scoileanna Gaeltachta agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú chun a iarraidh ar thuismitheoirí na Gaeltachta gan seod seo na teanga a cheilt ar a bpáistí: is trí labhairt na teanga sa teaghlach agus sa phobal a chinnteofar go mairfidh an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, áit a mbeidh sí mar fhoinse as a dtarraingeoidh daoine díograsacha ar fud na tíre meanma agus misneach chun leanúint dá n-iarrachtaí ar mhaithe leis an teanga.</P>
    <P>Is rud tábhachtach é go mbeadh nuachtán tarraingteach Gaeilge ar fáil agus eileamh maith air ón bpobal agus is ar an gcúis sin atá airgead á chur ar fáil ag mo Roinnse don nuachtán seachtainiúil <i>Anois.</i>  Tá an tréimhse trí bliana a leagadh síos sa chonradh a síníodh le Anois Teoranta ag druidim chun deiridh agus tá idirbheartaíocht ar siúl faoi láthair ag mo Roinnse leis na foilsitheoirí maidir le conradh nua.  Cé go bhfuil súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas méadú éigin sa dheontas a thairiscint do lucht <i>Anois</i> ni mór a choimeád i gcuimhne go bhfuil teorainn leis an gcúnamh gur féidir leis an Stát a chur ar fáil d'aon chuspóir dá fheabhas é.  Tá sé riachtanach mar sin go dtabharfadh gach duine agus gach dream ar spéis leo an Ghaeilge tacaíocht leanúnach do <i>Anois</i> trína cheannach gach seachtain agus/nó trí fhógraíocht a dhéanamh ann.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn iriseoireacht áitiúil a spreagadh i gceantair Ghaeltachta ina labhartar an Ghaeilge go coitianta mar ghnáththeanga bíonn cúnamh ar fáil o mo Roinnse faoi Sceim na nirisí Áitiúla Gaeltachta. Baineann an scéim le hiris Ghaeilge a bhíonn á stiúradh ag coiste iontaofa Gaeltachta ar a bhfuil ionadaíocht shásúil ag pobal an cheantair agus a fhoilsíonn nuacht áitiúil, trácht ar chúrsaí reatha, filíocht nua-cheaptha agus rudaí mar sin. Is féidir deontas suas le £500 in aghaidh <Col N="3919" /> an eagráin a íoc gan dul thar £3,000 sa bhliain i gcás aon irise áirithe.  Tá cúnamh ar fáil ó mo Roinnse freisin do thréimhseacháin áirithe Ghaeilge, mar shampla <i>Comhar, Feasta, an tUltach, Agus, An Sagart, An Gael Óg, Tír na nÓg agus An Timire.</i></P>
    <P>Nuair a bunaíodh Bord na Gaeilge chun &ldquo;an Ghaeilge, agus go háirithe a húsáid mar theanga bheo agus mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide, a chur chun cinn&rdquo; leagadh ualach trom air agus bhí a fhios ag an Rialtas ag an am go raibh obair mhór le déanamh.  Tuigeadh, freisin, nach ar an mbord amháin a bheifí ag brath: leagtar síos go soiléir san Acht faoinar bunaíodh an bord go leanfadh Ranna Stáit agus comhlachtaí eile de comhlíonadh na bhfeidhmeanna i ndáil leis an nGaeilge a raibh siad freagrach iontu.  Aithníodh go mbeadh comhoibriú ó Ranna, ó chomhlachtaí eile, ó na meáin chumarsáide agus ón bpobal mór féin de dhíth chun dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá tréimhse an chéad Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986 a d'ullmhaigh an bord istigh anois agus tá an Dara Plean Gníomhaíochta don tréimhse 1987 go 1990 á ullmhú faoi láthair. Léiríonn na tuarascálacha ar fheidhmiú a chéad phlean a leagadh faoi bhráid na Dála gur baineadh amach cuid mhaith de na spriocanna a sonraíodh.  Is cosúil nár éirigh le Ranna agus comhlachtaí áirithe Stáit, áfach, a gcion féin a dhéanamh i ndáil leis na spriocanna teoranta a sonraíodh dóibh.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh socruithe sásúla i bhfeidhm san earnáil phoiblií, ar a n-áirítear Ranna Rialtais, comhlachtaí stáit, údaráis áitiúla agus a leithéidí, chun seirbhís chothrom trí Ghaeilge a thabhairt do gach duine a bheadh á lorg agus go mbeadh sé soiléir dóibh go gcuirfear an tseirbhís sin ar fáil le fonn agus le fáilte.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh lánchomhoibriú ar fáil ó Ranna agus comhlachtaí Stáit chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach le linn tréimhse an dara Plean Gníomhaíochta.</P>

      <Col N="3920" /> Tá réamhthuarascáil faighte le fíordhéanaí ó Ghrúpa Oibre ar a raibh ionadaithe ó mo Roinnse, ón Roinn Cumarsáide, ó Bhord na Gaeilge agus ó Radio Telefís Éireann, a bunaíodh anuraidh chun staidéar iomlán a dhéanamh ar cheist na Gaeilge ar an teilifís.  Tá moltaí an ghrúpa sin á meas faoi láthair ag mo Roinnse agus ag an Roinn Cumarsáide agus is léir go bhfuil scagadh doimhin déanta acu ar an gceist thábhachtach seo, agus ar na fadhbanna agus na deacracthaí a bhainfeadh le méadú a dhéanamh ar líon na gcláracha Gaeilge ar an teilifís. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an nGrúpa Oibre as an saothar díograiseach a rinne siad in achar gearr agus tá súil agam nach dtógfar orm é má thugaim focal molta ar leith don Chathaoirleach, Eoghan Ó Cadhain, Uasal.  Scor Eoghan ón Státseirbhís i mí Eanáir seo caite tar éis 40 bliain a chaitheamh ag obair ar son na Gaeilge.  Is eol dom gur chaith sé an-dua ie hobair an ghrúpa agus táimid faoi mórchomhaoin aige gur lean sé mar chathaoirleach ar an ngrúpa go dtí go raibh an obair críochnaithe.  Tá Súil agam go mbainfidh sé lán sásamh as an sos atá tuillte go maith aige anois.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go bhfuil na ceantair Ghaeltachta scartha amach óna chéile is gá go mbeadh oiread teagmhála agus is féidir eatarthu.  Is mór an chabhair Raidió na Gaeltachta chun sprid an chomhluadair a chothú trí chláir a chur ar fáil sna canúintí éagsúla &mdash; rud a neartaíonn na snaidhmeanna cairdis agus cultúrtha atá idir na ceantair sin.  Ba mhaith liom tréaslú le Raidió na Gaeltachta as ucht na hoibre atá curtha i gcrích acu thar na blianta &mdash; agus le bliain anuas ach go háirithe ó cuireadh le líon na n-uaireanta craolacháin dóibh.</P>
    <P>Is as Ciste na Gaeilge a chuirtear cúnamh Stáit ar fáil do Bhord na Gaeilge agus do na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge &mdash; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge, An tOireachtas, Cumann na bhFiann, An Comhlachas Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, agus do Bhord na Leabhar Gaeilge, Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe.  Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair agus an Gael-Acadamh. Tig leis na heagrais Ghaeilge sin an-obair <Col N="3921" /> a dhéanamh i mease an phobail ach cur chuige le fonn agus le fuinneamh.  Tig leo freisin tacú le gníomhaíochtaí a chéile i gcaoi go mbeidh comhórdú ceart idir na hiarrachtaí a bhíonn ar siúil acu.  Is gnó do Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, áfach, féachaint chuige go mbíonn iarrachtaí na n-eagras éagsúla á chomhórdú go héifeachtach d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a leathadh i measc an phobail agus táim sásta go bhfuil aghaidh á tabhairt ag an gComhdháil ar an obair sin i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom gur mó é an soláthar sa Chiste i mbiiana d'ainneoin na géarchéime airgeadais agus go raibh ar mo chumas, dá bharr, méadú éigin a thabhairt do gach eagras acu.  Cé go raibh an méadú níos lú ná mar a bhí á lorg acu ceapaim gur féidir leo obair fhiúntach a dhéanamh leis an airgead atá ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Is breá liom go bhfuil i gceist go n-athbhunófar an Comhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge a rinne an-chuid oibre chun áit níos feiceálaí a thabhairt don Ghaeilge in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach.  Bhí sé de phribhiéid agam féin bheith mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste sin agus d'éirigh linn dhá Thuarascáil a fhoilsiú ina raibh moltaí praiticiúla maidir le leathadh na Gaeilge anseo sa Dáil agus sa Seanad.  Is áthas liom go bhfuil feidhm tugtha do chuid de na moltaí sin ach tá a lan le déanamh go fóill.  Sílim go dtig le hAirí, le Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí tabhairt faoin Ghaeilge a labhairt níos mó i dTithe an Oireachtais. larraim ar gach duine de Bhaill an Oireachtais oiread feidhm agus is féidir leo a bhaint as labhairt na Gaeilge anseo agus an dea-shampla a thabhairt don phobal ar fad.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom go mbeidh airgead ar fáil don Ghaeilge ón gCrannchur Náisiúnta. Níl a fhios agam go foill cé mhéid ach tá sé i gceist go mbeidh breis airgid le fáil agus beidh fáilte roimhe.  Chinn an Rialtas le gairid ar £1,750,000 a chur ar fáil i mbliana do na healaíona, don chultúr agus don Ghaeilge ó na fáltais sin agus socrófar go luath conas a dáilfear an t-airgead idir na héilimh éagsula.</P>
    <P>Tá an géarchéim eacnamaíochta ag goilliúint ar gach gné de shaol na tíre agus <Col N="3922" /> ní haon eisceacht í cúis na Gaeilge.  Ach tá go leor gur féidir linn uile a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge nach mbeadh costas ar bith ag baint leis.  Dá mbeadh gach duine sásta úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá aige nó aici go mórtasach agus go hoscailte is gearr go mbeadh an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil, ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht, ach ar fud na tíre uile.  Tá súil agam gur féidir bheith ag brath orainn sa Teach seo chun an dea-shampla a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Teach glacadh leis an Meastachán seo mar chabhair chun an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt tuilleadh agus chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This Adjournment debate takes place at the end of what has been an unusual and fascinating session of the Dáil.  It is a session that was preceded by an unusual general election.  It was unusual in that rarely can there have been quite the contrast between the approaches adopted by the parties in terms of how much they were prepared to tell the public of their plans and intentions.  That election was fought by us on the basis of the budget which failed to win the support of this House.  In every detail what we had in mind was on the table for examination, for analysis, for criticism.  In contrast, the Fianna Fáil Party, and more specifically their leader, rather like Brer Rabbit stayed there and said nuffing.  One recalls the disdain with which Deputy Haughey declined to enter into any discussion on whether there were to be public expenditure cuts and if there were to be public expenditure cuts in what areas those cuts might take place. So, we had a very curious general election and a very curious and interesting result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the votes were counted it was clear that the only Government that could be formed, if a Government could be formed, and about that there was considerable doubt, was one that would be led by Deputy Haughey but it was not clear from where he would get the extra support required in order to be in a position to form an administration.  Some possibilities arose.  There was a possibility of some sort of attempt to cobble <Col N="3923" /> together, as happened on a previous occasion, support from The Workers' Party &mdash; from the Marxists of The Workers' Party &mdash; a perhaps improbable alliance but it had happened before and who was to know whether that was to be on the agenda.  Would one of the Independents suddenly find a possibility of massive investments in his or her constituency running to tens of millions of pounds?  Who knew what treats were in store for South Tipperary or wherever? Or would the Government depend for their continuance in office on the support of Deputy Blaney and what might the implications of that be for Anglo-lrish relations?</P>
    <P>All of those were possibilities, but once the election results were in my party thought it important to clear the air, to indicate very clearly where we stood. Therefore, on the night of the count, once it was clear that Fine Gael would not be in a position to form a Government or participate in the formation of a Government, the then leader of my party, Garret FitzGerald, went on television to indicate what would be our approach.  He indicated in the most explicit terms that our attitude would be one of goodwill and support towards an incoming Government who were prepared to follow broadly the analysis we had identified.</P>
    <P>Subsequently our parliamentary party met and, with a greater opportunity for reflection, considered the matter in more detail.  We issued a formal statement indicating what our position would be, assuring an incoming Government that a budget they would introduce which followed the parameters of our budget would not be opposed by us, and neither would the legislation to give effect to that budget be opposed.  We thought it important that an incoming Administration should know what the prospects of securing support would be.  During the transition period after the election and before the first meeting of the Dáil, because it seemed most probable that an Administration would be headed by Deputy Haughey, we arranged on an <Col N="3924" /> unprecedented scale that Deputy Haughey and those who were likely to serve with him would be briefed in detail on the various problems facing the country. The Taoiseach today graciously referred to that fact once again.  Even in those few weeks we made our position clear.</P>
    <P>Then we all gathered for the first day of the new Dáil session.  I recall what a tense and exciting occasion that was.  Few recall that better than yourself, A Cheann Comhairle, given the role you were to play in it.  Deputy Haughey was duly elected by the skin of his teeth, went to Aras an Uachtarain and came back with the seal of office to announce the nomination of the members of the Government.  That gave another opportunity to the parties in this House to indicate what their approach was to be during the course of this Dáil session.  My then party leader again made our position very clear.  He referred to the very difficult problems, particularly in the economic area, facing the Government, Anglo-lrish matters and difficulties in the European Community.  He went on to say what he thought our function should be.  He said at column 64, volume 371 of the Official Report, on 10 March 1987:</P>
    <P>None of us is or need to be in doubt about the gravity of the problems facing us or about the fact that they can only be overcome by an effect of political will involving a commitment and a degree of united effort on the part of all of us in politics which is outside the normal framework of what has in the past been secured or what has seemed possible to secure given the adversarial character of our parliamentary system. </P>
    <P>He went on to say, and this has been quoted already in today's debate.</P>
    <P>I know it is going to be difficult for all of us.  We are going to find it difficult at times to offer the degree of support which will be necessary for the Government to carry out their functions effectively and to overcome the great problems that face us and to take on <Col N="3925" /> the vested interests which are strangling this country.  It will not be easy for an Opposition to support some of the measures the Government will have to take.  Yet we will do so.  It will not be easy for the Government to take these steps but they must do so.  It will not be easy for this House to operate in such a way as to secure, on the one hand, the benefits of the degree of unity required to tackle the problems of the scale which now face us and, on the other hand, to maintain the distance there should be between Government and Opposition and to continue to carry out the constructive role of Opposition in questioning the Government's actions, scrutinising them and of keeping the Government up to the mark in the way in which every Opposition have to do. </P>
    <P>That was a statement of goodwill for the incoming Government and a promise of support.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must have found that a reassuring debate because it was not just Deputy FitzGerald and Fine Gael who had encouraging words for the newly elected Taoiseach.  Deputy O'Malley, Leader of the Progressive Democrats also intervened during that debate.  He promised support on Northern Ireland if Fianna Fáil went along with the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and then continued, at column 71, volume 371 of the Official Report on 10 March 1987:</P>
    <P>The same is true as far as economic matters are concerned.  The Progressive Democrats will not seek to defeat or bring down the Government on specific policy issues where we judge the Government are trying to do the right thing.  We will encourage and support them either by voting with them or by not voting against them as appropriate in such cases. </P>
    <P>He said that to show his goodwill he would not challenge a division that night.</P>
    <P>The next major occasion in the life of this session was the budget speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, and our first opportunity to see how serious were those statements of <Col N="3926" /> goodwill.  In his reply Deputy Michael Noonan indicated, I think rather moderately, his surprise at the extent of the Pauline conversion which had taken place and what appeared to be a willingness to steal other parties' clothes.  Having done so, he indicated that in accordance with our commitment, we would not be opposing the budget.  At that stage Deputy McDowell spoke on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  He was scathing about Deputy Noonan's contribution simply because he had taken but a few minutes to refer to the change of direction by Fianna Fáil.  He said at column 829, volume 371 of the Official Report on 31 March 1987:</P>
    <P>This debate is one in which we are reminded, especially by the speech given by Deputy Noonan, that this is an adversarial institution where people come together to argue what is proposed by the Government rather than to get together to do what is best for the country... I find it remarkable that somebody could be so abusive and so scornful when on the Fianna Fáil benches we now see a change of heart of a very substantial kind which has been made in the interest of the country at large.  Everyone should have the generosity to accept it. </P>
    <P>In the light of subsequent events that really is remarkable.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats were founded as a new and separate political party in order to make the Irish political process not more divisive but more decisive. </P>
    <P>It was bound to be an interesting session. It was going to be an unusual Dáil.  It was a Dáil which would require from its participants a degree of sensitivity, flexibility and generosity.  Let us see to what extent the parties in this House have lived up to that responsibility.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Government party has been deeply disappointing, most noticeably in their attitude to committees of the House.  One might have thought that having failed to secure the <Col N="3927" /> majority support of the public and operating as a minority party in the Dáil they would have accepted the fact that there was an unanswerable case for an expanded committee system giving Members of all parties, whether in Government &mdash; the minority &mdash; or in Opposition &mdash; the majority &mdash; an opportunity to exercise influence.  Instead, we have seen a retreat from the progress that was made during the course of the last Dáil.  There has been an attempt to wrap up committees which had worked effectively in the last Dáil and a sluggishness, slowness and hesitancy as they were dragged into movement on committees in other areas.  There is a deeply disappointing lack of openness and lack of generosity.</P>
    <P>In contrast stands the approach which has been taken by my party because, as Deputy Garret FitzGerald said on that occasion, it was not going to be easy for us at times.  We accepted the fact that the election results imposed particular responsibilities on all of us to make this House work and we fulfilled that commitment to a degree of co-operation. Take, for example, the attitude we have taken to Private Members' Time which, traditionally, was used for condemnatory motions to which Governments tabled laudatory amendments and we had ritual playacting at 8.30 p.m. on a Wednesday. We have not sought to make use of Private Members' time in that way.  Deputy Shatter introduced a Bill in Private Members' Time in relation to adoption, a serious in justice which had been tolerated for far too long and in respect of which a Bill had already been drafted. The House was presented with an opportunity to end the injustice and to offer to children in institutions all over the State the prospect of moving to a secure and stable family environment.  Consider the difference of approach.  Fine Gael did not seek to use their time to score party political points, they were prepared to allocate the little time available to Opposition parties to discuss a serious social ill.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil voted down that Bill and <Col N="3928" /> condemned people to a longer stay in institutions.  Under pressure, they produced a virtually identical Bill.  If there was any substance to the minute differences which existed between the two Bills, they could easily have been dealt with by amendments on Committee Stage.  However, Fianna Fáil could not adjust to a situation where there might be merit in proposals coming from any side of the House other than their own, they closed ranks and voted it down, another example of a lack of openness and generosity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most curious role in the Dáil has been played by the Progressive Democrats who, you will recall, through their party leader, intervened in the debate on the nomination of members of the Government to indicate their attitude. They indicated they would give the Government a degree of co-operation and support.  Indeed, when Deputy Noonan, Opposition spokesman, prefaced his indication of support by political remarks on the budget, he was castigated by Deputy McDowell.  What has their performance been?  Far from offering any degree of co-operation they have sought to turn the Chamber into a bear garden day after day.  They have shown themselves to be the parliamentary vandals of the Dáil.  That is from a party founded on the basis that they were the party of new politics, which would have no time for the bickering which bedevilled civil war politics.  They were prepared to see good from wherever it would come and they would be responsible, open and constructive. The role they have played in the Dáil is in shameful and stark contrast to their stated position.  Their antics have directly prevented the Dáil from debating issues of substance.  For example, the very early important sections of the Finance Bill, dealing with income tax, were not debated on Committee Stage, not because of an oppressive Government guillotine or because of collusion between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, as the PDs suggested, but because they engaged in the nonsense of calling for divisions again and again that morning, making debate impossible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3929" /> One could understand those kind of tactics coming from a very different political party.  Those who take an interest in British politics might associate such tactics with the so-called hard left of the Labour Party, the anti-Neil Kinnock group within that party, who, allegedly, have a degree of enthusiasm for extra parliamentary tactics.  We did not expect such tactics from a party founded on the basis that it was the party of a modern Ireland, which would put bickering, squabbling and all that old fashioned nonsense behind them.  Their antics are mind boggling and the pretence that they were justified because of a change in Standing Orders requires some scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The Standing Order to which they take objection is the way in which Private Members' Time is to be allocated between the parties in Opposition.  For this purpose, we are talking about three political parties, The Workers Party do not qualify as they do not have enough members to form a group for this purpose. There are 14 Progressive Democrats, 12 Labour Members and 51 Fine Gael Members.  We seek neither more nor less than that the time should be allocated on a proportional basis.  What the Progressive Democrats seek is that the parties which have only half the number of members which Fine Gael has, should have twice as much time as Fine Gael in Private Members' Time, which makes no sense whatever.  Our case is based on simple justice, that we should have our mathematical share of the time available to the combined Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcomed the formation of the Progressive Democrats because I admired the courage with which some of their founders had argued their case within Fianna Fáil.  I took them to be people of some substance with whose policies in some areas I agreed.  I thought they would have a serious contribution to make to politics.  Indeed, it is fair to say that I probably did not increase my popularity within my own party because I did not make a secret of my views.  However, those who rebuked me have been shown to have spoken a good deal of sense.  Part of the appeal of the Progressive Democrats was that they would be a party of substance and reality and businesslike.  The fact that they engaged in this kind of exercise seems to indicate that they are on the slope to irrelevance.</P>
      <P>I still have not given up on the Progressive Democrats.  They might yet have something to offer and I hope they will get their act together.  The Progressive Democrats are essentially a splinter group from Fianna Fáil and they are simply resorting to traditional Fianna Fáil Opposition tactics.  During the four years in which Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, not a word of encouragement was forthcoming on any issue tackled by the Government.  Instead, week after week, motions were tabled seeking increases in public expenditure.  The track record of the Progressive Democrats is all but identical.  Formed as the party who would, above all, cut public expenditure, what has their voting record been?</P>

      <P>It is true that they did once get their courage together. During the course of the last Dáil they came through the lobbies on one occasion in support of the then Government on an issue of some moment when they supported them in their attitude to the teachers' pay dispute.  Having done so once, they so terrified themselves that they never did it again.  The very first vote in <Col N="3931" /> which they participated as a party perhaps indicated what was in store.  Again, the press launch of the new party will be recalled, with all the hype across the road, how they were going to be serious, tough, determined.  The first vote they had to face was one of putting 1p on the pint.  Scarcely, one might have thought an issue that should have troubled people who were so tough minded and determined and willing to face unpopularity. What did they do?  They scurried through to oppose a 1p increase in the price of the pint.</P>
      <P>Then, as the Government sought to curb expenditure and the Opposition party week after week brought in motions seeking extra public expenditure, what was the role of the Progressive Democrats? When they were present their attitude was one of supporting calls for extra expenditure while all the time wrapping the garments of financial and fiscal responsibility around themselves.  That double think, that hypocrisy, that dishonesty, have characterised their performance and their contribution in the life of this Dáil.  I say again, as someone who would like to see them remain around for a while and would like to see them make some kind of contribution, that they are just going to have to sort themselves out.  Their leader in the most explicit terms indicated that a Government who were prepared to address a common analysis of our economic problems would be entitled to expect support and would receive support.  They have failed to deliver.  In the course of the Finance Bill there was a certain procedural tango between the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, and the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Noonan.  As a result of that, when commitment as to pressing or not pressing an issue was recoiled from, Deputy Noonan charged that Deputy O'Malley was unreliable.  That surely is the mark of the performance of the Progressive Democrats during the course of this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see just what the consequences are for how our parliamentary system <Col N="3932" /> works.  Because of Fine Gael's willingness to accept the difficult burden and the Progressive Democrats cowardice in refusing to share the burden they had indicated they were going to shoulder, Deputy O'Malley in his contribution and Deputy Desmond both welcomed the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government appear to be welcoming the Anglo-Irish Agreement at this stage in a U-turn on what they had at one stage indicated was their attitude.  I welcome the change of approach on that.  Does anybody think that we would have that change of approach if the Government were not in a position to look to these benches for some general support and had to depend instead on the narrow minded irredentist nationalism that is represented by Deputy Blaney on his perch up in the corner?  Is that what the Progressive Democrats would wish to have happen? Nowhere is this double think and hypocrisy more obvious than in the outbursts of the last few days.</P>

      <P>We accept the case for curbing expenditure if there is room for cuts and savings in those areas.  We believe it is impossible to stay within the general allocation for this year.  Deputy Desmond says that is a cop-out.  Frankly, I am not for one moment suggesting that it is possible to do all that needs to be done simply by finding layers of bureaucracy that can be stripped off, even on the basis of the allocations that we proposed and the decisions we had taken; very difficult decisions would have to have been faced in the health service area and I fully acknowledge that.  We pressed our case at every opportunity that was open to us.  However, we had the charade over the last few days of the performance of the Progressive Democrats.  On Tuesday night, people went home with some speculation that the country was on the <Col N="3933" /> eve of an election and no doubt there was a hope that people might have had a good night's sleep.  Our backbenchers could not get a night's sleep because of the antics of the Progressive Democrats at the very highest levels ringing them up begging them not to vote in the Dáil on the following day, asking them to absent themselves so as to save the Progressive Democrats from an election they were terrified of.</P>

It is not just the Progressive Democrats who are in the business of posturing and of shadowboxing. We had a much publicised application for readmission by Deputy Stagg. One would have thought that that was an issue on which, if people were serious, a full attendance of his would-be supporters and comrades might have been expected.  But was there a full attendance of the Labour Party?  There was not.  Was there a full attendance of the Labour Party even in last night's division?  There was not.  They would not have known long enough in advance what our attitude was going to be and in order to avoid a general election they had to make sure that Deputy Bell was going to miss plane connections or whatever and was not going to get back in time for a vote.</P>

      <P>The truth of the matter is that <i>The Evening Press</i> commented that on a radio programme this morning I made an astonishing admission; that astonishing admission was that I had not looked forward to a general election.  The truth of the matter is that there was not a Deputy in this House who looked forward to a general election because a general election at this moment <Col N="3934" /> would not have been in the country's interest.  We know in broad terms what the outcome would have been.  There have been opinion polls which show what happened since the February election. They show that Fianna Fáil support has dropped significantly, that Fine Gael support has increased significantly, by 6 per cent on the basis of the last poll.  They show the PDs falling back and the Labour Party beginning to make a little headway. What does all that mean?  It means another Dáil in which no party would have an overall majority, so how much better off would we be for that?  Everybody knows that that is no solution to our problems.  The truth of the matter is that the problems we face at this stage are too serious for play-acting.  A Government who are prepared to tackle our problems &mdash; and we do not know whether this Government are prepared to tackle them, my own feeling is that they will funk it and run away &mdash; are entitled to look for general support from those who share a broadly comparable analysis of our problems.  That is not easy for us. We have been prepared to shoulder the burden.  There are others who have funked it.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi easpa Gaeilge i ráiteas an Taoisigh ag cur tús leis an díospóireacht seo.  An cheist a chuir mé féin ort, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ag deireadh an ráitis sin ná, an raibh Meastacháin Roinn an Taoisigh agus Roinn na Gaeltachta á moladh ag an am céanna.  Dá mba rud é go raibh an díospóireacht <Col N="3935" /> ag baint ní amháin le cúram an Taoisigh go ginearálta ach leis na Meastacháin éagsúla eile, chuir sé iontas orm, toisc go raibh deireadh á chur le Aireacht na Gaeltachta agus go raibh sé ráite ag tús an téarma seo go raibh cúraimí na Gaeilge agus cúraimí na Gaeltachta á dtógaint ag an Taoiseach féin, nár labhair sé focal i nGaeilge agus nach ndearna sé tagairt dá laghad do na fadhbanna taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí, agus nach ndearna sé tagairt, fiú amháin do ainm na Roinne, Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Chuir sé áthas orm a chloisteáil go luath sa díospóireacht, Gaeilge an Teachta Denis Gallagher, Aire Stáit ag Roinn an Taoisigh a bhfuil cúram na Gaeltachta air.  Ach ag an am céanna caithfidh mé an pointe a dhéanamh, mar tá sé tábhachtach dom.  Níor chuir sé iontas orm a laghad suime agus atá ag lucht Fhine Gael i gcúrsaí Gaeilge mar ní raibh sé ro-láidir riamh, ach tá suim ag an ceannaire, an Teachta Alan Dukes, mar labhraíonn sé Gaeilge breá agus is trua nach mbaintear i bhfad níos mó úsáide as an Ghaeilge sa Teach seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoin méid atá ráite ag an Aire Stáit: ar an gcéad dul síos, an cur síos ar an chaiteachas atá i ndán don bhliain atá ag teacht i bhfoirmeacha éagsúla.  Is mian liom cúpla ceisteanna a chur air.  An bhfuil sé ar intinn aige, mar shampla, glacadh le moltaí Bhord na Gaeilge agus an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas seo plean cuimsitheach don Ghaeilge a fhoilsiú do na blianta go dtí deireadh na nóchaidí? An bhfuil sé ar intinn aige, cuir i gcás, cúraimí nua a thabhairt do Udarás na Gaeltachta chun dul i mbun oibre atá tábhtachtach, go háirithe infrastructúr agus seirbhísí a chur ar fáil?  Céard faoi fostaíocht nua sna Gaeltachtaí?  Céard faoi na Gaeltachtaí taobh istigh de Chomhphobal na hEorpa?  An bhfuil aon airgead breise curtha ar fáil do athbheochan na Gaeilge féin de bharr ár mballríocht i gComhphobal na hEorpa?  Céard faoi na deacrachtaí speisialta sna scoileanna Gaeltachta?  Tá an-chaint faoi, mar shampla, obair Roinn na Mara.  An bhfuil aon scéim speisialta curtha ar fáil <Col N="3936" /> chun sean-chéanna a dheisiú agus céanna nua a fhorbairt, agus mar sin de?</P>
    <P>Is iontach an rud é nuair a bhí an Taoiseach ag dul trí na Ranna a bhfuil sé ag brath orthu chun fhorbairt na tíre a chur chun cinn nach ndearna sé tagairt díreach don méid is féidir a dhéanamh taobh istigh de na Gaeltachtaí féin, mar shampla, tionscal na turasóireachta, tionscal adhmaid, tionscail iascaireachta agus mar sin de.  Dar ndóigh beimid ag éisteacht leis na Teachtaí eile faoi seo gan mhoill. Tá níos lú ama agam le caint ná mar is gnáth mar tá mé ag glacadh leis go bhfuil Baill eile gur mian leo páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth nár tugadh i bhfad níos mó airgid ón national lottery do chúrsaí cultúrtha Gaeilge?  Cén fáth nach bhfuil aon tagairt do thionscal na turasóireachta san ghné sin a bhaineann le cúrsaí cultúrtha? Níl na tagairtí sin le feiceáil.  Agus chuir sé iontas an domhain orm féin toisc go bhfuil, b'fhéidir, an tsuim a bhí aige i gcúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta imithe go mór i léig.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé iompó anois do rud eile go ndúirt an Taoiseach go raibh suim aige ann, cúrsaí scannán.  Indeed, the appropriate transition quotation is that it is said that each man kills the thing he loves.  If that is the case, the absence of Irish in the Taoiseach's speech absolutely astonished me, in view of the importance of example at these times when I wonder about the commitment that exists towards the Gaeltacht communities and the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I have not identified any clear intention in the Government's policy to comprehensively go through the different Government Departments dealing with the ordinary lives of Gaeltacht people to establish as a fact that they would have the basic right to do their business through Irish.  A simple obscene example relates to the national lottery putting its two-sided signs all over the Gaeltacht in English only.  The national lottery has become almost as important as the national Exchequer.  Everybody is expecting to draw money from the national lottery, the lame, the blind, the people who want to run, the people who <Col N="3937" /> want to make pictures and so on.  In the Gaeltachts these signs are put up only in English.</P>
    <P>I noticed a lack of commitment but I intend to move on from it because as time goes on I hope we will have other opportunities to speak on the importance of the Irish language.  There is an issue of rights involved, the right to participate fully in the State.  I am becoming weary listening to people who pretend to have an interest in the language but who will not use it in their public life.  When I came to Galway first it was normal to expect the Mayor of the day to speak in Irish, at least on public occasions.  That is entirely gone.  People have abandoned it altogether.  It is regarded as chic not to know the Irish language and not even make an effort.  I will return to all these matters on an appropriate occasion.</P>
    <P>The Adjournment debate deals with matters other than this but I have to deal with these together because things Irish, the language and the Gaeltachts are now within the tight bosom of the Taoiseach. In relation to the arts, it gave me no pleasure to read in the Taoiseach's script his decision to abolish Bord Scannáin.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to reconsider that decision.  It has nothing to do with ideology.  If one wanted to establish a film industry here one could not do a more damaging thing than what is proposed there.  The Finance Bill made provision for people who want to invest sums of money up to £100,000 in the production of films to enjoy certain amounts of tax break.  The money is for production but Bord Scannáin was a clearing house for all of the preliminary stages to film production. If one decides on a film there are different options available for getting it written and so forth and it was to Bord Scannáin that people came and they could get some money to employ a script writer and for the whole creative pre-production part of film making which any-one who knows anything about films knows is very important.  Equally important is the post-production phase, the whole question of the different skills which are not market-oriented.  What will happen now is that individuals wanting <Col N="3938" /> to make a film will have no assistance up to the point at which they have finished the idea and then they will have to take that finished idea to the different people around the place with bundles of £100,000 and hope that they will be artistically lunatic enough to abandon their most extreme commercial desires of film making and start enabling an individual film maker to work.  Any film maker in the business could have advised on that. This unfortunately was not taken up.  Lest anyone get the idea that this is just another semi-State body gone, it has a tiny staff, it had a tiny budget of about £600,000, it made ten feature films during the five years of the board, and made 25 short films.  The money advanced to the board was £1.22 million and for that it earned £3.295 million in foreign currency earnings for films sold abroad.  This proposal is an act of philistinism, damaging to the film industry and it transcends even the excesses of mad Margaret in the neighbouring island, who set an alternative commercial entity in place before she decided that she would abolish the film board.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult in a short time to speak about the overall thrust of the Taoiseach's speech.  I do not want to be as negative as other speakers.  The problem about the speech is the little reference that was made to the unemployment crisis.  Something that is terribly important for the people who have built their expectations of living in this country in conditions other than poverty is that somehow or other the presence of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach will release a kind of atmospherics which will create development.  The weakness of economic thinking is getting worse by the day.  I do not want to repeat arguments I made in relation to the Export Bill a few nights ago.  We are enjoying the lowest inflation rate for 20 years in comparison to many OECD countries.  We live in expectation of a drop in interest rates and at the same time there is a massive increase in workers' productivity.  In 1980 the output per worker was 100; in 1981 it was 108.4 and in 1986 it was 164.2.  The output per worker has increased, the <Col N="3939" /> average industrial wage has remained steady in real terms and imports are now less than exports.  Therefore, we have a favourable trade balance.  However, in 1981, 141,000 people were unemployed. and in 1986 250,000 were unemployed. Therefore, the equation is going wrong.</P>
    <P>I wonder if people read the reports of the commissions that are established. The Economic Research Institute have published commentaries on unemployment. The National and Economic Social Council published an analysis of the different economic difficulties that are before us.  We can enjoy low rates of inflation and live with some expectation of a drop in interest rates but jobs will still not be created because there is no investment strategy for the different sectors of the economy which will in turn lead to specified levels of outturn in relation to jobs.</P>
    <P>This raises a number of questions about this Adjournment Debate.  I read the Taoiseach's speech a number of times and I am afraid that the ratio of borrowing requirement in relation to gross national product is now the single greatest priority of this administration.  That is why Deputy Birmingham who is so far removed from the reality of the problems I have described can say he is getting irritated that the Taoiseach's consensus is not enthusiastic enough for him.  It is only when unemployment has been moved to the top of the agenda that we will make any significant indent on the poverty and misery that is taking place.</P>
    <P>The most disappointing aspect of speeches on the economy and in the Taoiseach's speech is the vagueness of the language.  There are over 20 State agencies assisting the Irish private sector and this is like saying that an injection given to a cow is not working.  The Taoiseach noted in his speech that unfortunately there have been no jobs as a result of the investment that is given every year to industry to try to make it productive.  What is the point in saying something like that?  Why is it not put more bluntly?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3940" /> We have a highly over-taxed population on a very narrow tax base who are at the point of extremity because of the burden of taxation they are carrying. People now have to live with lectures about reducing their wages and an embargo on public service employment and at the same time the Government are looking at the dismantling of services. Taxpayers are told they will have to wait for any concessions in relation to tax while at the same time they can see people outside of the earned income sector having one kind of tax liability after another virtually scrapped.  They have figures thrown at them to show that Irish exports are doing very well. However, they are not told the amount of those exports that are accounted for by foreign located firms in Ireland selling into the European Community and taking all their profits out of the country without any linkages in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I would have welcomed from the person who says he is feeling macho about leading a management team that is going to march the new Ireland into health, prosperity and vision an indication of what he thinks about our industrial policy.  NESC have written about our industrial policy.  Telesis produced a report on the Irish economy and <i>The Economist</i> writes reports on industrial policy.  Our industrial policy has not worked.  The Taoiseach said that he hopes semi-State bodies will become development corporations.  What instructions and allocations have been given to these bodies and what provision is being made for their borrowing needs?</P>
    <P>Recently I asked a series of Dáil Questions to establish the nature of the national debt.  I asked frankly how much the indebtedness of a number of semi-State bodies was worth to the Irish banking system.  In reply to my question I was told that domestic interest paid to banks and other financial institutions was £541 million in 1986; in 1985 £540 million; in 1984 £420 million and in 1983, £368 million.  I asked also how much each health board has paid in interest to the different banking systems and I was <Col N="3941" /> appalled at the figures I was given.  The Housing Finance Agency, the YEA, AnCO, the health boards and the local authorities are all good customers of the Irish banking system.  They are paying interest on effectively no risk borrowing.</P>
    <P>There was no reference in the Taoiseach's speech to a credit policy which would lead to an investment policy. There is no reference to the credit provisions he might have to make to the semi-State sector to enable them to develop in different ways.  Two semi-State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Labour, AnCO &mdash; the Industrial Training Authority &mdash; and CERT Limited incurred interest charges on loans in the years 1983 to 1986.  The total during those years for AnCO was £4,358,158 and for CERT the total was £155,439.  There is no reference in the Taoiseach's speech to a credit policy. Where has the fine accountancy brain and the economic genius gone?  We are told that we must be happy, optimistic and feel bright and if we meet an unemployed person tell them that the new day is coming.  This is like something one would hear at a flower show and it is insulting to the intelligence of people.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has been neglected and as a result two societies are being created in exactly the same way as in the North.  There is no point in saying that some of the 250,000 people who are unemployed are abusing the system although I am sure an odd few are.  There is a crisis in relation to unemployment. With unemployment comes a chain of poverty and deprivation.  We have to ask ourselves what the nature of our social policy is.  There was a piece of waffle in the Taoiseach's speech in which he said that Fianna Fáil are the grand party who are in favour of productivity and who have a social policy and he referred to the 1930s.  We have three choices in relation to social policy &mdash; a minimalist social policy like the one in Britain, an insurance social policy or a social policy in which one redistributes.  Irish society is deeply unequal and this inequality is being broadened.  We are reproducing an unequal society because we have an <Col N="3942" /> insurance based system where parents must insure for their children's future education and for illness.  If we continue like this we will continue to create two cultures: one based on poverty and unemployment and one based on a battens down for the privileged of what they have.  When that happens there will be an effective barrier to participation.  These bankrupt economics are cancelling the citizenship rights of half our society.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for his co-operation for allowing me the opportunity to speak before 9 p.m.  I intend at this stage to make some general references to what has been said tonight. It struck me that Deputy Birmingham, rather than speaking on the topic of the Adjournment Debate and the record of the Government during the past 100 days or so, gave us some kind of apology for Fine Gael's lack-lustre performance during that period.  I have heard it said that attack is the best method of defence and Deputy Birmingham's attack tonight seemed to echo that belief &mdash; if he attacked enough people rather than turning his attention to the policies and performance of his own party that possibly people would not advert to the very poor performance of Fine Gael over the past 100 days.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I thank the Minister for the Marine who I understand is standing in for the Minister for Labour.  None of us can fail to observe the ongoing problems there have been in the ISPCC. Earlier in the week there was some hope of a settlement of the dispute as there were talks of Labour Court hearings and discussions.  However, because these have come to nothing and in fact the situation has become stalemate, I raise the matter in the House in the hope that <Col N="3943" /> the Minister may be able to intervene to the Labour Court to bring the sides back to the table to seek a resolution.</P>
      <P>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is noted, not for management and staff problems, but for the wide range of support services they give to the poorest and most vulnerable sections in the community.  This is the first time in the 100 years of its existence that this kind of situation has emerged. This dispute does no good, either to the image of the society or to the 1,000 or so families in either the settled or the itinerant communities who are dependent on the services and the support services of the ISPCC.  In my own constituency they provide a playschool service in the local itinerant settlement. This is a valued and very important service in helping the children to become integrated into the community.  That little extra assistance at pre-school age, which is so vital, is of great benefit when they go to school.</P>
      <P>The issues involved appear to be complex involving redundancies, retrospection pay and the general problems of the society in maintaining their operations under the economic pressures which will be there for the foreseeable future.  In the past week as the dispute has been going on there have been no moves whatsoever because an initial Labour Court conciliation attempt was deserted by the management side who refused to submit to binding arbitration. The unions involved, who represent the workers, have offered to submit the issues to binding arbitration in the Labour Court.  It would be desirable to bring the sides together to that forum to seek some agreement.  The workers and the management must also be frustrated because of the lack of progress and some intervention may be needed to bring the sides together.  I am asking if there is any way in which the Department of Labour could get the wheels in motion to get some form of conciliation or to arrange a forum in which the two sides could meet and seek to find a solution.</P>

      <P>I should like to add to Deputy Flaherty's plea that some initiative be taken in this dispute for a number of reasons.  The workers involved have been working for a long time, because of their own background and commitment, in conditions which would not be acceptable to many other workers of their training or in terms of the number of hours they work.  This fact is widely appreciated and I am grateful to Deputy Flaherty for allowing me to submit a few points which have been made to me.  This point is very much appreciated by the families of the children involved.  That is the reason they have stated publicly they wished this dispute was resolved in a sense of equity to the employees of the organisation involved.  It is true to say that any organisation operating at present has to operate conscious of the economic circumstances.  That argument is a much lesser one than the case which has been made and put forward by the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employees have been entirely reasonable in putting forward their case as they have been willing to adopt the usual procedures in relation to the resolution of an industrial relations dispute. There is an obvious recalcitrance in relation to the negotiation process.  The reason it is raised in the Dáil is that it is very important in the interests of children and the families involved that attention should be drawn to employees who have for so long worked, in comparative terms to other employees, for low wages.  The reason they have not complained in the <Col N="3945" /> past is the sense of dedication which they have brought to the work they are doing. They have just realised that the importance of their work, the human contact and the kind of dedication required, has in fact restrained them.  For their dedication in the past and for being willing to make sacrifices they should not be treated in the way they are now.  The reality is that people who work in the caring profession, and particularly those working with deprived children, are standing out on the street on official strike.  It is a very sad day indeed.</P>
    <P>A background feature to all of this is the unresolved issue between State provision and voluntarism.  We all hope at a certain stage that we know the State should never be bailed out of a situation where it makes adequate provision for children.  It never has happened in Ireland so we can leave that part aside. The voluntary sector must not be used as a substitute for State provision.  In the charters negotiated for a balance between a State and voluntary provision it is important that those who work within the voluntary sector have satisfactory working conditions, that respects their training and commitment.  We must realise that the definition of voluntary must be a definition of the 20th century. I am not making criticisms here.  I would like to see the association involved getting much more State aid.</P>
    <P>I have listened to all the sides in relation to this dispute.  I come to the inescapable conclusion that those people who have worked for a very long time in demanding conditions requiring complex responses to human difficult situations are forced into the position they are now in.  It is absolutely unacceptable to simply stand and say there are known procedures by which this dispute can be resolved.  There is no way in which anything can be resolved in that respect unless, as Deputy Flaherty said, both parties enter into it in the spirit that they will accept a resolution of the dispute which will take cognisance of the cases put forward by both parties.  If that kind of an embargo on the resolution is there, how <Col N="3946" /> in the name of goodness can it be resolved other than by intervention?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour would be well served by intervening and discussing equally such external supports as are necessary from the Department of Health or elsewhere to facilitate a resolution so that the workers can do what they have wanted to do, and which they have been doing: to continue caring for children. They should not be penalised for the fact that they have given unstinting service. If they were in a different kind of work they could have plunged in their claim over a long period of years for wages and conditions of employment and consultation. Incidentally, I have come to the conclusion that we are long overdue with regard to the voluntary sector in giving them basic charterist procedures and conditions and so forth.  May the day hasten when that will happen.  In the meantime this dispute should be solved. As Deputy Flaherty has suggested, the Minister should use his efforts to achieve a solution.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Flaherty for sharing her time with me.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister cannot be here, but he has asked me to outline the present position on this issue.  I appreciate fully the concern of Deputy Flaherty and Deputy M. Higgins on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is a national voluntary organisation who provide a range of family support services to children and their families &mdash; for example, creches, play schools and social work services.  As Deputy M. Higgins pointed out, approximately 40 per cent of their funds come from the Department of Health and the remaining 60 per cent from voluntary subscriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of financial problems a task force was appointed to investigate the position and make recommendations.  An accounting firm was part of the task force and they recommended the appointment of a financial controller.  A fund raiser within the ISPCC was appointed to that position.  Shortly after his appointment <Col N="3947" /> the bookkeeper was dismissed, the argument being that there was no job for her.  Prior to her dismissal, the union, the Local Government and Public Services Union, had been negotiating on proposed redundancies in the society and also on the payment of wages amounting to £75,000 which were overdue for about three years.  I understand that agreement had been reached about a number of redundancies and progress was being made on the wages front.  The new wage proposals were to extend to 1990, on a phased basis.  However the dismissal of the bookkeeper threw the whole negotiations into disarray and caused an official stoppage of work since 16 June.</P>
    <P>Two Labour Court conciliation conferences have already taken place in an effort to resolve the dispute.  It is important to note that the Minister for Labour <Col N="3948" /> has made some inquiries in the matter and he now understands that the parties are willing to return to Labour Court conciliation talks.  The Minister would hope the talks under the auspices of the conciliation service of the Labour Court could be got going again as soon as possible. I understand that late this afternoon developments along these lines have taken place and it is hoped that Labour Court conciliation talks will recommence at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that as the talks will resume almost immediately, it would not be helpful at this stage to get any more involved in the issue and it should be left to the conciliation service to resolve this unfortunate dispute.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 26 June 1987.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department who deal with the public on a face-to-face basis <Col N="3746" /> or on the telephone are trained to provide a courteous and efficient service.  In addition to the on-the-job training which all such staff undergo the staff development unit in my Department provide regular courses in customer relations training.  I am very conscious of the need to treat applicants for social welfare services with tact and courtesy at all times and with this in mind the training courses provided by my Department are regularly revised and updated in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>The content of each training course varies slightly according to the needs of the trainees.  The following is a typical programme content:</P>
      <P> (i) Basic communications theory.</P>
      <P>(ii) Assertion.</P>
      <P>(iii) Dealing with difficult customers.</P>
      <P>(iv) Questionnaire and discussion on effective customer service.</P>
      <P>(v) Film &ldquo;Dealing with the public&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(vi) Role plays.</P>
      <P>(vii) Discussion and feedback on role play.</P>
      <P>(viii) Summary and action planning.  </P>
      <P>The telephone techniques training covers similar theory but emphasises the constraints involved in not being able to see the customer.  Particular stress is put on aspects such as the so called verbal handshake, i.e. the welcome in the voice, taking information accurately, ensuring as far as possible that information given is understood and the importance of followup. A different training film is used to reinforce the points.</P>
      <P>Participants are filmed in the role plays on almost all courses and this is an important aid to the feedback they are given.</P>

    <P>In a joint venture with the Department of the Public Service, marketing consultants (Market Research Bureau of Ireland) were employed to conduct a survey of the attitude of the public to social welfare services.  The objectives of the survey, which was carried out in <Col N="3747" /> September/October 1986, were to measure reaction of social welfare recipients to the service provided to them, to identify specific areas in which improvements are required and to assess reaction to possible new methods of payment.  The following is an extract from the consultants general conclusion of the survey results:</P>
    <P>In overall terms, reaction of the three categories of social welfare recipients covered in the survey &mdash; the unemployed, pensioners and those on disability benefit &mdash; can be described as satisfactory.  Initiation of payments is seen to be straightforward, as is the completion of application forms, while considerable majorities are satisfied with payment procedures.  Furthermore, the courtesy and politeness of staff is highly regarded; a considerable majority (three in every four) of those who had contact with officials consider that they know their job well and finally, in this positive context, the relevant forms are not perceived as formidable or difficult. </P>
    <P>The MRBI survey cost £18,000 with the Department of the Public Service bearing 50 per cent of the cost.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the instructions, if any, which have been issued to community welfare officers that supplementary welfare allowance should not be paid to persons whose social welfare has been cut because they declined to participate in Jobsearch programmes, even where this decision is under appeal; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons in this category have been refused supplementary welfare allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>No instructions on the lines mentioned by the Deputy have been issued by my Department.  The basic criterion for the award of supplementary welfare allowance is that an applicant has not got <Col N="3748" /> sufficient means to meet his or her needs. An applicant for supplementary welfare allowance may also be required to register for employment, unless there are specific circumstances which would justify the waiving of this requirement.</P>
      <P>Community welfare officers must be satisfied, in determining the entitlement of any applicant, including applicants whose claims for unemployment payments may have been disallowed, that he satisfies the means test and other conditions for receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.  A person who is not satisfied with the decision on his application may appeal against it to his local health board.</P>
      <P>In the normal course of their work, community welfare officers regularly deal with applications for supplementary welfare allowance from persons who have been refused payments of unemployment benefit or assistance for failure to meet the statutory qualifying conditions.  This has been a feature of the scheme since its inception.  I am aware that since the advent of the Jobsearch programme, a number of persons have had their unemployment payments reviewed and some have been terminated for reasons associated with their non-participation in the Jobsearch programme.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that a small number of persons whose unemployment payments were so terminated have contacted the Department recently to say that they had also been refused supplementary welfare allowance.  These persons were advised that they should discuss their situation in detail again with the staff member dealing with their claims in the employment exchanges.  They were also advised of the appeals procedures.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has particular cases in mind where he considers that supplementary welfare allowance has been unfairly refused, I will be happy to have them looked into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free electricity scheme meets the cost of the normal standing charge on the ESB's domestic consumer tariff and allows up to 200 and 300 free electricity units per two-monthly billing period in summer and winter respectively. The basic purpose of the scheme is to help those with actual costs incurred and it was never the intention of the scheme to provide for crediting in respect of costs not yet incurred.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to revise the scheme along the lines advocated by the Deputy as it is considered that the scheme in its present format meets the objectives for which it was designed.  Some 172,000 persons benefit under the existing scheme at an annual cost of £21.79 million to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the average unemployment assistance payment to single persons living at home; the lowest amounts paid to single persons on unemployment assistance living at home; if he will set a minimum level of unemployment assistance below which no person's entitlements would fall; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on means and in any particular case the rate payable is the appropriate maximum rate less the weekly means assessed, including in the case of single persons living at home the value of board and lodgings.  The lowest rate would, therefore, in individual cases depend on the claimant's means.  Statistics are not kept in such a way as would enable the average rate of assistance paid to single persons living at home to be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting of a minimum level of assistance payment, irrespective of means, would not be an efficient use of resources in present circumstances of <Col N="3750" /> financial constraint.  The purpose of the means assessment is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants living in relatively better off circumstances and those whose circumstances are not so good.  The criteria used in the assessment are designed to ensure that each case is decided fairly having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    <P>The recent budget provided for an increase of 3 per cent in all weekly payments from next month at an extra cost of some £30 million this year.  Deputies will remember that the previous Government did not propose to give a general increase until November.  The 3 per cent increase now being paid next month will maintain the real level of payments of over 700,000 social welfare recipients and it will also maintain the significant real increases in the level of payments which have been achieved over the last decade.  In that period there has been an increase of over 44 per cent in real terms in payments to the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not maintained in a manner which would allow the information sought by the Deputy in this case to be furnished.</P>

    <P>It is a statutory condition for receipt of unemployment benefit that persons must be available for and genuinely seeking employment suitable for them having <Col N="3751" /> regard to their age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.</P>
    <P>Whether claimants are deemed to be available for and genuinely seeking work is a matter which is determined by statutorily appointed deciding officers.  Each case is determined on its merits through the application of standard criteria.  Persons who are dissatisfied with the decisions on their claims have the right to have their cases submitted for consideration by an appeals officer where the person has the opportunity to explain in person her particular circumstances.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inspector of taxes will not be in a position to determine if, or to what extent, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of income tax for 1986-87, until certain outstanding information is received.  The inspector wrote to the taxpayer in the matter recently. On receipt of the required information the taxpayer's liability for 1986-87 will be reviewed and any refund found to be due will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following is the information requested by the Deputy, so far as it is available:</P>
      <P>(a)  A figure for average gross pay for the non-industrial civil service is not readily available.  The best available figure is expenditure per head, calculated by dividing the total outturn of civil service pay subheads (which include pay, allowances, overtime, employers' PRSI, etc.) for the relevant calendar years by the numbers serving at the beginning of each year.  The resulting figures for expenditure per head are 1984, £11,254; 1985, £12,264; 1986, £13,429.</P>
      <P>(b)  and (c) Statistics are not available which would enable the figures requested under these headings to be provided. However, on the figures given at (a) above, a single person, taxed under PAYE, would have paid £3,912, £4,397 and £4,862 in income tax in the tax years 1984-85, 1985-86 and 1986-87 respectively, while a married couple with no children, one spouse earning, taxed under PAYE, would have paid £2,269, £2,752 and £3,055 respectively in the tax years in question.  These figures assume that no tax reliefs or allowances other than the personal and PAYE allowances were being claimed.</P>
      <P>Again on the basis of the figures at (a), the total employee PRSI deduction would have been £439, £478 and £389 respectively in the tax years in question; this deduction has been calculated at the employee rate of social insurance for a modified rate contributor in Contribution Class B and also includes temporary income levy (for 1984-85 and 1985-86), youth employment levy and health contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3757" /> (d)  The numbers serving at the beginning of each year were 1984, 31,544; 1985, 30,659; 1986, 30,532.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.  I am informed by the Garda <Col N="3758" /> authorities that the present opening hours of Maynooth station, 10.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. Monday to Saturday and 12 noon to 2.00 p.m. on Sundays, are considered adequate to meet local needs and are fixed so as to strike an appropriate balance between the provision of a station service and outdoor patrol duties. An extension of the station's opening hours would be at the expense of outdoor patrolling duties which are regarded as a very important element of the crime prevention activities of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>When Maynooth station is closed, members of the public who require Garda assistance can contact the Garda through the 999 system, by telephoning the district headquarters station at Naas or by using the free external radio-telephone &mdash; the `Green Man' &mdash; at Maynooth station which puts callers in immediate contact with Naas station.</P>
      <P>In so far as mobile Garda patrols for Maynooth, Celbridge and Clane are concerned, I am informed by the Garda authorities that these areas are covered by mobile patrols from the district headquarters station at Naas on a 24-hour basis.  In addition, there is a motorcycle assigned to Celbridge station and the patrol car assigned to Rathcoole can be called upon to assist if the need arises. The Garda authorities consider that these arrangements are adequate and make the most effective use of resources in providing a satisfactory mobile Garda service over the entire district.</P>
      <P>As regards the policing arrangements generally, I am informed by the Garda authorities that an extra Garda was assigned to Celbridge recently and that the strength and other resources allocated to the three stations in question, together with the resources available from the district headquarters at Naas, are adequate to meet the present police needs of these areas.  The situation will, however, continue to be kept under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 of the Prisons (Ireland) Act, 1907 allows provision to be made by prison rules to enable a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment to earn by special industry and good conduct a remission of a portion of his imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Rule 38 (2) of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, provides that a male prisoner sentenced to penal servitude shall be eligible by special industry and good conduct to earn remission of a portion of his sentence not exceeding one-fourth of the whole sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the invariable practice to accept that all offenders serving sentences of longer than one month are entitled to full remission unless all or part of it is forfeited as a consequence of breaches of prison discipline.  In the case of the <Col N="3760" /> offender referred to by the Deputy no such forfeiture arose and, accordingly, the question of his entitlement to anything other than the full remission did not arise.  The Deputy will appreciate that the nature of the crime for which an offender has been sentenced, or a view of his possible or likely behaviour on returning to the community, are not factors which could properly be taken into account in relation to the amount of remission which an offender actually receives.</P>
    <P>No proposals were made to my predecessor that the offender in question should not be released in the normal way and, in any event, the Minister would not have had the power to prevent his release.  The Deputy will appreciate that the courts, in deciding that a sentence of 10 years penal servitude was appropriate in this case, would have been aware of the provisions governing remission. Allowing for normal remission, the imposed sentence was served in full.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to supplementary questions about this case last week, the offender, during the course of his imprisonment, was seen by a psychiatrist on 26 occasions.  No decision was taken that a transfer to the Central Mental Hospital was warranted at any stage while he was serving the 10 year sentence.</P>
    <P>The question of using the powers contained in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 in so far as they would apply to an individual who has served his sentence is not a matter for the Minister for Justice. However, I should make it clear that in referring to these powers I am not to be taken as expressing a view as to whether their use would have been either possible or appropriate in this case.</P>

I have no plans to introduce further legislation in this area.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister for Justice to a parliamentary question on 8 April on the subject, where he stated that the Garda authorities are satisfied that they have adequate powers to deal with cruelty to animals whenever it is observed by members of the force or when complaints are received from members of the public.</P>

      <P>It is estimated from the 1985 farm structures sample survey that the number of female landholders at 24,000 represented approximately 11 per cent of the 220,000 farming landholders in the State.  Not all landholders, however, would consider themselves to be &ldquo;at work&rdquo; with farming as a principal gainful occupation; the results from the 1985 labour force sample survey indicate that only an estimated 119,000 landholders considered themselves to be in this category and, of these, 5,800 or 5 per cent were female.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned has been in receipt of unemployment benefit since May 1986. Following a review of his case, his claim was disallowed from 4 June 1987 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work, by virtue of the fact that he had not made any effort to obtain employment.</P>
      <P>A form to enable him to appeal has been issued to him.  When he returns this form, duly completed, arrangements will be made to have his case determined by an appeals officer at the earliest available opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>An officer from headquarters was not sent to Galway employment exchange for the purposes mentioned.  The position is that towards the end of last year an officer was appointed in each of the 13 largest employment exchanges for full time fraud control work.  The particular officer appointed in the Galway employment exchange was in fact already serving in that exchange and had served there for the previous four years.</P>
      <P>Among the duties of these officers is the interviewing of claimants to confirm that they continue to satisfy the basic requirements of the unemployment schemes namely that they be fully unemployed, are capable of work and genuinely available and seeking employment.</P>
      <P>Claimants to be interviewed by the officer in Galway are normally given two days' prior notice.  Every effort is made to ensure confidentiality in conducting the interviews, but due to accommodation constraints there is no alternative, at present, to having interviews carried out at hatches.  I am having this matter examined further.</P>

      <P>It is the practice to arrange that persons who have their social welfare payments disallowed are fully informed <Col N="3769" /> of the basis of the disallowance in their case.  Questions relating to the entitlement to unemployment benefit and assistance are decided by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers.  Where, following a review of a claim from an investigation by an investigating officer or an interview with the claimant, a deciding officer disallows the payment, the person concerned is informed of the reason for the disallowance in writing and the relevant statutory provision under which the disallowance was made is quoted.</P>
      <P>The decision quoted on the disallowance notice does not require any further clarification in the vast majority of cases.</P>
      <P>Where, however, the person may not be clear as to the basis for the decision, it is open to him to inquire at this local office where the matter will be explained further.  All claimants whose payments are disallowed are informed of their right of appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned who had been in receipt of disability benefit since April 1982, had her payment disallowed from 6 June 1986 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. She appealed against the disallowance and was examined on 19 January 1987 by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to disallow payment of disability benefit was subsequently upheld by an appeals officer who decided on 15 May 1987 that she was capable of work during the period from 6 June 1986 to 21 April 1987, the date of the latest medical certificate before him.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and <Col N="3770" /> can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.  The person concerned continued to claim disability benefit after 21 April 1987, with the same incapacity.  Her claim from that date has been disallowed by a deciding officer.  She was notified of the disallowance and of her right to appeal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has satisfied himself that real competition exists between alternative suppliers of bottled domestic gas in the standard size, given the multiplicity of different, incompatible regulatory fittings for the same; the action, if any, he intends taking to introduce a standard fitting which will meet both national safety standards and facilitate interchangeability of alternative sources of gas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that competition between the three companies who currently supply bottled domestic gas to the Irish market has always been keen.  In addition, strong competition exists between the bottled gas producers and the other industries in the energy sector i.e. electricity, domestic heating oil and natural gas.</P>
      <P>The development of a standard fitting which will facilitate interchangeability of alternative sources of gas is a matter for private industry.  My primary responsibility is to ensure that an adequate standard of safety exists for users of bottled domestic gas and to that end two Irish standards were signed in October 1986 relating specifically to the safety of neck valves and pressure regulators for liquified petroleum gas cylinders.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any evidence of public dissatisfaction in respect of different fittings for cylinders.</P>

      <P>I share the concerns expressed by the Irish Videogram Association about the adverse economic effects of video piracy and, at my request, the Government have recently authorised the restoration of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1984, to the Dáil Order Paper.  This Bill, <i>inter alia,</i> makes provision for substantial increased penalties, including terms of imprisonment, for breaches of copyright and is specifically designed to stamp out importation of and dealing in pirated video material.  The Bill also strengthens the search and seizure provisions which can be applied in relation to illicitly copied material.</P>

      <P>There is no requirement on Bord na Móna to leave a minimum depth of peat when carrying out their harvesting operations. No decision has been reached as to the uses to be made of the different depths and types of cut-away bog currently available.  However, cut-away bog is being left in a state suitable for development for either grassland or forestry. There is not sufficient depth of peat on existing cutaways for horticultural purposes, but in any event the suitability of cutaway for such purposes has not yet been established.  When the research on this subject has been completed, further consideration can be given to the question of optimum peat depth but, of course, the alternative fuel value of the residual peat will also have to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research carried out by the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department on short rotation forestry related specifically to an investigation of the growth of conifers and broadleaf forest crops in relation to their use as a primary source of energy.  This was part of an EC funded project which was co-ordinated by the <Col N="3794" /> National Board for Science and Technology and included separate studies by An Foras Talúntais and Bord na Móna using coppicing trees.  In addition, there is a project initiated by the NBST involving two farmers in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The results of these trials have been mixed.  However, I understand that target yields of dry matter have been attained where the optimum combination of special soil type, plant spacing and fertilisation have been present.</P>
    <P>The results of the project are being assessed by the EC at the moment and are due for publication in September, together with proposals for further research, if such is considered necessary. It is my intention to ensure that, in respect of any further initiatives in this area, any unnecessary fragmentation of effort on our part will be avoided and that co-ordination between the agencies involved will be maximised.</P>
    <P>Production costs and the market price currently available for forest produce make biomass plantations an uneconomic proposition at the moment and for the foreseeable future.  It is unlikely therefore that short rotation crops will be available as an alternative fuel source for electricity production.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if the development proposals prepared jointly by the Forestry and Wildlife Service and the Industrial Development Authority have been frustrated by a lack of timber supplies; whether this can be resolved by rescheduling the flow of timber from State forests; whether it represents a miscalculation on the part of the Forestry and Wildlife Service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke) Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any planned development proposal which has been frustrated by inadequate forecasting of available timber supplies.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the Forest and Wildlife Service will market 1.25 million cubic metres (m³) of timber.  By 1993 this volume will reach 2 million m³ and by the year 2,000 a total of 3 million m³ of both sawlog and pulpwood will be put on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, native sawlog timber accounts for 50 per cent of the home market for construction timber, an increase of the order of 35 per cent over the last seven years.  By the early 1990s <Col N="3796" /> our share of the construction market should be at least 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>As far as the pulpwood sector is concerned domestic supply and demand can be regarded as being in balance at present, but again, as on the sawlog side, there is reason to be optimistic about the future.  Pulpwood supplies are increasing and a recent study by internationally renowned timber consultants predict a new pulpwood industry with the next three to four years and further pulpwood processing facilities by 1999.</P>
    <P>While it is my wish to make more timber available on the market we must have regard to the danger of over-exploiting our forestry resources.  Such over-exploitation or rescheduling of supplies might have certain short-term gains but in the longer term would not be in the interest of the State or the timber industry generally.</P>

This package was made available for purchase by suitable oil companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date 12 companies have purchased the data.  As is the norm in the oil exploration industry, applications for licences would not be expected until the closing date, 1 July 1987.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Protection of the Irish people and the environment from the potential hazards of radioactive emissions from other <Col N="3799" /> nuclear facilities in the UK is linked to the safety of those facilities.  As I indicated in the Dáil on 8 April 1987 I wrote to the then UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Peter Walker MP, expressing the Government's concern about the safety of such facilities.  As in the case of Sellafield, the Government will continue to pursue these issues with the UK and at international level.  Measures open to the Government are being considered including any steps necessary to ensure that such measures could be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Brundtland report was presented on 5 May 1987, to a Joint EC/EFTA meeting in Brussels.  Ireland welcomed the report for its wide ranging analysis and in particular for its emphasis of the theme of sustainable development.</P>
      <P>One of the problems considered in the report is the acidification caused by long range transport of air pollutants.  The recent report on Air Quality in Ireland published by An Foras Forbartha concluded that there is little evidence to date in Ireland of marked environmental damage from acidification.  However, the report does refer to limited episodes of high acid deposition along the eastern seaboard of Ireland associated with easterly wind conditions, and continued vigilance is therefore necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effective countermeasures to acidification depend on national and international controls.  As regards national <Col N="3803" /> measures, the recently enacted Air Pollution Act, 1987 (No. 6 of 1987) provides the necessary legislative framework.  As regards international measures, Ireland is participating in the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution and in the EC Environment Action Programme both of which aim to limit, and where possible, to reduce the transboundary effects of air pollution.</P>

      <P>The returns for animal experimentation carried out in 1985 under the Cruelty to <Col N="3814" /> Animals Act, 1876 show that a total of 32,136 animals were involved in a total of 24,235 procedures.  The returns for 1986 are not yet completed but are expected to show a similar level of activity.</P>
      <P>The balance of medical and other informed opinion at the present time is that properly controlled animal experimentation contributes to advances which lead to the protection of life and alleviation of suffering.  I accept that some animal experimentation will, therefore, continue to be necessary in the public interest subject to proper safeguards but I am anxious to keep the level of experimentation to a minimum.</P>
      <P>All persons wishing to conduct experiments must be licensed by me under the Cruelty to Animals Act and all applications for licences are closely scrutinised by inspectors appointed under the Act.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above, a special grant of £80,000 was paid to post-primary schools in the inner city area of Dublin in 1982.</P>
    <P>The schemes are administered through the principal teachers of the schools, who, subject to the amount of money made available to them annually, have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and in the amount of assistance given to each one.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the schemes, a necessitous pupil is defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of particular circumstances e.g., unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family with inadequate means, a one-parent family or other circumstances which would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    <P>The allocation of funds to schools under the schemes is based on the number of such pupils as estimated by the school authorities.</P>
    <P>The allocation for each sector was used in full for each year.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to each type of second-level school listed by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>Secondary &mdash; The conditions and qualifications relating to registration as a secondary teacher are prescribed by the Registration Council.  The council is a statutorily constituted body which includes representatives of the Universities, School Management and teacher organisations in its membership. The council prescribes that an applicant for registration as a secondary teacher must, <i>inter alia,</i> comply with the following conditions: (a) hold a degree and training in teaching qualification acceptable to the Council; or (b) hold an acceptable qualification in one of the subjects art, home economics, physical education, religious education, woodwork, metal-work or music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a bachelor degree of an Irish or a British university is an acceptable qualification in fulfilling the degree requirement and the higher diploma in <Col N="3820" /> education of an Irish university automatically fulfils the teacher training requirement of condition (a) above. These qualifications merit open registration. Certain qualifications which are automatically acceptable under (b) above confine the holder to teaching the subject of his/her qualification.</P>
    <P>In general, applicants holding qualifications obtained outside of this State are assessed by the Registration Council on an individual basis and if the qualifications appear to the council to be equivalent to a primary degree and H. Dip. from an Irish university it may, by resolution and with my approval, accept them for registration purposes.</P>
    <P>The other main requirements for registration are; the completion of one year of satisfactory teaching experience in accordance with the council's regulations and establishment of a proficiency in oral Irish.</P>
    <P>Community and Comprehensive &mdash; The minimum standard of qualifications required for appointment in a community and comprehensive school are as follows: (i)  a relevant primary degree i.e., the subject in the title of the post must be taken in the final degree examination of a recognised degree awarding authority; and the higher diploma in education of an Irish university or an approved equivalent qualification; (ii) an acceptable qualification in Irish.</P>
    <P>Vocational Schools and Community Colleges &mdash; In general, the qualifications required for appointment as a teacher in second-level vocational schools and community colleges are: (i) the degree of a recognised degree awarding authority with at least one subject on the school curriculum taken in the final degree examination or an equivalent qualification; and (ii) An ceard teastas Gaeilge or equivalent qualification.  An ceard teastas Gaeilge is a certificate of a person's competency to teach through Irish.</P>
