      <P>No, it is not agreed. Before agreeing to the Order of Business, which I would like to do, I want to ask the Taoiseach if he will allow the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the acting Minister in the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come into this House and explain the circumstances surrounding the closure of the Hyster factory this morning, and the activities of a company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Please Deputy Mitchell, allow me to clear the Order of Business.  The Chair will insist on clearing in a decisive manner the Order of Business. If Members wish to object they will be afforded an opportunity to do so when I complete putting certain proposals in the Order of Business to the House.  As I asked earlier, is the late sitting agreed? Agreed.  Are the proposals in relation to statements as outlined by the Taoiseach agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposal regarding the statements, I have to make the following point.  Since it was agreed that time would be set aside for statements the matter on which those statements would be made has come before the courts and is awaiting adjudication. The proposal before us that &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in the practice of the Dáil in relation to references in debate to matters which are awaiting or are under adjudication in the courts,&rdquo; amounts to a departure, and a very clear departure, from the custom and practice of this House in relation to matters which are before the courts.  Since there has been a change in the status of the matter since we agreed to have time made available for statements, I believe it is a matter which should be considered further by you and the Whips before we proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is that we should be entitled this morning by way of <Col N="1156" /> statements to consider and discuss some recent court decisions.  I have given this matter some thought and I felt it is in the public interest that we should proceed in the way I have outlined here.  I am aware of the practice that has prevailed for many years whereby this House does not wish to prejudice the interests of persons coming before the courts by having the matters discussed here in advance of the hearing in the courts.  However, there has to be a limit to that.</P>
      <P>I cannot, and I think most Deputies will agree with me, envisage a situation where the House will be prevented from discussing matters of urgent public interest simply because some person, a citizen, decides to initiate court proceedings. We have had cases where libel actions were instituted and this House was prevented from discussing matters which it wished to discuss because initial steps were taken in regard to the libel proceedings and then the libel proceedings were subsequently not proceeded with.  I am not suggesting that is the case in this instance.  The House would fulfil its obligations of responsibility if it refrained from discussing matters of serious criminal cases, or equivalent types of cases, but I do not think that in this instance we should be prevented from discussing this very important matter simply because preliminary steps, as I understand, have been taken in regard to the institution of libel proceedings.</P>
      <P>I have considered the matter carefully. It is a question of balance of advantage and I feel that in this case the public interest demands that we do have a review of the situation and not be prevented from doing so for six months, 12 months or a length of time which might be involved in the court proceedings concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some considerable reluctance that I intervene in this motion which is now before the House.  I would not intervene were I not convinced that involved in the proposal here is a principle of enormous importance. This is being brought before the <Col N="1157" /> House in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and without notice.  The Taoiseach has raised certain feelings he has about these matters.  If this rule is to be dealt with it should be dealt with in a very formal way and not in a casual cavalier <i>ad hoc</i> manner arising out of an emotive case.  This is much too serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that we can decide this issue on the Order of Business in the normal way but it is not open to debate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that but in my view what I am going to say will be strictly in order.  The motion before the House proposes to suspend Standing Orders in order to allow statements to be made in a manner that in my opinion was never contemplated by Standing Order No. 41.  However, of greater importance is the fact that the motion invites the House to ignore a rule, known as the <i>sub judice</i> rule, which was established by inheritance and precedent 65 years ago and wisely respected since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point or order, Deputy Fitzpatrick is referring to a motion before the House but there is not a motion before the House.  What we are discussing is the Order of Business.  From the point of view of the Government I should like to point out that the procedure which we propose is in response to a request from the Opposition that the House be given an opportunity to review these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a motion before the House and it seeks to ignore the Standing Order and this rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair should be permitted to go through the proposal for today's business and if there are serious objections they can be dealt with in the ordinary way.  To allow a debate develop at this stage would be improper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make the <Col N="1158" /> point that there is a proposal before the House to do something, notwithstanding Standing Orders.  I want to say before the House takes whatever decision it is going to take on the matter, that the House should be clear on what it is doing.  At the very least that means that if we are to proceed with these statements Members of the House should take account of the fact that the absolute privilege that applies in this House carries with it a certain obligation.  It is well that the House should be aware of that.  In addition, since we are dealing with statements, and provision for statements, I would wish to ask &mdash; we can deal with this later &mdash; the Taoiseach to make time available during the course of the day for statements to be made on the Hyster affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the sentiment expressed by Deputy Dukes that our privileges carry the onus of discretion and responsibility and I am sure Deputies will bear that in mind.  I will consider in what way information regarding the Hyster issue can be disclosed to Deputies in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot allow a debate to develop at this stage.  The Chair has a statement to make in respect of this matter and it was intended to make it before the debate commenced.  Perhaps I should make it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Chair bear with me for one moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to explain my position.  The motion before the House, with the greatest respect, was put by the Chair when the Chair asked if the House agreed to the proposal for the making of statements today.  I am stating why I do not agree and, with the greatest <Col N="1159" /> of respect, I will keep strictly within the letter of order.  I will not go into the merits of what will be discussed and I have not mentioned them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree, from his previous experience and that of his predecessors, that making speeches on the Order of Business is unheard of.  I am seeking to allow the Deputy to put his point of view but he must be very brief and succinct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House also directs the Ceann Comhairle to ignore the <i>sub judice</i> rule and it takes away the Chair's discretion. Broadly speaking, the <i>sub judice</i> rule provides for the protection of litigants, lowly or exalted, in that a matter awaiting or under adjudication should not be brought before the House.  The object of the rule is to ensure that the trial of the issue which is awaiting trial is not prejudiced by discussion in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy again but I must point out to him that the Chair is very well aware of the importance of the <i>sub judice</i> rule and has a view to express on that shortly, if the Chair is allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to argue with the Chair or appear obstructive but I would like to ask will I have an opportunity before this motion is passed, taking away the protection of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, of saying why it should not be passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the reference to &ldquo;aspects of recent court cases&rdquo;?  I understood that this related to a particular trial which concluded the week before last.  Is it proposed to include other cases in the statements and, if so, what are they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no particular <Col N="1160" /> cases in mind apart from the case which is uppermost in everybody's mind.  It was felt that Deputies in discussing the matter might wish to refer to other cases of a similar kind and that the discussion on one case might be more meaningful if it was taken in the context of others.  It is in order to be of assistance to Deputies rather than the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to suspend the operation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in future and is there any precedent for its suspension in this House?  I cannot recall an instance but no doubt if there is one the Taoiseach will be aware of it.  If so, would he let us know because it is an unusual step which requires some explanation. I can recall other court cases of considerably greater importance than this one which were not discussed in the House because of this rule.  As recently as a few weeks ago you, Sir, ruled that a particular question submitted by a member of this party was out of order as breaching the <i>sub judice</i> rule although it related to something which was the subject of proceedings abroad.  It is curious that a rule which was enforced so rigidly up to a few weeks ago should suddenly be pushed aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I raised this in the House when the previous Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair and he was unable to quote any <i>sub judice</i> rule.  It is not in Standing Orders. Could you please quote to me the <i>sub judice</i> rule in question?  I understand it is some kind of precedent but not a rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long standing practice in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a practice; there is no such thing as a <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my own comment in respect of these matters pertaining to the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I must advise the House that I have been informed that Mr. Paul Carney, <Col N="1161" /> Senior Counsel, has instituted defamation proceedings against two national newspapers arising out of articles which appeared in them.  I am also aware that a plenary summons and a statement of claim were lodged in the High Court on 8 June 1987.  In these circumstances, the long standing practice of the House in relation to matters awaiting adjudication by a court would prevent reference to the Cavan case in the course of the statements about to be made.  If the House decides to suspend the practice for the purpose of this statement then the Chair, of course, will allow the making of references to that case.  I would have to insist, in so far as I could, that Members, if this debate is to be proceeded with, would exercise the utmost restraint in relation to any references that may be made to persons outside the House. Members of this House have absolute privilege whereas outsiders do not.  If the debate is to be proceeded with, I further appeal to Members to avoid making references which might prejudice the right of any individual outside the House to a fair trial.  Finally, in respect of this matter, my predecessor, who is in the House, on 22 October 1986 in a matter pertaining to a <i>sub judice</i> rule, at column 14, Volume 369 of the Official Report stated:</P>
      <P>It is very important, therefore that it should be noted that this House has complete control over its own procedures. It can abolish the application of the <i>sub judice</i> rule or it can modify it.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the proposal made by the Taoiseach in this regard is not in conflict with that ruling.  I now propose to proceed to deal with the Order of Business in the ordinary way and if the Order of Business is challenged we shall deal with it and the Members may discuss the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A particularly abhorrent and outrageous crime was committed in Cavan town in the early hours of 3 December last year. Nothing that any of us says here today will alter that.  All of our sympathies must go out to the victim of that crime for the appalling suffering, both mental and physical, which she has had to endure from the circumstances of the crime itself and for the additional trauma and distress that she has suffered as a result of having to re-live the ordeal again in the course of the court proceedings.</P>
      <P>As I said, nothing that we say can undo what has happened.  Our purpose in commenting on it must be to try to bring about any changes that are called for that may help to reduce the likelihood that anyone in future will have to suffer in the same way.  It is not easy to know what can be done to prevent the occurrence of a crime of this nature.  The fact that such an appalling crime can occur in our society must be of serious concern to us all and we can ask what has gone wrong with a society which produces people who are prepared to commit offences such as this.  But this is not really what we are addressing here today.  Our concern must be to ensure, when a crime does occur, particularly a crime of such a heinous nature, that the resources available to the State, and the ways in which these resources operate, are such as to provide an effective legal process by which the guilty can be apprehended and brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I am entrusted with responsibility for the administration and business generally of public services in connection with law, justice, public order and police and with powers, duties and functions connected with the same. While this is so, there are overriding principles, enshrined in Articles of our Constitution, which provide for the separating of the functions of the executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. There is, accordingly placed on me, as Minister for Justice, a limitation on what I can properly say on this particular <Col N="1169" /> matter.  As a member of the Executive addressing the Legislature about a matter which directly concerns the judicial process, it is incumbent on me to be punctilious in not saying anything which might be construed as breaching the principles I have referred to.  There is a grave onus on us all to exercise responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am of course anxious as far as possible, within the constraints I have mentioned, that the Dáil should have the opportunity of expressing its views on matters that can be and are being widely discussed in the media and elsewhere.  If we cannot have that, there is a danger of lending support to the allegation that is sometimes made, that Dáil discussions are too often irrelevant to the real issues of the day.</P>
    <P>In turning now to the case in question, I want to make two points very clearly, and I ask all subsequent speakers to keep them very firmly in mind.  First, a person was charged with the very serious offences connected with this crime, that person was properly brought before a court, and that person was found &ldquo;Not Guilty&rdquo; of all the charges brought against him, by a jury of his peers.  That is something that the jury was bound to do once, in their view, any reasonable doubt existed about the guilt of the accused. That the jury found it possible to agree on their verdict so quickly &mdash; in something like ten minutes according to reports &mdash; is, I believe, of some considerable significance.  Whatever about that, the point is that the jury disposed of this case and we here cannot question their verdict and in effect presume to try the case again.</P>
    <P>The second point is that neither are we here to comment in any way on the conduct of the case by the presiding judge.  There is a long and I believe well-justified tradition in this House that the exercise of their functions by the Judiciary, or individual court decisions, are not criticised here.  In making the point I want to make it very clear that there is no implication that justified criticism might be possible were it not for the existence of this tradition.  The point to <Col N="1170" /> be borne in mind is that the Judiciary are independent in the exercise of their functions subject only to the Constitution and the law.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the case which seems to have attracted most public concern is the reported absence of Senior Counsel briefed by the Director of Public Prosecutions during parts of the trial, especially during certain parts where his attendance could be expected to be of particular importance.  I assure you that I most definitely share this concern that a Senior Prosecuting Counsel should be absent to any significant extent during the hearing of a serious criminal trial for which his services have been engaged.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the General Council of the Bar of Ireland has had its own inquiry carried out in connection with the circumstances of this case.  I have seen the report of this inquiry and in my view it does little to allay the public concern that has been widely expressed.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is also having inquiries made into what exactly transpired in this case and why. At this stage the only comment I shall make is this &mdash; irrespective of whether what happened occurred by virtue of some practice, or departure from a practice &mdash; the consequences of these inquiries must, in my view, be such as to ensure and to satisfy the public at large that an occurrence of this nature will not happen again.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Attorney General that he will be holding a statutory consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions under the provisions of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, on those aspects of our systems and procedures for prosecuting criminal offences which call to be looked at in the light of what occurred in this particular case.  The Attorney General will keep both the Taoiseach and myself informed of the steps, if any, that may need to be taken arising out of the statutory consultation.</P>
    <P>He has informed the Attorney General that his practice over the 12 years since the establishment of his office has been, <Col N="1171" /> and is, to brief counsel for the prosecution on the basis that they give full attention to the case throughout the trial. The Attorney General has also been informed by the DPP that his inquiries are being conducted in the light of that practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am very conscious of the remarks you made earlier this morning and I hope to respect your wishes in my contribution. However, in my opinion it is vitally important that those living under a democratic system of government respect the laws of the land, that those responsible for administering these laws do so in a fair and equitable way and that those involved in the whole legal system are respected.  Attacks on these basic principles must be checked immediately and action must be taken to restore public confidence.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to try to turn this Chamber into a courthouse.  My remarks are not intended to question the guilt or innocence of the accused man.  That matter was decided by a jury consisting of nine men and three women when they returned a verdict of &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo;  They did this having been persuaded by the defence that guilt could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  It would appear from newspaper reports that it took only ten minutes to reach that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a number of questions must be answered by the Minister to allay public disquiet and I note he answered some of the questions in his contribution. I pose a number of questions which the Minister might address when winding up this debate.  Is it not reasonable in cases such as this to expect the full prosecution team to be in attendance from the beginning to the end of the trial?  I note the Minister's comments in this regard but the question must be answered firmly. Rape is always a dreadful crime and presumably because in this instance it was accompanied by the most brutal violence &mdash; the Director of Public Prosecutions through the Chief State Solicitor saw fit <Col N="1172" /> to brief both a senior and junior counsel to represent and put forward the best possible case on behalf of the State. Surely, therefore, it is reasonble to expect that the DPP should ensure that whoever was offered the brief was available to be present right throughout the period of the trial?  If that was not the case, it should have been the case.  The Minister should give a guarantee today that this will be the procedure in future.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the absence of the senior counsel for nearly two days of the trial made little or no difference to the outcome as the junior counsel is a very experienced lawyer and ably substituted for his leader.  That may be so, but if that is the case, it poses another question.  Why was it necessary to engage the services of a senior counsel in the first place if the case could be adequately handled by a junior counsel?  It must also be recognised that on this occasion the defence team was led by one of the most formidable defence lawyers in this country. Human nature being what it is, the members of the jury must have been conscious of the difference in rank, no matter how competent the junior counsel may have been.  Otherwise why should we have both senior and junior counsels? To be fair to the senior counsel in this instance it should be made clear by the DPP, through the Minister, if it was a condition of his accepting this brief that he be present throughout the whole period of the trial.</P>
    <P>This leads me to another question.  Mr. Carney was absent for nearly two days of the rape case because he was representing the State in another case in the High Court.  Can the Minister tell me if there was another senior or junior counsel representing the State in this particular case in the High Court and if so, and to avoid the continuation of rumours around this House as to who this counsel might be, can the Minister name this counsel?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;could he or she not have taken that case on their own leaving Mr. Carney free to continue the prosecution case in the rape case?  Was it the case that the second counsel was not present in the High Court and that because of this Mr. Carney was forced to leave the rape case to the junior counsel and take the case in the High Court.  Is it the case that two sets of fees are paid regardless of whether one of the counsel is present and, if so, should this continue? I make that comment to be fair to the senior counsel who is being questioned as to his availability to represent the State in the rape case.  It is only right and proper, in order to be fair to the gentleman, that it should be made quite clear to this House if there was a second counsel retained by the State in respect of the High Court case and, if so, who it was and why that person was not present in the High Court, why he was not present to allow Mr. Carney to be available to represent the State in the rape case? Surely, in a case such as this where a counsel is representing the State in two different cases he must decide which is the most important case in terms of gravity.

      <P>There are some people in this House who appear to be terribly anxious that that question should not be answered and those same people come into this House and talk about the reduction in public expenditure and the abolition of State pensions but when it comes to asking questions about certain vested interest groups which should be answered they seem to become extremely nervous.</P>

      <P>Let us cut out the hypocrisy.  If the State is going to pay two sets of fees to two counsels to represent the State in court those people should be present and if they are not present they should not be paid and should not accept payment.  If I am to be stopped by the barracking of a certain group in this House just because I pose a question, there must be something to hide.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to the report of the inquiry which was carried out by Mr. Justice McWilliam.  First, I welcome the fact that this inquiry was carried out by the Bar Council but to say that I am disappointed with the outcome is to put it mildly.  I do not wish to imply that Mr. Justice McWilliam acted in any way improperly nor that the facts contained in his report are inaccurate.  It seems that following the carrying out of this investigation the Bar Council intend to take no action nor intend to amend the code of conduct adopted by them in July 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> To say the least, this is puzzling.  It may be common practice among lawyers for one of them to be missing during a trial, even for the second counsel to take the case, and it may even be done with the approval of the Bar Council but if it is common practice steps should be taken to eliminate it at least in very serious cases such as this.  Will the Minister tell the House if he proposes to take any action to bring this about in view of what I consider the unwise decision of the Bar Council not to do so on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The full text of the report published in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> was very helpful.  It is extremely disappointing that the full text of the trial proceedings was not available to this House.  I was disappointed to read this morning in one of the newspapers that the Department had not sought this transcript.  Could the Minister indicate whether that newspaper statement is accurate because if it is, steps should be taken to ensure that if we are to have this type of debate in future a full transcript should be available to those who are supposed to represent the different political party interests in this House.</P>

      <P>I want at the outset to <Col N="1179" /> indicate that I have a personal involvement with some of the issues raised in this matter by Deputy Barrett.  I was asked by the Attorney General, after my call to the Inner Bar, to retain my junior counsel's brief for the State in the Kennemerland case, a constitutional case in which Mr. Paul Carney was senior counsel, which was heard on 26 May, 1987 and on subsequent days.  I also want to put on record, for the guidance of Deputy Barrett, that Mr. Carney was, co-incidentially, in the course of the recent general election my election agent.  I have been made aware by Deputies on all sides of this House and by journalists that Deputy Barrett and others anticipated some embarrassment on my part during this debate.  In short, the Deputy and a Senator with a keen interest in my career have put about a rumour that Mr. Carney was prevented from attending the Cavan rape case by my absence during part of the Kennemerland case.  That suggestion is completely false.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy is that he informed Mr. Stephen McGrath of the Irish Independent Group of Newpapers yesterday who contacted me to tell me that.  If the Senator watching the debate wants to know about it, a <Col N="1180" /> Cheann Comhairle, he told Deputy Gregory and various other people in this House of these matters.  I know these facts and I know just how scurrilous and how low these rumours are.  The Deputy doubtless was unaware that on 26 May Mr. Carney and I discussed Mr. Carney's position and Mr. Carney, who has prepared lengthy submissions and had recently appeared in a case decided on similar issues in which judgment was reserved, informed me that it was his intention to make the only submission on behalf of the State and for that purpose to remain constantly with the Kennemerland case.  I am satisfied that that decision was made properly and conscientiously by him.</P>
      <P>On the following morning, 27 May, the final day of the Cavan rape case, Mr. Carney excused me for a short time from the Kennemerland case for the purpose of allowing me to attend a funeral, along with other members of my family, of a close family friend.  I arranged for another junior counsel to take my place in the Kennemerland case.</P>
      <P>I challenge anybody to repeat outside the House what has been said in the House but I repeat that there is no sense in which Mr. Carney was kept away from any portion of the Cavan rape case by reason of my attendance at that funeral. If there has been, I would not have attended the funeral and, if so, Mr. Carney would not have permitted me to attend the funeral.  Accordingly, there never was any question of my being embarrassed by these matters.  If Deputy Barrett had approached me to tell me these things, I would have been happy to put him right on these issues.  Instead, he chose to raise this matter in this House in the hope of making some political capital, or doing me some damage politically or professionally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the many journalists and Members of this House who discounted Deputy Barrett's attempt to smear me, who would have none of it and expressed revulsion at his behaviour.  My advice to Deputy Barrett is to devote the considerable energy which he misplaced in trying to embarrass me to attempting instead to master his brief as Justice spokesman for his party &mdash; and on today's performance he seems to have made very little progress in coming to grips with any of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>I do feel embarrassed by attending a debate in which so little real thought has gone into the basic issues involved.  Alone of all the Members of this House I have prosecuted rape cases to conviction and defended others accused of rape to acquittal and that was as a junior counsel. I have had considerable experience of the workings of the law in its substance and administration in rape cases and I have had, at first hand, an opportunity to see the weaknesses and the clear need for reform in this area of the law.</P>
      <P>First, there is a clear need to amend the definition of rape to include other violent acts of sexual defilement by penetration by objects and certain forms of mutilation which are not now included in the definition of rape, which is confined to penile penetration of the vagina.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there is a strong case for restating the criminal law in relation to sexual violence within marriage. Whether the concept of rape within marriage is the best means of doing so is something about which I have practical reservations.  I should like the Minister to bring forward a discussion paper on this matter which advances the matter beyond the report of the women's rights committee of this House of recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the entire field of how rape cases are conducted and where they are conducted.  One of the clear messages from the report of Mr. Justice McWilliam <Col N="1182" /> was that the Circuit Court is an overworked and under-equipped court to deal with rape cases.  In 1981 two Acts were passed, the Criminal Law (Rape) Act and the Courts Act.  Section 31 of the Courts Act of 1981 had the effect of removing from the Central Criminal Court, which is the criminal side of the High Court, any function in relation to rape, kidnapping, drug dealing and other serious offences.  These cases were transferred exclusively to the overloaded and overworked Circuit Criminal Court. While the purpose was to prevent the High Court from being needlessly weighed down by minor trials on indictment, it was a major error that serious crimes apart from murder, attempted murder and treason would be removed from the High Court where they stood a better chance of being heard with adequate facilities, adequate time and consistent sentencing policies.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, alone of the political parties in the last general election put that issue before the electorate as their policy.  I invite Deputies of this House to visit the Circuit Criminal Court in Dublin, where they will see a hard working Judiciary and Bar working to deal with a large volume of indictable crime in circumstances of squalor, overcrowding and unpleasantness which would do justice to a cattle market.  Any Deputy seeing that system in operation could not possibly say that the Circuit Court is a suitable venue for the trial of a rape case.  The ordeal of any rape case is horrific for the complainant.  Not only does she have to relive her ordeal, which she will never forget, but she has to do so in circumstances of stress and frequently while her credibility and her character are being tested and disparaged.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 went some way to protect the complainant from unfettered cross-examination as to her sexual history.  It did not go far enough.  It also went a considerable way to protect her anonymity and that of the accused unless he is acquitted.  There has been a suggestion that such cross-examination must never be permitted. While I agree that it is rarely justified it <Col N="1183" /> cannot be excluded on <i>a priori</i> grounds from relevance in every case.  There are cases in which it can be relevant and a Statute which prevented an accused from bringing relevant matters into issue would not be constitutional.</P>
    <P>There is, however, room for greater protection of the complainant's privacy and while indictable crime must be prosecuted at the suit of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the name of the people under the Constitution, the Constitution seems to preclude counsel for any witness or any alleged victim from taking part in the prosecution of a person accused.  I can see no reason for a separate legal representative not being permitted to protect the interests of an alleged rape victim where, in the absence of jury, permission is being sought to cross-examine her as to her previous sexual history under section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981.  This area should be the subject matter of immediate proposals of the Minister.  There are many other ways in which the ordeal of a rape victim can be mitigated in terms of investigative procedure, counselling, explanation and comfort without falling into the trap of coaching witnesses.  Here again, there is need for procedural reform.</P>
    <P>I want to add that a society which establishes and maintains by law funds to compensate persons who suffer personal injuries at the hands of motorists, insured and uninsured, but which abolishes the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal to compensate victims of brutal crime, including rape, is a sick society, with very strange priorities indeed.  That tribunal, which was a tangible expression of the State's constitutional obligation to vindicate the personal rights to life and bodily integrity of a citizen, should not have been abolished by the last administration and should be immediately restored by this one.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I wanted to say but I appreciate that time is running against me.  There should be provision to reform the law so as to enable the <Col N="1184" /> prosecution to appeal inadequate sentences. There should be provision to enable the prosecution to appeal every case where a decision of law is made against them, even if the accused is subsequently acquitted by a jury and not by direction.  I want to pay tribute to the voluntary bodies involved in the whole rape issue.  I want to pay tribute to Deputy Gemma Hussey whose Bill on criminal law rape brought about the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  People who call for rape cases to be heard in camera would do well to reflect on the events of the past fortnight to see whether any of things which they say are wrong in the system of prosecution would have come to light if rape cases were held behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>I am not naive.  I have seen what has happened in this House during the past week.  I heard Deputy Barrett apply for this debate.  I saw the circumstances in which he was encouraged to do so on the Order of Business when it was agreed by the Taoiseach to have these statements. I am not naive as to the circumstances which gave rise to changing the longstanding rule of this House today against the clear indication of a former Ceann Comhairle and against what I can only divine as the view of the Chair as to the wisdom of the situation.  I am not naive, but that an ambush was laid here today to try to embarrasss me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The purpose for which this debate was called and allowed by the House was to discuss matters of a very serious nature involving people's lives, their past lives, the conduct of their future lives and the serious situation which affects all too many women in this country.  It is a disgrace that the level of the debate so far on this matter has been debased and reduced to a status of personalities of this counsel or that counsel or whether it involved any Member of this House or not.  It has been a most unedifying spectacle and I am sure it will do nothing to enhance the viewpoint of this House in the eyes of the public who are watching this situation and whose interest has been aroused by the conduct of what happened at the Cavan rape case. We in this House would be advised to apply ourselves to the issues involved and what has transpired here.  Is there a lesson to be learned from this issue?  How are we to ensure there will be no repetition of this?  What improvements and amendments are necessary in the law governing rape?  What should be the conduct of the legal profession in general who are involved in this case?  Those are the issues which should be discussed, not the personalities involved or the petty politicking backwards and forwards between one party and another to seek to make political capital out of this most serious and personal issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cavan rape case which was reported recently has been the subject of a great deal of public disquiet and anxiety. The coverage given to the case in <Col N="1188" /> the media has highlighted a serious problem of management and organisation which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There is no point in any of us in this House seeking to make a scapegoat out of any particular individual involved. I would not wish to do that but in so far as serious deficiencies in the system have been exposed we must address these as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The crime of rape is one of the most serious and vile crimes.  For too long a blind eye has been turned to the urgent need to make reforms in the law in this area.  As a consequence, there is too much evidence already that victims of this crime do not come forward to seek redress and that there are perpetrators of this crime who have never been charged. The only way this can be changed is by giving victims of the crime absolute confidence that they will be properly and well treated and that their cases will be vigorously and efficiently prosecuted.</P>
    <P>One of the great tragedies of the publicity surrounding this case is that it will undermine that confidence and no doubt will lead to victims of rape failing to come forward to make the complaint and ensure that the appalling crime committed on them is prosecuted.  In some situations the victims of this crime will be faced with a choice.  Should they suffer on alone and in silence or take what has become a risk that they will now believe is substantial, that if they go forward they will be made to endure more trauma and humiliation?  What we are talking about here to a major extent is perception.  In so far as the present case is concerned it would not be proper for me or any other Member to attempt to pass judgment on a case where a jury took ten minutes to reach their decision.  It cannot be our purpose to attempt to question that decision but we must concern ourselves with the perceptions that have arisen from the case and we must not ignore the fact that this case which has achieved much publicity is one of several recent cases which have caused public disquiet and a loss of confidence in the system which is supposed to ensure that justice is delivered to the victims of rape.  We <Col N="1189" /> could just as easily be talking about two recent cases where suspended sentences were imposed on persons convicted of rape, even though they were cases which attracted little publicity.</P>
    <P>The victims of rape in criminal prosecutions ought to be entitled to have separate independent legal representation at the hearing and their counsel and solicitor should be fully entitled to participate in that trial, to make submissions to the jury, address the judge and cross-examine witnesses.  There is no reason that could not be committed by an amendment to the law.  I know it runs counter to the legal system we have had until now but it applies in other jurisdictions.  It would do something towards giving a degree of confidence and support to victims of rape who at present are only witnesses in these prosecutions.  There is an old saying that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.  I cannot comment on whether justice was done but certainly the public perception is that justice was not seen to be done. The public perception is that when counsel are retained by the State to appear in a prosecution, they should be there to prosecute that case.  It has been pointed out by Mr. Justice Roe and Mr. Justice McWilliam that a junior counsel with ability and experience can conduct a case. That is perfectly true but if the State decides that the seriousness of the crime committed requires the attendance of a senior counsel and the State is prepared to go to the expense of retaining a senior counsel, then surely the senior counsel should be there.  If his attendance was not required, if a junior counsel had the ability and skill, there would not be a need to retain the services of a senior counsel.  This concept of barristers being retained and being there for a very short period in the case is not a new complaint against members of the Bar.  It is ancient. It goes back for well over a century and one can recall the parody on the subject in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas where the judge was reciting his experience as a member of the Bar and says &ldquo;my learned profession I will never disgrace, by taking a fee with a grin on <Col N="1190" /> my face, when I have not been there to attend the case, said I to myself said I&rdquo;. We must recall that that was written by Mr. Gilbert who was a barrister.  This is not new.</P>
    <P>I accept Mr. Justice McWilliam's statement that in this case the guidelines laid down by the Bar Counsel were complied with but it is time that those guidelines were changed.  In the moral context those guidelines cannot any longer be accepted. It is not acceptable to members of the public, and that has been made clear, that a person is retained to do a job and is not there to fulfil his task.  I am disappointed with the reaction of the Bar Counsel to this.  The blasé stance they have taken when they say that no further action is necessary on this issue is totally unacceptable.  That is an incredible reaction to a case where so much concern has been expressed and where it is obvious that, as a result, trust in the law has been placed at risk.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the Bar Counsel in the case gives rise to the question as to how much longer the elite professions can be allowed to police themselves and the system they operate.  Inquiries in this matter should be independent and decisions on this issue ought to be independent and not from within the profession. The real tragedy would arise if we in this House were to decide like the Bar Counsel that no further action is necessary.  Action is necessary and possibly on a number of fronts if situations like this are to be prevented from recurring and if confidence is to be restored in the system.  Some substantial action is necessary.  A number of areas need to be examined.  First, the question of availability of counsel must be addressed.  I do not know if it would have made any difference to the outcome of this case if the experienced senior counsel retained had been present.  That can only be a matter of speculation.  I understand that a very experienced defence counsel appeared for the accused.  So far as I know, he found it possible to be present throughout the hearing.  The major work of a prosecuting counsel in the case would be the cross-examination of the accused <Col N="1191" /> and the final address to the jury.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to get a transcript of the case, but as I understand it, the accused was not cross-examined by the leader in the case nor was there an address to the jury by the leader at the conclusion of the case.  The presence of a senior counsel throughout the case might have made some difference, but that is not the point.  The point is that the perception in the eyes of the public is that something was amiss here by that absence.  Here was a case where one of the most experienced criminal lawyers in the country was retained by the defence, no doubt at great expense, and the feeling is that a particular counsel can sway a jury and can influence the outcome of the case.  That is why skilled lawyer services are so much in demand.  The public perception is that the outcome of the case may have been different had the case been prosecuted by the full presence of the full team of prosecuting counsel.</P>
    <P>The question of the Courts Act 1981 must be looked at.  Its effect was to remove from the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court all cases of serious crime other than treason or homicide. We should look again at the question of providing for the trial of rape cases in the Central Criminal Court.  That court is staffed by one or two judges of the High Court for an entire law term.  All cases of sexual abuse should be tried there. There would be a consistency of personnel which one does not get in a Circuit Court trial because there are different Circuit Court judges in counties up and down the country.  To have such cases tried in the Central Criminal Court would have the advantage that there would be consistency in the evolution of a pattern of sentencing.  One of the most serious allegations often made about the attitude of the courts to rape concerns the lack of a pattern in the way in which cases are treated.  There is enough evidence to show that this allegation is justified in many cases.</P>
    <P>If some good can come out of this case it may go some way to mitigate the trauma suffered by the victim in the case. <Col N="1192" /> Nothing can ever make up to her for what she has already suffered, but we cannot wash our hands and say the matter is out of our control.  If there are practical steps open to us as legislators which would enable us to ensure that victims of this horrible crime will at least have confidence that justice will be done, we must take those practical steps.  We believe that there are such steps, and we owe it to the victim in this case and to all other victims to take them.</P>
    <P>We must give serious consideration to leaving open the possibility of appeal by the prosecution in certain circumstances in criminal cases.  There should be an overall concept that, where a superior court held that the trial of first instance was unsatisfactory for one reason or another, it should be possible to order a retrial.  A frequent ground of appeal on the part of an accused is that the trial was unsatisfactory for one reason or another. I do not say that the door to that end should necessarily be thrown wide open, but in certain circumstances when certain considerations apply &mdash; I have not time to discuss the minutiae of that here &mdash; in this jurisdiction, as in other jurisdictions, an appeal at the suit of the prosecution should be open to the State.</P>

      <P>I should like to express satisfaction that the House has taken the decision to set aside for the time being the <i>sub judice</i> rule or practice that has existed within the House.  Deputy Mac Giolla raised with you, Sir, the fact which must be underlined again, that in our Standing Orders there is nothing that prohibits this House from discussing a matter that might be under consideration by the courts at any time.  That is not to say we should not be careful and exercise discretion in remarks we make so that we are not seen to be in any way usurping the functions of another arm of Government. Nonetheless, in the past the rule has been applied too often as a means of stifling debate rather than involving the work of this House in considering matters of importance such as the recent Cavan case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> It is regrettable that, having taken a very good decision to embark on a discussion of the implications of that case, we have been entertained to the spectacle we saw here this morning.</P>
    <P>Very serious issues have arisen from the case and, in expressing regret, let me say that it is equally regrettable that the Minister in his opening remarks does not appear to have taken the opportunity to inform the House on what he or his Government might consider doing in the whole area of law surrounding the conduct of rape cases and the law relating to the proofs required in those cases.</P>
    <P>None of us in this House was, as far as I am aware, present for the proceedings of the trial.  No copies of the transcript have been made available, so we have had to rely on newspaper reports for our information.  I do not know how comprehensive these reports are or, for instance, if the reporters present were there throughout all of the trial.  Any comments we make must be made subject to this qualification.  However, we know from the newspaper reports and from matters that have emerged since the trial that serious and important questions have been raised by the conduct of the case and it is good that this Dáil has been given the opportunity to consider them.</P>
    <P>The primary matter of concern at the end of the Cavan rape case debacle is that a most heinous, vicious rapist of an innocent woman has gone undetected and unpunished.  There is no legal basis for an appeal in a case like this and, despite the understandably strong feelings it has aroused, it would be creating a very dangerous precedent to suggest that the jury verdict of not guilty should be subject to appeal.  There is now, in effect, no prospect of the culprit being brought to justice and made answerable for one of the most vicious, brutal and degrading incidents of assault and rape ever to come before our courts.  Nobody can feel happy about this and nobody &mdash; the legal profession, the Garda, or we as legislators &mdash; can escape a share of the blame for this unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>While most of the public and media attention has focused on the performance <Col N="1194" /> of the legal profession, there is a need to look at the manner in which the case was investigated and presented by the Garda. I understand that as far as the Garda are concerned the case is now closed. Presumably they thought that they had apprehended the right man, but the case they produced failed to satisfy the jury that this was so.  The Garda rested the main part of their case on an alleged voluntary admission that was taken from the accused in such circumstances that it is fair to assume that the trial judge and jury had no regard to it.  I believe there is an obligation on the Garda authorities to investigate the manner in which this case was presented to the court in order to avoid a repeat of the mistakes undoubtedly made.  I hope the Minister will indicate in his reply whether he has in any way requisitioned an inquiry of the Garda authorities.  Undoubtedly, mistakes were made which were open and criticised in the course of the trial and &mdash; it is not unreasonable to infer &mdash; led to the jury within a very short time clearly indicating that the manner in which the statement was taken from the accused was not acceptable to them as a jury and that they placed no reliance whatever on what was presented to them by the prosecution as a voluntarily made statement of admission.</P>
    <P>Respect for an accused persons's right to legal advice and his right to make a voluntary statement in conditions of ease are crucial to a fair and proper investigation of crimes and these principles must be reasserted and re-established so that they are observed in all cases, especially in serious and emotional cases. In many cases the failure of the gardaí to observe these requirements undermines their own case.  The legal training gardaí receive at the moment is at best perfunctory. The recent report of the Garda Training Committee calls for a more comprehensive training scheme for Garda recruits, particularly in the area of legal studies, and I hope this report will be acted upon as soon as possible.  It is understood that the Minister and his Department are at present considering the implications of the report and we <Col N="1195" /> have been promised an early response to it.  I hope the Minister will now appreciate even more the importance of this response and implement the recommendations of that report at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>This case has led to a number of calls from Members of this House for the establishment of a Dáil committee who would have some sort of right of review of the workings of the office of the DPP. These calls are often based on little real knowledge or insight into the operations of the DPP's office and in some cases are a smokescreen for those who would like to re-establish political control over the office of the DPP and decisions as to when prosecutions should be initiated or terminated.  While the office of the DPP, like any other body or institution, are liable from time to time to make mistakes, generally they have performed their duties well and conscientiously.</P>
    <P>Politicians have a duty to legislate and there is a great deal of work to be done in the area of court procedures and criminal law reform, enough to keep us active and involved for many years to come without making efforts to restrict the independence of the DPP.  The principle that the director should be independent and free from political control was established when responsibility for initiating prosecutions was transferred away from the Attorney General who is, in effect, a member of the Government.  There should be no going back to the old system which was open to so much political abuse.  However, this does not mean that the office of the DPP prosecuting on behalf of the people should not be more fothcoming in explaining the basis upon which decisions are reached, especially in cases of public controversy.  One positive effect of this appalling rape case is that it is likely to lead to new pressure for reform of the law relating to rape and its investigation and trial procedures in rape cases.</P>
    <P>The Rape Crisis Centre have campaigned for a number of years for reform of these areas but they have been fobbed off by successive Governments.  Their <Col N="1196" /> main demands, which we support, include proper aid to and counselling of rape victims, including independent legal assistance at trial stage, full consultation by victims with the Director of Public Prosecutions office or counsel before the trial begins, greater restriction on questions relating to the previous sexual history of the victim and the extension of the definition of rape to include rape within marriage and rape by physical object.  In addition we must give particular consideration to the whole question of the treatment of sexual offenders once placed in our prisons.  It is very unsatisfactory that they are merely sentenced and locked away without any effort being made at their rehabilitation for their inevitable return to society.  We must have particular regard to the question of the abolition of compensation for victims of rape by reason of the effective closure by the previous Government of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the issues that we, as legislators, should now be addressing. A further concern with the Cavan case must centre on the standard of practice and consideration shown to trial and criminal practice generally by the legal profession.  It is no surprise that the code of conduct of the Bar Council allows barristers to slip in and out of cases to facilitate their multiple case practice and, by definition, greater fee-earning opportunities. One important question raised by the case which the Director of Public Prosecutions should answer in his inquiry is: if a junior counsel of 17 years standing was retained and was considered capable of carrying the prosecution for two whole days why was there need for a senior counsel at all?  The fact that the Bar Council retains a code of conduct that allows for less than the best standard in the prosecution of cases on behalf of the people of Ireland is not acceptable and should not be allowed go unchanged.</P>
    <P>The report produced by Judge McWilliam cannot be considered to have adequately answered the questions raised by this case and will do nothing to restore public confidence in the legal system.  The <Col N="1197" /> legal profession, as a whole &mdash; and I do not absolve solicitors from their share of the blame &mdash; have been party to the diminution of standards in criminal law matters over the years.  Such problems have been thrown into sharp relief by the recent Cavan case.  There is an obligation on all involved in the conduct of criminal cases to look again at their standards of codes and practice to ascertain in what way they need to be improved and made more relevant.  This includes the Director of Public Prosecutions, as it appears by implication from the Bar Council's code of practice and the report of Judge McWilliam that the absence of counsel during the trial did have the Director's consent.</P>
    <P>One final matter which should receive urgent attention is that of the level at which this case was heard.  Proceedings in this case were taken and heard in the Circuit Criminal Court.  This was directly as a result of the provisions of the Courts Act, 1981, by reason of which almost all cases other than murder and treason are now heard at the level of Circuit Court. For example, in England it would almost certainly have been heard at the level of the Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey.  There is a need to restore to the Central Criminal Court &mdash; which has the equivalent jurisdiction of the High Court here &mdash; its jurisdiction to deal with serious offences such as rape.  This would help to ensure the status of the case in its presentation before the courts and would ensure that the prosecution and defence in these matters is conducted according to the highest possible standards.</P>
    <P>None of the parties involved in the handling of this case &mdash; the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the lawyers concerned &mdash; can be happy with its conclusion.  As legislators we cannot afford to be self-righteous or complacent. It is not sufficient for us to wallow in the misery, unhappiness or mistakes of others.  We have a great deal of responsibility in this case and a lot of work to do in the area of reform of the law of rape. We must ensure that the circumstances of the Cavan rape case are not repeated.</P>

      <P>It is very definitely as a non-member of the legal profession I wish to make my contribution, rather as a representative of the public, as a member of the public.  I speak mainly because of public disquiet of long standing. Reported activities of some members of the legal profession have occasioned this discussion today.  There have been worries expressed about some conduct. Members' contributions this morning have done absolutely nothing to dissuade me of the opinion that there are questions to be answered.  I want to emphasise my non-legal status because it appears to the public that when there are complaints about or attacks on the legal profession there is an immediate closing of ranks and that that closing of ranks appears to cut across the political persuasion of those involved.  There are very serious questions to be posed and answered. Deputy Taylor struck the right note when he said that it is the future with which we must deal.  We must ascertain precisely where we are going, raising questions of a nature that will ensure the position is improved in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can confine our remarks to what has been described on the Order Paper as the Cavan rape case. The one regret I have is that it took the horrific happenings, if you like, torture, of the victim in this case to present us with an opportunity to speak in this House and address ourselves to this type of problem. Already there were allegations this morning that people tried to back out and all the rest.  I do not know what is behind such arguments.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on these issues.  Bearing in mind the guidance of the Ceann Comhairle, I will not be specific on the Cavan case.  However, I should like to pose a few questions about it.  Indeed I should like to broaden the discussion somewhat. I concur with the remarks of the two previous speakers that there is need for immediate change of the laws appertaining to rape trials.  These laws must be changed immediately in the public interest.  Yet, it would be totally useless to change the rules if they can be flouted, <Col N="1199" /> breached and bent to suit the administration generally.</P>
    <P>That takes me back to the question of public accountability on the part of the legal profession.  There appears to be absolutely none.  I say that as a member of the general public.  I believe there is a public conception of a total lack of public responsibility on the part of the legal profession.  It appears that one section of society see themselves as above question. Of course trial by one's peers, self-questioning within any organisation, is a very good method of operation if one can get away with it, if one is not responsible to the public, if one does not have to answer. I suppose the greatest facility of the legal profession is learning to put up a defence, to keep talking until the point has been lost or until one has conditioned people's minds to accept one's viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I should like to broaden the discussion somewhat.  There are a number of matters about which I have been worried and I may avail of this opportunity to voice them.  These worries are about the legal profession, the Judiciary, the courts system generally.  The first aspect that worries me is the air of mystique and self-importance that seems to prevail. Indeed, I know there are members of my party who would question my right to make a contribution today, whose attitude would be, how dare I come in to speak on an issue relating to legal matters.</P>
    <P>That type of attitude has led to a situation in which people have been able to get away with wrong-doings, with what is seen by the public as malpractice.  They have been able to operate with a very close, friendly relationship between themselves and we must question that. The rest of the people should be entitled to make a contribution and to question what they do without fear of libel action, slander and all the other hedges that are put up.  I heard this morning how this can be played about with.  I do not know the rights and wrongs of the allegations made by the first and second speakers.  They spoke for half an hour and in the end I did not know who was right or who was <Col N="1200" /> wrong.  If this debate was argued outside this House it would cost at least £1,000 a day.</P>
    <P>It is time that we questioned some of the practices involved and some of them have been questioned today.  Why should you have a senior counsel on a case if a junior one will suffice?  This applies right down the line.  One of the interesting things in relation to any court case is the number of people involved.  The legal teams are now competing with the various sporting teams because there will soon be as long a list of legal people involved in a case as would be involved in a sporting team.  These practices should be questioned and we have the opportunity today to raise some of those questions.</P>
    <P>There has been a total lack of consistency in the judicial system and this has been referred to today.  This situation arises because some people seem to be above question.  In one part of the country a case can be tried, a rape case or any other case, and for that offence somebody may get a smack on the wrist whereas in another part of the country a person can be sent to jail for an indefinite period of time for committing the same offence.  That is totally wrong.  There seems to be no acceptable standard within the legal profession in this regard. We are always told that it is left to the discretion of the trying justice.  All justices are of a certain calibre.  In the past there were extreme cases when people let themselves down so badly that action had to be taken and even the legal profession could not walk away from that fact.</P>
    <P>There is now a new game of spot the technicality.  There was a recent case concerning shipping where the legal costs came close to £1 million.  It appears that even the interpretation of a single word can now be used to gain a couple of thousand pounds in defending a case and also to turn justice on its head.  I ask members of the legal profession in particular to address themselves to some of the points which I raise today.  I am the layman, the member of the public, the person who is affected.  I dare not take <Col N="1201" /> on the legal profession publicly because I have very limited financial funds.  The procedure for conducting business has been brought into question by this case. In some cases the lengthy team of people, the public servants and others involved, can be called back six, seven or eight times to deal with the same case.  I assume each time a case is referred back there is finance involved and the people are paid. Perhaps they do the work for free until the case is referred back but I suspect they are paid and very often at public expense.  This is happening and there is absolutely no excuse for it.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question as to who is running this country for the people.  Is it the Judiciary or is it the Executive?  I raise that question because I have compiled a list of about 16 cases ranging over the past seven or eight years in which decisions of the Judiciary at various levels have cost a minimum of £650 million and in many other cases there is unlimited potential for public costs.  I go back again to the question of responsibility to the public.  If legislation is passed in this House funds should be made available to put into practice what is in that legislation and it should be passed with that in mind.</P>
    <P>Judicial decisions are made and it appears that some of the people involved pride themselves on taking on the Executive. They want to be seen to be super-liberal or any other description which is put on them.  They appear, for whatever frivolous reason, to find against the Government or the Executive.  Before anybody starts reaching for his pen I want to say that I subscribe to the concept of an independent Judiciary but it must be responsible and consistent and it must relate to happenings in this State.  The public conception is that the judicial system has gone off the rails and I cannot fault them for that.  More weight seems to be given to legal technicalities, often of the very flimsiest nature.  Not alone is there immediate funding for frivolous cases but it will be of benefit because the reporting of it will show how well the person fared, but eventually the State and the public suffer.</P>
    <P>I question the sincerity &mdash; I am careful <Col N="1202" /> in saying this &mdash; of many of the statements made in relation to suggested changes.  If the workload of the members is to be cut down, there appears to be a reluctance on the part of the legal profession to agree with them.  It would be quite acceptable if there were expanded facilities, more hours and more cases to be dealt with.  It seems to come back to finance, unfortunately. I ask people to try to forget this when legislating.  Members of the legal profession who are Members of either House of the Oireachtas should have the interest of the public in mind at all times. If they do not, the public will refuse to accept them.  Essential ingredients in our legal system are credibility and public confidence.  They have been disappearing so rapidly, particularly in the past seven or eight years, that it is frightening.</P>
    <P>We saw in America ten or 15 years ago what we thought was a shocking situation in which members of the public would watch a person, young or old, being mugged, robbed or beaten and would just walk past.  We said that could never happen in Ireland.  Recently in Cork a professional person saw an elderly woman being harassed and attacked by young thugs.  He put his children in his car nearby, went back and sorted out the problem by knocking out one of these people.  For his good deed he ended up in court and was fined £50.  If that kind of attitude prevails we will have the same situation here as they have in America. We are heading in that direction and who can blame the public?  They will walk past and say: &ldquo;Why bother?  Why get involved?  I will be brought before somebody and depending on whether he is having a bad day or a good day I may suffer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask members of the legal profession present today not to blind us with technicalities but to simplify matters and to listen to what I, as a member of the public, am saying.  It is easy to say there is a growing lack of confidence in politicians but there is certainly a lack of confidence in the legal profession and in the courts system and if that continues we will all be in a very sad state.  They should change their attitudes and try to serve the public. <Col N="1203" /> There is general support in this area but it is being eroded very rapidly.</P>

      <P>When the call for this debate arose originally I was extremely apprehensive about the appropriateness and the propriety of such a call to this House to, in effect, review a decision of the courts.  That is how the call came across, and that is how it was made initially, inspired by dissatisfaction that a horrific crime had gone unpunished.</P>
      <P>My sense of worry about that has been somewhat allayed by the universal acceptance among those who have spoken of the decision by the jury as being final, not being subject to criticism and, above all, not being subject to review.  If we are to have a healthy democracy we must be prepared to live under the rule of law.  The rule of law implies that our courts, in all their aspects and in all their operations, are independent, that they will act the same for all citizens and that the same régime will be applied for all citizens.  That is the kernel of our democracy.</P>
      <P>As I said, I was apprehensive that this procedure was going to turn into a witch hunt against the courts.  Undoubtedly it is to some extent turning into a witch hunt against the judicial and legal system. This is an unsatisfactory forum for doing that because the time available for contributions is too short and the issues have not been isolated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the case that provoked this series of statements, it has to be said that in common with all other cases before a jury, only the members of the jury, together with the presiding judge, can make a totally objective assessment of the evidence that comes before them. While the legal teams, whether for the prosecution or the defence, should be <Col N="1204" /> objective, it would be contrary to nature for them to be totally objective, but only a jury who hear the evidence <i>viva voce,</i> who listen to the cross-examination and who can watch the witnesses, are in a position to make a decision.</P>
    <P>In this case the jury, having sat through several days of trial proceedings, came to their decision in an extremely short period of time, which tends to suggest that the case against the accused person was significantly lacking in weight.  One has to assume there was clearly, on the documents available to the prosecuting authorities, a <i>prima facie</i> case; otherwise it would have been a horrific injustice to have laid the indictment at all.  Nevertheless, the weight of evidence was seriously lacking.</P>
    <P>Immediately a horrific case goes unpunished and the accused is established as an innocent person, understandably, because of the sense of public unease, there is a hunt for a scapegoat. We have had a number of scapegoats proposed to this House for consideration today.  I think that is wrong because this is not the forum in which to engage in that sort of exercise.  Some Deputies were calling for the transcript.  I read in the paper, and the Deputy may have been wrongly reported, that the objective in getting the transcript was to read the judge's charges to the jury.  Obviously he was going to be fingered as a scapegoat.</P>
    <P>The police have been fingered as scapegoats because they have not succeeded in securing a conviction in this case.  That is not to say they should have, because that implies that the person who was acquitted is the guilty party and there is no evidence to suggest that.  In a perfect world the police would always be able to adduce perfect evidence obtained in the most perfect circumstances to secure a conviction. But we do not live in that sort of world.  The main thrust of the scapegoat seeking process has been to put the finger of guilt on one of the team prosecuting for the State.  Again, because of the very serious considerations which were put to this House, mainly by Deputy Tom <Col N="1205" /> Fitzpatrick before we commenced proceedings, I do not intend to comment on that issue.</P>
    <P>Arising out of what Deputy Dennehy said &mdash; he raised a lot of matters for the legal profession &mdash; I will make one point with regard to the role of counsel and the role of legal teams.  There are differing capacities within the legal profession and within the profession of barristers.  Some are particularly skilled in the technical work of drafting and analysing pleadings; others may have a particular bent or skill in cross examinations; and others may have a talent for addressing juries in an impressive way.  When a team is being put together the idea is to have on the team representatives of all these skills, not all of which are required all the time during the conduct of a trial or the hearing of a particular case.  That is one important aspect of our system of legal representation which tends to be overlooked. One has to bear that in mind before one looks for scapegoats or makes judgments in this House, judgments that inevitably cannot be full judgments because they cannot be based on what took place during that trial.</P>
    <P>The only people who can make total judgments are the jury and the presiding judge who are there for the entire trial and who hear the entire evidence <i>viva voce.</i> No newspaper report and no transcript of the evidence can substitute for that experience.  Any attempt by this House or by anybody in it to lay blame in the absence of that experience must be faulty and to compare a 15 minute debate in this House with the Supreme Court is totally inaccurate.  So far as reviewing the trial court by this House is concerned this is obviously fallacious.</P>
    <P>As regards public confidence in the judical system, if this is to be constantly criticised in the terms Deputy Dennehy used &mdash; he spoke about frivolous reasons for finding against the Government &mdash; that is a most serious statement to make with regard to judicial decisions.  Statements of that type repeated here or in the press inevitably will undermine confidence in the judicial system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> We have lost our regard for the important constitutional principle of the division of powers.  I mentioned the rule of law earlier, but an equally important safeguard for democracy is the existence of that principle and the honouring of that principle both in the letter and in the spirit.  It is incumbent on this House, as one of the powers in the Constitution, not to trespass in the area of any of the others.  The Minister for Justice said he thought the Dáil should have the opportunity to express its views on matters that can be, and which are being, widely discussed in the media and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Superficially that is an understandable approach.  If a controversy is being aired, people are puzzled as to why it is not being discussed here, but if the matter being aired is tantamount to a review of the courts, that is a very good reason why it should not be aired in this Chamber. Matters of public concern should be dealt with here, provided they are within the constitutional competence of this House but I suggest that for the House to engage in the exercise it has engaged in this morning is not within its constitutional competence.  Certainly, it is not within the spirit of its constitutional competence. It may be within the letter of it but we have a greater obligation than that.  We have an obligation to preserve the spirit of the Constitution as well and for the House to attempt to review a judicial process is, in my opinion, transgressing that constitutional requirement.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the point raised by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick at the outset of the proceedings this morning.  He pointed out that for the first time in 65 years the House has decided to set aside the <i>sub judice</i> requirement and he said this was a matter of fundamental importance for the rights of all citizens.  We may say that this only relates to one case and that it will never happen again but all of us know that, human nature being what it is, once the first breach in a fundamental principle is made, once the small initial opening is made, it becomes easier and easier to justify subsequent infringements of that rule.  I should like to echo his warning to the House and express the <Col N="1207" /> hope that this will be the first and the very last time that that fundamental rule will be breached.  That rule has within it the spirit of protecting the rights of individuals, the rights of citizens.  After all, the prime concern of any Parliament must be to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected and vindicated.  We must not allow ourselves, no matter how emotional the issue or how much public concern there may be about it, to be deflected from essential issues of principle. I have to say that today's proceedings were unfortunate.</P>

      <P>It is important and significant that we have this debate.  We need to address the need for changes in the Act dealing with the offence of rape.  The sooner we as a Government can bring forward an amendment to the 1981 Act the sooner the type of problems which arose in the case under discussion, and which arise constantly in rape trials, can be addressed. I do not intend to take my 15 minutes because many other Members want to contribute to the debate but I should like to make a number of points.  We need guidelines laid down in regard to sentencing here particularly in regard to sensitive cases.  I am not saying that those guidelines should be statutory but the legal profession would be well served in addressing this matter &mdash; as they have done across the water &mdash; as soon as possible. That might help to alleviate difficulties that arise at present such as those referred to by Deputy Dennehy and others.  They should try to restore confidence by the public in the Judiciary and the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask the legal profession to have a close look at the code of conduct under which they operate so that we do not have a repeat of what arose in the unfortunate case under discussion.  It is not a matter for the State to lay down statutory conditions but it is important that the code of conduct is looked at immediately in the light of the allegations made in this case.  I am aware that the <Col N="1208" /> Joint Committee on Women's Rights, which I chaired, spent a considerable time dealing with the whole area of sexual violence.  We were supported by all political parties and we produced a comprehensive report which is the basic framework for legislation in that area.  I am aware that the matter has been referred to the Commission on Law Reform and that the Minister for Justice is giving it the highest priority.  I should like to appeal to the members of the commission to bring forward a report dealing with this matter as quickly as possible.  If that is done I am hopeful that the Government will be able to bring forward in the next Dáil session an amendment to the 1981 Act that will grapple with the difficulties that have arisen since it was passed.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the other areas referred to by Deputies such as the definition of rape because they were well documented in the report of the joint committee.  The recommendations of the Commission on Law Reform and of the joint committee will help the Government to produce legislation dealing with this matter in the autumn.  I appeal to the Minister for Justice to spare no effort in his Department to ensure that his civil servants treat this as a matter of urgency.</P>

I will review the matter when Deputy Barnes has concluded.</P>

      <P>I will not take my full time in order to allow other Members to <Col N="1209" /> contribute.  I wish other Members had adopted that attitude and thus prevented a last minute rush.  I am delighted to have an opportunity to make a short statement on this issue.  I regret that it has taken a violent and serious crime against a woman to get us two hours in the House to debate the question of rape.  In the course of his statement the Minister said he did not have time to go into the dreadful offences that are perpetrated against women in society but we could bring in legislation that is needed to change attitudes towards women, and thus prevent such offences against them.  This is the most extreme and violent reflection of how women can be treated in society but there are other areas where women are treated in a less violent but in as exploitative a form in society.  Legislation should cover all those areas.  It is unfortunate that it usually takes a crisis, a directive from the EC or a judgment by the European Court of Human Rights before we address any of those areas.</P>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy Cooney suggested we should not make the legal profession a scapegoat and I am sure some Members will say we should not do that to legislators but where does the responsibility lie?  Where does the buck stop?  There are two issues involved.  The first is the failure to reform legislation dealing with rape that leaves women in an unsupported position inside and outside our courts.  The second is our inability to move quickly as legislators to introduce reforms in the law and in the legal profession. I am not going to make anyone a scapegoat this morning because I am part of that process but it should not take a crisis, it should not take human scapegoats and sacrifices for us to bring in civilised and socially just legislation. Nobody is attempting to review a judicial proceeding.  We are trying to deal with the implications of one such proceeding and to do something constructive about it instead of castigating one another or trying to score cheap political points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there is such a shortage of time I want to put two practical suggestions to the House.  The first is to express my disappointment at the fact that the <Col N="1210" /> Bar Council having recorded that there has not been a breach of their rules and procedures did not even hint that such procedures should be looked at.  I do not hold Mr. Justice McWilliam responsible although as the man carrying out the task I had hoped he would have gone further. The matters which Deputy McDowell raised this morning were not referred to either, the squalor and the unbelievably difficult situation in which the law is carried out.  If the legal profession really care about the law and the fact that nobody, including themselves, is above it and if, above all, they care about the administration of the law in regard to the victims who come before them, reform should start with them.  They should be battering down the doors of this House to ensure that legislators bring about the kind of reforms, decency and civilised space people should have and a public perception that the law is not being just administered but administered fairly and justly.  It does not matter how elitist the profession is or how protective it is of <i>sub judice</i> or anything else, there must be public perception that the law is just, that Deputies legislate to the best of their ability and, above all, that legal practitioners carry out the law properly.  We need not talk about upholding archaic precedents and principles and allowing matters to be discussed on the Order of Business and so on if people are afraid to go to court or, if they do, that they consider they have not had a fair deal.  It is up to all of us to take that seriously and this is really what we are debating.  Let us hope it is only the beginning of a much longer process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy called for an immediate change in regard to the laws on rape. For generations, women have been calling for changes.  That is particularly so in this country and I have been part of that movement since 1973.  We have been lobbying, working and giving sanctuary to those who were raped.  We have been attempting, from the experience of the way women are treated in rape cases, to tell the legislators exactly what needs to be done.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights produced an <Col N="1211" /> all party, agreed list of recommendations which would go a long way towards improving the position in regard to rape. Where did that report go?  It went to the Law Reform Commission.  Where is it now?  When will it see the light of day? This should be the beginning of a definite date by which we intend to address that legislation.  An all party committee have spent a lot of time in getting submissions from the people who are most concerned, the Garda, the legal profession and those in the Rape Crisis Centre who give support and counselling to victims of rape. We have the agreement of all parties in this House.  There is no point in setting up a joint Oireachtas committee and getting recommendations if we then send them off to another agency.  The legal profession should ensure that everybody who has to go through the process of law will believe that nobody is above or outside it, that it is accessible to everyone and that it is administered fairly.</P>

      <P>Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak and I will bear in mind the fact that other Deputies are anxious to contribute to this very important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am privileged to have an opportunity to speak in the debate and if it had not been for the course it took an hour and half ago I would have had a fuller opportunity, as spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, to speak more fully and comprehensively than I will now on the issues involved.  As Justice spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, I have, in relation to the Cavan rape case, as I did in relation to several other cases over the past 18 months, expressed my outrage and annoyance at particular <Col N="1212" /> court decisions.  I was never stopped from doing that by virtue of the fact that anybody might have been in any way connected with me.  The remarks made earlier this morning by Deputy Seán Barrett to the effect that I kept my mouth shut for a week are inaccurate.</P>
    <P>On the afternoon on which this case was reported I was contacted by Ken Whelan of <i>The Irish Press.</i> I spoke to him as I did to every single journalist who contacted me during the past ten days.  I have made two full statements on this matter.  I have said that I was outraged at the decision; I have said that there is need for changes in legislation in relation to rape; I have said that there is a need for changes in the regulations governing the practices of senior and junior counsel in cases; I have said that there is a need for the House and the Minister to investigate once and for all our legal, prosecution, trial and investigative procedures to see why in so many serious cases &mdash; sometimes involving death in mysterious circumstances &mdash; nobody is convicted.  I have spoken out on all these cases unlike other spokespersons in the House.  I have sought, by way of parliamentary question, to raise these matters.  Indeed three weeks ago when the Minister for Justice was answering questions in this House I sought, by way of supplementary question, to ask him about the Molloy case. However, it was ruled out of order by the Chair and the Minister resorted, as previous Ministers have done, to telling me that he was not free to talk about individual cases.</P>
    <P>This debate is very important for many reasons, especially to women who look to the House and the few women in it to try to ensure that the outdated laws in relation to rape legislation are changed as a matter of urgency.  I was very pleased when the joint committee on women's rights, of which I was not a member, made unanimous suggestions last year in relation to rape legislation.  I am disappointed that those recommendations were sent to the Law Reform Commission by the last Government.  I have said in this House and outside it that I do not believe there was any need for the <Col N="1213" /> Law Reform Commission to examine them.  Members of this House and Governments in particular use the Law Reform Commission to delay enacting legislation.  If we as legislators are to take our job seriously we should begin the process of legislating and effecting change.  We should not have to wait, as has happened so many times in the past, for the courts to force us to make certain changes.</P>
    <P>I am sure many members of the legal profession and the Judiciary will rightly say that we are the kettle calling the pot black when we refer to the archaic procedures of the law.  In many instances, there is nothing more archaic than the procedures in this House and it is about time we put our own house in order before we pontificate and lecture to others.  There is a need for a barrister's Act because it is no longer good enough that an essentially private body should be able to decide on the code of procedure and practice followed, particularly in serious criminal cases.  There is also a need for that Act to give jurisdiction to a fitness to practise clause to see whether certain people are fit to practise as is the case in relation to other professions. There should be proper safeguards for litigants.  It is not good enough to leave that as a matter for a private body.  In relation to rape, which brought about this discussion, I, like many Members of the House, feel that the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, should be repealed.  I was privileged to be a member of the other House of the Oireachtas when that Bill was going through and I said then, as I say now, that it was not adequate.  It was very shortsighted of us to introduce such limited legislation in relation to the whole area of rape.</P>
    <P>It was very shortsighted of us to have introduced such limited legislation in relation to rape, which is a most awful, horrific crime against any woman.  Those who have been subjected to this awful crime will agree with me that not even time will rid their minds of the awful ordeal they have gone through.  I know many victims would prefer to hide their <Col N="1214" /> anguish and their trauma and obsession and live in fear, perhaps, of being raped again, rather than go through the ordeal they must go through at the moment, which is almost like a second rape in public &mdash; to have to go to the Garda to report the matter and then go before a court.  I agree with them: it is a most humiliating and degrading exercise for any woman to have to go through the ordeal that some women must go through in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not accept, as lawyers are sometimes apt to say, that in order to defend a person accused of rape a lawyer has to engage in the kind of questioning, including insulting remarks, that many of them see fit to engage in.  I agree with the premise that a person is innocent until proven guilty &mdash; it is good that that is the case and that it will continue to be the case &mdash; but I should like to quote from an article by Lorna Donlon in this week's <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> She was reporting on a rape case in July 1986.  She quoted the remarks of an eminent senior counsel who had said that his client, who had been found guilty of raping a 30 year old woman, had &ldquo;given way to a human sexual urge&rdquo; and that if he were a practising Catholic &ldquo;it would mean 23 minutes in confession to wipe the slate clean&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They are the kind of insulting remarks that do not do justice to the legal profession in Ireland.  It is simply treating women as chattels and does not respect or understand the kind of humiliating ordeals many women have to go through. I want to see the law changed here to ensure, first, that women are given their own representation in these cases.  At the moment the prosecution is there to present cases against accused persons: it is not there to defend the victims.  It is a pity that rape victims do not have a right laid down in law to have their own representation to put forward their points of view and to ensure that victims will not have to go through the kind of ordeals they are expected to go through now.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the definition of rape should be amended to include other forms of sexual assault.  It is a degrading and awful experience for a woman to <Col N="1215" /> have to endure some of the procedures followed in relation to describing what is called &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo;.  I submit that the law here falsely assumes that one form of sexual assault is more serious than another.  I suggest there is a need to amend the law to cover the possibility of rape within marriage, though it may be difficult to prove.  I suggest that anybody, by virtue of marital status, should not be prevented from being charged with the crime of rape.  I suggest that a jury in a rape trial should be 50 per cent female and 50 per cent male.  I say that because people of one gender might have a bias in favour of a member of their own gender.</P>
    <P>In the whole conduct of rape trials, references to a women's past sexual history should not be allowed.  It is a matter, I appreciate, for the presiding judge to decide whether that is relevant or not. Those operating in the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre tell me that as few as 30 per cent of those who go to them for attention go any further and report the cases to the Garda.  That is a shame but I can well understand why it is so.</P>
    <P>In relation to sentencing policy we need to lay down mandatory sentences for those found guilty of the crime of rape.  At the moment it is not good enough that this should be left to the whims of individual judges.  Many of these recommendations were made by the Women's Rights Committee, and the Government and the Minister for Justice as a matter of urgency should bring legislation before the House implementing those recommendations to give real effect to solutions of problems worrying many people throughout the country.  If we are to learn from the publicity given to this and other areas, if we legislators are to do our job properly, and if the Minister is to do his, he will have to inquire why so many cases lead to decisions that allow members of the public rightly to believe that the law in this respect is simply a lottery, depending on the judge in court and the lawyers who represent victims.  That is not good enough in a democratic society and it <Col N="1216" /> is up to us to change it as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great public concern about the conduct of this trial, with particular reference to the attendance of senior and junior counsel throughout the trial.  Therefore, I welcome strongly the announcement by the Minister that there is now a process of statutory consultation between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General in relation to that matter.  Only then will we know the truth, even from those who, perhaps, protest too much.  The second point I want to make is that the report should be made public either by way of Parliamentary Question or statement by the Minister on the result of the statutory consultations in regard to what precisely happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that such trials must be transferred as a matter of urgent public importance to the Central Criminal Court under the jurisdiction, I hope, of a competent High Court judge.  I have seen rape trials in the Circuit Court and at High Court level.  I know it is the wish of the fomer Attorney General &mdash; the Minister today can speak for the present Attorney General &mdash; that there should <Col N="1217" /> be consistency in sentencing and in procedures in relation to the conduct of such trials.  If trials of this sort were held in the Central Criminal Court this would be enhanced.  Perhaps then senior and junior counsel would be more disposed to attend such trials because the High Court judge presiding would take great care of the procedure.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point in regard to the presentation of forensic evidence.  As former Minister for Health I am aware that in many such cases the extent to which forensic evidence is available and assembled is very often marginal.  I can just imagine the facilities in Cavan County Hospital and in the Cavan Garda station.  I can imagine the expertise of general practitioners and gynaecologists in assembling the evidence.  In this case, to be polite about it, the facilities were sparse.  Such a framework for the treatment of victims and the general facilities for them when they present themselves to the forensic authorities and the Garda law enforcement agencies must be improved drastically.</P>
    <P>I make an earnest plea to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health that these facilities are in dire need of improvement.  If they are not improved we will never succeed in our efforts to discover the truth in regard to such cases, particularly when the victim is subjected to harsh cross examination, as we saw in this case.  I rest with those three firm recommendations to the Minister, particularly the first one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can say anything in one minute that is worth saying.  Very briefly I will make the point that a rape trial such as this should not become a ritual lynching of somebody accused of rape or a public juridicial rape of the reputation of the alleged victim. The reforms recommended by the Women's Rights Committee in this regard so as to ensure that the person making an allegation of rape will not be put through a form of questioning in the <Col N="1218" /> witness box which seeks to destroy the reputation of that person totally, in a manner that does not have any relevance to the accusation made in the context of the trial, is a procedure that requires immediate attention.</P>
      <P>In the time remaining to me let me make one point which has not already been made by any other speaker.  None of us in this House can state whether the verdict reached in this case was correct but what we can all state is that there is a public perception that something was wrong and that perception derives from the fact that a barrister employed to appear on behalf of the State throughout the course of these proceedings did not appear for reasons which have been referred to already.  There is no doubt that any counsel instructed by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute a case on behalf of the State should be required to be present in court throughout the period of the trial in order to ensure that justice is done and the State is properly represented.  That can be brought about by action taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions and I join with those who raised the issue of the Bar Council changing their guidelines and looking at their procedures in this area. It is my view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide for the extension of the Custom House Docks area.  The present boundaries of the area are defined in the Schedule to the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and the Act makes no provision for their alteration.  There is an immediate need to extend the area to include the River Liffey quays immediately adjoining it and I propose to extend the area to the centre of the Liffey as soon as the Bill is enacted.  I also propose to extend the area eastwards once development of the existing area has got underway.  Extensions in an eastward direction will take in lands lying between the Liffey and Sheriff Street, Upper and Lower.  The Bill accordingly provides for the extension of the Custom House Docks area by order made by the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Bill deals also with other matters which arise or will arise as a consequence of the extension of the remit of the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are committed to securing the early redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area in a manner which will rebound to the benefit of our capital city and of the economy as a whole.  Indeed the whole thrust of the present redevelopment effort has its origins in legislative proposals put forward by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 in the Urban Development Area Bill of that year.  That Bill lapsed with the dissolution of Dáil Éireann on 4 November, 1982 and it is regrettable that it took until March, 1986, almost three and a half years later, before the Coalition Government revived those proposals and presented them to Dáil Éireann in the form of the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986.  It is a pity that this time was lost in securing <Col N="1220" /> the redevelopment of the area.  This Government are determined to ensure that there will be no more delays in securing completion of the task.  I made it clear to the Authority last March that early and sustained progress was expected and I am pleased to say that the Authority responded by bringing forward their target dates for completion of the necessary stages of preparation, planning and development.  Deputies will be aware that an important milestone was reached last week when the Authority presented a planning scheme to me for approval.  I will make a decision in relation to this scheme as soon as possible, taking account of any objections that may be made by Dublin Corporation within the period of one month allowed in the Act.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have given an undertaking to keep under continuous review the legislative framework and other constraints under which the Authority operate and to bring forward any necessary legislative proposals, or make other appropriate arrangements, to deal with any factors that might hinder the Authority in securing the redevelopment of the area.  I have been in frequent contact with the chairman of the Authority in this regard and, arising from these contacts, I believe that the present Bill is both necessary and timely.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the Bill, as I have already said, is to extend the Custom House Docks area and I have indicated the extensions which are proposed.  The purpose of these extensions is not to expand the Authority's jurisdiction to lands which are separate and distinct from the existing area.  Instead, the purpose is to expedite the redevelopment of the existing Custom House Docks area by providing potential developers and investors with an assurance that the Government intend to see to it that the entire dockland area is progressively renewed and redeveloped.  In addition, the Bill will enable redevelopment of the existing area to be carried out in a manner which relates well to its surroundings and which re-incorporates the site and the quayside into the life of the city.  This is essential, because of the importance of <Col N="1221" /> the site, the nature and scale of the development and the impact it will have on the whole fabric of the city centre.</P>
    <P>The southern boundary of the area at present lies along the Custom House Quay but does not include the road, the quayside or any part of the River Liffey. It quickly became apparent that this situation was unsatisfactory and would restrict excessively the options available to the Authority in relation to roads and traffic arrangements, pedestrianisation schemes, environmental improvement and amenity works necessary to exploit fully the potential of the river and the quayside.  One of the most important objectives of the redevelopment of the area must be to maximise the quayside and the river as an integral part of the fabric of the city and to exploit its value for the purposes of communication, recreation and amenity and as a unifying link in the appearance and structural organisation of the city.  The present boundary of the area militates against this objective.  For this reason, the Government decided that the area should be extended to the centre of the River Liffey as soon as possible and I made an announcement to this effect on 10 May, 1987 so that it could be taken into account by the Authority in the preparation of their planning scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the riverside frontage to the south of the existing area it is important that redevelopment enhances and relates well to other adjoining areas. Deputies will be aware that the area is bounded on the western and northern sides by the Custom House, Bus Aras, the Postal Sorting Office and Connolly Station, all of which are unlikely to be the subject of major redevelopment in the foreseeable future.  However, there is considerable potential for improvement and redevelopment to the east of the area, where a good deal of land is in the hands of public bodies.  The extension of the remit of the Authority in an easterly direction is, therefore, a logical and necessary step and provides the best means of realising the full potential of this area.  The local authority housing complex at Sheriff Street is already the <Col N="1222" /> subject of review by a special working party drawn from Dublin Corporation, the Department of the Environment and the Authority.  This does not imply, however, that any decision has been made about the future status of this housing area, much less that it is to become the responsibility of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will increase the number of ordinary members of the Authority from four to seven.  This increase is needed to broaden the range of expertise available on the Authority and to include, for example, persons who have direct experience in the financing and carrying out of large-scale development proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the chairman of the Authority will have the statutory duty of ensuring the efficient discharge of the business of the Authority.  A similar provision applies to the chairman of An Bord Pleanála under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, and it is desirable that an express requirement on these lines should apply to the chairman of the Authority who is, of course, a full time executive chairman.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 confer necessary powers of land acquisition by agreement and the special powers of transfer of land by ministerial order under section 13 of the Act relate only to land in the Custom House Docks area held by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  All such land in the existing area has already been transferred to the Authority.  While these powers were adequate in relation to the existing Custom House Docks area, they would neither be appropriate nor adequate in relation to the areas to be added on the eastern side.  Sections 5 and 6 reflect the considerable differences in terms of land use and land ownership between the present area and the areas now to be added.</P>
    <P>Section 5 confers powers of compulsory land acquisition on the Authority. The intention is that the Authority will have the same powers in this regard as a housing authority under Part V of the Housing Act, 1966.  This section does not apply to land held by statutory bodies, but will enable the Authority to <Col N="1223" /> acquire any other land that is situated in the Custom House Docks area, as defined for the time being.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enables land held by a statutory body in the Custom House Docks area to be transferred to the Authority by order made by the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the body concerned.  Consequential matters, including the assessment of compensation and any necessary application or modification of other enactments are provided for.  As with section 5, this section will apply only to land which lies within the Custom House Docks area as defined for the time being.</P>
    <P>Section 7 extends from two years to five years the period within which grants can be made to the Authority under section 14 of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986.  The existing period of two years from the establishment of the Authority is unrealistically short and needs to be extended, having regard especially to the provision for an extension of the remit of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is a reflection of the responsive and supportive role of the Government in relation to the redevelopment of this important area.  The potential for redevelopment in this part of the city is immense.  I believe that the redevelopment of this site, and future extensions of it, will contribute substantially to renewed growth in the building industry and the general economy.</P>
    <P>Of course, within the overall framework there is great scope for imaginative and innovative design.  The area offers a unique opportunity to exploit the relationship between buildings and water and to create a visually dramatic and at the same time attractive place to live and work in, and to enjoy as a leisure and recreational amenity.  In other cities it has emerged that a dockland development of this kind becomes a major attraction for visitors who come just to look and wander around, as well as serving as a major focus of commercial and social activity for the residents of the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> One of the most important elements of this development will be the establishment of the new international financial services centre.  Arrangements for this development are well under way under the guidance of a special committee appointed by the Taoiseach and on which the Custom House Docks Development Authority are represented. Already, on the recommendation of the committee, special tax provisions to encourage the development of the international financial services centre have been included in the Finance Bill.  These incentives are in addition to the incentives already available for other development on the site.  The latter include rates remission and taxation allowances in respect of the capital costs of commercial buildings, the rent payable by traders and &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; type allowances for rented residential accommodation.  These allowances add up to a very keen incentive package and should not only encourage primary development on the site, but also allow rental costs to be held at very competitive levels compared with those obtaining in other centres.  This will be particularly important in the case of the international financial services centre.</P>
    <P>Financial services is one of the fastest-growing sectors of economic activity in the world and our aim is to put Ireland into the mainstream of that growth.  The south west corner of the site, adjoining the Custom House has been earmarked for the centre.  All the indications are that this centre will be an outstanding success. Major financial institutions from all over the world have expressed interest and a major marketing campaign is underway. In addition to the centre and other commercial activities, it is envisaged that the site will contain retail, cultural, residential and amenity facilities.</P>
    <P>The important thing now is to ensure that every possible effort is made to achieve the objective of getting the right kind of development under way quickly, and that the momentum for progress is sustained. The Bill is an important step in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a strange little Bill, appearing at a strange time and ostensibly <Col N="1225" /> for a purpose which had not been very apparent or in demand prior to its appearance. The Minister has laid great emphasis on the primary purpose of the Bill as being the necessity to extend the area which would be developed by the Custom House Docks Authority.  Of course, it was always an objective of the proposers of the intention of the Authority that they might extend their activities progressively and hopefully, as had happened in other cities, that there might be a regeneration of the entire obsolete dockland area.  However, the initial area of 27 acres was chosen carefully for a variety of reasons, one being that it was all in the one ownership of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
      <P>The intention clearly was outlined that the successful development of those 27 acres would then dictate the pace and size of any extension which might take place. Now, for some strange reason which perhaps we can explore at greater length later, the Minister has chosen, before any specific development has been decided upon in relation to the original area of the Custom House Docks Authority, to seek from the Dáil the authority to allow him to extend the size of the Custom House Docks Authority site in an ill-defined way and one which is very difficult for Members of the House to assess.</P>
      <P>At the time when the 1986 Urban Renewal Bill was being presented to the House, the then Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, who was handling it at that time undertook to place in the Library of the House maps of the area which it was intended would be covered both by the Custom House Docks Authority and in relation to the development areas in other cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Premises have been obtained at 58-64 Upper Dominick Street, Dublin 1, to meet the accommodation needs for the National Archives on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>A scheme for a purpose-built, permanent headquarters for the National Archives at a State-owned site at Smithfield was investigated some years ago. In more recent times, the possibility of adapting an existing building, including one located at the Custom House Docks Site, to serve as a permanent repository for the National Archives, was also evaluated. A final decision on the matter will be made in the light of experience of the use of the Dominick Street premises and in the light of the availability of financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate that our archival heritage must be safeguarded and the provison of suitable accommodation is the key factor in that regard.  I will ensure that my Department and the Office of Public Works monitor those needs closely <Col N="1230" /> so as to anticipate and alleviate any difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to report that considerable progress has been made in my Department on the preparation of documents which will be deposited in the National Archives.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Cabinet minutes and supporting files have been transferred over the past ten years from my Department to the State Paper Office where public access is permitted to them. The papers transferred already relate to the period up to 1954.  It is estimated that other files still held in my Department and dating from the inception of the State up to the late fifties number approximately 9,500.  In exccess of 8,000 of those files have been examined already.  About a further 1,500 files from that period remain to be examined.  The process of examining the latter files will be completed before the end of this year.  I will ensure that this material is transferred to the State Paper Office as soon as interim archival accommodation is available.  I expect that this will happen before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One person is engaged wholetime on a contract basis on the examination and evaluation of files and he is assisted, as <Col N="1231" /> need arises, by the three members of staff attached to the Registry of my Department.

Is the Taoiseach aware that little or no progress has been made in some of his Departments and that some of them seem only to have the slightest acquaintance with the legislation?  Will the Taoiseach take steps to ensure that they are brought into line with his own Department and the Department of Finance?</P>

      <P>The Naval Service vessels are fitted with appropriate equipment for the task of surveillance of Irish territorial waters.  In the interests of security it would be contrary to established practice to furnish information regarding the proposed acquisition of equipment of this nature.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware it has been estimated in our daily papers that there are in excess of 100 trips in any one year of submarines armed with nuclear missiles from Holy Lock.  Can the Minister give an assurance that none of these submarines is entering Irish territorial waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The detection of submerged submarines remains a most difficult problem for naval forces, even for those countries with very large modern navies.  To achieve even moderate success calls for the provision of a very large variety of expensive equipment.  For example, in order to monitor Soviet submarine activity in the waters adjacent to the US, the US have installed very large fixed sonar installations on the seabed of its continental shelf.  These installations are connected to shore stations by cable and can achieve very long range detection of submarines.  In addition, the US Navy have developed sophisticated sonar equipment for their warships which permits reasonably long range detection of hostile submarines.  Such large navies also operate long range anti-submarine aircraft which can detect submerged submarines from the air.  The Naval Service is not so equipped.  Even Sweden, another neutral State, has been unable to cope with the problem of Soviet submarine incursions into their internal waters despite their considerable expenditure on ships and equipment.</P>

I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs are satisfied, on the basis of assurances given by the countries concerned, that military aircraft travelling through Irish-controlled airspace abide by the conditions that I referred to in the early part of my reply and that no overflights by foreign military aircraft take place other than those for which permission is given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

Has the Minister of State or his Department any proposals to equip us with the capacity at least to monitor, if nothing else, the overflight of military aircraft in our airspace?</P>

      <P>I am being upstaged.  I had intended to leave the submarine question until the next day.  It appears that our military neutrality does not count for much when we can do nothing about it. Does the Minister of State consider that planes should be asked to land when requested to do so at a few minutes' notice?  Seemingly that is the only way we can discover whether these planes are carrying unauthorised equipment or armaments.  Will the Minister of State consider introducing a provision that prior notice of overflights has to be given? Of course we should have the authority to ask planes to have random checks, to land at some of our major airports so that we can check to see whether what we have been told is correct.  Does the Minister of State favour such a system?</P>

The balance comprises the staff dealing with the central purchasing of vehicles, stores etc. for other Departments, Civil Defence, pensions and allied matters, the personnel branch, and non-clerical classes such as messengers and cleaners.

It appears that this Government have given no indication of how many recruits will be taken into the Permanent Defence Force over the next five years, so that none has any real prospect of taking up a position within the Permanent Defence Force.

Surely the Minister and his Government must know exactly what will take place between now and the end of the year, whatever about what may happen in four or five years time.  It is only proper that the Minister should come clean and tell the House exactly what is likely to happen to many of those 8,316 applicants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 17 together.  It is assumed that Question No. 17 refers to two separate incidents involving personnel of the Irish contingent serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) which occurred on 30 May 1987.</P>
      <P>The wounding of an Irish soldier on 30 May 1987 occurred when a civilian refused to permit a search of his vehicle at a checkpoint manned by Irish troops and made attempts to drive his vehicle at a member of the checkpoint party.  A number of warning shots were fired by the checkpoint personnel, one of which, it is understood, ricocheted and slightly injured the soldier in question.  The soldier who was discharged from hospital on 1 June 1987, is now back on duty.</P>
      <P>On the same day, two Irish personnel travelling in a jeep were stopped and surrounded by five armed men.  The soldiers were disarmed and obliged to drive to another location.  They were released after a short period and they returned unharmed to Irish Battalion Headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL is kept under constant review.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures <Col N="1247" /> are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops consistent with the carrying out of their mission.  I am satisfied that the procedures and equipment supplied provide very adequately for the protection of our personnel.</P>

      <P>I saw newspaper reports recently and in one report the retiring senior officer of whom Deputy Barry spoke stated there were indications of increased friction between various rival factions in South Lebanon which area the Irish UN forces were helping to police.  I also saw a recent report in a newspaper that the £2.5 million cutback by the Government has hit the programme to supply the Army with heavy machine guns.  The guns were originally ordered after Irish UN forces serving in Lebanon came under fire from similar weapons used by the Christian Militia and it was found that the standard machine gun was out-ranged.  This is a very serious matter that our Army are not properly equipped overseas.  This is very dangerous.</P>

Troops selected for overseas service undergo a <Col N="1248" /> very rigorous programme of training designed to help them to carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  In addition, the troops are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment.  The training, weapons and equipment provide very adequately for the protection of our personnel. In addition, physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is steadily being improved.

      <P>The number of female personnel in the Army on 31 May 1987, the latest date for which figures are available, was 66 all ranks.  There are no females serving in either the Air Corps or the Naval Service.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is determined from time to time in the light of military requirements and does not differentiate between male and female members. Because of the non-combatant role of female personnel, enlistment for general service has been confined to male personnel in recent times.  The question of recruiting additional female personnel is reviewed periodically in the light of current strengths and commitments and in the context of prevailing financial circumstances and the overall budgetary situation.</P>

      <P>This question was raised in the House by the same Deputy in the last Dáil shortly before the Christmas recess.  The then Minister for Defence outlined in the fullest detail why there are no females either in the Air Corps or the Naval Service.  Quite simply, the facilities are not there for females in the Naval Service.  Since that question was answered in the Dáil on the last occasion the situation has not changed in any way. I can assure the Deputy that every consideration is being given as far as female recruits are concerned.</P>

      <P>An ongoing review of military requirements for lands and premises was intensified in recent years with a view to identifying major items of property which could be disposed of as surplus to requirements.  As a result, a number of surplus sites have been selected for disposal as soon as they can be vacated.  Where these sites are vested in the Minister for Finance, they will be returned to the Commissioners for Public Works and the properties vested in me will be put up for sale by public advertisement, if they are not required by other Departments.  Any moneys realised from sales would accrue to the Exchequer as appropriations-in-aid of the Vote for Defence or of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  In any event, I am not at all certain from the investigations made so far that any worthwhile revenue will accrue from the sale of old military barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with great regret that we heard of the decision of Hyster Automated Handling Ltd. to cease operations at their Blanchardstown plant.  I am sure the House will share this regret and join with me in expressing my concern for the employees who will lose their jobs as a consequence.  This news is particularly regrettable in so far as the operations at Blanchardstown represented the establishment of an integrated stand-alone operation incorporating research and development, training, production and marketing in this country.  In this respect it met the industrial policy criteria followed by successive Governments and enshrined in the 1983 White Paper on Industrial Policy.  Deputies will I am sure recall that it has been a frequent criticism of overseas policy and that it has failed to attract projects which incorporated these desirable features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982 the Industrial Development <Col N="1256" /> Authority agreed a significant support for the establishment in Ireland of a worldwide headquarters for the design, development, manufacture and marketing of a new generation of automated materials handling systems.  The company planned to provide jobs for 450 people within five years, and this was seen as a most desirable type of investment project for Ireland because of the quality of employment opportunities particularly for the graduate population.  The project was to be the only centre for Hyster Corporation to develop a new generation of products.</P>
    <P>At the peak stages of the project, towards the end of last year, 289 people were employed and a range of new products had been developed at the plant for markets worldwide.  The IDA had paid £15 million to Hyster mainly in relation to the people-related activities of the investment.  The most significant proportion of grants paid related to the comprehensive advanced training programmes, the research and development activities and employment grants. Some £2.9 million of IDA grants relates to capital investment by the company.  In addition the Authority provided a custom built factory at a cost of some £6 million. This factory was to be purchased by the company in the period 1988-92.  The company was also the recipient of grant assistance from Córas Tráchtála of £553,000.</P>
    <P>I am advised that during 1986 it became apparent that the project was not developing as planned and that significant losses would be incurred by the company. The company undertook a review of the business in co-operation with the Industrial Development Authority.  This indicated a need for a restructuring of the company's plans, particularly in the light of the failure to achieve its targets.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the cash grants paid to Hyster is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Capital Grants (Machinery &amp; Equipment) £2.9 million</P>
    <P>Training Grants £6.2 million</P>
    <P>Employment Grants £3.5 million</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> R &amp; D Grants £2.5 million</P>
    <P>In the matter of employment grants raised by Deputy Bruton the project incorporated significant R &amp; D, marketing and other functions specified by the Minister for Industry and Energy under the International Services Programme and the grants approved were to be paid in respect of employees in job categories designated under that programme.</P>
    <P>The Hyster company was up to yesterday in discussion with the Authority on a modified business plan concentrating on those manufacturing elements which might have potential for providing the basis of a viable business over the longer term.  The IDA are now in discussion with the Hyster company on the question of revocation of grants and will pursue the company for their liabilities.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the IDA that the company's decision is irrevocable and that an immediate priority for them will be to pursue every avenue to provide new opportunities for employment of the workforce at Blanchardstown.</P>

The Minister has told us that in the region of £21 million was given to the company and I should like to ask him if the first notice of this action by the company was received at 2 a.m. this morning given that the IDA were in discussions with the company yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, or the Minister for Labour to do everything possible to ensure that the provisions of the Acts dealing with redundancy payments and the minimum notice and terms of employment are adhered to for the benefit of the employees.  Will the Government seek advice, if they have not received it, as to whether the company have been in breach of the law?  Is the Minister aware that the company have <Col N="1258" /> a worldwide reputation for this type of activity?  Will the Government be making their disgust and anger known throughout the world at the behaviour of the company who were involved in discussions yesterday and, without any notice, made the decision which faced employees this morning?</P>

I understand that discussions are taking place between the company and the staff work council involved.  The company have a worldwide reputation and I have no doubt that the IDA will be taking that matter up with them when discussing the revocation of any money.</P>

      <P>The statement by the Minister that the decision by the company was irrecovable was the most frightening part of his reply.  In view of the fact that the staff are non-unionised &mdash; presumably that was one of the conditions of Hyster coming to Ireland &mdash; will the Minister say what steps he is taking to ensure that the staff get their wages due to them, holiday pay, redundancy pay and so on?  How were the IDA fooled in regard to this?  They were able to say on Thursday last that the Hyster plant would not close although there would be some redundancies.  In view of the fact that there was a similar occurrence in Blanchardstown two years ago in the case of the Mostek factory how were the IDA fooled for the second time?  Could it be more sinister, were the IDA fooling the staff that there was no prospect of a closure, something that is now being said?  Is the Minister satisfied with the strategy adopted by the IDA or have they altered their strategy in view of the number of closures in recent times?</P>

I should like to assure the Deputy that all influences will be exerted by the IDA who are in constant touch about this.  In regard to the statement that the IDA were fooled, I should like to tell the Deputy that it is clear to us that the IDA were working diligently for some time to get a restructured or streamlined package to maintain some employment there.  The discussions were developing on those lines until yesterday when the company announced that they had decided that the project here had failed and they were not continuing.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that the Irish taxpayer has put up in the region of £20 million and I should like him to tell the House how much, under the terms agreed by the present and previous Government, the company have put in as counterpart to that substantial figure from the Irish taxpayer?  Will the Minister tell the House who will have the right to use the results of the research and development work carried out at Blanchardstown towards which the Irish taxpayer has paid £2.5 million?  Why did the Government in 1982 not seek a parent company guarantee of the repayment of the money, as was done by the same Government in the Mostek case?  Furthermore, in regard to the employment grants which were apparently paid in this case, could the Minister say if there is any other instance where a manufacturing project was paid employment grants?  Does he agree that those grants are solely intended to be paid to service projects?  Could the Minister also say if he is satisfied, having looked at the file &mdash; I realise he has not had that much time to do so &mdash; that the company, the IDA and the Cabinet had adequately examined the market for the product being produced in Hyster in Blanchardstown before they approved the expenditure on a contractually irrevocable basis of such large sums of money by the Irish taxpayer?</P>

      <P>Hyster had an investment equity of £4.2 million in the company and own the results of research and development but the people trained in such skills are in this country.  In relation to a parent company guarantee being available, anybody who knows anything about this project will recognise that there was keen, world wide competition to attract Hyster to various countries, including north and south of the Border in this country.  At the time the IDA did a very successful job in attracting them here.  I do not have the figures in regard to employment grants for other companies but if the Deputy puts down a question I will answer it or send the information to him.  I should also like to remind Deputy Bruton that the Government of which he was a member in 1984 supported a grant of £14 million towards another project by Hyster with only £1 million coming from them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will he assure the House that he will take every step possible to ensure <Col N="1261" /> that workers get their rights?  Is he prepared to ensure that his Department and the IDA treat the Dublin west area as the blackest of employment black spots? Will he outline the measures he will take to get alternative employment in this area?</P>

      <P>I categorically state that in so far as the Government are concerned, workers will get their rights. I have already replied to another point made by the Deputy by saying that the IDA and all other agencies will be directing their attention towards providing replacement jobs in the area because of the high technological skills available from a very important, mainly graduate, workforce.  It is disappointing that this project has failed but, notwithstanding the losses, we will do our utmost to ensure that these skills will be utilised in this country and in the Blanchardstown area. I do not have a calculator but I am sure the cost per job is substantial and could add up to £50,000 or £60,000.</P>

It is a credit to the former Government that we did not accept the deal at that time and that we asked for more investment from the company.

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is very high-tech research employment which is costly.  Naturally it would cost a greater amount per job than in the normal course of events.  We would all like to see more jobs being created but we are in competition with many other countries in this regard; 49 of the 50 States in America now promote employment potential in their State.  That is the kind of competition we had to contend with.  I am not suggesting for a moment that we should be giving higher than the odds in relation to cost per job. All Deputies must appreciate that this company was in a very high-tech research area and that is why the cost was substantially higher than normal.</P>

    <Title>Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was saying that this is a strange little Bill, produced at a very strange time.  I invite the House to consider just how strange this Bill is.  The Urban Renewal Bill as passed last year provided for the establishment of designated areas in a number of our cities for redevelopment purposes, and specifically, as is the subject of this Bill, for the establishment of the Custom House Dock Development Authority for 27 acres.  Now, extraordinarily, before one brick had been laid or one foundation opened, the Minister comes in ostensibly to seek our agreement to the enactment of this legislation to allow him to extend the area.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the boundaries to which the area is to be extended are ill-defined, in sharp contrast to the position when the principal Bill was presented to the Oireachtas and when lists of the areas were laid in the Oireachtas Library for the consideration of Members so that they might speak with greater knowledge on what was envisaged.  It was always envisaged that the Custom House Dock Development Authority, if successful, would extend the scope of their activities and in time would see to the redevelopment of the entire Dublin dockland area.  Though the Minister has said that the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the extension of the Custom House Docks area, that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The Bill has been introduced for one real reason only, that is, as represented by the Minister in a subservient and minor part of the Bill, because the present administration want to increase the size of the board membership from a chairman and four members to a chairman and seven members.  What we have presented to us is merely the cloak of the purported desire of the Minister to be able to extend the authority of the Custom House Dock Authority to a wider area for the Minister to achieve his main objective, in section 3, of enlarging the ordinary membership which, together with the chairman, would result in an authority of eight members rather than five.</P>
    <P>Even that attempt is rather clumsy because virtually every administration and Minister would attempt to have a board comprising an uneven number whereas the Minister now proposes there will likely be an equality of votes, a situation which is not regarded as particularly desirable.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that within months of the Minister taking office he has identified an authority appointed by the previous administration and because he or his party did not have the right to appoint the membership of that authority he has resorted to the device of substantially increasing the membership so as to be able to appoint persons of his choosing. It is very difficult to come to any other conclusion.  In explanation of the clause to increase the ordinary membership, the Minister said it was necessary in order &ldquo;for example, to have persons who have direct experience in the financing and carrying out of large scale development proposals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Apart from the gratuitous insult thereby paid to some of the existing members of the authority, anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the development scene in Ireland will know that in the existing membership of the Custom House Dock Development Authority there is extraordinary experience and expertise among some of the members in the carrying out of major developments in construction, <Col N="1298" /> in the tourist industry and major financing of developments in Dublin, throughout Ireland and abroad.  There is in the authority a wealth of civil engineering experience among people who have been principal partners of the main contracting firms in the country.  It ill suits the Minister to attempt to represent that the authority do not have expertise among the members.  They clearly do.  The existing membership were chosen specifically so that that expertise would be available in the activities of the authority.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has chosen to represent that the authority have not got particular knowledge or experience.  That is the reason why the membership need now, so soon after the authority had been set up, to be increased so substantially. The plain unvarnished truth is that the Minister wants to appoint his own men, and the way in which he has chosen to do that is to introduce legislation ostensibly to allow him the right to extend the area under the control of the authority, which is not opportune at all at present.  As the Minister said, the authority in the past week have published planning schemes and invited submissions from potential developers.  Already, by the production of this Bill, ostensibly to double or treble the area for redevelopment, potential developers have been left in a state of confusion because they are no longer certain whether they should make proposals regarding the 27 acres or whether the proposals should relate to a wider area and, if so, whether the proposals for the primary section of the site should be different from the position if the site itself would be a contained unit.</P>
    <P>It is particularly unfortunate that with the much heralded launch of the planning scheme last week we have, contemporaneously with that launch, the Minister's proposal to extend the area in an easterly direction with no potential easterly boundary as far as I am aware. There are other minor aspects in this regard.  I should not have thought it necessary to publish a Bill simply to extend in a southerly direction the area in the control of the Authority, to include the North Wall with a section of the River <Col N="1299" /> Liffey.  It was a suggestion I made in order that the southerly face of the area would be developed and opened up in an imaginative way so as to provide a picture window into the entire development area of the site.</P>
    <P>In that regard I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to seek the inclusion of the entire width of the river along the southern boundary of the existing Authority area.  It is desirable that if there is to be some kind of marine development in the inner dock that it be allowed to spill out into the river so as to provide an attractive picture of the opening into the site.  It would be more beneficial if such development included the entire width of the river rather than using just half its width as has been suggested by the Minister but that is not the primary purpose of the Bill.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to play politics with the membership of the Authority.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice for one administration to accept the bodies which were put in place by a previous administration and to accept the appointments which were made by a previous administration until such time as the period of appointment comes to an end.  Indeed, in many cases, outgoing members are reappointed by the administration of the day.  I do not think it could be suggested that the members of the existing Authority were primarily appointed on party political lines as each of them has a particular expertise.  Now, for whatever strange reason, the Government have decided that they wish to appoint their own people on to the Custom House Dock Authority and one can only wonder as to the reasons.  One cannot deal with statutory bodies in the same way as certain financial institutions might attempt to initiate take-over bids for other institutions. The Minister in introducing this Bill seemed to indicate that that is the type of cavalier approach being adopted in this case.</P>
    <P>There were particular reasons as to why the membership of the Custom House Dock Authority was kept to a <Col N="1300" /> small number.  The Minister of State in introducing the Bill at that time made it clear that he intended that Authority to have an executive rather than a representational function.  For that reason he wanted a small tightly knit group who were prepared to devote a good deal of their time and expertise to ensuring that the venture would be a success.  Now the Minister, for whatever reason by increasing the membership is defeating much of that purpose and for no useful reason.  I want to give notice to the House that I will be tabling amendments to sections 3 and 4 of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind section 4 is extraordinary. Normally, when a statutory body is appointed it consists of a chairman and ordinary members and the normal powers, duties and functions of a chairman are set out in the appointing section of the Bill.  There is no necessity for section 4 to outline specifiedly that it shall be the duty of the chairman of the Authority to ensure the official discharge of the business of the Authority.  That is one of the normal functions of any chairman or acting chairman.  It is dangerous that the Minister should suggest that he has had widespread consultation with the chairman of the Authority and is now making a number of suggestions.  Each member of the Custom House Dock Authority has a specific responsibility and as I have already said it was the intention of the previous administration that the five member Authority, whose chairman would also act as a full time chief executive, would act in an executive capacity.</P>
    <P>It would be regrettable and wrong if the chairman in his dual capacity as both chairman and chief executive felt he had the right to take decisions which later only require the rubber stamp of approval from his colleagues.  It is particularly important that where a person acts in the dual role of chairman and chief executive, the other members of the body or organisation have the right to question his decisions and put forward other points of view.  If that is not the case it would be more realistic and honest if one person was appointed chairman chief executive <Col N="1301" /> and sole decision maker.  In this case before a decision can be reached it has to have the approval of a majority of the members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>When the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986 was introduced in this House it provided for the establishment of designated areas for tax and special rates and one of the areas designated was the Custom House Docks site.  However, the Bill did not deal with the tax concessions which would apply to the designated areas and the reason for that was because it was felt it would be more appropriate if such concessions were outlined in the Finance Bill.  Therefore, the boundary of the Custom House Docks site was set out in Part II of Schedule III of the Finance Act, 1986 and in section 41 of the same Act the tax concessions which would apply inside that area were set out.</P>
    <P>The Minister purports to have, as his primary purpose, the extension of the boundaries of the existing site in a southerly direction towards the River Liffey and in an easterly direction for an undefined distance.  Yet in the 1987 Finance Bill there is no mention of any change in the area to be administered by the Custom House Docks Authority.  If the Minister makes an order to extend the size of the Custom House Docks site either to the south or to the east there will be a 27 acre site on which certain tax incentives and rate remissions will apply and an additional site to be brought within the remit of the Authority which presumably will carry the rate concessions proposed in the Bill but which will not carry the tax concessions as no attempt has been made to insert a clause in the Finance Bill to modify the boundaries of the designated area which are set out in Part II of Schedule III of the Finance Act, 1986.  Would the Minister explain how the Authority are to be expected to operate in that fashion and why extension clauses are not included in the Finance Bill this year as was the case last year.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that in this Bill the Minister deals only with one aspect of the 1986 Act, that is, the Custom House Dock Development Authority.  I would <Col N="1302" /> have thought that he would have taken this opportunity to outline to the House the progress which had been made in encouraging development into each of the designated areas which were set out under the Principal Act &mdash; the County Boroughs of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  As it has been found necessary at this early stage to extend the boundaries of the Custom House Docks site perhaps the Minister would indicate to the House whether there is any intention to alter or modify the boundaries of the designated areas in the five county boroughs.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also explain, which should be an interesting process, how it is now envisaged that the Authority will develop a larger area &mdash; how much larger we do not yet know and perhaps there will be some indication given of that in the reply &mdash; when one considers that the funding made available to the Authority in this year for the redevelopment of the 27 acre site was reduced by this administration from the £5 million provided by us in the last Government to £3 million. How is it now envisaged that a larger site will be developed expeditiously and in the manner which apparently is desired on a budget which is reduced by two-fifths from what was regarded as the minimum necessary for the Custom House Dock Authority to develop during this year on the 27 acres.</P>
    <P>I also find it rather difficult to accept the bona fides of the Minister in regard to some of the things which he has said regarding the necessity, identified and recognised by everyone, for there to be large-scale redevelopment and regeneration of life and activity in Dublin city centre when the Minister is the same person who has in the last week, announced his intention as from the end of this month to abolish the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, having some months ago removed the funding assigned to them.  It does not seem to be a very consistent line for a Minister to suggest that he is so concerned about the redevelopment of Dublin city that he wishes now to extend the boundaries of this particular, unique, <Col N="1303" /> designated area for redevelopment having reduced the funding of the Authority charged with doing it and at the same time having abolished an authority which was set up virtually at the same time with the express purpose of redeveloping and bringing back a particular style of life into Dublin city centre.</P>
    <P>All of these proposals had a particular purpose; they were all designed in various ways, between the designated area for the redevelopment of Dublin, the Custom House Dock Authority and the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission, towards a greater area of Dublin inner city with redevelopment taking place along the quays, up through the northern derelict inner city, on the Custom House Docks site to open up the docklands and assign to them a new usage and at the same time to redevelop the main shopping spine of the capital city which would run through and be contiguous to those areas.  It does not seem to be very consistent to hear of the Minister's ostensible commitment to the redevelopment of Dublin docklands when one compares that with the actuality of his actions since becoming Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>There seems now to be also a representation being made that the primary purpose of the development of the Custom House Dock Authority area is for the setting up and creation of a financial services area.  Indeed one of today's newspapers seems to report the chairman of the Custom House Dock Authority as suggesting that that is the primary purpose. That was not at all the primary purpose when the Government of the day turned their minds to the prospect of redeveloping the site under the ownership of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which site was becoming progressively obsolete over a number of years.  That process started in 1981 when my colleague, Deputy O'Brien, was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment and was continued by the Minister's administration in 1982 and had been worked on progressively by Deputy O'Brien over the intervening years, <Col N="1304" /> taking the proposal to the stage it is at now.</P>
    <P>The prospect and possibility of a financial services centre being established or located within the site is indeed an exciting one which ought to be pursued and hopefully will be successful. However, it would be remiss to think that the entire site is to be primarily one for the provision of a financial services centre.  I do not think there is the scale of interest that would involve the redevelopment of the entire site and from what I understand, neither do the Authority.  It is important that whatever opportunities are in this area should be availed of and that those who have an interest should be encouraged to locate within the designated area, but the operation of any financial services activity should be one of a range of activities which will need to be carried out and developed virtually contemporaneously if the entire area is to have generated within it the life and the activity and new dawning which have been envisaged by so many people associated with the Custom House Docks site.</P>
    <P>I now make a point which I hope the Minister might consider in his examination of the planning scheme which I gather has been submitted to him.  It does not seem that the suggested location of the financial services area on the south west boundary of the existing site, that would be on the part of the site most adjacent to the Custom House, is perhaps the ideal location for such an activity, which is primarily an activity to be carried out within an office block.  In the same way as it is important to develop the southern boundary, the boundary opening out on to the River Liffey, in an imaginative way so as to attract the attention and the interest of passersby and Dubliners to the site and to what it may contain.  The south western corner which faces the Custom House and Busarus is vitally important and it is to be hoped that development will open up vistas as to what activities are taking place deep within the site, thus attracting people to enter on to the 27 acres and become aware of retail shopping, commercial usage, hotels, conference centres or <Col N="1305" /> whatever else.  I am not sure that the heart of the site where the general public will see the range of activities which are occurring is the best possible location for an office block for the proposed financial services area.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that it is not that I have any objection or feel that it is not appropriate that financial services should be located on the site, but I do not think that it ought to be represented that the site would be primarily for or substantially taken up by financial service users.  I think, regretfully, that it is unlikely that there would be that level of demand.  For the reasons I have outlined I feel that the suggested location for a financial services office block is not in the most appropriate part of the site.  The other suggestions relating to the establishment of a possible conference centre, hotels and a mixture of commercial, retail and housing have been generally accepted.  These proposals were advocated also by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Customs House Docks Authority has been in existence for such a short time it is extraordinary that there is a need to introduce a new Bill ostensibly to extend the size of the authority before either the market or the authority has been tested to see to what extent there is a market and what the time scale will be for the development of the 27 acres which has been assigned to the care and responsibility of the authority. It is regrettable that the primary purpose for the introduction of this Bill is to enable the Minister to make his own appointments onto an authority where he did not make appointments in the first place.  That is not acceptable.  It is not the normal practice which has been engaged in by administrations operating in this country.  I do not think the Minister can expect this House to easily accept this without registering a strong complaint.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill.  I assure you I will not delay the House.  For too long the planning laws of Dublin city have been controlled in no small way by a very select number of prominent people in a position of power.  The ease with which rezoning was granted in exchange for personal gain has led to the present state of decay in the inner city.  It is time to call a halt.  The Progressive Democrats support the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Bill, 1987.</P>
      <P>It is a well known fact that the centre of every major city suffers in some way from dereliction and urban decay.  It is the duty of every public representative to reverse this trend and in doing so to provide much needed employment for the people of Ireland.  This employment will afford a much needed injection of capital into the deprived areas of Dublin. The nature of the redevelopment will be such that it should encourage major investment from home and abroad.  The profits from multinationals which have so often in the past been repatriated can now be invested in Ireland for the benefit of the country and citizens.  The Bill creates an atmosphere and structure that will enable this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Large sums of money are being made available to develop achievable short-term and medium-term plans.  This will create an attractive commercial environment thereby encouraging confidence in inner city developers.  This proposed development will contain both commercial and residential units and this will make it ideally suited for inner city renewal.  Too often in the past residential and commercial interests were deemed <Col N="1309" /> to be incompatible.  This dock site development is a prime example of where an alliance between the two interests can be achieved successfully.  This can be brought about only in a planned and controlled manner as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Dublin Gas admitted yesterday that there are approximately 3,000 potholes in Dublin streets, causing great inconvenience and loss of time to motorists. This is in addition to the craters dug by Telecom Éireann, the ESB and Dublin Corporation.  It is high time the Minister got this matter under control.  This city has suffered from the eyesore of dereliction for far too long.  This Bill provides the authorities with the necessary powers to ensure that these circumstances will no longer prevail.  One of the essential ingredients of any urban renewal programme is the creation of a community. In order to facilitate the growth of a community, it is vital to provide a mixture of shops, offices, private and local dwellings and relevant amenities.  We know from previous experience that planning without any consideration of community aspects has been nothing short of disastrous. This Bill contains the necessary mechanism for planned development incorporating both commercial and residential interests.</P>
    <P>I say with confidence that proper planning does work.  On a smaller scale, my own city of Kilkenny could be held up as a shining example of urban renewal.  The city has come alive in the very recent past in terms of residential and commercial interests.  It is no accident that Kilkenny has won the major town award on a number of occasions and in 1985 it was the first large town to win the coveted Tidy Towns Award.  I have seen the benefits that controlled urban renewal can bring to a city.  Therefore, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats I endorse this Bill and hope that Dublin will reap similar benefits to those of my native city.</P>

      <P>I will be equally brief as I realise that my colleague from <Col N="1310" /> the constituency is anxious to come in and no doubt the House will benefit from his long experience of local authority matters.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill as it was badly needed.  I hope he will push the development through with all haste.  This is probably one of the most depressed and derelict areas in the whole country.  What we badly need here are jobs because we have the highest unemployment rate in the country.  We also need a proper mix between commercial and residential development.  I would not like this to become a ghost town after 5 o'clock in the evening.  In this city streets have changed over the years and have become totally commercial and especially on dark winter evenings they become positively dangerous, a haven for muggers and other undesirable characters.  Now that the Minister is settling in I hope he can break what appears to be central government indifference and local government inertia when it comes to developing areas.</P>
      <P>In 1963 the film &ldquo;The Spy who came in from the Cold&rdquo; was shot in the north inner city because it most resembled postwar Berlin.  That film could be shot all over again in areas in my constituency and one would not have to change anything. Much of the cause of this problem is that planners draw lines on maps without a thought for the communities.  The street widening plans for Dublin were drawn up in the 1950s.  Once one draws a line on the map for a road widening scheme one condemns the area to dereliction. We saw it in the North King Street area, in Smithfield, in the Hay-market, an area which has been completely derelict for years.  We were told we needed a street widening scheme to improve traffic flow etc. but in the process we have destroyed whole communities. We have built houses on farmland miles from jobs, services, churches etc., when we could have been developing the inner city and keeping the communities alive in places where families have grown up not just for generations but for centuries. Once this Bill has been passed I hope the Minister will turn his mind to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it may not be the Minister's <Col N="1311" /> field, he might, in consultation with his colleague the Minister for Transport and Tourism, take a look at the development of the north river as a ferry port.  The way passenger trends are going it seems that foot passengers on ferry boats are now becoming a thing of the past on the ferry boats between Ireland and England.  The north docks area is an area that could be developed to take heavy goods, cars, caravans and so on.  We cannot pour money into two areas, into Dún Laoghaire and the North Docks.  I am making a plea for the north inner city. Dún Laoghaire is good for yachting and perhaps a marina could be built where people may use their boats and enjoy themselves but what we need in the north inner city are jobs and an end to the dereliction.  This is a step on the road to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  As is known to the Minister and other Members of the House, I was involved in the initiative for this in 1982.  I could claim credit for initiating the whole project but that is not important.  What is important is the proper redevelopment of this site and the extended areas involved in it.  I disagree with the Minister in relation to what I would consider to be the proper redevelopment of this area.  I am afraid there will be a major gap between my views and what the Minister appears to intend, judging from the very glossy designed proposals with which we were all presented at the very expensive launch of this scheme last week.  It was noteworthy that at that very sophisticated, well organised, well orchestrated launch, there was not one member of the local community from Sheriff Street.  That is a very good indication of the Government's attitude of this area of the city and perhaps even of the Minister's attitude.  Not one member of a community that has been there for generations, that has kept that area alive and who worked, as my father did, in the warehouses on that site, was invited to this launch and they were not consulted in the proposals to redevelop the area in which they sweated for <Col N="1312" /> years.  On the day of the launch I was contacted by the Sheriff Street Tenants' Association and asked what was happening. They had not been informed and anything they knew they had read in the newspapers.  That is a terrible indictment of the way this matter has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>I would define urban renewal as a renewal process involving the communities in the inner city or in the urban area involved.  This redevelopment does not involve the inner city communities. It does not provide any possibility of jobs or any possibility of modern housing for the community.  The type of jobs involved in the financial services centre and the type of residential content envisaged in the glossy scheme with which we were presented would not be the sort of jobs or residential accommodation of which people from the Sheriff Street area, the East Wall or any of the inner city areas could avail.  It seems that what is involved in urban renewal from the Minister's point of view is renewal by speculators and developers of the office blocks, luxury apartments and so on and facilitating on the north side that type of commercial expansion that has destroyed so much of the south side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I differ from Deputy Boland in his view that the major reason this Bill is being brought in is to increase membership of the board.  I am sure that was high in the Minister's mind, but equally high in the minds of some of the Minister's advisers would be the presence of that community that I have referred to, the Sheriff Street community, virtually over the wall from the 27-acre site.  They present a threat to the Minister's redevelopment proposals for that area.  I know he devotes a few words to this community who comprise in the region of 2,000 people which would be bigger than the population of many small towns and villages throughout the country and about whom perhaps the Minister would be more concerned.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority housing complex at Sheriff Street is already the subject of review by a special working party <Col N="1313" /> drawn from Dublin Corporation, the Department of the Environment and the Authority.  This does not imply, however, that any decision has been made about the future status of this housing area, much less that it is to become the responsibility of the Authority.</P>
    <P>It does not imply it, but will the Minister when replying clarify what it implies about the Sheriff Street community? Whose responsibility will they be?  Does the Minister intend, as things stand at the moment, to leave the sole responsibility for that community with Dublin City Council and Dublin Corporation?  Does he intend to intervene in any way in regard to that responsibility?</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the Dublin City Council special committee for the inner city.  I have been involved in every renewal project in that area of the north side of Dublin during the last ten years or more, and I was not aware that a special working party drawn from Dublin Corporation and other authorities have been set up.  I am not suggesting for a minute they have not.  I suppose if the Minister says they have been set up then they have been set up, but I will be calling an emergency meeting of the inner city committee to find out why we were not informed of such a development and to ensure that the elected representatives for that area who stand on that committee have an input into this special working party.</P>
    <P>My main interest in the redevelopment proposals for the north inner city and the north side of Dublin centre is on the people who live there.  They are a very disadvantaged community.  Local surveys have shown that the very large population of the Sheriff Street area have perhaps the highest unemployment rate in the country, something like 60 to 70 per cent of the adult population there being unemployed. They live in grossly overcrowded conditions but little or no mention is made of these facts.  The residential content the Minister proposes for the 27 acres will hardly cater for the needs of those people.  Other than jobs cleaning <Col N="1314" /> floors and windows in hotels and office blocks, I see nothing in the Minister's outline planning scheme to provide employment for the underprivileged people who live there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is perturbed by what I am saying.  He will have ample opportunity to tell us about all the opportunities in his proposal to provide jobs for the people who live in disadvantaged inner city areas, and I will be only too willing to listen to these detailed, specific proposals because I have heard nothing of them so far.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons said on behalf of the PDs that he was anxious to help the growth of the community.  Clearly the PDs are unaware of the existence of one of the most traditional communities already in that area.  We do not need to provide for the growth of a community. We need to provide just for the basic needs to sustain the existing community there.  There is a responsibility on the Government and on the Minister to take this point perhaps a little more seriously than the Minister appears to be taking it.</P>
      <P>The Sheriff Street flats complex was built in the late thirties and early forties to provide accommodation for people who worked in the docks area.  During the past 20 years with the containerisation of work at the docks virtually all those people lost their jobs.  There was never an attempt by any Government to provide any alternative source of employment in that area for those people.  It would seem that this urban renewal project offers a possibility of doing that if the Government have the will and the intention to direct their energies at providing alternative employment in that area for the people who live there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Government's intention, the Minister said: &ldquo;.....the purpose is to expedite the redevelopment of the existing Custom House Docks area by providing potential developers and investors with an assurance that the Government intend to see to it that the <Col N="1315" /> entire dockland area is progressively renewed and redeveloped.&rdquo;  The potential developers and investors are the people the Minister is concerned about. I feel that the Minister is saying there he intends to drive the disadvantaged people of Sheriff Street out of that area of the city entirely because they do not provide the type of scenario he feels is required to attract the developers and investors. If this is what the Minister or any of his advisers have in mind, he will have a very serious conflict on his hands because the people who live in the Sheriff Street and North Wall area will not leave it for developers, investors, the Minister or anybody else.  Their roots are there and they intend to stay there.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is also a local representative, is well aware of that.</P>
    <P>If they are to stay there they need modern housing facilities so that they can live as all families should be able to live in 1987, and they need jobs.  Those are essentials.  I will be interested to hear whether the Minister has any plans to provide either of those requirements for that community.  I raised with the Minister at Question Time some weeks ago his record so far in relation to urban renewal.  That record shows a failure to approve even one single inner city local authority housing scheme for Dublin Corporation, despite the fact that there are projects for approximately 400 inner city houses on the Minister's desk.  Some are at design stage and some even at tender stage awaiting his approval.  To date the Minister has failed to approve one single house let alone one single scheme.  If that is the Minister's view of urban renewal &mdash; which seems to reflect overall Government attitude to cutbacks, to not investing in the construction industry or in any type of urban redevelopment &mdash; it is highly unlikely that we will see anything like the ambitious scheme that would be required in the North Wall area to rehouse the people living there in such terrible conditions.  If the Minister does not accept that there are terrible conditions prevailing in the Sheriff Street area I would ask him to take a walk <Col N="1316" /> among the flats complexes there when he will see how they have deteriorated, particularly over the past couple of years, to a very sorry state resulting largely from the huge unemployment levels among its people.  On the other hand if everything I have said is not accurate, it is not fair to the Minister, I would be the first to withdraw it if and when the Minister presents proposals to deal with the problems to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Having said all that I accept the need for this amending Bill before us, particularly the extension of the boundaries.  I assume that the boundaries extend to the East Wall Road.  It makes sense to do that but, unfortunately, the provisions do not do anything else.  There is no provision for State investment in that area, no specific answers to the social problems of the people living there.  The provisions of this Bill merely extends boundaries for some vague purpose the Minister is not prepared to detail.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I might revert to my starting point &mdash; it may be easy to brush it aside &mdash; that is the fact that there has been no consultation whatever with the very large population of the North Wall, the Sheriff Street area, in order to ascertain their views on how that area should be redeveloped. We could all be invited to a reception at which there were several hundred people, none of whom had ever shown any interest whatever in the north inner city in the past but who were there, presumably, because there may have been something to be gained in the future.  Yet those who organised that reception did not see fit to invite representatives of the people who have lived in that area, who know it intimately, who know every brick in the walls of the 27 acres, people who reared their families there for generations.  That is a pointer to the attitude of those who advise the Minister in relation to this Bill and the proposals to redevelop this area.</P>
    <P>I do not say this lightly or in any dramatic way but if any attempt is made to proceed with the redevelopment of the area set out in this amending Bill, which includes the Sheriff Street flats complex, <Col N="1317" /> without consulting the people who live there &mdash; in a way that conflicts with the interests and needs of those people &mdash; the Minister will have a major social problem on his hands.  I say that with absolute certainty and conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to be as brief as I can but there are a few specific points I want to make on this Bill. I am sure I will finish in ample time to allow the Deputy to get in before the Minister or any other Member presents himself in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to amend the Act passed last year.  That Act marked a most significant stage of preparation for the single biggest piece of urban renewal to be carried out in our capital city this century.  It also advanced the measures outlined by the then Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, last October in relation to <Col N="1318" /> boosting employment.  Considering this in tandem with the generous provisions of the Finance Act 1986 and the house improvement grants introduced by the previous Government it will be seen clearly that the present Fianna Fáil administration, in contrast, are not committed to a real policy of urban renewal, having vandalised the provisions of the Fine Gael Government for renewal of our housing stock.  Despite being pressed by me, this Government have refused to even consider presenting a White Paper on urban renewal.  I appeal to them even now to reconsider this or at least to agree to the establishment of an all-party parliamentary committee to examine and report on this matter of urgent public interest.  That is something which should be done.  A committee of the House, rather like the Committee on Marriage Breakdown, which could report on an all-party basis on the need for urban renewal, identifying areas needing to be dealt with and the order in which that should be done is a matter in which Parliament should involve itself.  I would urge the Minister to give that suggestion consideration.</P>
    <P>Many of our cities have declining populations while they continue to finance emptying schools and other public buildings in their centres.  Our inner cities have churches and hospitals &mdash; though a declining species &mdash; shops, schools and other infrastructure not yet available in the outer suburbs or, if provided there, at enormous expense to the taxpayer.  Yet there is no Government policy on inner city renewal.  In a living city is it not desirable that citizens continue to dwell within its inner boundaries?  An inner city should not become exclusively crime-ridden, with empty shells at night, where only shuttered shops, ringing alarm bells and wailing sirens of Garda patrol cars are heard.  That is not the type of inner city we want but that is the sort of inner city we will have unless there is clear Government policy on the question of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have made a very good job of their programme for inner city housing but where is the response, <Col N="1319" /> imagination, input of the private sector?  I sincerely hope that there will be adequate provision on the Custom House dock site for a good housing mix with both local authority and private housing.  In particular I hope that any extension of the site proposed under the provisions of this Bill will incorporate good mix of private and local authority housing developments.</P>
    <P>Whereas the county of Dublin as a whole now have a population of the order of 1.1 million, the population of Dublin city decreased from 567,866 in 1971 to an estimated 490,000 in 1985. That is a decline of 0.5 of 1 per cent between 1971 and 1979.  This accelerated to 1.8 per cent between 1979 and 1981. If this rate of decline is allowed to continue the population of Dublin city will have declined by 23.5 per cent in the 20 years up to 1991.  The source of those figures is the Dublin Development Plan provided by Dublin Corporation.  The year 1991 is a few short years from now. There will be an enormous devastation of our city if we are prepared to have no policy on urban renewal or to stand by and allow the situation to develop whereby the population of the city will have decreased by 23.5 per cent in 20 years.  That would be a serious indictment of the administrations which have been in office since 1971 for their failure to come to terms with this problem.  At least in the past few years an effort has been made, at least by the local authorities, to resite housing in the inner city.  I say to the Minister that unless there is a specific policy of urban renewal we are heading for a crime-ridden empty shell in the inner city of Dublin with a decline in population, falling school numbers and schools in bad repair because of the way grants for repairs are allocated.  I ask the Minister to urgently reconsider my suggestion on the need for a White Paper on urban renewal or at least for a parliamentary all-party committee to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>Against the background I have just outlined &mdash; the fact that the Government <Col N="1320" /> do not have an urban renewal policy or a White Paper and do not intend so far to assist Parliament to address and redress this problem &mdash; such failure is a crime against our citizens and not just our urban citizens, because all our taxpayers in the long run will have to pay for the cost in terms of crime and vandalism and in terms of ultimate renewal of infrastructure if we do not come to grips with this problem even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>The Act now being amended set out to address the problem in only one area, but a major area, of our city.  This approach was based on the fact that inner areas of our major urban centres represent a very valuable resource in terms of people, community life, public buildings, commercial and cultural centres and other infrastructure.  Allowing resources of this kind to suffer will cost the taxpayer dearly in time to come, not least of all in increased crime and vandalism.  The movement of established industries and commercial activities to suburban locations together with high site acquisition and development costs has denuded whole areas of employment potential and contributed to the decline in population.  This trend has to be reversed if we are to have a living city. The original Act tried to address this problem in one part of our city.</P>
    <P>Development in the past has been very imbalanced.  Only 15 per cent of office space provided in Dublin between 1960 and 1984 was on the north side of the city.  Yet this Government have effectively neutered the main political animal capable of assisting and reversing this situation, the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission.  The Government are determined that O'Connell Street will remain a legoland of degenerate architectural design.  What chances has the north city got from a Government who intend to ensure that the office development in that part of the city does not improve on the present 15 per cent of the total Dublin office development?  What would you expect from a Government who have not even one Deputy from a <Col N="1321" /> city area in the Department of the Environment? It is a bit like appointing two city Deputies to the Department of Agriculture. I say that without any reflection on the Deputies concerned but it is an indication of a lack of understanding of the problem facing our cities the fact that there is not an urban Deputy in the Department of the Environment.  That is regrettable.  I do not say that on any personal basis in regard to the two Deputies who are Ministers at that Department and who are quite capable of doing the work.</P>
    <P>Any review of urban policy should include a review of the activities of An Bord Pleanála who appear to have made a major contribution to a decline in the standard of development in many cases. An Bord Pleanála should be required to account for their stewardship.  There is no reason an independent board should not continue in operation but being independent and unaccountable is not the same thing.  If the Minister was to take a walk slowly along O'Connell Street and go from door to door &mdash; leaving aside the attempts which have been made by Clarks shoe shop, Easons and people of that kind to improve the streetscape by purely personal effort &mdash; and if he was to look at the other legoland, Burgerland developments which have been allowed to take place in our city he would find that a large number of them were given permission on appeal by An Bord Pleanála. An Bord Pleanála should be accountable for their stewardship.  I do not think that being accountable should in any way affect their independence. If somebody contributes to the sort of degeneration that has taken place in our main city they should be asked to account for it.  That is something which should be considered.</P>
    <P>There seems to have been an evolution in recent years which has taken away accountability in many areas of public life.  We had the case this morning of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am one of those people who believes that the DPP should be independent but being independent does not mean you are not accountable.  The same applies to An <Col N="1322" /> Bord Pleanála.  It is not good for democracy and it certainly is not good for urban renewal that there is a lack of accountability in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the designated areas, outside the Custom House Docks site, will the Minister tell the House what progress has been made in the designated areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway to promote the very substantial tax incentives for owner occupier dwellings and for commercial properties set out by the previous Government?  A tax allowance of up to 5 per cent is given on the expenditure incurred by an individual in respect of a dwelling newly constructed or refurbished during the period 23 October 1985 to 31 May 1989.  This is in addition to mortgage interest relief and is available each year for ten years.  During the same period a double rent allowance as an expense to computing taxable income is available for commercial development in the same designated areas.  Have the local authorities made any progress?  I doubt it very much.  Will the Minister, when replying to the debate, tell the House what progress local authorities have made in getting off the ground the possible developments which were allowed for in the designated areas throughout the country?  It seems that the Minister should not only get on his bike but should get some members of the local authorities on the crossbar and bring them with him because they do not seem to be motivated on their own and it is time they were motivated.</P>
    <P>There are areas of my constituency from Ushers Island down which could be developed if somebody made the effort. It seems &mdash; and I hope I am not doing somebody wrong &mdash; that no major effort is being made by the local authorities to sell those designated areas.  I have outlined the great incentives that exist for non-commercial and for commercial properties.  Will the Minister tell us how many developments have taken place in the cities I have mentioned as a result of this legislation?  It seems the local authorities are not on their bikes and that the <Col N="1323" /> Minister should do something about the matter.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that section 11 of the Finance Act, 1987, just published, does not extend the tax incentive of the business expansion scheme to the Custom House docks site despite the fact that the 10 per cent corporation tax rate applies. However, I will return to that on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  I do not know if the fact that this scheme does not extend to the Custom House docks site is an oversight or if it was intended that it might apply, but perhaps the Minister would discuss the matter with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, because that site would be very suitable for that tax incentive.</P>
    <P>This Government sadly lack the credibility to carry the day with any potential investor.  However, the two Ministers at the Department of the Environment, despite their lack of urban credentials, are two able operators and are well served by the small but able staff of the Custom House Docks Development Authority with whom I recently met and was highly impressed.</P>
    <P>When looking at the area of urban renewal the Minister might look at some areas where the counties and cities are being disfigured by cornerstones and paving stones bearing the names of politicians who seem to want all and sundry to know they opened this road or that estate.  In my view they are contributing to urban blight by this sort of nonsense.</P>
    <P>I want to quote very briefly some pertinent passages from &ldquo;Tourism and the Environment&rdquo;, a report by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, published in October 1986.  They say:</P>
    <P>Tourism is a national industry in Ireland which, directly and indirectly employs 85,000 people, earns nearly £850 million in revenue for Ireland each year and contributes just over £400 million in taxes to Government.</P>
    <P>The physical environment is an important, if not the important, factor in Ireland's tourism product.  Year after year tourists are attracted to <Col N="1324" /> Ireland by the beauty of our countryside and the friendly atmosphere of our towns and cities.  The protection and development of our environment must therefore be an integral part of the national tourism development effort.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for us to develop along the lines proposed in that report unless we have a substantial committed national policy on urban renewal which has been set out by the Government and the Parliament of the day.  There is no such policy today, and that is a matter for regret.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper on Tourism, published in September 1985, recognises that the environment is of primary importance to the overall tourism product and it warns that the economic and employment benefits of tourism would be seriously eroded if environmental conditions were permitted to decline.  Careful management of the environment is therefore an economic necessity as well as a social issue.  It declares that it makes sound economic sense to invest in environmental management and pollution control and the preservation and development of amenities.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of preserving our environment for our own citizens, which is desirable in itself because of problems with crime; it is not just a problem of developing a site like the Custom House docks site and the adjoining areas which contribute to blight and to terrible problems faced by our urban community, but a matter of economic and social importance, as is clearly stated in this report.  I would like to quote one short passage from the same report.  It says:</P>
    <P>The attraction of our cities, towns and villages stems to a large extent from the overall impression gleaned from a combination of facades and spaces, changes and levels, contrasting materials, hard and soft landscaping and street furniture ...</P>
    <P>Quite often, however, it is not the individual buildings which matter so much as the overall composition and <Col N="1325" /> this can be damaged by piecemeal renewal.</P>
    <P>This report specifically says &ldquo;this can be damaged by piecemeal renewal&rdquo; and the report goes on to condemn dereliction. Not only from the point of view of our own citizens or removing decay so that people can live in a good environment, a crime-fee environment where these people can use their skills and be happy to live, but from the point of view of our economic and social development as well as our peaceful development, it is vitally important in this area of public affairs that the Government develop a specific policy.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to let us have a White Paper on urban renewal.  If he is not prepared to do that let us have an all-party committee which will report on urban renewal.  The committee will then be dissolved and the House will try to pursue the issues they have identified.  If the Minister takes on that suggestion he will have done a great public service.</P>

      <P>Today we are considering the development of an historic waterfront site in the heart of Dublin.  I regret Deputy Gregory has left the Chamber because I brought in a copy of the planning scheme produced by the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  I believe it is important to discuss this Bill in conjunction with this document.  I am not against the glossy cover on the document because I would be ashamed of any semi-State body which produced a shoddy document.  If you have something to say, it is important that you say it properly, and to have a document like this which is well presented and well printed is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This document has literary qualities, interspersed with the details and drawings or quotations from James Joyce, Brendan Behan, Flann O'Brien, Samuel Beckett, Derek Mahon, Máirtín Ó Direáin and Louis MacNeice.  There is nothing wrong with that.  They have all written well about Dublin and Dublin should not be ashamed of what they have <Col N="1326" /> written.  This document could be considered a souvenir.  I would not knock this document although there might be some gaps between aspiration and realisation. That remains to be seen.  At this stage I would not agree with criticising the document because it is well laid out and presented.  I like the details and drawings contained in it.</P>
    <P>The planning scheme is ambitious and the aims are to reach certain standards. The document states that the Government are seeking to provide a framework for the regeneration and revitalisation of this area.  It is further hoped to set the stage to help to stimulate creative responses for the full development of the Custom House docks area.  That perhaps is a bit high-flown but it is laudable.  If all the plans are fulfilled this area will become a national prototype.  However, there is one very obvious flaw in the scheme.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have proper urban renewal and a regeneration and revitalisation of our inner cities, we must bring the people back to live in these centres.  At present a great deal of our centre city areas are like a mint with a hole in the middle.  Unless we include housing people and jobs in our urban renewal plans we will not have a real renewal of our cities.  This is the one big flaw I see in the scheme.  Financial services which have already been mentioned are one thing but people are another.  Unless we provide housing and jobs in the plans for the Custom House docks site the scheme will not be complete. In other words, there is need for a good mix.  Despite those misgivings, I do not think the scheme should be dismissed out of hand.  It could prove to be a useful exercise and, undoubtedly, it will be a welcome boost to the industry.  This important project offers a unique opportunity to add to and improve the social, economic and environmental qualities of Dublin, a city that has a rich legacy in architecture and culture.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why good design, good materials and good functional buildings should not go hand-in-hand in this project.  I welcome the decision to invite <Col N="1327" /> submissions in respect of the scheme.  It is a useful democratic exercise.  I note that the canal lock is to be retained and that the cobbles, stone sets and other stonework features will be preserved. That is good because those features will prove a big attraction.  I hope George's Quay is retained and that we can correct some of the mistakes of the past in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to integrate cultural life in the whole project.  It remains to be seen how far that will advance.  I would like to see some works of sculpture in the area.  In my view the use of pieces of sculpture would enhance the decoration of the area.  It would also create employment for sculptors and greatly enhance the concept.  We have often been accused of not devoting enough attention to our buildings, our rivers and our waterways and there is some truth in that.  We could learn a good deal about this from continental cities who have made great use of their rivers and waterways.  I was pleased to note the inclusion of a provision for the use of Irish made materials and I hope that intention is fulfilled.  We have all condemned the importation of food as a scandal but the importation of building materials is equally scandalous.  It is not generally known we import more than 50 per cent of the bricks used in our houses, schools, factories, office blocks and so on.  It is an indictment of our building industry and a sad reflection on us all that we cannot produce our own building materials, particularly bricks.  I hope the scheme under discussion will see a reversal of that sad pattern.  All our cities are crying out for urban renewal programmes and I hope the Dublin scheme will be a prototype for schemes in other cities.  The Minister has a vital role to play in overseeing this project.  His role is a pivotal one and I hope he will carry it out wisely and well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to extend the provisions of the Bill to cover the area I represent on Dublin City Council and in Dáil Éireann.  When the scheme <Col N="1328" /> was first mooted I expressed the hope that it would involve a certain amount of housing in conjunction with office development.  The site is unique for Dublin in that it is very big and is ideal for development under one authority.  At first I objected to the scheme on the grounds that the decision to make one authority responsible for the project was removing some of the powers of the local authority.  However, I accept that the project can succeed under the direction of one person.  I have no doubt the Minister will ensure it is not a one day wonder.  I am confident the development will proceed speedily.</P>
      <P>In most countries dock areas have changed dramatically in recent years because of the change to container traffic. Employment in most ports has dropped. I have lived and worked in that area all my life and I can recall when thousands of people worked there but the advent of container traffic has led to the disappearance of most of the skilled and unskilled jobs.</P>
      <P>The only approach to this area is by the quays or by passing under two very low bridges from Sheriff Street and Seville Place.  The provision of a new roadway will enhance the approach to the site.  It has been said that housing conditions in that area are very bad but a stone's throw away from it are some of the finest houses built in the country. Those houses were built at the direction of the Taoiseach some years ago.  Such development brought new life into that area.  A local authority cannot bring life back to such an area.  It is important when encouraging the business community to move into the area that we get people to return there to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those living on the north side have often considered they do not get the benefit of anything that is going.  There is the view that there is a Dublin 4 mentality in Government circles.  They appear to hold the view that an office block not located on the south side will not attract tenants.  I have no doubt that the projects proposed will succeed.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the old buildings there are restored.  I should like to compliment <Col N="1329" /> those responsible for the restoration of the building used last week for the launching of this programme.  A magnificent job was done on that old building.  Everybody commented on the wonderful restoration work and I was pleased to hear it is intended to use it as an office.  I hope the waterways in the area are maintained. I have been impressed by such renewal work in other cities.  I have heard of an area in Boston which up to nine years ago was an no-go area and where today, as a result of the development carried out, it is very expensive to rent property. That project has the proper mix of housing and office development.</P>
    <P>Properly planned projects like this are always supported by the business community and local people.  In my view the Minister should approach those involved in organising the annual boat show and suggest to them that they hold next year's event at that site.  We should consider putting a boom across the Liffey at this site and take into consideration the problems that arise when the tide goes out.  It is important to remember that development work like this will be of benefit to the entire city.  It is sad to see the derelict sites on Bachelor's Walk.  Restoration work there, which carries 50 per cent grants, is very slow.  Unless the Government support the Custom House docks proposal 100 per cent it will not be successful. I wish the Minister and the board every success and I am sure that Dublin Corporation will help in every possible way.  I appeal to the Minister to include extra housing in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Some Members referred to the fact that local people might not be considered but it is obvious there will be skilled jobs in this area and we should be planning, through the IDA and different training courses, to make sure that some local people are employed in the development and building of the scheme and in maintaining it afterwards.  People who live near the area would have the advantage of being able to walk to work and we should direct the various authorities to train these people.  I congratulate the Minister and I wish the scheme every success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the Custom House Docks site was a concept of the previous Government and was carried out with great enthusiasm and vigour by the former Minister, Deputy Boland, and his Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  I am glad the Government and the Minister are also pursuing this redevelopment in a vigorous manner.  It may be an enthusiasm born of necessity to a certain extent because having failed to inject the £200 million which they promised into the construction industry, and indeed having extracted nearly that amount by abolishing grants and so on, they had to do something.</P>
      <P>My interest is in promoting the idea of a cultural complex within the development, in whatever form it will take.  In so far as this Bill provides for the possibility of an extra area being taken in at some time, it removes the only argument that might have been advanced against a cultural centre, in other words, pressure on existing space.  The concept of a cultural complex was put forward by me as Minister of State for the Arts and Culture, was strongly backed by the then Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, and was enthusiastically taken on by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, who has always been very supportive of culture and the arts.</P>
      <P>The idea put forward was that the cultural complex should be located in what is known as Stack A which is often called the Crimean Banqueting Hall.  This has the added advantage of being a protected building; it is of considerable architectural importance mainly because of the unique cast iron frame construction designed by John Wren.  Because of this architectural quality it is a protected building and was the subject of a planning board permission stating that the banqueting hall should be retained because of its historical and architectural interest. Incidentally, this building &mdash; now a warehouse &mdash; has a covered area of 1.8 acres. I do not say it is the only area in which there could be a cultural complex but because of the protected nature of the building it is natural that it should be designated for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> A national gallery of modern art, a national folk museum and a national museum of science and technology are proposed for the complex.  All these institutions are badly needed in the capital and indeed in the country as a whole. There it a need for a national gallery of modern art.  The present National Gallery had a cut-off fund in the thirties as far as acquisitions are concerned because they do not have the space to handle any more pictures.  Therefore, there is no national showcase for the works of contemporary Irish artists and the public have very little access to them.  There is a degree of urgency about this, as the Minister knows, because of the recent munificent donation by Sir Sidney Nolan of about 50 of his paintings valued between £2 million and £4 million.  A home must quickly be found for these works of art.</P>
    <P>I know of many other people, some based in Ireland and others in the United States, who would be quite willing to bequeath their collections to this country provided there was an appropriate home for them.  Because of that, and for other reasons, it is very important to have a national gallery of modern art.  The site has been examined by the director of the National Gallery and by architects, conversion possibilities have also been explored and it would be an ideal centre.</P>
    <P>The second area for which this might be used &mdash; the Minister should push the idea &mdash; is for a national folk museum to house our excellent folk collection.  This has languished in storage in Daingean for some time and before that in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  Some of the boxes which were nailed down by a now retired professor of folklore at University College, Dublin about 57 years ago and were not opened until last year when an excellent conservation and preservation job was done.  I am very glad the national folk collection is in an excellent state and ready to be put on show provided we have a showcase for it.  I am not suggesting a dead museum but a live activity one in which there would be exhibitions and people showing how things were done in <Col N="1332" /> the past which would be of great interest to visitors.  That would be a great advantage in the area as would a national museum of science and technology.  We have none here although they are all over the United States and are extraordinarily popular on the Continent.  They are also great crowd pullers, are highly educational and they show what can be done as far as technological developments are concerned.  They also follow the idea of an activity museum in which people participate and are very attractive for students and children.</P>
    <P>These are some of the possibilities that exist in this area.  The location would be ideal because it is so near the centre of the city and is easily reached from train and bus stations.  I know the personal interest which the Minister for the Environment has taken in the development in Castlebar and the support he has given in the area of culture and art in his native county.  I also know he will be very much in favour of furthering the idea of a cultural complex in the Custom House Docks site.  In advocating this, I suggest that far from taking away from the commercial value of the project the Minister would be greatly enhancing the potential commercial value of this area.  Indeed, with the presence of a prestige complex of the type I have been speaking about and getting the movement of people for constantly changing exhibitions &mdash; I understand the Authority are going along with this idea &mdash; I believe that developers who would come in there and in turn would seek to have something like this included to give an overall balance to the area would get movement of people, which is so essential, and would ensure that there would not be a closedown at 5 o'clock or 5.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>I believe passionately in this.  It might be possible to get Stack A refurbished and ready for the museum development at very little cost because of the advantage it would bring to that area.  It would be of major benefit to Dublin and of lasting benefit to the country as a whole in the educational, arts and culture areas. As Deputy Mitchell said, it would also be of major benefit to tourism.  About <Col N="1333" /> 68 per cent of our visitors from abroad designate this as being of major importance so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to resist in the strongest possible way any sort of pressure that might be brought on him, down along the line, for short term gain, seeking to have the idea of a cultural complex either postponed or not provided right in the heart of the initial development.  It will be something of which he will be proud, something of which the whole country can be proud.  It will be a major addition to the capital city and will fill three major gaps we now suffer from in our institutions.  If we lose this opportunity &mdash; we can get a suitable building in a suitable place at a reasonable cost &mdash; none of these three buildings will be seen on the ground in the lifetime of any Member of the present Dáil.  It is an opportunity to be grasped.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, as a west of Ireland man, that the various concessions given to the county boroughs, including Waterford and Limerick and now extended to Galway, should be extended to my native town of Sligo.  I understand this has been taken very seriously by the Minister for Finance, also a Sligoman. In Sligo town we have a rundown area similar to Galway and some of the other cities.  The extension of designation to those areas would lead to their revitalisation and revamping.  That would bring capital into those areas and there would be no need for expenditure by the Government, apart from a minor tax concession.  If that is not given those areas will remain derelict.  We are to have a new bridge across our river, and I understand the Minister will be announcing it shortly.  This will open up the view of the rundown areas.  I understand the Minister is considering the extension of these designations and concessions.  The case made by Sligo Chamber of Commerce is compelling. I cannot see a flaw in the argument.</P>
    <P>To return to my main theme, I am confident that the Minister, because of his previous history in regard to these matters, will not bow to whatever pressure commercial people bring on him, that <Col N="1334" /> he will insist on the establishment of a cultural complex there.  Though I conceived the idea myself, I would not have the slightest objection if it were called after him.  The main thing is that we get it off the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I will try to respond in a general way to the points raised.  There will be ample time to debate some of the other points on the sections on Committee Stage.  I will try to give a broad outline in my reply to some of the matters raised.  Lest there be any doubt about the matter, I want to stress first that this is an enabling measure. The Bill does not extend the existing remit of the Custom House Dock Development Authority by even one square inch.  It will enable the area to be extended by order of the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, but with the exception of the river frontage, which I will comment on later, it is not the Government's intention to extend redevelopment work to any further areas until the redevelopment of the existing Customs House Docks site is under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are important reasons that this Bill is appropriate and timely and why it needs to be passed as soon as possible.  Most important, I am aware that potential developers who have visited the site and the surrounding areas have expressed some concern about the impact of any development of the land surrounding the site, particularly those lands to the east which comprise in the main under-utilised dockland developments. The Government are and always have been committed to the eventual redevelopment of all derelict and semiderelict sites in the docks area but it is both opportune and necessary to translate that commitment into a concrete measure.  The passing of this measure will demonstrate clearly the Government's intention and will enable the Authority to allay any fears that potential development consortia may have regarding the <Col N="1335" /> future of the land surrounding the existing site.</P>
    <P>Once again I emphasise that it is the Government's intention to tackle the redevelopment programme on a logical and progressive basis, beginning with the Custom House Docks site.  The second major reason the Bill is needed now is to enable an immediate extension of the area in a southerly direction to take in the Customs House Quay and out to the centre of the river.  This was the original boundary proposed by Fianna Fáil in 1982 but it was not the one adopted by the previous administration who, for one reason or another, seems to have lost sight of the potential benefits of the waterside nature of the site.</P>
    <P>One of the most important objectives of the redevelopment will be to maximise the quayside and the river as an integral part of the fabric of the city and to exploit its value for the purposes of communication, recreation and amenity as a unifying link in the appearance and organisation of the city as a whole.  Unless the quays and part of the river are included in the site it will not be possible for the Authority or potential developers to maximise the benefits of the river. When one considers the two large docks, St. George's and the Inner Dock, which are contained in the site, it is obvious that the river and the water and the dock basins can play a critical role in the overall development of the site.  The development of the quayside has arisen in discussions between the Authority and potential developers.  For that reason also it is critical that the present measure be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A third reason for bringing this measure before the House at this time is the urgent need to increase the number of ordinary members of the Authority from four to seven.  As I have already said, this increase is needed to broaden the range of espertise available on the Authority to include persons who have direct experience in the financing and carrying out of large scale development proposals.  It should be obvious to all concerned that the redevelopment of the existing <Col N="1336" /> Custom House Docks site will be an enormous undertaking by any standards and in terms of cost, complexity and time-scale, will be quite unlike anything which has been seen in this city before now. Deputies will appreciate that the existing ordinary members of the Authority serve in a part time capacity and will be unable to devote all of their time to the needs of the Authority.  For that reason alone an increase in the size of the membership is warranted but on top of that the importance which must now attach to the development of the international financial services centre on the site makes it imperative that the Authority has available to them appropriate expertise in that area.  Furthermore, the Authority have indicated that they will expect a creative approach to both the design and the funding of the redevelopment.  In that connection, it will be critical for the Authority to have as much expertise as possible to assess the proposals which will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>What I have just said might suggest that the membership should be extended considerably beyond the proposed extra three but I believe also that the Authority will be most effective and efficient if their size is kept to the absolute minimum necessary to discharge their obligations. That is why I would not propose to appoint any more than three extra ordinary members and the total membership of the Authority, including the full time chairman, would then be eight members. I cannot emphasise enough the importance the Government attach to the redevelopment project.  The Taoiseach, other Ministers and I have already devoted an enormous amount of time and effort to facilitating and helping this project.  The improved range of incentives now available, the shorter time scale for the commencement of the development, which is now the aim of the Authority, and the bringing of this measure before the House are evidence of the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>I could spend some time detailing the many efforts and initiatives undertaken by the Government during the last few months in the interests of this project but <Col N="1337" /> that is not my main reason in mentioning them.  What I want to emphasise is that while the Government are fully committed and will do everything in their power to advance the redevelopment work there is on the other side of the coin a need for private developers to respond in kind.  I want to make it clear that the Government regard the development of the Custom House Docks as important not just in the context of Dublin but in the national context and, accordingly, I expect the community as a whole to adopt a positive and progressive attitude and to make full use of the opportunities the Government have now put before them. I do know that a number of Irish consortia have expressed an interest in the site. That is both heartening and gratifying.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with a few of the specific points raised by Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I was disappointed by Deputy Boland's initial remarks concerning the Bill but as he continued it became clear that he was very supportive of the measure.  I would like him to know that the need to extend the site was expressed and sought by the Authority and was expressed also by some of the would be developers who came to inspect the site in the past number of months.  They pointed out that it would be advantageous if the site was extended to the middle of the Liffey taking in the quayside.  The principal reason I am moving so fast is now that the planning scheme has been brought before me and the developers have been asked to make proposals before 1 September, it is essential that they understand that in their proposals they take cognisance of the fact that the river and the quayside are to be included.</P>
    <P>The extension of the site is to be welcomed and I would like to think that it would receive support from all sides of the House.  There is no point in saying that you had a bigger vista in mind.  If the proposals and the design scheme for the development were already with the Authority and if subsequently the sides of the site were extended it would not have been possible for the designers to take into account the extended area. <Col N="1338" /> Deputy Boland indicated that he always envisaged and expected that the total docks area would be included at some future date.  I would agree with that.  I stated earlier, apart from the extension to the middle of the River Liffey, that the extension will not take place until the development of the existing site commenced. It is necessary to make that extension now as it is essential to comply with the request and desire of all those involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland also made some remarks which I was not enamoured with in relation to the increase in the membership of the Authority which is to increase by three.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that the only reason the membership is being increased is because of the need which is there and which has been expressed by many.  I recognise the expertise that exists among the existing members of the Authority, that those on the Authority are highly experienced in their chosen fields of activity and have given of their best to date in so far as the workings of the Authority are concerned.  I am not dissolving the Authority nor am I sacking the members, all I am asking is for the membership to be increased.  This has the support of the Authority, too.  As I have already said, now that development proposals are being brought forward, perhaps an architect, a town planner, and a property developer may be useful additions to the membership of the Authority. Having regard particularly to the emphasis now being placed on the development of an international financial services centre perhaps, too, someone with financial expertise should be included.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recognise that the members are part time and that an extension in the membership by three is now needed.  The Deputy will also find that that need is recognised by the existing members of the Authority.  I am glad Deputy Boland agrees with the extension <Col N="1339" /> into the River Liffey but he commented that he would like to see the full width of the river being included.  I do not see the need to do so because by going only half way into the river will not interfere in any way with the development of the marina which is going to form part of the package. Including the full width of the river might interfere with future development on the other side of the river, on the Irish Life side at George's Quay.  It would be improper for us at this time to go beyond what we need for our own purpose which, as the Deputy quite rightly said, is to include the dock side and the river itself. I can see no reason for the Deputy wishing to have the area extended beyond what is proposed in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy had a concern about section 4 and the rationale for its inclusion in the legislation at this time.  That section takes account of the unusual position of the chairman; at present he is a full time chairman while the ordinary members are part time.  That section is in line with the corresponding section in the 1983 Planning Act in so far as a chairman of An Bord Pleanála is concerned.  I think it will be found that the proposal as outlined in that section will be welcomed by all concerned.</P>
      <P>The question of the funding of the Authority was raised also by Deputy Boland.  The capital allocation of £2 million this year is in line with what the Authority requested.  The previous Government's allocation was set when the precise needs of the Authority were not actually known.  The Authority has no problem with the present allocation and the grant-in-aid to them of £600,000 this year is also in line with their request to me.  It is an increase, as the Deputy is probably aware, on a previous Government's allocation of £387,000.  They needed the extra money and it has been provided so, in effect, the financial arrangements of the Authority and their needs have been catered for and I would ask the Deputy to take that in good faith as being the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also made some reference <Col N="1340" /> to the fact that I will be dissolving the Dublin Streets Commission at the end of this month.  While it is not perhaps appropriate in this discussion to talk about that, the commission have indicated to me that their plan for action will be ready before the end of the month and I shall be happy to pass on that plan to the corporation whose primary responsibility it is to look after the development of the inner city.  I understand that they are going to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon's contribution was most welcome.  He need be in no doubt that the cultural aspects and the need for such are not just well known to me and to those of us who have an interest in this site but are being processed and progressed very satisfactorily.

      <P>While I cannot say exactly how much of any particular stack will be involved, he can take it that, as outlined in the planning scheme, so it will be incorporated. It will make a magnificent contribution to the cultural and social life of this town and the inner city redevelopment. It will certainly be a great pulling cart for that area and will give a new life to the inner city.  It is needed and this is an ideal opportunity to take on board what is being offered to us almost free, gratis and for nothing, the magnificent Stack A that is in existence down there. I cannot go into it beyond saying that, of course, it is a major advantage to have such a centre in the area and it will do an enormous amount of good for the commercial viability of the site and for the tourist industry.  It is with all that in mind that we have been very carefully looking at the suggestion that the Deputy makes.  He will not be disappointed.</P>

      <P>We are agreed on one thing, Deputy Boland and I.  As far as <Col N="1342" /> the financial services centre is concerned, he sees it as an essential part of the development and I agree with him there, but it is only part of the total development. The implication was perhaps in what the Deputy was saying that it was the only thing that would happen down there and that the whole area would be swallowed up by that centre, but that is not the case.  There will be a whole range of developments actually outlined in the planning scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that in recent times the emphasis on the financial services aspect may put other potential people off from the concept of the mix that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share that view.  I believe that the financial services centre will be so strong that it will be the attraction there initially, but it will bring so many other things with it.  In the planning scheme, other developments are also expected and considered and will be regarded as an essential part of the total package.  The centre is getting the most media attention at the moment, I agree, but that is only to be expected because of the great interest shown.  It will be a magnificent success, the success story of the past 60 years.  Obviously, that is why it is attracting attention.  However, the other aspects of the development will be of considerable importance and will go to make up the total package, another good reason for the extension eastwards of the site earlier than had been anticipated by Deputy Boland and his friends.  I sincerely hope that is the case.  With the amount of interest being shown both here and abroad it is obvious that there will be a great need to extend the site in the not too distant future.  I look forward to that and welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the point made by Deputy Boland in so far as he sees some confusion in the developers' minds.  The opposite is the case.  The purpose of this Bill is to remove any doubts on the part of developers who are concerned about the area. The Government have indicated that additional areas will be added to and <Col N="1343" /> started up only when the redevelopment of the existing site is well under way. From conversations I have had with the chairman of the Authority and with some other interested parties, I found that they were unanimous in their welcome of the stated intention of the Government in the introduction of this legislation to extend the site and carry out the other functions that I have indicated.  I am sorry that Deputy Boland cannot see it quite in that light but he will find outside the House that my attitude in this regard is the attitude generally of all who are interested in this development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons welcomed the Bill very much and wanted to see a greater alliance between commercial and potential development on the site.  That is good thinking and is in accordance with everything I have been saying.  He is concerned about the number of gas holes in Dublin and while it has no relevance to this debate I would want it known to all and sundry that so am I and so are others who are sitting close by now.  Steps are being taken to see to it that that matter is looked into as well.  It is our intention, and not just intention but wish, that long before the millennium starts this matter will have been attended to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was very supportive of the measure.  He can rest assured the momentum will be kept up in so far as the development of the site is concerned.  I am very aware of the dereliction, the unemployment and the need for development that exists in the inner city.  It is not my intention to put any obstacles in the way of an early start-up of this development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory made an interesting contribution from many points of view but perhaps it is necessary for me to correct him on a few fundamentals in so far as his interest in this site is concerned. Quite rightly, he said he has been interested in the development of the area for some time, and his interest is well known.  He is critical of the fact that the Sheriff Street community were not contacted or consulted in relation to the development nor were they invited to the <Col N="1344" /> launch of the planning scheme last week. It is well to remember that the Custom House Docks Development Authority issued a public invitation to all interested persons and bodies to make suggestions and submissions in relation to the redevelopment at the site area and ample opportunity was given to all and sundry to do that.  Deputy Gregory might be interested to know &mdash; because obviously he is not aware of this &mdash; that submissions were received by the Authority from the North Wall Community Association, the Westland Row Community Council, the Living City Group and the Alliance for Work Forum.  I take it these are bodies, associations and organisations that have a particular interest in the inner city development.  They showed their interest in the development by putting it in writing.</P>
    <P>The reception for the launch of the planning scheme took place on 4 June 1987.  All elected representatives, Deputies and city councillors for the area in which the Custom House Docks site is located were invited by the Authority to attend the launch of the planning scheme. In any event, it was up to the Authority to invite whoever they wished.  I am aware that the president of the North Wall Community Association was in attendance.  I am not aware of any other group who were there but that association was represented.  Perhaps they have not been in contact with Deputy Gregory in recent days.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred also to the glossy planning scheme booklet in a rather disparaging way.  He was best answered in that regard by Deputy Kemmy who indicated that it was the only type of publication that would have sufficed.  I was surprised Deputy Gregory did not recognise and support the benefits that will obviously accrue to his constitutents as a result of this development. The Sheriff Street community do not represent any threat to me, to the development or to the Authority.  I cannot imagine why Deputy Gregory went off on the tack, that we should in any way feel threatened by them.  His attitude in this regard was quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> Some of his remarks were quite insular. One would have thought that the plight of the disadvantaged in the community in that area would have been eased and lessened by this development.  I thought he would have been most supportive and welcoming of the development.  There was an element of contradiction in his argument.  He said the Sheriff Street flats had been provided in the early thirties for people who were working on the docks.  As far as I am concerned, what is needed now are jobs to replace the lost dockside jobs and that is what will happen.  Thousands of people will be employed for a number of years on the construction of this development and after that there will be thousands of jobs, a whole range of activities.  I sincerely wish that many of his constitutents will get work in this development.  Listening to his contribution, it ran through my mind that Deputy Gregory holds some of his constituents in very poor regard but I will not go into that any further.</P>
    <P>The Deputy tried to suggest I was more concerned with development and investors than with his constituents.  If he were here, I would have to ask him what would be the future of his beloved inner city without investors and developers?  I cannot accept the threatening attitude he adopted at the end of his contribution, that if I or any of the people involved in the development attempted to do anything to upset his constituents in the Sheriff Street flats it would be resisted to the point of some kind of violent response.  I feel he has got the message wrong.  What he should be doing is welcoming something which is going to create a new environment in the middle of the city which will reinvigorate it and provide the jobs and the opportunities, for whatever length of time, for the people from his own community.  I must say I was very disappointed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory was taken aback because he did not know anything about the working party and the various bodies involved so far as housing in the Sheriff Street area is concerned.  This working party is at official level and the first meeting will take place next week.  I believe <Col N="1346" /> there are 19 subcommittees in Dublin Corporation and perhaps Deputy Gregory is not familiar with the workings of them all.  I am sure the working party will consult with all the interested parties including members of the corporation and people living in the area.  I know that Deputy Gregory will not be left out of the consultations.  He has always shown a very great interest in this area.  I am now showing some interest in this area and I hope he will see the benefit of my interest in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell reiterated his interest in a White Paper on urban renewal.  He is concerned about the decline in population of the city during the past 20 years. He may have some difficulties so far as his prognosis for the development of the inner city is concerned, that it might not go the way he would like and lead, as he said, to a crime-ridden empty shell.  The reason the Fianna Fáil Government are taking on this development is to ensure that it will not end up as that kind of an area.  This high level, classy development will give the extra push that is absolutely essential on the north side of the River Liffey that will bring about a new lifestyle and a new environment for the entire centre city.  It will be a magnificent contribution and I hope it will eliminate the fears that have been expressed by Deputy Mitchell in that regard.</P>
    <P>The planning scheme was welcomed by Deputy Kemmy and I thank him for that. He was concerned about the lack of housing, jobs and people but I ask him to address himself further to the scheme.  It is all about jobs and people.  There is a substantial element of residential development attached to the planning scheme and many people seem to have missed that point.  He is concerned also that many of the existing excellent features on the site such as some of the stacks, St. George's Dock and other important features would be retained.  He is not going to be disappointed in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Stafford for his support for the legislation.  Everybody is of the <Col N="1347" /> opinion that the existing beautiful buildings on the dock site which are so important from an architectural point of view should be retained.  That is very well catered for in the planning scheme.  It is my intention to press ahead with the idea that we should retain what is beautiful and add to it in the first phase of the development of the dock site.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the aspects that Deputy Nealon raised.  By and large I was very pleased with the reception that this important enabling legislation received. If there are other aspects Deputies would like clarified or expanded on on Committee Stage, I would be most happy to deal with them, but before Deputy Boland puts down the amendments I would ask him to give some consideration to the explanations I have given so that it might somewhat shorten the need for Committee Stage in regard to some of the items he raised.  There is nothing sinister in anything I have done.  My heart is in this project.  All I am interested in is seeing the development start at the earliest possible time so that we can bring some good news to the inner city.  It is overdue and this Government are determined to rectify that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can so easily be dealt with on Committee Stage. I asked the Minister if he could explain why the provision for the extension of the area has not been provided for in the Finance Bill as the tax incentives for the area are specifically provided for in the Fiannce Act.  As that involves other legislation it would not be so easy for us to deal with it on Committee Stage.  I would ask the Minister to give some explanation now to this very puzzling aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strategy there was deliberate.  We intend to deal with the incentives on a gradual basis as and when the new areas are added on taking account of the development envisaged at any particular time.  The Finance Bill contains the additional incentive of the 10 per cent corporation tax for firms <Col N="1348" /> trading in the international financial services sector and that is attached to the first area but no extension eastwards of the site will take place until the existing developments have already been undertaken. The Deputy supported that point of view except for the one out to the river.  I intend proposing that we take in the riverside and into the middle of the river immediately because the developers have asked that that be taken in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> In page 5, subsection (1), lines 36 to 38, to delete the definition of &ldquo;offshore installation&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `offshore installation' means any installation which is or has been maintained, or is intended to be established, for the exploration for or exploitation of minerals and includes any installation providing accommodation for persons who work on or from any such offshore installation so engaged in exploration or exploitation of minerals;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have been examining the definition of offshore installation in the Bill, which is intended to apply to installations used for the accommodation of offshore workers normally referred to as flotels.  I would prefer a definition which would refer specifically to such installations.  The amendment I am now proposing provides accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a help and it goes some distance towards responding to concerns that have been expressed.  There would be some concern among the operators that there had been a certain imprecision of definition and that left them in some doubt.  Indeed, they felt that the various definitions in relation to exploitation and exploration left open the possibility of some confusion. The amendment put forward by the Minister goes some distance to meet this, but I am not sure that it meets the situation fully.  Perhaps the Minister would put my mind at rest on this.</P>
      <P>A number of questions have been asked about the collective scope of these definitions.  For example, does the Bill cover installations that have been put in mothballs?  For some that are either in that situation or something very close to it the later provisions could prove very onerous.  To what extent has that been taken care of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes the point about some confusion.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove such doubts.  It is felt that the differences <Col N="1350" /> between the present description of the offshore installations in the section and in section 3(1) could give rise to some uncertainty.  Section 2 (1) defines an offshore installation as &ldquo;any installation which is used, or is intended to be used, for, or in relation to or in connection with exploration or exploitation&rdquo;.  Section 3(1), the later section which the Deputy refers to, provides that &ldquo;This Act applies to any offshore installation which is in waters to which this Act applies and which is used, or is intended to be used, in the exploration for or exploitation of minerals&rdquo;.  Therefore, there is no distinction between these two formulae. This could give rise to confusion.  I think this amendment clarifies the point.  Those installations &ldquo;laid up or in mothballs&rdquo; are covered but an exemption may be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to section 2(2).  That seems to make it clear that the definition of an offshore installation includes any part of one that is capable of being manned by one or more persons.  There is some anxiety that it does not exclude installations that are either unmanned or would be very rarely manned.  Is the Minister satisfied with that or does he feel any need to deal with it, as he has dealt with the earlier problem, by way of amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(2) extends the definition of &ldquo;offshore installation&rdquo; to cover any part of the installation capable of being manned by one or more persons. This refers to such units as flare stacks which may or may not be attached to the <Col N="1351" /> main installation structure.  The subsection also extends the protection of the Bill to &ldquo;any associated pipeline which, or any part of which, is in the waters to which the Act applies&rdquo;.  This covers the point that the subsection extends the definition of &ldquo;offshore installation&rdquo; to cover any part of the installation capable of being manned by one or more persons.</P>

      <P>Section 3(1) provides that: &ldquo;This Act applies to any offshore installation which is in waters to which this Act applies and which is used, or is intended to be used, in the exploration for or exploitaon of minerals&rdquo;.  The clarification by amendment No. 1 of the definition of &ldquo;offshore installation&rdquo; in section 2(1) of the Bill means in effect that the words in section 3 (1) following &ldquo;to which this Act applies&rdquo; are redundant and the amendment provides for their removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that that is a very good idea.  We have seen some indication recently that the Government are anxious to see greater activity offshore, and we all would endorse that aspiration though there might be differences about how we should get to that.  The concern of the industry in this area is that there should not be undue regulation.  Of course, in an area as hazardous as this there is a need for legislation, but we should be clear about the limits of what we have in mind.  I see no harm whatsoever in making clear that it is only installations intended for a particular purpose that are the concern of the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some examples of <Col N="1352" /> installations which would have been covered if section 3 stood in its existing form and those that will now be dealt with only on the basis of the amendment. In other words will any installations anywhere find themselves within the Bill as it stands and without the Bill if the amendment is made, or is it purely a drafting amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is a drafting amendment.  The earlier amendment means in effect that the words in section 3(1) are redundant.  It is a drafting amendment just to be consistent with the earlier amendment.  The clarification that I set out in section 2(1) of the Bill would just be meaningless if we leave this section unamended.  Therefore, I ask the Deputy to accept the point that it is a drafting amendment in line with the earlier amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 4 the power of the Minister to grant exemptions is provided.  Given the nature of the Bill it is clear that the Minister should have power of that nature.  This Committee Stage debate has only begun but already we have been talking about an installation that is mothballed, rarely manned or whatever, <Col N="1353" /> so there should be scope for exemptions, and it is clear that the person to grant them is the Minister.  What causes anxiety is the fact that at the moment the power to grant exemptions appears to be somewhat unfettered.  The principles on which the Minister will act to determine whether to grant or refuse an application for an exemption are not clear.  The purpose of our amendment is to provide that before the Minister would grant an exemption he should hear the views of the trade unions who are representative of the persons employed there.  That seems to be eminently reasonable.  Those who are employed in an installation who would find themselves outside the scope of the Bill and the regulations that I presume would be made under it may find their position prejudiced.  Maybe their position would be looked after &mdash; one expects and assumes that in the great majority of cases it will be looked after &mdash; but clearly they have an interest in whether they are to remain within or without the scope of the Bill.  In those circumstances their voice should be heard and their representatives' voice should be heard.  It seems to be an unanswerable argument.  I understand that the ICTU, who are broadly very supportive of the approach taken in the Bill, would accept the case for a ministerial power to grant exemptions &mdash; I do not want to put words into their mouth &mdash; and would be anxious that there would be provision in it for institutionalised consultation.  My amendment is quite limited.  It does not purport in any sense to give a veto to the trade unions or anyone else.  It says simply that before the Minister takes what is the fairly radical step of putting particular installations beyond the scope of the Bill and, in the process, putting some people beyond the protection provided by the Bill he should consult with the trade unions.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy said, section 4 provides the Minister with power to exempt an installation from the provisions of the Bill or from regulations made thereunder.  Before issuing an <Col N="1354" /> exemption, which must be in writing and must refer to a particular time span, the Minister must be of the opinion that to insist on compliance with the provisions of the Bill would not be reasonable.  The Deputy asked about the norms used in determining grounds for exemption.  I might say that there are four main ones &mdash; the amount of work involved, the number of employees, whether that be an actual or futuristic number, the duration of the work or any other special circumstances.  The whole purpose of the section is to give the Minister flexibility in the exercise of his powers.  It is important to ensure that the operations are not hindered by unnecessary restrictions. Deputy Birmingham made that point a few moments ago.</P>
      <P>The other important point is that the Minister would have the advice of the industrial inspectorate available to him in considering any such exemption applications, so that any views that should be borne in mind, whether advanced by the trade unions involved, through their representatives on the safety committees or those of any of the employees, will be considered.  An essential aspect of the provisions of the section is that the Minister should be able to respond quickly to a request for an exemption, ensuring that there will not be any unnecessary restrictions. The proposal contained in the amendment could lead to delays in granting exemptions.  For that reason I am opposed to the amendment on the grounds that any such exemption must be given in writing, that the inspectorate will be involved and that any decisions to be taken will have to be discussed beforehand. Therefore I do not consider the amendment necessary.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this <Col N="1355" /> Bill for the granting of exemptions are precisely those contained in the Application of Safety in Industry Act, 1980. The Deputy will note that, throughout the provisions of this Bill, great care has been taken to ensure that there is prior consultation in order to reach agreement, to ensure that there is no case of railroading, that any application is fully discussed, that there is sufficient time allowed for such consultation, that there is a structure of committees, that the inspectorate ensure that everything is done properly, at the same time &mdash; to take the Deputy's own point on board &mdash; without placing undue restrictions on the owner of an installation.  While the Deputy's point that there should be consultation is well made the provisions of the section will not prohibit such consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I push the Minister a little on this.  Presumably what will happen is that the owner of an installation which will be less actively used over a period, or whatever, will establish contact with the Department of Labour saying: &ldquo;We want an exemption.&rdquo;  I should like to know from the Minister how that will be handled.  For example, will there be an inspector sent out, will there be a report?  As a matter of practice will there be consultation with the unions even if we were not to include it in the section?  If the Minister could indicate what he foresees will be the chain of events that will follow an application for an exemption that would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would be consultation.  As I understand the provisions of the other legislation, there would be such consultation.  My understanding is that the provisions of this Bill would follow exactly the same lines &mdash; that the inspectorate would have to satisfy themselves that an exemption was reasonable, that the granting of such exemption did not in any way diminish the rights or safeguards of employees, <Col N="1356" /> ensuring that the granting of such exemption was not done by any way of a quick trick being played on the employees.</P>
      <P>I might point out that in general exemptions are not readily granted, they are always carefully considered.  The inspectorate are conversant with their powers or what they should do under the provisions of other legislation to deal with an application in order to ensure that everybody's interests are safeguarded.  I can give the Deputy an assurance that the interests of employees would be taken fully into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that the section as drafted says: &ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinion... that it would be unreasonable to require compliance with the provisions of this Act&rdquo;&mdash; and the factors which might influence him in that direction are indicated, such as the number of people who might be working, the shortness of the period during which the installation might be used and so on &mdash; he can exempt.  We have had a fair turnover of Ministers for Labour in recent times.  We just do not know how future Ministers for Labour would exercise that power.  I have to say I would be perfectly relaxed to leave it to the good judgment of the present occupant but, as at present drafted, the section contains the bald statement: &ldquo;Where the Minister is of opinon...&rdquo; he can exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be too far-fetched but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that at some stage we might have a Minister for Labour who believed in total deregulation, who would take the view that our entire offshore exploration is on such a relatively small scale by international standards that it would be unreasonable to require anybody operating within the Irish province to comply with the provisions of the Act.  Such views have been uttered in comparable areas in the House.  In those circumstances it is proper that there be some procedure to be followed which would give a third party an opportunity, where possible, to be heard in advance.  That is why it is appropriate that the representatives of <Col N="1357" /> the workers be given an opportunity of being heard.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have drafted provides that the Minister can do this having consulted with the trade unions representative of the persons employed.  The Minister says there may be cases in which an application for exemption is made as a matter of urgency.  I can understand that that might be the case.  I have no desire to add to the layers of bureaucracy. I would be quite prepared to amend my amendment, or to come back to this on Report Stage, to provide, for example, that the Minister would, wherever practicable enter into these consultations.  That concept of a requirement to do something where practicable finds expression elsewhere in the Bill &mdash; wherever practicable or wherever possible. But the principle of consultation which the Minister correctly says permeates much of the legislation, should be built into this centrally important section. There is no doubt that a Minister who has a mind to do so could set at nought the intentions of the Oireachtas by issuing exemptions with gay abandon.  Against even that remote danger it is appropriate that we build in procedures for consultation. That is why I would ask the Minister to think about this a little more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's points.  The purpose of the Bill is the protection of offshore workers, the whole principle being that they be protected. Therefore we should not be thinking that there is something in-built endeavouring to diminish or take away that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out also that exemptions may not be total, they can be granted subject to conditions where such is thought necessary, so that the wording would not be absolute but conditional. Bearing in mind that the principle enshrined is for consultation, that the industrial inspectorate under the provisions of various Acts endeavour to protect the safety, health and welfare of employees, particularly of offshore workers, and the fact that they work through the Department of Labour means that they are conscious of that <Col N="1358" /> protection.  Regardless of what Minister is in office the inspectorate would be very quick to stop any deregulation which is against the interest of employees.  There is adequate protection for people under this section and throughout the legislation.</P>
    <P>If I was to accept the amendments, I think the Deputy will agree with this, and if in all cases one was to have consultations directly with the trade union representatives involved and the trade unionists have been very helpful in the drafting of this legislation &mdash; it could become almost impossible to give an exemption.  Far from having any deregulation it would make it very difficult to operate the Act.  The Act has to work on the basis of a certain amount of trust and that trust is vested in the industrial inspectorate who have the interests of the protection of the employees at heart. That is precisely what the legislation is about.  I will consider this matter further if the Deputy wishes but I feel protection is adequately covered and the understanding is that the inspectorate would not make decisions lightly and would examine the question of whether an exemption should be granted.  In that examination it would be of paramount importance that there be nothing in the exemption that would be against the safety, health and welfare of the employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity in ensuring the safety of people employed on offshore installations I think the wording in this section is very loose in many ways and, consequently, I express reservations in this regard.  The reason for this is because of the amount of work involved.  That could leave the whole thing open to exploitation.  On Second Stage I mentioned that what I am concerned about is that if it were seen that in the marginal fields the amount of work involved would not be great it might not be profitable that people would try to get in and out quickly and standards would slip somewhat. I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity in regard to the inspectorate but <Col N="1359" /> by its very nature it will be very difficult to ensure that proper standards are maintained on offshore installations.  Because the installations will be many miles offshore there will be difficulties.  It is not like a land-based industry.  It will have its own unique problems and for that reason we will have to make sure that there will be not alone consultation but that there be not ongoing inspection and there is no provision for this in the Bill.  That is where I see the great difficulty arising.</P>
      <P>In section 4 the Minister states that exemptions will be granted provided they are of a short duration.  That is a potential recipe for poor standards to prevail.  If it is to be a short exemption job standards could be allowed to slip.  In section 4 also the Minister referred to &ldquo;any other special circumstance&rdquo;.  That type of wording is very loose and there is a need to be more specific in that regard.  What are the special circumstances under which an exemption would be granted?  The whole matter could be left open to abuse.</P>
      <P>I have figures for the numbers of injuries and deaths in the industry.  In 1982, 3,748 people were injured and there were five fatalities; in 1983, 3,294 people were injured and there were seven deaths and in 1984, 3,219 people were injured and again there were seven deaths.  This is a high risk industry where people work under the worst possible conditions.  For that reason every effort must be made to ensure that not alone is there consultation with the workers' representatives but also that there are the means by which proper supervision by the inspectorate can be carried out on a regular basis.  Spot checks should be made but this will be difficult on occasion because if a person is out at sea and sees a boat or a helicopter approaching it would be possible for him to tidy up any mess on these rigs.  There are certain parts of section 4 about which I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic rationale behind this is that in some circumstances, in the case of a small scale short duration activity, it might be oppressive to expect people to abide by the full rigours of this Act but there is no definition of what is <Col N="1360" /> small scale or of what is short duration. Any number of people might have any number of opinions on those definitions. Let me put forward this possibility.  Suppose there was some form of international convention, say, a UN convention, dealing with safety on offshore installations and suppose this identical section was included &mdash; that the Secretary General of the UN or whoever it may be, wherever he was of opinion with respect to offshore installations, that by reason of the amount of work involved, the numbers employed or the shortness of the period, it would be unreasonable to expect compliance &mdash; it would be by no means a fanciful interpretation to suggest that he might well take the view that anything happening in Irish waters was marginal and transient and that such a provision would only apply to the giants of the North Sea or whatever.  No one could say that that is not the interpretation that would be arrived at.  By extension, it is not inconceivable that at some stage there might be an administration so anxious to offer encouragement to offshore activity that corners would be cut in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that &mdash; this is not in any sense the usual token gesture &mdash; I have absolutely no fears whatsoever about the way in which the present Minister will exercise his power or about the advice that would be tendered to him by the inspectorate at present but when this Bill becomes law it will be there for time immemorial.  It is appropriate that we build into it some safeguards.  I have already accepted the Minister's point when he said this is something that could be asked of us as a matter of urgency and that if we had to consult anyone it might make it difficult for us to respond, that if people thought they could not have a genuine application dealt with as a matter of urgency it might discourage them from investing and locating in our waters.  I accept that is a valid point and I am quite prepared to reconsider my own amendment so that it might not be as categoric as it now is.  I would settle for a situation where the Minister would indicate a little <Col N="1361" /> more than aspiration, where he would indicate that the norm would involve consultations but that he would give himself power in appropriate emergency cases to absolve himself from the need to consult in a particular case.  I wonder whether the Minister will think about that overnight as I understand we will be resuming this debate tomorrow.  If he can see whether he can come any way towards accommodating my points, I, in turn, will think overnight on how I can introduce greater flexibility into my amendment and suggest some approaches that might achieve what is intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the points made by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Birmingham.  The basis of the legislation is the protection of offshore workers. Both Deputies made the point that when provision is made to grant exemptions some Minister at some time could start giving exemptions at will to anybody, regardless of the standards that are in place.  Deputy Birmingham is fairly making the point that the way to do that is not to take only the Minister's word but to have it cleared by the trade unions concerned.  I am sure between the two parties they would do an excellent job but a decision would not be made until about six months later when we would be into the winter season.  Any exploration for that year would be gone, and I do not believe that is what we are trying to achieve.  Under existing legislation the exemptions are there to allow some kind of flexibility where it is necessary.  We do not want the law to be so rigid that there will be no movement.  It is written into the legislation that exemptions will only be given when there are extremely good reasons for doing so, and not when a request is made by a particular firm.  The inspectorate would have to thoroughly examine the circumstances if they are envisaging granting an exemption.</P>

I believe exemptions should not be given unless there are extremely good reasons and they should never be given if there is a danger to employees.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all Members on the Opposition and Government benches who contributed to this debate and who voiced their concern for the action we have taken and for what will happen if a Bill such as this is not enacted very soon.  I could say that the expressions of concern for our environment have the total agreement of the House, but I must express my disappointment that the opportunity this Bill has given to the Dáil to halt the further destruction of the environment, and in particular to achieve the better preservation and protection of trees and woodlands of special recreational or amenity value or of outstanding natural beauty, may not be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urgency of introducing this Bill was necessitated by the application received by Wicklow County Council on 26 March 1987 from Bridgefarm Limited, owners of the old Fitzwilliam Estate, Coolattin, County Wicklow.  The Bill was presented to the House on 8 April last <Col N="1363" /> in good time to prevent the felling and extraction of trees, mainly oak trees, on 66½ hectares on a site known as Tomnafinnogue Wood which was covered by a tree preservation order number 3282/78.</P>
    <P>In view of the expressions by the Taoiseach both in and outside this House, we in the Labour Party had reason to hope that the Bill would have been welcomed by the Government and a speedy passage through both House effected.  Therefore, with regret we note that this opportunity was rejected by the Government on the grounds that it is, in the view of the Attorney General, unconstitutional under Articles 40.3 and 43, claiming that the legislation which would amend the Planning Acts so as to abolish compensation in the event of a refusal of consent to fell woodlands would be found unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Over the period of the debate I have been accused by members of the Government party that I had ample opportunity to introduce legislation when I was in Government.  When I introduced this Bill I expected to hear criticism of that nature.  In 1985 as Minister for the Environment I received the same legal advice as the present Minister and accepted it in good faith.  However, since then I have received from eminent legal people contrary advice on Articles 40 and 43 of the Constitution which leads me to believe that there are sufficient grounds in case law and in recent opinions to show that the legal opinion given to me in 1985, and now to the present Minister, is not conclusive.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, dealt at length on the aspects of the legal position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Articles of the Constitution which confirmed my doubts. Other contributors &mdash; Deputy McDowell, Deputy Barnes, Deputy Quill and Deputy Spring &mdash; added weight to the argument that the Bill would not be repugnant.  I only regret that Deputy John Kelly, who has written extensively on the Constitution, did not take the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I also regret that Deputy Garret FitzGerald, whose concern about tree preservation in Dorney Court is well known, did not take the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Nevertheless, we had the benefit of Deputy Kelly's book on the Irish Constitution which was used by Deputy Higgins to back up his case.</P>
    <P>When I introduced this Bill on 27 May I offered it to the Government to take it on board and to make any changes they considered it needed.  We were told by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that the Government would bring in their own legislation in the autumn session.  One can only assume that the Government are adopting a dog-in-the-manger attitude and that if there is a solution on the basis of our Bill then Fianna Fáil will bring in the legislation and no other party will gain any kudos from it.  I am afraid that is delaying an urgent matter to the probable detriment of Coolattin.  Nevertheless, we will wait and see what the Government Bill will provide as a solution.  I am prepared to bet that their Bill will have many similarities to the Bill we have already presented in the vital area of amending the planning acts.  We all hope that the Bill, when it is brought before the House, is not too late to preserve Coolattin Woods.</P>
    <P>The action of the Minister of State in charge of forestry in issuing a prohibition order against Bridgefarm's application for a felling licence is welcomed by all Members and I believe it will give the Government time to consider their legislation during the summer recess. However, it raises some concern for me arising out of the advice given to me by the Department in the last two years.  I was invited by the Coolattin Woods Action Committee in August 1985 to a meeting in Shillelagh &mdash; I was Minister for the Environment at the time &mdash; and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was represented at that meeting by a senior official and a local forester.  Clear assurances were given then that the replanting requirements in the consent for the felling of trees at Brow Wood and Drumgall Wood were being strictly <Col N="1365" /> monitored and would be so in the future. When Mr. Couchman wrote to me, as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, later in 1986 I was able to assure him then, on the information I received from my officials, that the monitoring had taken place and was continuing.  I was able to assure him that the replanting was being done in accordance with the arrangements and the surveillance that had been carried out by the Department.  The same information was given on 4 February to Deputy Hussey who was then Minister for Social Welfare by former Deputy Paddy O'Toole who was then Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  I assume that the same officials drafted both letters and advised the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, when he entered this debate on 27 May.  In the course of that debate, as reported at column 3094 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>I was in the position to make this decision because during a random visit to that wood in early May it was brought to my notice that the conditions which applied to the earlier licences had not been complied with. On receipt of that information I instructed officials of my Department to carry out an exhaustive and comprehensive inspection of the woods which had been clear felled and recently replanted.  My fears were justified as the inspection demonstrated beyond all shadow of doubt, and to my satisfaction, that the mortality rate of the saplings or new plants is of such an order as to make it very easy for me to put a prohibition order on the present notice which is before me.  The mortality rate of new plants in the clear felled area is of the order of 30 per cent.  In some of the oakwood species it is over 40 per cent but on average in both the conifer and broad leaf species, particularly oakwoods, it is over 30 per cent.  An acceptable level of mortality would be between 10 and 15 per cent but a mortality rate in the order of 30 per cent is totally unacceptable. Although I cannot claim to have any technical expertise in this matter I am <Col N="1366" /> strongly of the view that if you clear fell, particularly in relation to the replanting of oakwood species, it is very necessary for the young crop to have shelter and be protected from frost and heavy rainfalls.  The growing and maturing older trees compete for unwanted vegetation which allows the young trees to develop.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility to me and to former Deputy Paddy O'Toole to explain how he can be given information which is at variance with that given to his two predecessors.  I am happy that officials in the Department are well versed with the area but I find it difficult to accept that within a month different advice could be given to at least three Ministers.  That concerns me and the Taoiseach, who is present, should be concerned. I look to the Minister to find out who has given the information and whether it was given to us in the hope that it would make us happy.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out to the Minister that I have received information which is different from that given to me in 1985.  I hope it will be used by the Minister when he is preparing the new legislation for the autumn session.  I will not mind if the Minister brings in what we introduced.  There will be satisfaction in the knowledge that I put the Minister on the right road.</P>
      <P>All speakers from the Government side have endeavoured to deflect the attention of the House from the genuine efforts of my party to achieve a solution to the urgent problem of the attack on our environment by concluding their contributions with personal attacks on me.  I am prepared to compare my record of concern for Coolattin with any Deputy going back to 1977 when the problem arose with the sale of the Fitzwilliam Estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that <Col N="1367" /> on 16 January 1978 I proposed a notice of motion at a meeting of Wicklow County Council drawing attention to what was likely to happen at the Coolattin estate. I expressed concern for the woods and asked the council to take account of what was happening and apply tree preservation orders to the woods.  On 31 October of that year I signed more than 30 TPO's covering the woodlands and the trees in the Coolattin estate.  The effect of bringing in tree preservation orders on the woodlands was that the woodlands were taken out of the exclusive purview of the Forestry Acts and put into the amenity and planning sections of the Planning Acts thereby making the local authority the responsible body for the woodlands.  Wicklow County Council then became responsible for the amenities of the Coolattin area.  A further development took place later in 1985 and the Minister for the Environment dealt at some length with that aspect.</P>
    <P>It is one of the more interesting comments in his speech because much of the case he made for future preservation of trees hangs on what he said.  In columns 3083-84 of the Official Report of 27 May he said:</P>
    <P>Each individual tree preservation order is required to apply, in relation to any consent under the order and any application for such consent, provisions of Part IV of the 1963 Act which relate to applications for permission to develop land.  In the past, it was left very much to the individual planning authorities to decide for themselves which provisions of Part IV should apply in making tree preservation orders.  However, the situation is now very different in that my Department, in January 1986, issued to all planning authorities a document containing detailed advice and guidelines in relation to the making of tree preservation orders, together with a new model tree preservation order.</P>
    <P>This new order provides for the <Col N="1368" /> application of all of the relevant provisions which apply in relation to planning applications generally, including the provision for the making of submissions by interested parties to the local planning authority, the notification to such persons of the planning authority decision and the making of appeals to An Bord Pleanála by any person, whether the applicant for the consent or a third party.  The guidelines themselves reminded local authorities that a right of appeal is fundamental to the whole planning control system and they recommended that this should be provided for in every future tree preservation order.</P>
    <P>It was recommended also that the provision for appeals should cover third parties as well as the applicant for consent, since the basic principles underpinning the planning control system require that the position of such parties should be fully protected.  In line with this, the model tree preservation order now makes provision for applicants for consent to publish notice of their intention to do so, and provides also for the notification of consent decisions to any third party who has made representations at local level.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for the Environment in 1986 and perhaps the Minister could have been generous enough to acknowledge that fact and also that the guidelines and model tree preservation order were designed under my aegis at that time.  I am glad that the Minister acknowledges the benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been concerned about this problem over the years and, as a result of my actions, the public can use the Planning Acts and there can be objections by third parties to An Bord Pleanála.  The action which the Minister is now able to take is a direct result of <Col N="1369" /> those guidelines and the model tree preservation orders.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to read in the document which was prepared by the Taoiseach when he visited County Wicklow in April this year that these new powers were again stated.  I am sure he was made aware of them and that when he read the council's policy in relation to areas covered by tree preservation orders he must have been impressed at the actions taken as a result of such orders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may say that but I set out what happened and the problems which have arisen as a result of defective legislation whereby compensation still remains to be paid.  In any event, the Taoiseach read in the document that the council received seven applications for consent to felling of trees covered by tree preservation orders in Shuttles Wood, Quills Wood, Brow Wood, Mill Wood and Drumgall Wood. Given the limitations imposed by compensation provisions in section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the council in granting consents were able to achieve the imposition of conditions which had the effect of reducing the impact on the landscape, ensuring that the area was replanted with oak, the retention of specifies bands of trees and shade and shelter for new trees.  The above objectives are achieved by the imposition of 25 specific conditions on consents which provide for (1) the lodgment of cash security for compliance with conditions, (2) the retention of specifically numbered trees, (3) the retention of immature trees, (4) requirements to leave a double stand of oak on the boundary to woods adjoining public roads and (5) requirements that no tree of one metre girth or less at breast height or any yew or holly tree be felled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that the Coolattin tree preservation orders cover a number of individual woodlands.  Each <Col N="1370" /> application is referred to An Foras Forbartha and to the Department dealing with fisheries and forestry in addition to the council's staff.  Meetings were arranged on the site to discuss each application. In addition to technical reports, applications were discussed with elected representatives of the area together with interested local groups.  An Taisce, the Department, Mr. Couchman, Chairman of the Coolattin trees committee and any other person who raised an objection to a specific application were notified of the council's decision to grant consents. None of the decisions of the council was appealed to An Bord Pleanála within the prescribed period, presumably because the various interest groups were satisfied that the council had achieved the best possible compromise in dealing with the application.  That submission, which has not been questioned by the Deputies who contributed tonight, indicates that everybody was satisfied because under the new guidelines issued and the model tree preservation orders they were in a position to appeal any of these consents given in 1986.  Those bodies, the county council or its individual members, An Taisce and the trees action committee all had the ability to appeal but none of them did and, therefore, rather than pointing the finger in my direction when the powers were given to those bodies and to the members of the council, they should look into their souls to see if they were neglectful in any way</P>

That is the council's factual description of what happened right up to the present. If there is a problem in that regard Deputy Roche can set me right about it. We have been on this side for only a few short months but we have taken an initative about the preservation of Coolattin. Deputy Haughey had been on this side of the House for the past few years and I cannot recall any notice of motion being brought about Coolattin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen one from the Deputy, though his concern has been shown in recent months.  The Deputy's concern for the environment and the amenities of County Wicklow has got to be questioned to some degree.  The Taoiseach should know that under the Planning Acts development plans are drawn up for counties with the assistance of and the full knowledge of members of local authorities who are the custodians of our heritage.  County Wicklow is the most beautiful county in Ireland and therefore a development plan should be accepted.  However, in 1985 Fianna Fáil got a majority on Wicklow County Council for the first time in history &mdash; I will not say how the campaign was fought because it would be unfair in a debate of this kind.  They got 13 out of the 24 seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Since then they have maintained power in that local authority.  During my time in that authority we had planning boards for each area and interested people were encouraged to come in to discuss development plans or applications for planning permission.  In the time since Fianna Fáil got their majority we have had 69 section 4s tabled by members of the council under the 1955 City and County Management (Amendment) Act to direct the county manager to grant permission against the advice of his specialist advisers to build various dwellings etc, to change decisions.  Of those 69, 55 have been in the names of Fianna Fáil councillors.  That underlines the concern felt by Fianna Fáil in Wicklow, and of course Deputy Roche is a prominent member of the county council.  When I was a member of the council from 1974 to 1984 we did away with all section 4s. Again we are becoming the county of section 4s and receiving denunication in all areas for the use of that section to direct the manager to reverse decisions. The damage that can do to our environment is as bad as that being done in Coolattin.  When Deputy Roche comes in here and calls me names I would ask him to look into his heart and then give a bit of direction to his party in their operation of the Planning Acts so as to ensure that that activity will stop as quickly as possible, for the good of our county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will tell us if I signed any of those applications. You will find that I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that the Deputy is a very prominent member of his party, a very vocal member of the council and I am speaking about the concern he shows in County Wicklow.  I hope the Government will act on a final appeal to look again at our legislation.  I understand that both they and Fine Gael will be opposing this legislation.  I regret that. I appeal to them to reverse that decision and accept that the initiative we have taken on reasonably sound grounds should be supported.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1373" /> to say that he will take this Bill, have it studied again, use the examples we have given throughout the debate and see whether the changes we would like to see in the Planning Acts could be adopted, particularly because of the new feeling in the country about Articles 40 and 43 of the Constitution.  I will finish by repeating the remarks of Deputy M. Higgins on 3 June last when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That case law is there and those opinions are there.  It seems an extraordinary view of the Attorney General's office to be advising a senior Minister such as the Minister for the Environment in the way in which it has been reported to the House.  It has implications of a more conservative kind that go far beyond the question of Coolattin Woods or the trees and woodlands, because it spills over into the whole area of amenities and compensation. To run away from the whole issue of compensation by seeming to accept it and establishing a working party which would deal with the nuts <Col N="1374" /> and bolts of the establishment of levels of compensation is to fire away the principle before one even has begun to test it.  The appropriate way for the Legislature and for Government is to frame the law with prudence and care, as speakers have said; that having been done, to make the assumption of constitutionality and let others test it before the courts.</P>
    <P>That is the proper way for the Minister to proceed.  He has said he is opposing this Bill.  In the words of Deputy Higgins, I appeal to the Minister, for the good of our environment, of our amenities and our heritage, to take our Bill and have it studied again, with the information he has received from eminent Deputies on all sides of the House, and stop pointing the finger at whom he regards as the best and worst environmentalists among us. We should do something urgently for Coolattin Woods and for all the other woodlands throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  Since the Services provided for in a number of these Votes are of a non-controversial nature, I do not consider it necessary to go into the minutiae of the individual Votes.  However, I will refer to some salient points which will be of interest to Deputies.</P>
      <P>The combined total of the 19 Votes of the Finance group before the House this evening comes to some £352 million, including £43 million capital.  Almost three-quarters of the total falls under the Votes for Public Works and Buildings which is £106 million.  Office of the Revenue Commissioners, £95 million and Superannuation and Retired Allowances, £54 million.  Total payroll numbers provided for come to about 9,700, of which close to 7,000 are in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  In addition, the Office of Public Works employ around 2,000 or so, who are paid from the various maintenance and works subheads of their Vote.</P>
      <P>As far as my own Department are concerned, I am pleased, to be able to outline to the House some of the more significant developments which have taken place in recent times.  First of all, the merging of the Departments of Finance and the Public Service will, I believe, lead to more efficiency and better utilisation of staffing resources.  Already staff numbers in the combined Department have been reduced by more than 40.  Despite this merger, however, my Department's Vote for 1987 shows a net increase of £4.9 million over 1986 due to a new provision of £7 million for distribution of the lottery surplus to which I will refer later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are determined to pursue their policy of restoring order to the public finances and reduce dependency on national borrowing.  In order to ease the burden on the Exchequer the cost of the public service must be reduced and I am glad to report that as a first step the special measures in relation to pay <Col N="1378" /> and numbers outlined in my budget speech are being strictly adhered to.</P>
    <P>As a result of the reorganisation of my own Department in March of this year 42 officers have been redeployed most of whom were assigned to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  With a view to curtailing public expenditure generally, the Taoiseach has recently initiated a series of expenditure reviews which are intended to continue with the correction of the imbalance in the public finances which I began in my budget this year. Senior officers of my Department are involved in the examination of departmental expenditure programmes and will be reporting on them to the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>Servicing the national debt is a major burden on our public finances.  In 1987, debt servicing will account for about 12½ per cent of our GNP and for 33 per cent of our tax revenue.  How this debt is managed, therefore, has to be a source of keen concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved since 1984 in lowering the servicing cost of the foreign debt and smoothing out the repayment schedule.  That programme of pre-payment and re-financing has already yielded savings of some £80 million on the cost of the loans pre-paid.  The programme is, of course continuing but we will be constantly searching for other ways of making savings &mdash; without adding to risk &mdash; in the servicing of the national debt.</P>
    <P>A provision of £7 million is made in my Department's Vote for the distribution of the surplus of net proceeds from the national lottery.  This expenditure will not, however, result in any net charge to the Exchequer as a similar amount will come in as revenue.  The Government have decided that this £7 million should be allocated as follows: £3,150,000 for youth and sport projects, £1,750,000 to arts, culture and the Irish language and £2,100,000 to projects in the health area. The lottery is enjoying considerable popularity and all the signs are that the surplus available to the Exchequer will be well in excess of £7 million.  I am consulting with my colleagues as to the <Col N="1379" /> allocation of the additional funds anticipated.</P>
    <P>The remaining Finance Group Votes which are before the House tonight are largely administrative in nature and with the exceptions of Votes 9, Revenue Commissioners; 10, Public Works and Buildings and 22, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, involve relatively minor expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Revenue Commissioners is one of the largest within the group amounting to £95.138 million in 1987.  I have referred earlier to the redeployment of staff from my Department to the Revenue Commissioners. While it would not be in order to debate taxation policy on this occasion, I would like to mention again the Government's commitment to improving the administration of the tax system.  The revenue task force who were set up on foot of the budget this year have now completed their training and have been in operation for some weeks.  It is confidently expected that the task force will achieve the target of collection of £10 million in tax arrears to which I referred in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>Also in the Revenue Vote there is a capital provision of £6.3 million for the purchase of a new computer system.  This will upgrade the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners mainframe computer system to provide for continued growth and enhancement of existing systems. Additional computer terminals are being acquired to enable staff to take advantage of new on-line services which will provide them with improved access to information. These developments are aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Revenue Commissioners' operations.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General Deputies will note that there is a 30 per cent increase in the provision for Fees to Counsel in subhead D.  This increase is due to the particularly heavy legal costs incurred in the Single European Act case in both the High and Supreme Courts.  The total legal cost to the Exchequer arising out of this <Col N="1380" /> case could be in excess of £250,000.  Quite apart from this, the practice of multiple representation in personal injury and other High Court cases is quite costly to the State &mdash; as it is to the private sector &mdash; and I am therefore, awaiting with interest the outcome of the Restrictive Practices Commission study of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>I should also like to comment on Vote 19 for the Farm Classification Office, which provides for the estimated expenditure of the Farm Tax Commissioner and the Farm Tax Tribunal in implementing the Farm Tax Act, 1985.  It is the view of the Government that farmers should be taxed in the same manner as other sections of the community, that is on actual income.  I, therefore, announced in my budget speech on 31 March that the farm tax was being discontinued from 1987 onwards and that legislation to give effect to this would be introduced by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Because of the discontinuance of the farm tax, the Estimate for the Vote is down to £2,471,000 from the 1986 outturn of £4,298,000.  This 1987 Estimate represents the actual cost of the Farm Classification Office up to 31 March 1987 together with the residual cost of winding down the office's operations, including the processing of appeals to the Farm Tax Commissioner and to the Farm Tax Tribunal, if such appeals arise, in relation to 1986 farm tax demands.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works will deal with the Vote for that office.  At the conclusion of this debate before I formally move the individual Votes, I will deal with as many as I can of the points raised by Deputies. I, therefore, recommend this group of Votes to the House for approval.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I like to be in order so, therefore, I want to establish the ground rules before I commence. I thank the Minister for coming into the House with these Estimates.  He is a very busy Minister at present.  The Finance Bill is being debated and I appreciate the pressures that are on his office.  I would like to comment very briefly on some of the issues he raised and then I would like to ask a series of questions with which I hope he will be able to help me.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear that the Minister's economic strategy is on target.  I will await with interest the figures that will be produced at the end of this month for the half year to see will both revenue and expenditure be absolutely on target.  I am interested in his reaffirmation of further expenditure cuts later this year after an examination of various programmes has been carried out by officials of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that his pay policy is in line with what he committed himself to in the budget speech.  I take issue with this.  I am worried about the progress the Minister has made in pay policy.  The guidelines laid down by the previous administration have been adhered to in theory but in practice disturbing developments have emerged in the ESB settlement, in Aer Lingus and in other suggested settlements.  It is not enough to theoretically stick to pay guidelines and then top up this by benefit in kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seriously worried about the ability of the Minister to hold to the pay guidelines in the public sector and I am seriously concerned he will not be able to hold the line when pay policy in the public service as distinct from the public sector is established.  I know talks are being engaged in on a continuing basis between the Minister, the Taoiseach and some of his colleagues, and representatives of the trade union movement. I wonder at the wisdom of moving back towards national pay rounds again.  We <Col N="1382" /> do not have a lot to go on except newspaper reports, but it seems it is now the policy of the Government to move back to a national pay round.  It seems also that part of this pay round would have some involvement by the trade union movement in the whole area of income tax reform and income tax relief and I am worried that the Minister will find himself with his pay guidelines seriously askew at the end of the year and facing very heavy bills in the next financial year. So far the Minister has succeeded in holding the line.  It is easy to hold the line during the summer when the public service unions are not seriously negotiating. Once the autumn comes if the kind of agreement which is emerging in significant areas of the public sector is reached as a national round the Minister will face demands in 1988 of £100 million and £120 million for what looked like very moderate agreements, at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success.  I will not go further on it because pay is a very sensitive area and one certainly cannot negotiate pay agreements by way of statements in the House.  However, I can see difficulty for the Minister.  It may not upset his budgetary profile to any great extent in 1987 if he can keep a national pay agreement back to the latter part of the year, but certainly it reduces his leeway in 1988.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister's comments on Government pay policy now.  Are the Government absolutely committed to a pay freeze for the remainder of this year, or are they using that statement as their initial negotiating position as they move towards a national pay round to be paid from 1 November of this year with the consequent full year effect in 1988?  I notice there is an item on the Estimate which deals with the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector and there is a figure of £100,000 included. Will the Minister now tell us what is the function of the review body?  Is it still operating to the terms of reference laid down by the previous administration?  Is their work real or theoretical at this stage and does the Minister intend to <Col N="1383" /> implement the preliminary report of the review body?  Is there any commitment to implement the full report when it comes to hand?  It is unfair to our public servants to have a review body on their remuneration if there is no intention to implement the findings of the review.  The preliminary report was available to the previous Government but it was not proper for us in the last days of an administration to take a decision which could have a profound effect on the pay policy of our successors.  I would like the Minister to deal with this item.  What are the Government's intentions on the preliminary report?  If the review body is to continue, and it seems from the Estimate that it will, what are now its terms of reference?</P>
    <P>There is a figure included for the civil service arbitration board.  When will the arbitrator be appointed and is it the Minister's intention to reappoint Mr. Hugh Geoghegan?  I note what the Minister said about transferring staff now that the Department of the Public Service has been amalgamated with the Department of Finance.  I hope that in that amalgamation the Department of the Public Service will be left with a real function and that it will be more than simply a payroll function.  I note that in the appointment of a new Secretary to the Department of Finance, the Top Level Appointments Committee was not used and I understand it was not used either when the previous Secretary of the Department of Defence was transferred to the Department of Finance to take charge of the public borrowing programme. I wonder is this correct and is this practice to continue?</P>
    <P>What is the status of the Top Level Appointments Commission now as it applies to the Department of Finance? Without naming names, will the Minister tell us the hierarchical structure now in the Department of Finance, how many Secretaries are there, and how many Deputy Secretaries?  I understand the Minister acquired four Deputy Secretaries from the Department of the Public Service, plus a clatter of Assistant <Col N="1384" /> Secretaries.  Will he explain to the laity exactly the new hierarchical structure in the new amalgamated Department?  Is it his intention to hold onto all the new Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries in that new amalgamated Department or does he plan to redeploy top level civil servants as well as redeploying the 40 reasonably junior staff to whom he referred?  Obviously pay policy, the control of pay and the control of numbers in the public sector is a major plank in the Minister's policy for 1987.</P>
    <P>Another major plank is the issue of interest rates.  I will not go back over the ground I covered already in the debate on the Finance Bill and which will be covered in greater detail in the debate next week.  I understand the Minister has a primary plan that exchange rates will be maintained and that there will be no devaluation of the Irish pound in the near future.  I was astounded to see a leading industrialist here openly advocating devaluation of the Irish pound recently. If people of high credibility &mdash; and the person who was involved in speculation is a man of very high credibility, a man who has absolute access to Minister of whatever administration happens to be in power and he serves on the boards of State bodies &mdash; have submissions to make on exchange rates they should make them privately to the Minister and to the banks. There are two possible effects which can result if credibility is given to theories on devaluation.</P>
    <P>First, the flow of money which is going to fund that portion of our domestic debt that is funded from abroad will stop.  I am sure the Minister has figures available, but from reading the newspapers it seems that £250 million or £300 million has come in and been invested in Government paper by citizens of West Germany, the UK and possibly Denmark.  If there is any speculation of a devaluation of the IR£ not alone will that source of investment dry up for the Government but what is here will be cashed in quickly and moved out.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and again I speak from experience, if the trading sector of the economy believes that exchange rate <Col N="1385" /> policy will not be maintained there is tendency to take advantage by leading and lagging purchasing of currency.  We have seen that previously.  I would like the Minister to take this opportunity of making a categorical statement once again on exchange rate policy, and the message should go out from this House that people who speculate on our policy on exchange rates at the moment could do serious damage to Exchequer funding for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a number of points in connection with the Board of Works, some of a general nature, some of a particular nature.  I welcome the Minister of State and would be glad to listen to him. Could he say something in greater detail about the Government's policy on decentralisation? The amount of money provided in the Estimate is quite small and could not possibly fund the work which has been announced.  What is the plan for the next three years?  What kind of capital investment are we talking about in 1988, 1989 and 1990?  If the locations selected are the only locations which civil servants will be decentralised or if the selection of the locations which will be familiar to many people in the House from a previous announcement on decentralisation are still under consideration, which Departments are being considered for permanent movement to places beyond Inchicore?</P>
    <P>What is the position about arterial drainage?  The previous administration decided that arterial drainage would be a matter for the Department of Agriculture. Has this decision changed?  From the Estimate it seems that it has.  There are quite significant sums of money for arterial drainage in the Estimate.  What is the status of those rivers to which the previous Government had committed themselves?  Their priority listing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know whether the Minister for Agriculture is responsible now but if the Minister gets the opportunity he might ask him whether the Mulcaire or the Suir will get priority now.  Is the Mulcaire still at the top of the list or is the Suir at the top of the list?  Very little money is put in for new work.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> From the figure that is included it looks very like that.  A figure of £50,000 is included for comprehensive drainage surveys including cost benefit investigations.  Will the Minister of State inform the House as to what comprehensive drainage surveys are being undertaken and on what rivers in 1987?  What cost benefit investigations are being undertaken and on what rivers? Does the priority on design hold to the decision taken by the previous Government? Does priority on drainage work follow the priority on design which was laid down by the previous Government?</P>
      <P>Dealing with the OPW, I am not point scoring; this is for information purposes, under subhead E &mdash; new building works alterations, and additions&mdash;will the Minister give an indication of what is involved in the £8,400,008 which is being spent for works for the Department of Justice? Will this enable the Garda station building programme to be continued at the level promised to the Garda representative bodies?  Is enough provided in the Estimate to complete works which are progressing at the moment or is money included for new starts in 1987? If so, could the Minister inform us of what new starts will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on the restoration of Dublin Castle and the building of the conference hall.  I notice that provision has gone from £2,730,000 to £8,521,000, a significant increase.  I presume that the programme has got to the stage where significant sums of money can be spent satisfactorily on the site.  I would like the Minister <Col N="1387" /> to give us a progress report of what is happening in Dublin Castle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Finally, I thank the Minister for explaining his intent in the national lottery. Significant sums of money are now accruing.  I know that percentages have been changed but obviously if there is more money to distribute any leeway which is found necessary to be made up can be made up.  I would like the Minister to give a commitment that the extra revenue accruing to the national lottery will not simply be subsumed into central funds but will be used and will be disbursed for youth and sport, for health matters and for arts and culture.  I hope moneys expended for the Department of Health are not simply going to be thrown into the general Health Estimate but that specific extra work will be provided.  I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for calling my attention to the time.  I did not realise that we were so confined tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of tax collection has been raised here time and again and the Minister dealt with it last night.  I notice that in the Estimate for the Revenue Commissioners there is a token estimate of £1,000 for consultancy services.  Where there is widespread dissatisfaction with the efficacy of the Revenue Commissioners in collecting tax at the moment, is it not time moneys were provided to bring in outside expertise to examine the difficulties of which we are all aware, which have been going on over a number of years and which seem to be no nearer solution?  If the expertise existed internally I do not think we would have the constant round of questions, the constant round of comment and reassurance on the part of successive Ministers <Col N="1388" /> for Finance that all is well and that we are simply misreading the balance sheet. I would like the Minister to have a look at this, to encourage the Revenue Commissioners to avail of the expertise available across a whole range of services which would be of benefit to them.</P>
    <P>We shall have plenty of time to discuss finance policy next week on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  I should like to thank the Minister again for having given me the opportunity of making those few short comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I have had a full day and I want to finish reasonably early this evening.  I do not want to delay anybody unduly.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things I wanted to raise with the Minister in relation to the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems to me to echo what Deputy Noonan has just said, that there is a widespread feeling that the Revenue Commissioners are not very efficiently organised, that they are not coming to grips with their task as well as they might.  Although it is easy to criticise from the outside as a layman &mdash; to use Deputy Noonan's phrase about the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; nonetheless one gets the feeling there is an opening for the employment of consultants, or a radical rethinking on the operations of the Revenue Commissioners.  I fully agree with what Deputy Noonan has said in relation to the desirability of looking again at their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two points in particular strike me. There has been frequent criticism &mdash; at this stage it is classical &mdash; that the relationship between the assessments branch or function of the Revenue Commissioners and their collection function seems to be somewhat disjointed. Although I appreciate the Minister talked about the computerisation of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; and it may be that that will assist in co-oridnating their two functions &mdash; still I have misgivings that there is some kind of administrative hiatus between assessing tax and collecting it.  In addition to all the inefficiencies, loss of revenue and delay in collecting revenue which one can readily <Col N="1389" /> imagine would flow from such a disjointed approach it also gives rise to figures which, on occasion, appear to be scandalous and hard to defend in relation to uncollected taxes.  From some of those figures sometimes trotted out in this House &mdash; and I know how highly artificial they are &mdash; it seems there is not a well recognised or understood system of writing off bad debts by the revenue such as the ordinary layman would be acquainted with.</P>
    <P>I have to tell the Minister that, in his absence one day, the Tánaiste was taking questions on his behalf.  I asked on that occasion whether it was desirable, for instance, that directives which issue from the Revenue Commissioners to their collecting staff should not go before the Minister for his approval and assessment, so that he could keep in touch with the collection policies, those in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the like and policies in relation to tax collection priorities.  On that occasion the Tánaiste indicated that, for instance, the circular which was then the subject of some controversy in the newspapers and a subsequent circular referred to in this House, had not been viewed in the Minister's Department, that these were internal matters for the board of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with themselves. The Tánaiste agreed with my suggestion. I do not know whether he was purporting to bind the Minister policywise but he did agree it was desirable that the Department of Finance should be intimately aware of the policy decisions being taken by the Revenue Commissioners and should be consulted in relation to them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to what I want to make by way of a more general point.  To a large degree the Revenue Commissioners, once appointed, are independent in their functions and to some extent their independence is a very valuable thing.  However, I wonder whether we are not now reaching the stage at which we should have what they have in the Dominion of Canada, that is, a system under which the Revenue Commissioners are not simply an independent part of the Canadian Minister for <Col N="1390" /> Finance's portfolio but are more than that &mdash; they are represented at Cabinet level by a separate Minister called the Minister for National Revenue.  It seems to me there is a lot to be said for having ministerial responsibility for tax collection as well as tax expenditure.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind what the Tánaiste said at least on the occasion he was answering for the Minister, to some extent there appears to be a political dislocation, an absence of responsibility or direct control on the part of the Minister for Finance over the activities of the Revenue Commissioners. To be brief on that point, it seems to me the Revenue Commissioners need a detailed review.  They did not get a detailed review in the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation.  It is noteworthy that the Revenue Commissioners' responses to the commission &mdash; reading between the lines of the commission's report &mdash; were defensive and hardly outgoing toward the commission on some occasions.  It appeared that existing procedure and practices were defended almost as a knee-jerk reaction when innovation was adumbrated by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>I am posing the question whether we have reached the time when the Revenue Commissioners should be examined as to whether they are functioning efficiently. In that context I re-echo what Deputy Noonan said, that to provide £1,000 for consultancy services in an area which could be of vital importance in terms of improving Government finances seems to be somewhat niggardly compared with the allocations for consultancy fees in other areas.  I want to sound a note of warning that I detect a conservatism in the Revenue Commissioners' outlook on their functions which alarms me slightly.</P>
    <P>I also want to put to the Minister that the time has certainly come for a radical review of the law in relation to customs and excise.  I had some dealings with it in a legal capacity on occasions.  It was so antiquated, so unworkable in that field, the law on which it is based is so old, so Victorian in concept, and it should not be beyond the capacity of the parliamentary draftsman, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1391" /> themselves, or whoever, to revise the law in relation to customs and excise and to modernise the powers contained therein, rendering it more applicable to the early years of the 21st century rather than the dying years of the 19th century to which it seems to be best suited as at present drafted.</P>
    <P>One of the Votes being dealt with here this evening is that in respect of the Government Publications Office.  I want to make a minor point in relation to that. The backlog in relation to the production of bound volumes of Statutes in both Irish and English is now well known.  In recent weeks the Government Publications Office have come up with a copy of the 1980 Statutes in English and Irish.  They fill two volumes.  It is curious that on this occasion the bargain price being charged for the bound volumes in English and Irish is £92.50.  It is curious that the bound volume in English only, when issued in 1981 or 1982, cost £18.  It makes me wonder is there any political will at all to keep the Statutes up to date in that form. It appears they are now becoming so prohibitively expensive, they are so far behind times, it is likely that somebody at some stage will call a halt to their production in their present form.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise is in relation to the moneys raised under the national lottery.  I appreciate that in times of financial crisis such as these we are now experiencing the availability of £7 million to the Minister is important. The decision to be taken in relation to it are ones which undoubtedly will have the call of many deserving causes.  This morning in another context in this House I raised the issue of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  That body has been funded to the tune of about £2.5 million or £3 million each year.  It has been effectively mothballed so far as compensating victims of violence for the general damage they suffer is concerned. I raised this morning, and I put it again to the Minister for Finance, the question whether a society which organises a fund to compensate persons injured in road traffic accidents, whether they be drivers <Col N="1392" /> of cars insured under the motor insurance law or uninsured under the motor insurance bureau agreement, and at the same time scraps or mothballs the tribunal which compensates innocent victims of violent crime has not got its priorities very wrong.  I ask the Minister, in the context of the £7 million which is subscribed by people to a lottery, to make it, or some portion of it, available to compensate the victims of crime because they have not been compensated since that tribunal was effectively wound up by the last Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister if the withholding tax will apply to the servicing of the national debt and the services of the Government stockbroker and stockbrokers and money brokers generally who work for the Government.  I have had queries on that matter from people who are, and people who are not, affected.  They see those as professional fees analogous to the ones provided for in the withholding tax in the Finance Bill. They want to know whether this function, which is a professional service rendered for the State, will be subject to the withholding tax.  I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say in reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of specific items raised by the Minister in his introductory speech.  I support him in the merging of the Departments of Finance and the Public Service. This will lead unquestionably to a more coherent policy on the public service pay side.  Provided there is some imagination, though there is not much of it in the Department of Finance, on the training side and on the industrial relations side and provided the Department of the Public Service subsumed will not be totally emasculated by the Department of Finance as is their tendency whenever they get their hands on other Government Departments, the marriage can be fruitful.  There is no reason it should not be fruitful.  Provided the Department of the Public Service are not absorbed into a mere service division personnelwise of the Department of Finance, the integration, co-ordination and functional <Col N="1393" /> development of that critical area of our public service could expand and develop and could play a very dynamic role.  I favour integration in that regard just as I have favoured integration between the training side of the Civil Service and the Institute of Public Administration because there is limited availability of skills in the public sector even on the training side.  Therefore those that are there must be carefully husbanded and expanded.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the first officers have been redeployed from his Department as a result of reorganisation and that they have been assigned to the office of the Revenue Commissioners and to the Department of Social Welfare.  The officers concerned have my sympathy because frequently people are redeployed in the public sector without any real assessment of their capacity to make yet another contribution in yet another area.  Very often they are told they are being transferred and they have to go. Whether they go in a moralised or a demoralised state is very often open to question.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the question of the embargo as applied to the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  As a public representative, I do not necessarily hold the view that all areas of the Revenue Commissioners are grossly overstretched. That would be a very serious over statement but there is an absolute need to examine the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  They have managed to fend off successive Ministers and administrations with great dexterity and they pride themselves in that capacity.  I very seriously question the effectiveness and the organisation of 7,000 staff in Revenue and the extent to which they are making a real contribution in the elementary work they do, that of tax collection and ensuring that unpaid taxes in particular are collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister said that on a paper basis only £700 million was owing in PAYE contributions &mdash; we could work out the balances as far back as 1974 and <Col N="1394" /> I got many memoranda when in Government showing how the balances progressed from opening balances to collected amounts &mdash; he would simultaneously have to declare a national emergency because the other sectors of the community would be in a state of insipient revolution.  For all practical purposes whole areas of revenue collection have broken down.  To transfer 42 staff from the Minister's Department, some to the Revenue Commissioners and some to the Department of Social Welfare, with the prospect that they might collect £10 million between July and the end of the year is ludicrous.  You would lose that amount in a tot on the Revenue computer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any to be lost I would be glad to find it &mdash; even £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I advocated in the course of the general election that we might set up an office of revenue collection. I had close associations with some of the Revenue Commissioners particularly around 1970 when they stood by the country when they were badly needed and when their independence was sorely threatened.  I have great admiration for them but I think they should be abolished forthwith provided we, the politicians, keep our hands off the revenue collection procedure and stop putting prospective control over them a matter of grave political scandal.  There is not at present what I would call true political accountability.  As I said to the Minister on the Finance Vote, his duties are so multiple and the discharge of them is so onerous that by the time he sits across the table from the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps once a month, and asks what is going on in this sector, and why revenue trends have slipped, eminently reasonable and eminently courteous and serious contributions are no longer enough.  We have a major crisis because the public have no confidence in our taxation system.  It is not the fault of the Revenue Commissioners that our tax <Col N="1395" /> system is a hodge podge of developmental, incremental accumulations of tax revenue bits and pieces, but it is the fault of the political system.  I firmly believe that we must abolish the Revenue Commissioners, and bring them into departmental day-to-day accountability and have ministerial control over the operation on a day-to-day basis.  I have no doubt that at the end of his term of office the Minister will not stand the slightest prospect of being re-elected. This is one of the drawbacks he will have to be prepared for, of course, I would pay him an enhanced Finance salary.  We must face this situation, and I say that as one who wants to refrain, and has always refrained, from making representations to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Apart from the 42 transferees &mdash; God help us &mdash; the Minister has not given any information about the application of the embargo to the Revenue Commissioners. I would not dream of having the embargo applied to the Revenue Commissioners. The position is too serious to apply a blanket embargo to the Revenue Commissioners. If any area of State expenditure should be totally exempt it should be the Revenue Commissioners because flexibility is required right down the line in that office.  The purpose of the Revenue Commissioners is to get in money to run this God-forsaken country and ensure that everybody pays their taxes. As I said, I would immediately exempt the Revenue Commissioners from the public service embargo and I would be very ruthless with internal industrial relations reactions.  I know some of the things they get up to and we would require a very tough régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What broke my heart when I was Minister for Social Welfare was the remoteness of the Revenue Commissioners.  It was as if they were on another planet. People practically knelt in front of Aras Mhic Dhiarmada when the Revenue Commissioners were mentioned, at the prospect of getting a few bob into the social insurance fund.  Our social insurance fund was facing annihilation if we did not get money from the Revenue <Col N="1396" /> Commissioners, the £900 million needed for social welfare.  What are we doing now?  The Minister is providing a new computer system costing £6½ million.  I would be prepared to bet all the points Ireland did not score in the World Cup that that computer is not matched up to the social welfare machine.  The Minister could spend another £6½ million and it still would not be matched up.  Like certain people, Revenue and Social Welfare never seem to be compatible.  Is there any hope that the main frame computer system will be integrated directly into the Social Welfare computer system on which we have spent millions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy spent four years there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent four years there with an outstanding public servant, the secretary of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>And computers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That man knows more about computerisation and taught me more than I ever hoped to know, as did another outstanding public officer, the Assistant Secretary, who has left the public service and gone into one of the financial service companies.  He, too, broke his heart trying to see if there was any prospect of marrying the two systems. Unless we manage to do that, huge areas of public expenditure in terms of taxation and expenditure on the social welfare side, there is no prospect of having an integrated system for a mere three and a half million people.  We are not a country of multiple ethnic races, multiple languages and income profiles; therefore it is not beyond our capacity to do this job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention the farm classification office.  Is it true that the records are being destroyed?  We need a straight answer to that.  If it is, it is a national scandal.  I would not be a bit surprised if they were being destroyed.  I have heard rumours that this material was being dumped.  How many farm profile forms <Col N="1397" /> have gone out under the alternative taxation measures being proposed by the Minister?  I would not be surprised if nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>There are a few other brief comments I wish to make on the Minister's statement, particularly the provision for the distribution of the surplus of the net proceeds from the national lottery.  I notice the Minister is giving £2.1 million to projects in the health area.  That money is already spoken for &mdash; £500,000 for the AIDS programme and the other £1.6 million will be just enough to keep the Health Education Bureau afloat until the end of the year.  That £2.1 million was taken from the budget provision of the former Government and transferred to the national lottery.  It is true that there will be another £14 million available by way of net surplus to the Government. Do we have to wait until next Friday to learn how that money will be distributed? It should be distributed now.  If a few million pounds of that money were given to the health areas which are critically affected by the current cutbacks, particularly the community health areas, a lot of the appalling hardship being suffered by families, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area on the mentally handicapped side, could be alleviated forthwith and this would take some of the poor law smell away from the odium of this House. I strongly urge the Minister to review the overall situation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from time to tiem, and denied, that the Revenue Commissioners make subventions of one kind or another in respect of information received relating to alleged revenue offences.  We need to put that suggestion to bed or have it confirmed because there seems to be some confusion among officials on the accounting side as to what is happening.  The Minister should clarify that matter in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I have been critical from time to time of the role of the Revenue Commissioners because there is a serious crisis in Government in regard to revenue collection. There is a crisis of organisation <Col N="1398" /> more than anything else.  The public servants involved have my admiration because they have to tolerate the likes of us who change our minds from budget to budget as to the system of collection and the form of taxation we want.  Those officials every 12 months have to get involved in new areas of taxation.  It must be a most frustrating exercise for any public official but that is not to give an exemption to the fact that the system has become so decrepit and mismanaged, largely because of political action, that the revenue is not coming in as it should. As a consequence the financing of essential social services is gravely affected.  A root and branch restructuring of the Revenue Commissioners under the various Finance Acts, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act and under the Constitution is needed.  In my view that would be welcomed by the majority of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and officials in the Department of Finance. Certainly, it would be welcome in the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to give particulars of expenditure by the Office of Public Works this year on the basis of the programme format contained in the Appendix to the Estimate for Vote 10 in the Book of Revised Estimates. Some changes have been made in the layout of the Estimate itself to give more information to Deputies, and to the public, about the activities of the office. The effect of these changes is that parks, harbours and waterways now have individual current subheads whereas, previously, they were grouped under the general maintenance provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Programme 1 &mdash; the Accommodation Programme &mdash; is by far the largest of the OPW programmes and a sum of £73,205,000 is sought for 1987.  The largest entity within this programme is the capital building programme which accounts for £26,754,000.  The building programme includes for both the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing ones.  These two aspects are exemplified in major projects <Col N="1399" /> now in progress at Dublin Castle, namely the construction of a new international conference centre, and the extensive restoration and development of existing buildings.  These works are due to be completed in time for Ireland's next Presidency of the EC in 1990.</P>
    <P>It is of interest to note that during the course of the site excavations at Dublin Castle, important ancient historical structures were uncovered.  In order to ensure that these structures are preserved the scheme for the restoration and development has been amended and some of the structures found have been incorporated into the scheme as features which will be made available for public viewing. Deputy Noonan asked for a progress report on this project and I will endeavour to accommodate him.</P>
    <P>New Government offices have been completed and occupied in Sligo this year.  Staff from eight different Departments are now housed in the new building and it is hoped that the rationalising of Government services in this manner will result in a better and more efficient service to the public.</P>
    <P>The Government decided at the end of April last to reactivate immediately the programme for the decentralisation of certain Government services of the Departments of Agriculture, Defence, Environment and Social Welfare to the towns of Cavan, Galway, Ballina and Sligo respectively.  It is envisaged that the accommodation will be provided by private interests on the basis that they will meet all building costs and lease the properties to the State with an option to purchase.  The developments will be constructed on sites in public ownership.</P>
    <P>I am sure this decision has come as no surprise in the light of the Government's commitment to an active regional policy. We have been stressing for many years the need to initiate positive action which would go some way towards redressing the imbalance of development between Dublin and the rest of the country.  It is a fact that the east coast of the country around Dublin has been developed more than other regions and the concentration <Col N="1400" /> of public services in Dublin contributes to this situation.  The Government recognise this imbalance and intend that this trend be reversed in so far as is feasible by a decentralisation programme in respect of certain State services.</P>
    <P>Not alone will such a programme allow public service personnel, if they so desire, to return to their native regions but it will also give a much needed and timely boost to the construction industry.  It will foster the development of local service industries to cater for the demands which will be created by such a move and will be of tremendous benefit to the regions chosen.</P>
    <P>My Office is proceeding with the necessary arrangements and I am happy to say that there has been a very strong response to the initial advertisement in the newspapers. We are pressing ahead to the next stage, with a view to having schemes started as soon as possible.  The Government provided £1 million in the budget to accommodate the necessary expenses incurred in promoting, managing and bringing the initial part of this excellent programme to commencement stage.</P>
    <P>Approximately £10 million will be spent out of the OPW Vote on building work for the Department of Justice.  New or improved accommodation for the Garda accounts for £5.3 million of this programme.  New District Headquarters and Garda stations at Tallaght, Dungarvan, Belmullet, Swinford, Sligo, Patrickswell and Aglish in Waterford have been completed during the past 12 months.  Work is in progress at Roxboro Road in Limerick, Oughterard, Ennis, Tuam, Naas, Lucan, Ashbourne, Ardagh and Tramore.  Tenders have been invited for a new divisional headquarters at Letterkenny and among major projects at an advanced stage of planning are Shankill, Tipperary, Watercourse Road and Togher in Cork, and the largest regional Garda project undertaken to date, a new divisional headquarters at Anglesea Street, Cork to replace the old station at Union Quay.</P>

      <P>Work is nearing completion on a further stage of the Garda Headquarters at the Depot in the Phoenix Park which will house various services including the forensic unit.  Also a new building for court staff at Inns Quay on the site of the former Four Courts Hotel is now practically completed and will be occupied on a phased basis over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works continue also to provide and maintain accommodation for embassy staff abroad and during 1986 a new embassy complex was completed and occupied in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  The accommodation consists of a chancery and residential accommodation for the ambassador and other essential staff.</P>
      <P>The commissioners' conservationist role is reflected in the provisions for the restoration of stonework at the Registry of Deeds and the Custom House.  The work of restoring the stonework in the Custom House is progressing well and an improvement can already be noticed in the areas where work is completed. Indeed, I was glad to have the opportunity lately to observe at first hand the work which is being done.</P>
      <P>Copies of the new works list have been circulated to Deputies.  I have highlighted some of the major building projects being undertaken by the commissioners and do not propose to go through the full list.  If any Deputy has a query relating to a particular project I will try to provide the information later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rest of Programme 1 is concerned with the routine costs arising on the extensive property portfolio for which the Office is responsible on behalf of the State.  Office accommodation accounts for a large part of the total &mdash; there are approximately three million square feet of office space in the OPW's care in Dublin alone, but the Office's responsibilities include other buildings such as Garda stations and employment exchanges.  Much of the total holding is State-owned but there is also a substantial proportion held on lease, and a sum of £20,049,000 is being sought in the current year to cover rents.  The outgoings on <Col N="1402" /> maintenance and supplies are estimated at £14,750,000 and fuel and electricity are expected to account for £8,484,000.</P>
    <P>Programmes 2 and 4 provide, respectively, for the survey and design, construction and maintenance of arterial drainage and embankment schemes, and the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant, machinery and stores required in connection with these and other engineering services of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>A total of £10,520,000 is sought for Programme 2.  A sum of £250,000 is required in 1987 under subhead L.1 for survey and design work on four new arterial drainage schemes, viz. the Mulcaire, the Owenmore, the Suir and the Dunkellin and for hydrometric survey work involving the collection and analysis of data on many rivers throughout the country.  This survey work is a valuable service providing much useful information on the country's water resources.</P>
    <P>On the construction side which is funded by subhead L.2, the reduction by some £3 million in the 1987 provision, compared with last year's outturn, reflects the fact that major schemes on the Boyne, Maigue and Corrib-Mask-Robe rivers have been completed.  This year sees the continuation of works on the Boyle, Bonet and Monaghan Blackwater for which a total of £6,770,000 is sought. Deputies will be aware that the Monaghan Blackwater scheme is a practical demonstration of cross Border co-operation, the success of which, I am happy to report, is reflected in the satisfactory progress of the works on both sides of the Border.  The commissioners are fully aware that there can be no question of the allocation being exceeded and that all necessary steps must be taken to ensure that budgetary targets for the construction works are met.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of completed arterial drainage and embankment schemes is met from subhead L.3 and an amount of £3,500,000 is sought for this service in 1987.  This allocation shows a modest increase on the 1986 outturn but, bearing in mind that significant expenditure will be incurred on maintenance of the three <Col N="1403" /> recently completed schemes, it will be abundantly clear that there is an overriding necessity to ensure that economies are effected in this service.</P>
    <P>Programme 4 provides for the necessary back-up of the arterial drainage and other engineering services undertaken by OPW in terms of purchase of plant and machinery, purchase of stores and payment of staff in the central engineering workshops in Inchicore.  These workshops provide a wide range of engineering skills and equipment which are made available, countrywide, to the office's engineering fleet.  A total of £1,578,000 is sought for this service in 1987.</P>
    <P>Programme 3 covers marine works and a sum of £160,000 is sought to complete new harbour facilities at Roonagh Point, County Mayo, which involve the provision of a landing pier, access road and parking area.  These new facilities are an important step towards improving the communications infrastructure for the islands off the west coast as Roonagh is the mainland pier serving Clare Island where improved landing facilities were provided by the commissioners some years ago.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of the three State harbours at Howth, Dunmore East and Dun Laoghaire, together with a number of small piers, navigational lights and beacons around our coasts, will require, in 1987, a sum estimated at £1,779,000.</P>
    <P>A sum of £173,000 is sought for the ongoing maintenance of coast protection schemes completed by the commissioners pursuant to the Coast Protection Act, 1963, and for the undertaking of a sampling survey of material in offshore banks in connection with the proposed new coast protection scheme for Rosslare Strand.  The ongoing task of maintaining the direct sea defences at Rosslare Strand will continue in 1987 in order to prevent damage to valuable property at this important tourist location.</P>
    <P>Programme 5 covers the parks and national monuments work of the office. The provision of £3,833,000 sought under subhead G covers the maintenance of <Col N="1404" /> national parks, national historic parks and other gardens and properties.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national parks are an essential part of our heritage.  They are among 3,000 protected areas listed by the UN and although conservation is the overriding objective, the other main aim is to provide visitor facilities in the parks so that the public can appreciate this heritage.</P>
    <P>There are three national parks in Ireland which comply with the criteria set down for such parks; these are Killarney, Glenveagh and Connemara.  A start has been made on the establishment of a fourth national park in the Burren, County Clare.</P>
    <P>Glenveagh National Park was officially opened to the public in July last year and attracted a total of 85,000 visitors.  This magnificant park contains a splendid new visitor centre incorporating an audiovisual theatre, a restaurant and exhibition areas.  Glenveagh Castle was officially opened to the public in 1986; the refurbishment works are not yet completed and will continue throughout this year.</P>
    <P>Killarney, which includes the three famous lakes, was our first national park. It is now well established but further improvements and extensions are made as resources permit.  This year I expect to officially open Knockreer House and the interpretive facilities which have been provided there for the public.</P>
    <P>There are four parks in the care of the Commissioners of Public Works which comply with the accepted definition of national historic parks.  These are Derrynane, St. Enda's, Kilkenny Castle Park and Phoenix Park.  In 1986 a management plan for the Phoenix Park was launched. The plan officially designates the park as a national historic park and recognises the importance of its historic buildings and landscape and its value as a centre for both wildlife and recreation.  The management objectives are set out in the plan and work is well under way towards achieving those ends.  A massive tree planting programme is continuing and will see 20,000 new trees planted by the end of the decade.  Further road closures and traffic controls will be implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> It is also proposed to restore the park's unique gas lighting system and work will commence this year.  Management plans are also being prepared for the other properties under the control of the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The third category includes such properties as St. Stephen's Green and Garnish Island and it also covers the cost of maintaining the Glebe Gallery, County Donegal. The world famous artist Derek Hill donated his properly at Churchill, Co. Donegal, and his collection of paintings and other works of art to the State.  A gallery was created from one of the outbuildings in order to display the paintings and other objects and works were carried out to the house itself to make it suitable for the public to visit it.  The gallery was opened to the public in 1983 and the house will be officially opened in July. This will coincide with the unveiling of an exhibition of the paintings of Derek Hill to celebrate his 70th birthday.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Estimate for the National Monuments Branch for which a provision of £3,551,000 is sought.  In this, the European year of the Environment, it is appropriate to say a few words about the contribution which the Office of Public Works make to the conservation and preservation of our built heritage, and which they have been making for over 100 years now.  That contribution began when, following the passing of the Irish Church Act of 1869, a number of ancient church properties were vested in the Commissioners of Public Works. Today, there are over 700 national monuments in the direct care of the commissioners and over 2,000 other monuments have been afforded special protection under the National Monuments Acts.  In all decades, the amount of work which could be done was limited by available finance and difficult choices had to be made when selecting which of our rich collection of ancient burial mounds, castles, abbeys, churches, round towers and archaeological sites would receive funds for conservation. Much has been done.  Much yet needs to be done.  At times the task appears daunting but the attitude and expertise <Col N="1406" /> which the office have built up over the years gives them the confidence to face the challenge with pride.  In the parks and monuments service, conservation is a way of life.  The staff are involved in many specialist areas and all are dedicated to the achievement of one goal, namely, the preservation of our historic built heritage. They are the recognised experts in the field of conservation, using old skills and modern, but appropriate, technology and methods to ensure that the monuments which were created by our ancestors, in some cases over 5,000 years ago, will be passed on to future generations to appreciate and admire.</P>
    <P>This year, major projects will be carried out at some 30 of our national monuments sites and minor conservation and maintenance works will be carried out at many hundred others by a trained workforce of about 200.  Most notable amongst the major projects are the restoration of Cormac's Chapel at the Rock of Cashel, the conservation of grave slabs and the provision of visitor facilities at Clonmacnoise, interpretive exhibitions at Boyle Abbey, County Roscommon and Aughnanure Castle, County Galway.  I am pleased to announce that approximately ten acres of amenity land, which will comprise a future park adjoining the Casino, Marino, have been acquired and enclosing works have commenced there preparatory to landscaping the entire site.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased to reiterate the decision announced by the Minister for Finance recently that the Government will provide funds of £1 million over the next four to five years for Kilmainham Jail, to be used for conservation of the fabric of the building and for the provision of improved exhibition and visitor facilities.  This year a provision of £200,000 has been designated to enable a start to be made on the programme.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, recognising that the most effective tool in the preservation of our monuments is a public well informed of the significance and importance of our antiquities, embarked on a programme some years <Col N="1407" /> ago for the provision of interpretive visitor centres at our better known monuments. This continues apace and this year a valuable addition will be made to the 15 sites at which visitor services are already in place.  I speak of Glendalough, County Wicklow, where a £1 million development will be completed shortly to provide interpretive facilities consisting of guided tours, exhibition and audiovisual presentation for this very important and popular collection of national monuments.  I expect that this centre will be opened to a limited extent to the public later this year and that it will be in full operation in 1988.</P>
    <P>I might mention that, exclusive of Kilmainham Jail, the number of visitors who paid admission fees for interpretive service in 1986 was 335,674.  Despite the fact that 1986 was recognised as a very poor tourist year, these attendances represented a reduction of only 5 per cent on the previous year and otherwise, were the highest yet recorded this decade.  The guide information service helps to promote the attraction of the sites for visitors by highlighting their cultural and educational aspects.  The service, which will employ over 50 persons in the current tourist season, is self-financing.</P>
    <P>This year post excavation work is being carried out on the artefacts and materials recovered during major archaeological excavation completed at Dublin Castle earlier this year.  This years work will be concentrated on researching medieval and post medieval ceramics, analysing botanical remains and interpreting Viking levels.  The ceramics include pieces imported from throughout Europe and the Islamic world and the botanical research is revealing information about the diet of the Viking inhabitants.  Interestingly, theirs was a high fibre diet.  As I mentioned earlier some of the features revealed by the excavation are being retained and will, in due course, be accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included here for grants totalling £80,000 for archaeological research purposes made in consultation with the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The archaeological survey of the country, the purpose of which is to locate and record all monuments so as to enable a comprehensive policy for their protection to be formulated, will make steady progress during 1987.  Sites and monuments record for about seven counties are expected to be produced this year bring the total completed so far to 12.  Inventories, which are descriptive, mapped records and which follow the completion of sites and monuments records, have been published for two counties and this year, a further county, namely County Meath, will be issued.</P>
    <P>The special survey of medieval and plantation towns is also making steady progress and this year reports on at least six counties will be completed and made available to the relevant planning authorties to enable them to take account of archaeological factors when drawing up development plans and when considering planning applications.  This will bring the number of completed counties to 13.  The remaining counties should be completed in 1988.</P>
    <P>A pilot survey of thatched houses in County Dublin has been completed and results are being studied with a view to devising a policy for the preservation of this threatened part of our vernacular heritage.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, new legislation which will provide better protection for our heritage than exists at present is currently before the House.  The Commissioners of Public Works have prime responsibility for that heritage.</P>
    <P>I trust that this necessarily fairly long account of the range of works, for which £3,551,000 is sought this year for the National Monuments Service, will serve to illustate how these necessary ongoing programmes will conserve and preserve our national heritage for present and future generations.</P>
    <P>Programme 6 covers Inland Waterways and the provision of £2,399,000 sought this year will cover expenditure on the Shannon navigation, for which the commissioners have had responsibility for many years, and also expenditure on the Royal and Grand Canals, including <Col N="1409" /> the Barrow navigation, which were transferred to the care of the Commissioners last year under the Canals Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>The development of the canals so that their full recreational and amenity value for the general public can be realised represents a major challenge, but it is one to which I am certain my office can respond.  The planning consultants retained by the commissioners to carry out a study of the canals have completed the study and their report, which will contain detailed proposals for the future development and management of the canals will be available shortly.  It is clear from the study that a significant level of co-operation between the Office of Public Works, other State bodies, local authorities and the many voluntary and community groups with an interest in the canals will be rquired in any programme for their future development.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, priority is being given to increased maintenance work such as dredging, weed control, improved maintenance of the canal banks and replacement of lock gates.  To this end, the sum of £1,589,000 is included under Sùbhead H of the Estimate for maintenance work on the canals.  This figure represents an increase of approximately 25 per cent on the amount spent on maintenance of the canals in 1986 and is a clear indication of the importance which is attached to dealing with the backlog of maintenance which had built up in the years prior to the commissioners taking them over.  The recent re-opening of the Naas branch of the Grand Canal, following a programme of extensive dredging, lock gate replacement and tree planting along the banks, has provided an additional pleasant amenity for the people of the area and a further stretch of navigable waterway for boat users to enjoy.  I hope that it is but the first of many such restoration projects on the canals which my office will complete.</P>
    <P>The balance of the Subhead H provision, £690,000, will be spent on the maintenance of the Shannon Navigation. Pleasure cruising on the Shannon has developed into one of the country's major tourist attractions and maintenance work <Col N="1410" /> on the various harbours, sluices, locks and other navigation facilities, which is carried out on a year round basis, ensures that the highest standards are maintained at all times.  In addition to this maintenance work, the commissioners will continue their programme of new development works on the Shannon this year, with continued work on the extension of Lecarrow Harbour, with further improvements at Hudson's Bay and with the commencement of work on new mooring facilities at Galey Bay on Lough Ree.  These developments undoubtedly will increase further the popularity of this area with boat users.</P>
    <P>Programme 7 covers the President's household staff for which an amount of £86,000 is sought this year.</P>
    <P>The administration of the office is covered in Programme 8 for which a sum of £14,061,000 is sought.  This includes the salaries and wages of the staff as well as official travel and staff training and development.  Deputies will note that the overall amount sought is down on last year's outturn, which reflects a reduction in staffing levels within the office.</P>
    <P>Programme 9 covers income and it will be seen that receipts, expected this year to be £6,800,000, will be down substantially on last year's outturn.  One of the main reasons for this decrease is that the OPW are no longer required to seek recoupment from county councils of expenditure incurred on the maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, it is, I think, worthy of mention that the office also undertakes for other Departments, works such as prisons, fishery facilities and some court work which are funded from outside of Vote 10.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be happy to note any comments Deputies may wish to make on the Office of Public Works Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the public service aspect of the Estimate, I am disappointed at the apparent neglect in this part of the Vote, and in the Minister's speech.  I checked the Estimate published in January and I find that it was for a sum of <Col N="1411" /> £12 million, which amounts to only one-third of the Vote for the Department of Finance.  In looking at the figures tonight, that is not obvious, and I am afraid this reflects the lack of importance being given to the Department of the Public Service.  I do not share Deputy Desmond's idea that it was a good move to merge the two Departments.  He spoke of the dangers involved and he hoped they would not occur.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance have taken over the functions of the Department of the Public Service and the priority of that Department has been subsumed. If that Department were given the proper priority it would go a long way towards relieving the public purse in restructuring the Department.  That has been left aside in the now reconstructed Department of Finance.  When I last checked the pay bill in regard to the public service it was about £2.6 billion and the only way to reduce that was to reduce the numbers.  That must not be done willy nilly but in a structured manner, a way which will not detract from the present structure of Government. I do not believe that with the Department of the Public Service now being subsumed in the Department of Finance we will see any development along these lines in the near future.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to consider what the priorities should be and to give priority to the restructuring of the public service as proposed in the 1985 White Paper which suggested possible solutions.  Much progress could be made in bringing the State finances under control if there was a review of how the public service in general is run.  It was my understanding that was what the Department of the Public Service were doing but the indications are that they are not being allowed to continue that function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the increase in public borrowing over the past seven or eight years, which amounts to about £16 billion, and at the figure for the rise in unemployment, which is about 150,000, it becomes clear we have not been spending <Col N="1412" /> the money we have raised through borrowing in the right way.  There should be a responsibility on each Department to report the progress they are making on various programmes, particularly those in relation to personnel, &mdash; I realise that essentially the Department of the Public Service dealt with that but responsibility for it could be devolved to other areas. Although Departments are accountable for the money they are spending they do not have to show that it gave a return to the State.  We have borrowed an extra £16 billion in the past seven or eight years but we have not made proper use of it. While we have increased the number of State services and have increased the numbers employed by the State, we have not solved the country's problems.</P>
    <P>In that time the industrial sector has contracted while the State sector has expanded.  The problem has to be looked at very carefully and I do not believe that the Department of Finance as at present constituted will be able to tackle that problem.  Very simply, if there is one Minister at the Cabinet table who is responsible both for restricting spending and allowing spending and also responsible for reform of the public service I do not believe reform of the public service will take precedence as money matters will take over.  That has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Department of the Public Service would have looked at the area of financial management systems as they are absolutely essential to the proper budgeting of public moneys.  Most Departments do not have these systems. Until recently the Department of Social Welfare who have an enormous budget had no accountant employed to examine how that money was being spent.  It has now one accountant.  Departments are not called on to show whether the money which they are spending is being spent effectively.  Financial management systems must be introduced.</P>
    <P>Last year the Progressive Democrats suggested that a system of zero-based budgeting should be introduced in each Department, meaning that the figures for last year should not be just taken as read <Col N="1413" /> and added to.  I think that is a system we will have to seriously consider introducing because if we go on the basis that the figures for last year were appropriate and should be continued we will never get to the point where we will review on a regular basis the spending in each Department.  That is something which should be done constantly.  That is a function the Department could carry out but I do not see it happening.</P>
    <P>A restructured public service is the key to the recovery of our economy.  We have invested heavily in State services, in money and in personnel.  There is a huge number of people working in the public service and unless we restructure that service the country is not going to benefit in the way it should.  We do not seem to know what we should do with the public service.  Should we do as the Labour Party suggest and increase its size or should we do as we suggest and reduce it?  I have not heard any member of the Government talking to any great extent about substantially reducing the number employed in the public service and I put it to the House that it is essential for us to do so if we are to move forward.</P>
    <P>We need to widen our productive base. The State sector is placing an enormous burden on the Exchequer.  As I have said already, the industrial base is contracting. We need to look at the problem radically because if we do not do so we are going to get radical solutions.  There are thousands of dedicated public servants many of whom are not given the encouragement they deserve.  They try to be effective but the structure of the public service does not allow them to do so. Some changes have been made in recent years and these have gone some of the way towards allowing them to be more effective, but once more I have to ask how is that momentum going to be continued? How are we going to allow our public servants to be as effective as they can if the structures work against them? The Department of the Public Service who were responsible for achieving that aim are now part of the Department of Finance and as such they have no clout in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> Expenditure management rather than public service reform is going to and has taken over and that is a terrible pity.  As I said earlier, the way to get the economy moving again is to make the public service slimmer and more productive.  Otherwise, lack of planning will lead to things being done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and we will not achieve the ends we wish to achieve.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to public service pay.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he believed the figures were holding and that they will continue to do so.  I would encourage him to stay on the path of keeping pay within the guidelines but I am not totally convinced there is not one rule for the semi-State commercial bodies and another for the Civil Service and the non-commercial semi-State sector.  Most people have a perception that the Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and ESB pay settlements contravened the guidelines which the Government have laid down and, perhaps, the Minister could tell us if this trend is going to continue. Is it the case that semi-State commercial bodies will be allowed to go over the guidelines simply because they are in the commercial world?  If so, the Minister should say that quite clearly, that we have one rule for the commercial sector and another for the non-commercial sector. We have a pay claim that has been lodged by 20,000 civil servants, I believe, on reading the papers.  This is being looked on as being a challenge to the pay guidelines the Government have laid down.  I do not know if the Minister has decided what he is going to do about it, but I have no doubt that the civil servants will not accept the guidelines lightly.  While I would urge him to stay within them, we need more than his just saying that he is going to do it.  We need to see action on it.</P>

      <P>Indeed, and we have supported it up to now.  We have to know whether the Minister is differentiating between commercial and non-commercial semi-State bodies.  The Office of <Col N="1415" /> Public Works, in a way, come in under the Public Service.  I have been thinking about that office for some time.  It seems that they are spending quite a bit of money on behalf of many individual Departments and the Departments themselves do not have to account for that money.  It is not spent by the Departments under their Votes.  As a result, the realisation of the cost to the Exchequer of certain projects and the ongoing costs of maintenance and other aspects perhaps are not realised by the individual Departments.  I would favour a system whereby individual Departments had to account for that money when it had to come in under their Vote rather than under that of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that I would like completely to abolish the Office of Public Works without further thought.  They do much very creditable work and I was very interested to hear the detailed statement of the Minister of State.  I would certainly commend the Office of Public Works for some of the work they are doing, particularly in conservation, restoration and so on.  That does not mean that I do not see other Departments doing it as effectively. The essential thing in terms of the Public Service is that each Department should know what is being spent on their behalf and not alone know, but be responsible for it.  Would the Minister consider that in the future?</P>
      <P>I end on a query.  Could the Minister elaborate on the difference between the figure in the Estimates published in January and the revised published Estimates for Vote No. 50, or 51 as it was known then?  That is for the increases in remuneration and pensions.  There is a difference of £10 million on an initial figure of £16 million, an allowance made of £6 million.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to programme 2 of arterial drainage and mentioned in particular the Monaghan Blackwater scheme.  This is the first cross-Border scheme embracing both sides of the Border, with the main <Col N="1416" /> channel forming the Border for upwards of ten miles.  We had separate contracts for north and south and the contract for the main channel.  This is the first real indication for people in the Border region of practical cross-Border co-operation which was a substantial benefit to the farmers on both sides.  It brought back into production thousands of acres of good farming land in an area where the farms are small.  I should like to compliment the Office of Public Works on their progress to date and on the way in which they have applied themselves to that scheme in a short 12 months period. The funding was provided partly by the EC under FEOGA aid and by the two sovereign Governments.  It is particularly satisfactory to a person like myself who has been involved in cross-Border co-operation, in meetings and in the compilation of projects which it was felt would be beneficial to both sides of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Included in that scheme with the Monaghan Blackwater was another cross-Border scheme, the Finn-Lackey scheme.  While no mention has been made of that, we would hope that with the provision of a headquarters in Monaghan, with a substantial building, workshops and repair units which would be there as a permanent fixture, that the Finn-Lackey scheme would be next in line.  The Office of Public Works, in the past number of years, have been carrying out a hydrological survey of the wonderful Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I hope that the result of the survey will soon be published.  With the present emphasis on the development of tourism the opening up of the tourism potential of that area would be a practical approach.  If that canal were developed as it was intended to be when first constructed, to link the Erne and Shannon systems, it would constitute one of the finest waterways in Europe.  This is an area with tourism potential and here again we have our friends across the Border placing much emphasis on tourism development also.  Seemingly, they will use the moneys being made available under the agreement towards the <Col N="1417" /> development of tourism.  That would be a positive approach.</P>
    <P>I notice that the customs clearance stations are also provided by the Office of Public Works, along with the roads stations. We have one customs clearance station on the Dublin-Derry road, a national primary route, just north of Monaghan town.  A number of years ago when that clearance station was being erected, I made the point in this House that it had been moved half a mile down the road away from the built-up area.  I knew that it was being moved from a hazardous position to an equally dangerous position.  The position now is that large articulated trucks are parked on the roadway.  On the surrounds of that station there are large areas of greenery.  For a small outlay of £5,000 to £7,000 the grass could be removed and the area tarmacadamed. This has been brought to the notice of the Department on numerous occasions.  I ask the Minister to consider this possibility.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Department on the Blackwater drainage scheme.  I hope the scheme will be continued because it would give a real lifeline to areas.  The Minister said that the commissioners are fully aware that there can be no question of the allocation being exceeded and that all necessary steps must be taken to ensure that budgetary targets for the construction works are met.  I believe there is a set capital allocation for the Blackwater drainage scheme.  I think 100 workers are employed on the scheme at present.  It was hoped that this number would be increased by a further 10 to 20 per cent. This is the time of year, when the weather is good, that the capital allocation might be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputies for their contributions on this debate.  They said at the start that they would be short and sweet and they all were but this did not in any way diminish the importance of the subject matter raised by all of the Deputies.  While I will do my utmost to reply to the points that were raised as they were raised, I may leave some out but I will try during the <Col N="1418" /> course of my reply to get all the information that was requested and to give it to the House.</P>
      <P>For the third or fourth time in recent days I can assure Deputy Noonan, Deputy Colley and others that the targets are being met.  There is no doubt whatever about the Government's determination to ensure that both the expenditure and revenue targets will be achieved at the end of the year.  Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out the position that emerges at the end of June in every financial year, and definitely as far back as 1982 when I last had the honour to hold this position before.  We all know that because of the way the major proportion of tax comes in between October and December, at the end of June figures can be misconstrued to the effect that the budget deficit has already been surpassed at the end of the six month period.  Many Deputies have had ministerial experience and understand perfectly what the position is.  I have no doubt that the targets will be met but if for any reason there may be some slippage action will be taken.  I think every Deputy realises and accepts that we cannot continue the way we did for the past ten to 14 years.  It is not sustainable.  If we are to have democratic control we must take action.  The Government have taken and will continue to take action to ensure that we begin to reduce the huge level of borrowing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan and all other Deputies referred to pay policy.  In my budget speech I said that we, like what the previous Government proposed in January, will not be making any additional provision for pay increases beyond the expiry of the 25th round.  That is the position and it will remain so.  There is no money available to meet any pay increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the review body on higher remuneration.  He asked what were they doing and why was there money in the Estimates for them.  They produced an interim report during the previous Government's time and it was left to the incoming Government to deal with that report.  We have deferred it <Col N="1419" /> indefinitely but the review body are continuing to produce their final report which will be presented to the Government. This is why additional moneys have been made available for the review body in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the reappointment of the arbitrator.  The arbitrator will continue to operate until 31 July.  Therefore, the matter does not arise at present.  I am sure the matter will be discussed between now and then.  I want to refer to some of the points raised by Deputy Desmond, Deputy Colley and Deputy Noonan in relation to the Department of the Public Service, one of which was, I understand, about the continuation of the top level appointment committee.  This committee have done very useful work and all of the relevant appointments, with the exception of some in the sensitive areas like Finance and Revenue have been made as a result of recommendations made by that committee.</P>
    <P>I have some details on the structure of the Department which I would like to give to Deputy Noonan.  We now have two full blooded central Departments in one.  Obviously, the structures that existed in two full blooded central Departments will look very top heavy in relation to structures in other Departments but I think these structures are very necessary. There are three secretaries; the Secretary of the Department of Finance, the secretary for national debt management and the secretary for public service management. Those positions were put in place out of necessity.  There are also two second secretaries, two deputy secretaries, and 13 assistant secretaries.  It may appear to many that that structure is very top heavy but bearing in mind the workload that falls on the personnel in what were two major central Departments which have now become one they are necessary in the interim.  I can assure the House that we will be looking at these structures very carefully to ensure that there will not be an overburdened top heavy structure in any Department, including the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Nobody is subject to reallocation or redeployment in any part of the public service since the budget speech.  As of now they are in the Department of Finance.  That could be reviewed and could change.</P>
      <P>In raising a very important point I am delighted that Deputy Noonan gave me the opportunity to emphasise policy in relation to the exchange rate.  There is no doubt that the Government must maintain the value for our currency.  That is fundamental to our survival.  Speculation was raised by top personnel in recent days and I totally dismiss it.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has dealt quite extensively with some of the points raised in relation to arterial drainage and decentralisation. Deputy Noonan raised the issue of the £1 million allocated for the decentralisation programme.  A totally different approach is being taken to decentralisation by this Government than was taken by us before when in office.  There have been a large number of inquiries from parties interested in building these offices in the four locations decided upon by the Government and subsequently leasing them to the Government with a view to purchase by the State.  The intention is that we will end up having rented accommodation at a lesser rate than obtains at present where these offices would be housed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy has already said that that is the beginning of the reintroduction of the decentralisation programme. I assure Deputies that it is the resolve of the Government to continue to pursue that policy vigorously.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the point relating to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.  I have referred to most of Deputy Noonan's points.  It is not that I want to delay the House at this hour, but I want to avail of the opportunity to reply to all the matters raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> Deputy McDowell referred to the Revenue Commissioners, the task force and the new computer.  I am sorry that he is not here now.  The Deputy was very critical of the Revenue Commissioners.  I must defend the Revenue Commissioners in the way in which they operate. New Deputies like Deputy McDowell will soon learn that his constituents think that the Revenue Commissioners are over-efficient in the way in which they pursue tax arrears.  Every Deputy in the House gets letters from constituents, companies and individuals, asking him to intercede on their behalf with the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners because of how efficiently and effectively the Revenue Commissioners and tax inspectors are doing their job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but I must try to state the facts.  Customs and excise law was raised by Deputy McDowell, who suggested that it be updated and revised.  I am not in a position to respond to his comments but I will have the points carefully examined.  Deputy McDowell and others referred to the national lottery. The funds allocated by the Government are broadly in line with what was decided by the previous Government. While Deputy Desmond suggested that there would be as much as £14 million in additional revenue, he is probably suggesting a sum of 100 per cent or 150 per cent more than might actually accrue. There will be additional funds and when these Estimates are passed we will be in a position to release the funds available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is to be a question on the Adjournment about the lottery but I will refer to it briefly now.  It has been an outstanding success.  It behoves all of us in this House and particularly those who have responsibility for allocating the resources, to be seen, for the benefit of those who have participated in the lottery, to be using their contributions to provide useful facilities and services for <Col N="1422" /> the arts and culture, sport, the Irish language and health services.  That is important. There has been some adverse publicity about the lottery but the way in which it is being supported and the contribution it can make in the areas outlined will be seen as a very useful exercise and as a very important source of funds for the areas mentioned.  The Government will decide which way additional resources over and above the £7 million will be spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also mentioned the withholding tax on professional fees for those involved in borrowing on behalf of the State.  They will be statutorily subject to withholding tax just the same as anybody else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond made a point about the Department of the Public Service no longer existing.  It has been completely integrated into the Department of Finance and the integrated Department is working efficiently and effectively.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners, like any service, have room for improvement.  It is not good for taxpayers to hear statements being made about tax arrears of £700 million being collectable.  It is essential that we realise that much of the amounts stated as being outstanding or collectable are not outstanding or collectable.  I have referred to that in a number of areas in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Revenue Computer.  The Revenue Commissioners provide to the Department of Social Welfare, after the end of each tax year, a tape for input to the social welfare computer giving particulars, supplied by employers in relation to their employees, of the social insurance deductions made during the year and this information is updated at a later stage as the P35 returns come in from employers.  That is not satisfactory and I agree with what Deputy Desmond was saying.  I hope that we have not moved too far from the stage where we can have the integration that he has rightly suggested not only here but in <Col N="1423" /> other debates and at Question Time. Deputy Desmond asked if the Revenue Commissioners pay informers in any way, or at least that was what was implied in the question.  In Vote 9, subhead F, there is provision for law changes, fees and rewards so I assume &mdash; I am not sure &mdash; that some rewards are given in some instances by the Revenue Commissioners. To get a more detailed reply to that, perhaps the best process would be to put down a parliamentary question and I will do my utmost to reply to it.</P>

      <P>That is for a different Vote.  It has nothing to do with the Revenue Commissioners.  The secret service is to deal with Justice and Defence mainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke to Vote 9, subhead F, and the control of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners Order of 1923 which established the board of commissioners called the Revenue Commissioners conferred on them all the functions which were formerly exercised in the State by the British Commissioners of Inland Revenue and the British Commissioners of Customs and Excise.  Paragraph 9 of that order provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall, in the exercise of their duty, be subject to the control of the Minister for Finance and shall obey all orders and instructions which may be issued to them on that behalf by the Minister for Finance.  The intent of that provision appears to have been to subject the Revenue Commissioners to the Minister for Finance so far as the general control of their staff was concerned and their qualifications and hours and conditions of service, but not to involve the Minister for Finance in matters relating to the assessment of taxes payable by any person.  So far as that is concerned, the commissioners have to act independently and judicially.  That is the way that Order has been interpreted since 1923 by successive Governments.  That covers the <Col N="1424" /> points made by Deputy McDowell and Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley is disappointed I did not spend more time in my initial remarks talking about the expenditure on the public service of the Department of Finance. She is absolutely correct in this, but I had hoped there would have been even more contributions to the debate tonight, although important contributions were made from all sides of the House.  I could have spent all of the time allocated to this debate speaking on all of the detail that would be available on the 19 Votes before the House for debate.  I tried to refer to some of the points I thought should be highlighted, and others have been raised to which I am now doing my best to reply.  If Deputy Colley were Minister for Finance &mdash; I have no doubt that some day she will be &mdash; she would realise as I have, the responsibility and the work involved in the integrated Departments which occupies a great deal of time of the Minister for Finance and that the restructuring she referred to on a few occasions in her address will continue to be a priority.  In the last couple of months we have ensured that the input that was there and the expertise and experience that have been built up since the divorce that took place between the public service and the Department of Finance will not be lost.  That brings me back to my reply to Deputy Noonan about the existing structure and the new structure in the Department of Finance which could be suggested by many as top-heavy.  I assure Deputy Colley I am very concerned about the points she raised in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The retraining branch or a good number of them are now a task force with the Revenue Commissioners. That is hardly consistent with keeping the public service together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that retraining was the most important aspect. It was an aspect and it is still there.  They are not all gone.  I could not agree more with what Deputy Colley said about financial allocations to Departments.  She is probably correct in suggesting that last <Col N="1425" /> year's figures of expenditure or outturn were more or less taken as the starting point for budgetary discussions on what might be spent in the next year which is utterly ridiculous.  What is required is detailed examination of every item of expenditure under every subhead in every Vote to ensure that we are getting value for money in every area of Government activity.  We have already begun to examine that very seriously and I assure the Deputy that process will continue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley talked about a reduction in numbers in the public service and we are committed to that.  We must have a slimmer and more productive Civil Service and we are working towards that end.  Everybody involved in the administration of Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas, the public service, the public sector and the public at large must realise that if we are to do anything to overcome the horrendous problems we have with over 245,000 people unemployed, we must expand our productive base.  There is absolutely no other way we will get out of the difficulties in which we now find ourselves with the imbalance in the public finances.</P>
      <P>The question of public service pay has been raised by all Deputies.  In relation to the issues that have arisen, bearing in mind what has been said in the Budget Statement and since then, that we have had matters affecting ESB, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, An Post and BTE all either resolved or about to be resolved and that other discussions and negotiations will take place in relation to public service pay, the Government are discussing all aspects of expenditure, unemployment and taxation with the social partners, as they are described, including the ICTU. Those discussions will continue in the weeks and months ahead and I hope we will be able to come to a sensible approach for all concerned.  It never can be in this economy any more &ldquo;them against us&rdquo;, no matter who &ldquo;them&rdquo; and who &ldquo;us&rdquo; are.  It is a question of all of us in the difficult circumstances we find ourselves in trying together to overcome the difficulties.  That is the only way we will begin to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> The last question Deputy Colley raised was the difference in the original Estimate for 1987 and the provision of £16 million to meet the commitments which were then expected to arise on pay and pensions throughout the year.  On coming into office, the new Government examined all the Estimates including the Estimate for remuneration and pensions. Arising from that examination and from the new policy on special pay increases in the public service which I outlined in my budget speech the Government decided that a figure of £6.7 million would be sufficient to meet all of the demands in Vote 50.  This represented a saving of £9.3 million on the original figure.  That remains the position and £6.7 million is believed to be sufficient to meet all the demands which will be made on the Vote. Most of that additional resource was in relation to special increases which have been discontinued, as the Deputy knows, since my budget speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard raised some very important points which the Minister of State referred to already.  I can assure the Deputy that we have taken careful note of some additional points he made.</P>
    <P>That covers most, if not all, of the points raised in the course of the debate. I know we have quite a bit to do to go through the 19 votes now.</P>

      <P>The first definite commitment on the part of any Government that the national lottery was to be established was given in the White Paper <i>Building on Reality</i> published in 1984. There was some talk about it up to then but the first concrete commitment was given in that document.  It was envisaged that the funds accruing from the national lottery would be devoted to providing sport facilities and so on for young sport enthusiasts.  The actual Bill was introduced in the House in June 1986 and subsequently passed.  In the course of that debate there was a guarantee given, on Committee Stage, that a minimum of 55 per cent of the proceeds of the national lottery would be devoted to sports.  At the time some people were of the opinion that the entire proceeds should be given to sports.  It was decided by the Government of the day that 55 per cent should be given to sports, 35 per cent to arts, culture and the Irish language and the remaining 10 per cent to health, and other contingency projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, during the passage of the Bill through this House while it had the support of the Government it did not have the support of the Opposition because of the fact that the entire proceeds were not being given to sports.  I have a copy of the relevant debate of 25 June 1986 here.  The first speaker for the Opposition on that day was Deputy O'Kennedy, now Minister for Agriculture and Food, who, at that <Col N="1434" /> column 1216 of the Official Report, had this to say:</P>
    <P>We are opposed to this Bill and, having listened to the Minister's statement, our grounds for opposition are strengthened rather than weakened. We are opposed to it for a variety of reasons and I will develop these points later but I should like to indicate now our three main reasons for opposing it.  First, we are opposed to it because the Bill gives the Government power to subsume into the Exchequer for such purposes as the Government may determine from time to time the proceeds of this lottery.  We are not prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>At column 1223 Deputy O'Kennedy stated:</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept from any Government, and particularly the present one, those general intentions which are not enshrined in legislation, particularly legislation which allows them to cancel out the whole Bill for whatever purposes they wish.</P>
    <P>Later that day in the House another spokesperson for the Opposition, Deputy O'Rourke, who is now Minister for Education, stated at column 1238:</P>
    <P>We all rested comfortably on that promise.  In recent years when I met representatives of third level institutions, secondary schools, community and sporting organisations, the promotion of sport was mentioned and I took sustenance from the commitment of our Government, in the person of Deputy Tunney who was responsible for sport and later Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to devote most of the money from the national lottery to the promotion of sport.</P>
    <P>Another speaker from the Opposition that day was the present Minister with responsibility for youth and sport, Deputy Fahey, who stated at column 1356 of the Official Report on 25 June:</P>
    <P>I find it objectional that the proceeds of the lottery, instead of going to sport, <Col N="1435" /> will, according to the Minister, be applied to a variety of purposes including sport, health care, the arts and cultural activities.  The Government should not have changed the original intention.  It appears that the proceeds of the lottery will be used to replace Exchequer expenditure.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>The Government's document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> stated that the proceeds of the lottery would go to the promotion of sport and the change now proposed by the Government is totally unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>At column 1357 Deputy Fahey stated:</P>
    <P>The original intention was to use the proceeds to finance the promotion of sport.  The national lottery should be operated by a Department of Sport and the proceeds should all go to sport, as originally intended.  The arts and culture should continue to be financed from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I hope these quotations which I have quoted from the Official Report give an indication of the thinking and the view of the Opposition on the National Lottery Bill when it was going through the House. They were in favour of a lottery Bill but they were against this National Lottery Bill due to the fact that the entire proceeds of the lottery were not being devoted to sporting facilities and sporting organisations.  Subsequently, there was an election and a change of Government and a number of things have happened since then.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the amount of money allocated to sporting organisations was reduced to £100,000.  It was £1.6 million in 1986. One could say that the reduction in the allocation in 1987 was a mortal blow to the development of sport in this country. However, there was light at the end of the tunnel because in the meantime the national lottery was launched and it was a great success, as the Minister said in the House earlier this evening.  The returns <Col N="1436" /> from the lottery exceeded the most optimistic expectations of any of its supporters. The people supported it and it became obvious that at long last sport would get the vital funds and resources to enable us to compete with the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>However, we were all in for a rude awakening.  In reply to a Dáil question put down by me and by others on 12 May 1987 in which we requested information as to what was happening the funds of the lottery, we were told that instead of sport getting 55 per cent as was decided by the outgoing Government it would now receive 45 per cent.  The question is, 45 per cent of what?  It was not 45 per cent of the entire proceeds but 45 per cent of £7 million, which is £3.15 million. That amount was not entirely devoted to sport because youth affairs was also included in that allocation.</P>
    <P>Instead of sporting organisations and sporting facilities getting 55 per cent of the proceeds of the lottery they were now to receive 45 per cent of the first £7 million.  We all know that before the end of the year, if people keep contributing to the lottery, that figure will not be £7 million but will be £20 million or more. We are entitled to some clarification in the House as to what percentage of the entire lottery will go to sport.  Will it be 45 per cent of the entire take or 45 per cent of the £7 million which has so far been handed over?  Sporting bodies and sporting organisations who have been depending up to now on Government funds are very anxious to find out what will happen for this year.</P>
    <P>For instance the Olympic Council &mdash; this is a very important year for them because they are preparing for the Olympic games in Seoul in 1988 &mdash; were granted £275,000 last year under the Coalition Government to prepare our team for the Olympic games.  What can they expect to get this year?  They will certainly not get the money from the traditional Exchequer transfer because that is down to £100,000.  Can they expect to get it from the national lottery?  What will happen to the national sports centre?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> Are there funds available to cover that development?</P>
    <P>As I said, 45 per cent of the £7 million will go to sport and also to youth, another area which has been badly neglected by the Government.  In 1986 the entire allocation to youth and youth organisations who promote youth affairs was £3.9 million. In the 1987 budget it was reduced to £2.1 million, a reduction of almost 50 per cent.  They are also depending on the national lottery to make up that shortfall. So far £3.15 million has been allocated to sport and to youth and that is insufficient.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the entire concept of the national lottery is under seige by the Government in their hungry quest for Exchequer funds.  The proceeds of the lottery are being used as another form of taxation and are being poured into the bottomless pit of the Exchequer.  People who contribute to the lottery under the impression that the proceeds will go to sports and community facilities are being conned.  Instead, the moneys are being used to supplement the Government's inadequate funding of various Departments. God knows what other Departments and other functions will be funded by the lottery before the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>This is nothing less than a somersault, another broken promise in the long list of broken promises by the Government. They changed their minds with regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Single European Act and so on.  In spite of all the pious platitudes of the Government during the processing of the Bill when it went through this House, they have been caught with their hands in the till of the national lottery.  The people who pay their money on the understanding that they will see the results in their own communities in the form of sport centres and other facilities are being conned.  It is about time they were told exactly where the proceeds will go for the rest of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole concept and the thinking behind the introduction of the national lottery in the initial stages was that it would provide a source of <Col N="1438" /> funding for sports.  This concept was shared by all and by the many Ministers and Ministers of State involved, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, way back in the initial stages.  At a later stage the idea of funding the arts from this source was added at the instigation of the then Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, and of myself.  The idea was that the national lottery would provide a source of funding for sports and the arts.</P>
      <P>Throughout, there was one great fear &mdash; and this fear was shared by all sides of the House &mdash; that the funds would be raided for purely Exchequer purposes at some stage.  I say &ldquo;at some stage&rdquo; because even the most cynical or hardened observer did not think this would happen before a single penny of the lottery funds was distributed.  To safeguard against that possibility, and at the very strong urging of the then Opposition and through amendments which they put down at that time, a section was added to the original Bill specifying the agencies which should be beneficiaries of the funds.  Included was sport and the arts and health was added simply to make up for the small amount which would be lost to the health area through the ending of the Irish Hospitals (Trust) Sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government provided the funds as follows: 55 per cent for sport, 35 per cent for the arts and culture, including the Irish language, and 10 per cent in the other areas.  I thought the 35 per cent allocated to the arts was not satisfactory but considering the great success of the lottery it would have transformed the arts scene.  My Department produced a White Paper saying the funds from the lottery would be used to implement the issues covered in the White Paper.  You, a Leas-Ceann Comhairle, know how difficult it is to satisfy the people in the arts community but for once they were relatively satisfied and were not grumbling.  They felt this was an opportunity for them to break away from the penury which had bedevilled them down the years.  Now before even a penny has been distributed, we find 10 per cent has been chopped off the amount for the arts and culture, including the <Col N="1439" /> Irish language.  Not 10 per cent of the entire fund, the 40 per cent to flow to the beneficiaries of the lottery, not 10 per cent of the projected £9 million but 10 per cent of £7 million.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that what is now happening is, to a certain extent a confidence trick on all the people who bought lottery tickets.  Research carried out here, in the United States, Australia and elsewhere has shown that while the main motivating factor of anyone purchasing a ticket is the hope of winning something, a secondary and very strong motivating factor is the purpose for which the funds accruing from the lottery will be used.  In this case everybody clearly understood from the beginning that the main beneficiaries would be sport and the arts.  All the people who bought tickets, and this accounts for almost every adult in the country, thought they had a chance of winning the lottery, but they also thought they were helping sports and the arts. If they had thought this was a form of taxation I believe many of them would not have purchased tickets.  As I said, I am afraid this can only be described as a confidence trick.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to restore immediately if possible, or if not as soon as possible, or to give some indication of his thinking on the restoration of the original percentages.  Perhaps he would let us know what he is going to do with the money in excess of the £7 million &mdash; and there will be a lot of money involved.  I suggest he should distribute the money in excess of the £7 million on the basis of the original 55 per cent, 35 per cent and 10 per cent.  What has happened is that the Government have taken a retrograde step.  I know the reason this was done and I know the exigencies that exist in the health areas, but having taken all these factors into consideration, in the long term interest of the future of the National Lottery, I believe this was a retrograde step and will damage the lottery.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that once again sports in which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, have a great interest, and the arts and culture, in which you have an equally <Col N="1440" /> great interest, are again being treated badly.  While they are getting moral support from all of us and we all say they deserve support, when it comes to giving them cash we once again renege on these promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation under which the national lottery operates provides that the lottery surplus is to be applied for the purposes of sport and other recreation, national culture, including the Irish language, the arts and the health of the community, and such other purposes as the Government may determine.  The Government have decided to add youth projects to the purposes for which lottery moneys may be used.</P>
      <P>On the advice of the lottery company, the Government set aside £7 million in the Book of Estimates as the surplus likely to be available to the Exchequer from lottery operations this year.  That was their advice, not a Government decision.  This estimate was prepared in the weeks prior to the launch of the lottery and was based on the best available information.  To acknowledge that it has proved in retrospect to have been a conservative estimate is in no way to say we should have built a higher figure into our calculations at the time the estimates were being prepared.  It would have been irresponsible of the Government to make unduly optimistic projections without any firm basis for them and to proceed to allocate resources on the basis of those projections.  We did not do it in this area, any more than we did in any other area of Government expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have given careful consideration to the purposes to which the lottery surplus ought to be applied. In doing so they took the view that there were particular services which ought to be financed either totally or to a significant extent from the proceeds of the lottery and this is reflected in the distribution by programme of the £7 million set aside in the Estimates which was announced some weeks ago, namely, £3,150,000 for youth and sports projects, £1,750,000 for arts, culture and the Irish <Col N="1441" /> language and £2,100,000 for projects in the health area.  The Ministers directly concerned are at present in the process of determining the detailed allocation of these resources following which I will authorise the release of funds to them from the lottery fund.  The Dáil earlier tonight in approving the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Finance has placed the necessary funds at my disposal for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I understand that of the £3.5 million allocated for youth and sports projects, about £1.4 million will be used to assist sporting organisations and other sports activities while about £1.7 million will be spent on projects in the youth area.  Total Government assistance to sports organisations and to sport in general will be maintained at roughly the same level as last year and at a time when there are cutbacks in almost every area, including health which was referred to by Deputy Nealon.</P>
    <P>I know Deputies will join with me in paying tribute to the lottery company on the highly successful launch of the lottery and the manner in which they have succeeded in maintaining public interest in and support for it.  Ticket sales to date are of the order of £37 million and it is clear that the surplus accruing to the Exchequer this year will be significantly higher than had earlier been anticipated. I am in consultation with my colleagues on how best to allocate the additional resources now likely to be available and I know that the Minister of State with responsibility for youth and sport will be putting forward proposals for consideration in this regard.  I will be bringing these proposals to Government for decision later in the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to Deputy McGinley that money is made available for sport and youth under other headings. Huge sums are being spent under amenity grants and other activities by local authorities, vocational educational committees, health boards and all Government Departments.  I should like to assure him and Deputy Nealon, that <Col N="1442" /> youth or sport will not be neglected by the Government.  In the course of the debate tonight on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister of Finance many Members suggested that money should not be devoted to those areas but given to the health services.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputies to say that initially the money was to be devoted to sport and that, following pressure by the Taoiseach and Deputy Nealon, a former Minister of State with responsibility for the arts and culture, the arts were included.  It has been said that following pressure from some other interest, health was added.  It appears that it was in order for the last Government to change the allocation on three occasions but it is wrong for us to decide to add youth.  That is nonsense.  The last person to talk about confidence tricks in any regard is Deputy Nealon.  Had he been listening to the debate earlier on the Estimates he would have heard me say, almost word for word, what he said in regard to those who participate in the lottery.  It behoves all of us to ensure that they see, through expenditure on youth, sport, the arts, culture, the Irish language and health, that they are making a contribution as well as taking a chance on winning a prize for themselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate those involved in setting up the lottery on its major success so far.  On their behalf I should like to thank the people who have subscribed and congratulate those who have won prizes.  I hope people will continue to subscribe because the lottery will provide much needed resources for areas that are of concern to us all under the headings of youth, sport, the arts, culture, the Irish language and the health services.  That money would not be available for those sectors otherwise because of the state of the public finances and that should be evident from the savings we have to make in other important areas.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 June 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present at the annual conference of the Prison Officers' Association on 7 May 1987 when allegations of the use of political influence in promotions within the prison service were made.  In response I undertook to investigate what I regarded as very serious allegations and asked the Association to provide me with any evidence they had to substantiate their claims.</P>
      <P>On 14 May 1987 the Association wrote to me referring to the undertaking which I had given and enclosing a copy of a document which they indicated they had recently received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document in question is a very poor photo-copy of a letter apparently written on Dáil Éireann note-paper.  It is <Col N="1268" /> addressed to &ldquo;Mr. Michael Noonan, TD, Minister for Justice&rdquo; over the signature &ldquo;Ivan Yates TD&rdquo;.  In the body of the letter representations are made on behalf of the person referred to in the Deputy's question who is stated to be anxious to secure a post in the institution referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied.</P>
    <P>In the accompanying letter from the Association I was asked to have the relevant files examined to establish the validity of the enclosure.  I was asked for an early reply in view of what the letter described as &ldquo;the serious public allegations made by Mr. Yates against this Association&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 21 May 1987 my private secretary wrote to the Association and asked them, in view of the very poor quality of the photo-copy which they had forwarded, to arrange to have the actual document which had been produced to them brought to my Department for inspection. He also referred to an article which had appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> where an officer of the Association had been quoted to the effect that they also had other documentation to support the allegations which had been made.  My private secretary indicated that, if I was to fully investigate the allegations, it was imperative that all relevant documentation be made available to me.  Accordingly, he requested that a copy of any other relevant documentation which the Association had in its possession, or could obtain, be forwarded to me.</P>
    <P>On 25 May 1987 the Association replied expressing surprise at the request for the actual document in their possession to be produced for inspection and asked that I &ldquo;now address the issues which arise in this matter&rdquo;.  Their letter did not indicate that they would comply with the request to produce the document and did not refer at all to the second request which had been made viz. to provide any other relevant documentation which the Association possessed.</P>
    <P>I think it will be clear to the House that I have given the Association every opportunity to produce whatever evidence they have to support the allegations of the use of political influence <Col N="1269" /> which they made.  All that has been produced is the very poor photo-copy to which I have referred.  There is no document corresponding to this photo-copy on my Department's files and there is no record of any representations having been received in relation to the appointment of the officer referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the appointment in question was entirely proper.</P>

The composite statistics compiled by the Garda Síochána include the offence of having no insurance with other offences, for example, that of failing, on request, to produce a certificate of insurance at a Garda station within the prescribed period.</P>
      <P>For the years 1982 to 1985 the relevant statistics that are available are published in the Commissioner's Annual Report on Crime for those years, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library. The report for 1986 will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The incidence of uninsured driving is of course a matter of serious concern.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the problem is receiving, and will continue to receive, a high level of Garda attention.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the adoption of modern farming methods in land structure can entail loss of wildlife habitat but I accept that some loss is unavoidable in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department is concerned to try and ensure that habitat loss is kept to a minimum without interfering unduly with the desire of progressive landholders to improve their farms.  Under the powers conferred by the Wildlife Act, 1976, and within the limits of the funds available to it the Forest and Wildlife Service is engaged in an active programme for the acquisition, protection and conservation of sites of major wildlife and scientific importance where possible.</P>

      <P>The current EC structures measures for <Col N="1276" /> the fisheries and aquaculture sectors include provision for financial assistance towards the permanent withdrawal of vessels from the fishing fleet.  Such assistance is contingent on a member state contributing 50 per cent of the total cost involved.  The basic aim behind the withdrawal scheme is to eliminate excess fishing capacity from the fleet and not to replace old vessels with new ones.  Consequently any person receiving a withdrawal premium is deemed ineligible for an EC grant for the construction of a new vessel to replace that withdrawn.  In any event the terms and conditions applying to the withdrawal scheme are very restrictive, with limited scope.  Taking these factors into account and in view of the developing nature of the Irish fleet, it is felt that the best interests of the Irish fishing industry would be served by concentrating the financial resources currently available on fleet renewal and modernisation.  I have, therefore, no plans at present for the introduction of a withdrawal scheme as suggested.</P>

      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The International Conventions relating to safety of life at sea which have not been ratified by Ireland are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Title: Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977 (International Maritime Organisation). Reason for non-ratification&mdash;Present indications are that the Convention is unlikely to secure the support of sufficient countries to bring it into force internationally since certain of the main fishing nations have difficulties with its provisions.  It is not proposed to take <Col N="1277" /> the necessary steps to ratify the Convention until it becomes clear that it is going to secure international acceptance.</P>
    <P>Title: International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, 1979 (International Maritime Orgainsation). Reason for non-ratification&mdash;Ireland is in broad compliance with the provisions of the Convention and the Attorney-General's advice has been sought on the legal requirements for ratification.  It is proposed to take the necessary steps to ratify the Convention as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The International Conventions relating to pollution of the sea which have not been ratified by Ireland are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Titles: (i) International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969 as amended by Protocols of 1976 and 1984; (ii) International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971 as amended by Protocols of 1976 and 1984; (iii) International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (collectivly known as MARPOL 73/78); (iv) Protocol relating to Intervention of the High Seas in cases of Pollution by Substances other than Oil, 1973.  Reason for non-ratification&mdash;New legislation is necessary to enable these conventions to be ratified by Ireland.  The drafting of appropriate legislation is at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>Special training courses in remedial education for post-primary teachers were introduced by the Department of Education in 1971-72.  A total of 308 remedial teachers for post-primary schools were trained between 1971-72 and 1977-78.</P>
      <P>As remedial teachers were not a specific category in post-primary schools during that period, it is not possible, to give the number of such teachers employed in post-primary schools. Where a need was established for the provision of remedial education for pupils in these schools, such education was provided by teachers who, in addition to possessing the normal qualifications required of teachers in the schools, were deemed to be competent to undertake remedial education, usually as a result of attendance at the special in-service courses organised by my Department.</P>
      <P>Remedial teachers in post-primary schools were regarded as ex-quota from the commencement of the 1979-80 school-year.  A hundred such posts were approved in 1979-80 and in 1980-81 a further 100 posts were approved.  37 posts were approved for post-primary schools in 1985-86 and 55 remedial-guidance posts were approved in 1986-87 in post-primary schools catering for disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>In addition, many post-primary schools employ within their approved quota of posts remedial teachers who have been trained in the area of remedial education.</P>
      <P>It is not possible on the basis of the data available to calculate the percentage of pupils who were provided with remedial teaching during each of those school years.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 232 in relation to pre-employment courses on Tuesday, June 9 1987.  The vocational training and preparation programmes were a direct successor to the pre-employment programmes having similar objectives, but aimed at servicing a larger number of young people who wished to avail themselves of this type of programme.  For this reason the programmes were offered by secondary schools in addition to vocational, community and comprehensive schools to which the pre-employment courses had been confined. <Col N="1296" /> A tabular statement of available information as requested by the Deputy in relation to vocational training and preparation programmes follows.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ongoing evaluation by the Department's inspectorate and psychological service in consultation with school and other authorities, an evaluation of the vocational training and preparation programmes was carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute and a report of the findings was published in November 1986.  A copy of this report is being lodged in the Oireachtas Library. Following is the statement:</P>
