    <P> (a) amendments to subheads in individual estimates to reduce the amount provided,</P>
    <P>(b) amendments to the subheads in individual estimates to increase the amount provided if the amendment contains within it a proposal to reduce another subhead, in the estimate, or in the same group of estimates, by the same amount thereby ensuring that the overall provisions of the estimate for this and subsequent years are not increased overall,</P>
    <P>(c) amendments to increase provisions for particular subheads, as set out at subparagraph (b) above shall not have effect if, within two weeks of their being passed by the Dáil the Minister for Finance certifies, for reasons stated, to a Committee of Public Expenditure that the proposal designed to achieve savings to compensate for the proposed increase will not in fact achieve the savings claimed, and</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I concluded last evening I was referring to the depth of the economic crisis facing the Government and the steps being taken by them in a planned and pragmatic way.  I was indicating the programme of initiatives being taken by the Government to deal with the crisis. The Government's aim at this time is to lift the national depression and despair and to restore confidence to all sectors of economic activity.  The Estimates of realism before us are one of the principal items in the formula of recovery announced by the Government.  We are aware of the increase in current expenditure as a percentage of GNP over the years.  In 1950 it represented 18 per cent of GNP, in 1960 it represented 19 per cent, in 1970 it represented 26 per cent, in 1980 it represented 38 per cent and it is expected to be 52 per cent or in excess of that figure this year.  We are all aware of the intolerable levels of taxation and borrowing as a direct consequence of this expenditure.  The Government have declared war on debt and they must succeed if living standards, services and future prospects for employment are to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see as the central problem facing us now not just the question of the management of the economy but also the control of public finances.  The Government's response is to take decisions and to make choices.  Some of those decisions are harsh and difficult but they are across the board and are distributed fairly, affecting every Department, local authority and all the agencies of the State. Savings made cannot be expended on new or enhanced activities and services; they must be used to reduce the deficit and borrowing.  To achieve targets, economies must be made in the current and the capital expenditure programmes.  All expenditure programmes are being subjected to the same close scrutiny and each <Col N="977" /> programme must justify expenditure before the Government allow it to proceed.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic in these matters. It took 15 years of borrowing to bring about the current position in the finances of the State and it cannot be reversed overnight.  However, this should not be an excuse for delaying the start of the process.  There is no painless solution to the problem enunciated by the Government. We must recognise that the full compensation for efforts made now may take some little time to produce the results we require but we cannot delay the start of the process any longer.  We must also recognise that borrowing is taxation and that our priority must be to reduce it.  Departments and agencies must now plan for decremental spending until we restore solvency to the public finances.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that other international agencies, the EC or the IMF, cannot solve our problems.  We can only do that ourselves.  It is easy at this time to be pessimistic but it is also a time for challenge to overcome our difficulties and improve the future prospects for all our citizens.  Irish people, whether in the business or sporting world have demonstrated that they can succeed at the highest levels.  Therefore, I am optimistic that we as a nation can unite to overcome our economic problems and build a brighter future.</P>
    <P>There are definite positive indicators, apart from the public finances and the level of unemployment, that the economy is in a position to respond to Government action.  I refer to the low level of inflation, the reduction in bank interest rates &mdash; five times since the Government took office &mdash; record levels of exports, a favourable balance of payments and a growth in imports of capital goods which is consistent with the expectation of stronger growth in machinery and equipment investment this year.  These positive factors along with the recent <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will assist in the regeneration of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Environment area, as one of the <Col N="978" /> largest expenditure areas, could not isolate itself from Government expenditure reductions.  When one considers the extent of expenditure incurred by the Department and local authorities &mdash; about £1,800 million approximately in 1987 &mdash; it was natural that the reductions would be substantial.  However, the reductions will be implemented in a manner to ensure that essential services are not affected.  I might add at this stage that some reductions would have taken place in any event next year as a result of a reduction in demand in certain areas, past expenditure and following decisions taken in the March budget.  For instance, £61 million of the reduction in capital spending relates to the two terminated grant schemes or a quarter of the total reduction in the public capital programme for 1988.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable reaction to the 1988 rates support grants allocation of £225 million which I announced recently, some of which has been exaggerated and unduly alarmist.  It must first of all be put in perspective against the overall background of both central and local financial resources.</P>
    <P>The rates support grants provided by the Exchequer in general amount to less than one fifth of current revenue accruing to authorities.  This means, for instance, that the reduction in grants for next year amounts to less than 3 per cent of the estimated current account receipts of local authorities in 1987.  Accordingly, talk of draconian cuts and of the survival of councils being in jeopardy is, quite frankly, not correct.  Equally, I must reject the contention that cutbacks should have been avoided in this area. In the context of the overall budgetary situation, there is a very large measure of agreement within this House on the necessity for reduced Exchequer spending, and it is simply wishful thinking for any Deputy to expect that local authority expenditure should somehow be immune from this process or that rate support grants, which represent such a large element of current Government expenditure, should have been inviolate.</P>
    <P>I have undertaken two initiatives which <Col N="979" /> will help considerably in this regard.  Firstly, local authorities were notified some time ago of their individual allocations for the year, the earliest this has been achieved in at least a decade.  At the same time, the prescribed periods for deciding annual estimates in all authorities were brought forward and the process is now under way.  The authorities have been given ample time to consider and to develop co-ordinated budget strategies for next year, which can be spread over the full 12 month period.  Revenue collection can begin from the start of January, thereby greatly improving cashflow compared with recent years.</P>
    <P>The second development involves direct assistance to authorities.  I have already announced details of a new local authority voluntary redundancy scheme under which additional finance will be provided to authorities where reductions in expenditure lead to voluntary redundancy or early retirement of staff.  This further aid will cover the full cost of all lump sum severance payments under the scheme.  However there is an onus on the authorities to maximise savings on manpower costs next year through measures such as natural wastage, redeployment, nonreplacement of staff taking career breaks and economies on expenditure such as travel costs and overtime.</P>
    <P>In summary therefore, it is now up to each elected authority to determine their priorities having regard to the funds available to them and they must allocate the available resources accordingly.  Before leaving this area, I want to make it clear that I am neither complacent about nor satisfied with the present system of funding local authority current expenditure. Deputies will be aware that some time ago I initiated an in-depth review of local finances within my Department with a view to developing proposals for long term reform of the system.  The review is almost completed and once I have considered the outcome, I will put proposals to Government involving changes designed to assure authorities of an adequate and stable level of funding.  I might mention that the future of service <Col N="980" /> charges is being considered in the context of this review and will be decided upon in due course.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has experienced major difficulties in recent years caused by declining levels of private investment.  Despite this it is our largest industry, with the exception of agriculture, directly employing over 70,000 persons.  Construction output in 1987 will exceed £1.7 billion and account for almost 10 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to construction must be dictated by the realities of the marketplace, the scope for action offered by the state of the public finances and the need for public investment. Public investment without regard to need is counterproductive and wasteful. Expenditure and investment programmes must be subject to careful examination and appraisal.  The curtailment and termination of programmes, some of which impact directly or indirectly on the construction industry, are largely related to progress already achieved and changing levels of needs as well as the need to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Clearly, the constraints on Exchequer finances have necessitated radical economies in many investment areas.  While economic considerations are a factor in social infrastructural investment, the need for such investment is also dictated by demographic and social trends.  Major structural adjustments in our population profile necessitate a re-appraisal of capital expenditure over the whole range of the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Government economic policy will boost business confidence and create the conditions necessary for a revival of private investment in construction.  This policy has already produced results.  Interest rates and mortgage rates have declined significantly and growth forecasts for the economy as a whole have been revised upwards.  Output in the commercial and retail sectors of construction in 1987, which is a key indicator of private confidence in the industry, will record its first increase in volume since 1981 and a <Col N="981" /> further rise is forecast for 1988.  Development on the Custom House Docks site, which will commence in the near future, will provide a major boost to the industry as a whole over the next three to five years.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the key developmental role of the construction industry in the economy and the priority of achieving higher levels of private investment in the industry, I established in July 1987 a Construction Industry Development Board representative of a broad range of interests in the industry.  The function of the board is to advise and make recommendations to the Government in order to encourage development, improve efficiency and competitiveness and enable the industry to contribute effectively to national economic and social policies.  The Government value highly the work of the board and will consider all recommendations addressed to them by the board.</P>
    <P>Demand for housing has been in decline for a number of years now.  This depressed demand is reflected in the demand for house purchase loans. Having regard to the latest trends in house purchase and improvement loans advanced by local authorities I am satisfied that the 1987 provision of £175 million for this purpose will be more than adequate and that, in fact, some savings in this provision are likely to arise this year.  Furthermore the number of local authority house purchase loan applications on hand at the end of 1987 is expected to be lower than the 1986 figure of 11,000.  The 1988 provision of £155 million is, therefore, a realistic assessment of the likely requirement for local authority house purchase and improvement loans for next year.</P>
    <P>It is not generally appreciated that local authorities provide one in four of all house purchase loans advanced in this country.  This is a very large market share either by historical standards in this country or by international norms.  Local authorities were empowered under the Small Dwellings Acquisitions Acts to provide loans for house purchase since late in the last century.  It must be said that these <Col N="982" /> house purchase loans, or SDA loans as they are still commonly referred to, have played and continue to play a vital role in the national housing programme. Annuity loans remain the preferred choice of the vast majority of these borrowers and, in fact, in recent times there has been a shift away from the income related loans.  However, we must recognise the fundamental changes that have occurred in recent years in the housing finance market, particularly since the emergence of the commercial banks as major providers of house purchase loans. In the first six months of this year the commercial banks advanced mortgage loans valued at over £126 million compared to only £20 million in a full year in 1983.</P>
    <P>Housing mortgage finance is now more freely available from commercial lending agencies than it has been for many years and the cost of this finance in terms of interest rates has fallen significantly since the 1987 budget.  Information available in my Department shows clearly that building societies already advance a considerable proportion of their mortgage loans to applicants who would otherwise qualify for local authority house purchase loans.  At present bank loans tend to be concentrated in the upper income groups. However, I believe that both banks and building societies have considerable scope for providing loans to many applicants who would otherwise consider they had no alternative but to approach their local authority for a house purchase loan. Deputies will be aware that my Department have initiated discussions with the commercial lending agencies in order to encourage these agencies to make additional mortgage finance available to low income house purchasers.  In recent years there has been a marked trend in other European countries towards greater reliance on private sector funding of the mortgage market, and we must recognise the scope that now exists for positive developments in this direction in this country.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the outcome to these discussions will allow a significant <Col N="983" /> reduction in Exchequer expenditure on house purchase loans in the coming years and, at the same time, secure an adequate supply of mortgages for all income groups in all areas.  I would also be concerned to ensure that any new arrangements do not reduce the capacity of any potential house purchasers to secure home ownership or lead to increased pressure on the local authority housing programme. I hope to be in a position to make a detailed announcement on this matter within the next week or so.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding public expenditure constraints, the Government are committed, as indicated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> to give special emphasis to the housing needs of disadvantaged groups.  Recognising the appalling conditions under which travellers sometimes live, the 1988 provision for residential caravan parks for travellers will be maintained at the same level as 1987.  This will enable about 20 parks to be provided in 1988.</P>
    <P>Voluntary housing organisations play a significant role in providing housing for the elderly and disadvantaged people. Between 1984 and the end of 1987 voluntary organisations will have provided around 350 units of accommodation with a total of £5.5 million in assistance under the scheme of assistance operated by my Department for such bodies.  The Government recognise the special contribution which voluntary organisations can make and intend to facilitate the development of that role.  I have, therefore, considerably increased the capital available for the provision of housing by voluntary groups.  The original 1987 provision for voluntary bodies was increased from £1 million to £2.5 million during the year and a sum of £3 million is provided for 1988.</P>
    <P>During the past few months I have had discussions and correspondence with a number of voluntary and representative organisations concerned with homelessness on legislative proposals for the accommodation of the homeless.  I intend to introduce a new housing Bill in the <Col N="984" /> present session which will, for the first time in housing legislation, provide statutory recognition for the homeless and will ensure that the needs of the homeless will be recognised by housing authorities in the allocation of dwellings in future years. A provision of £400,000 is also made in the Estimates in anticipation of the enactment of the Bill for the recoupment to local authorities of expenditure incurred by them in securing accommodation for homeless persons by voluntary organisations and other means.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months, I have carried out a comprehensive review of the road development programme.  Arising from the review, I have decided to publish within the next few months a blueprint for road development over the next 20 years.  The blueprint will contain:</P>
    <P> (1) an outline of the assessment of medium/long-term needs relating to national, regional, urban and county roads:</P>
    <P>(2)  an outline of the proposed long-term strategy, including the funding from the State, local authorities, the EC and the private sector: and</P>
    <P>(3) a tentative list of major improvement schemes to be commenced between now and 1997. </P>
    <P>I recently announced my intention to set up a new body which will be responsible for the improvement of the national road network.  The blueprint will provide the benchmark for this body in formulating its plan for future national road development.</P>
    <P>The provision for road improvement and maintenance works in 1988 is £150 million, £120 million for improvement works and £30 million for maintenance. This is a substantial sum especially next year when in order to improve the public finances reductions have had to be made in most public expenditure areas. However, progress will be maintained in 1988 at a reasonably satisfactory level on several major improvement schemes including:</P>
    <P>Tallaght Road/Galway Road section <Col N="985" /> of the Dublin Ring Road and the Lucan and Chapelizod by-passes in Dublin;</P>
    <P>Glanmire by-pass and Southern Ring Road in Cork,</P>
    <P>by-passes of Athlone, Bunratty, Cahir, Killarney and Newtownmountkennedy and</P>
    <P>bridges in Limerick and Sligo. </P>
    <P>In addition to state funded projects, construction will also start early next year on the Galway Road/Navan Road section of the Dublin ring road which has a rolled up cost of £30 million and which will be fully funded by the private sector at no cost or risk to the State.  In June last, I gave my approval in principle to Dublin County Council's proposal to enter into an agreement with West Link Toll Bridge Limited for the construction of this project. This agreement was signed by both parties on Friday last and I expect to be giving my formal consent to the agreement within a matter of days.  This partnership between the State and the private sector marks the beginning of a new era in public road construction.  I am hopeful that private funds will be forthcoming for other projects in the future especially with low inflation and reduced interest rates as a result of Government policies.</P>
    <P>The national roads authority, the details of which I will be announcing shortly will have as part of its brief the attraction not just of further private finance and investment but it will also seek further funding from the EC and further funding from tolls and any other method they can find particularly in order to inject further investment into the building of national primary and secondary roads.  It is my intention that we will meet the deadline to accommodate the EC requirements over a limited number of years.  That will be the task of the national roads authority and I expect that initiative to be welcomed by all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the improvement provision, I have also decided that the county road strengthening grant to each <Col N="986" /> county council will be maintained at the 1987 level, totalling £15 million.  I have also decided that the block grant for roads allocated to each local authority will also remain at the 1987 level, totalling £20.2 million.  I am sure that all the rural Deputies will give a cheer because that decision has been taken.  For the first time this year, and to be continued next year, we will get a suitable level of funding to maintain the infrastructure of 92 per cent of county roads and other regional roads in an appropriate state of maintenance and repair.</P>
      <P>My decisions to maintain the level of these grants at their 1987 level were influenced by the deterioration in the condition of county and regional roads and by my concern for employment. Heavy commercial traffic has taken its toll on these roads which were not built to cope with such traffic.  Local authorities have already made a good start with the county road improvement programme this year and I expect considerable progress to be made on this programme in 1988.  The roadworks undertaken with the assistance of these grants also provide significant employment potential in the roads area.  This is the area where the biggest number of road workers are employed.  That was one of the significant factors in my making the decision to maintain the level of funding which was increased this year and will be maintained at that level for next year.</P>
      <P>The provision for the local improvements scheme in 1988 is also being maintained at the 1987 level of £4 million.  This provision will permit the further acceleration of the programme of works on non-public roads in the less favoured areas of the west of Ireland where many small holdings have no proper access to a public road.  This increase in funding was welcomed by all shades of political comment last year and I am satisfied that it will get the same kind of reception this year at the estimates meetings that will take place in local authorities between now and 16 November this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say there is good news on the financial front for the local authority fire service.  I am allocating £6.5 <Col N="987" /> million for the development of the service in 1988, an increase of £1.8 million or 38 per cent on 1987.  This substantial increase highlights the Government's commitment to this vitally important service, particularly in these difficult economic times.  The funds will be used to finance existing projects under construction and to start a number of new projects.  It will also enable fire authorities to purchase fire appliances, together with other fire-fighting, telecommunications and rescue equipment. It is not the intention of the Minister for the Environment to see a rundown on the emergency services under his control.</P>
    <P>The Estimates include a provision of £600,000 by way of grant-in-aid to the Customs House Docks Development Authority for current expenditure which will cover all administrative and running expenses.  The public capital programme includes a further £2 million to meet the costs of capital works on the site.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that, as a result of the Government's economic policies and their positive approach towards creating a climate which will stimulate investment confidence, the development of proposals for the Customs House Dock site is on target.  The Authority are now evaluating a number of development proposals for the re-development of the site and an announcement will be made shortly on the successful proposal.  Construction work valued at about £250 million is expected to commence early in 1988&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In addition, the international and national support for the international financial services centre at the site is very encouraging.  It is an indication of the success of Government policies in promoting confidence in the economy.  The development of the site is important as it is anticipated that it has <Col N="988" /> the potential for the generation of some 7,500 jobs there over the next three to four years.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the problem of dereliction in our urban areas.  Derelict buildings and derelict sites detract enormously from the appearance and attractiveness of our towns and cities in the eyes of inhabitants, tourists and potential industrials alike.  Positive and aggressive action is required if the problem is to be tackled and resolved in the foreseeable future.  The existing Derelict Sites Act has proved inadequate and I believe, therefore, that a new and comprehensive legislative framework is needed.  Work on the preparation of the new legislation is nearing completion and I hope to be in a position to introduce the measure in the near future.</P>
      <P>Finally, my Department, local authorities and the semi-State and other corporate bodies under the aegis of the Department will be preparing their work programmes in accordance with the Estimates before the House.  Every effort will be made to ensure that all essential services are maintained at a high level and that other services will be provided in the most efficient and cost effective manner.  In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in commending the Government motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister for the Environment is in the House I would like to draw his attention to a few of the points he made.  I agree with him on the dereliction but that extends far more to the countryside now and the Minister must know that coming from the west; I come from the mid-west.  I ask him to <Col N="989" /> consider putting more money into rural housing in the future.  I know the Minister made the case that there is sufficient housing stock in the country now, but I can assure him that there are far from adequate funds available to most local authorities for the provision of rural housing for those who would like to continue to live in the country, who can provide their own sites and their own water supply and who would be responsible for maintenance afterwards.  Many of these people have been facilitated by being given houses in towns which would otherwise have gone to townspeople but within a short few years those very people want to move out to the country again.  I earnestly ask the Minister to consider this point.  I have made very little progress on the number of representations I have received and I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this problem to the Minister this morning.</P>
      <P>As Progressive Democrat spokesman on Food and Agriculture, I agree with the Minister that one cannot be for cuts and against them at the same time.  One cannot have the best of both worlds.  I, and my party, are generally in favour of the thrust of the cuts in Government spending.  I do not accept that the Government have stolen our clothes.  I believe they were left with no alternative when they took office.  What has been done up to now can be compared to a farmer who borrows money for development, buys a motorcar, has a holiday and keeps the rest of the money to meet the initial repayments.  This sums up what we have had in general Government policy over a long number of years.  When difficulties came in terms of repayments we sold the productive assets &mdash; just as the farmer sells a few cows &mdash; to keep up the standard of living and put a brave face on foolish policies embarked on earlier. We cannot any more afford to have Government by auction, with the public faced with a total bill of £2,400 million a year in annual repayments to pay for so-called development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled when I came into this House to find that at least £1,500 million <Col N="990" /> will have to be paid to financial institutions in the country annually, that is almost 40 per cent of all taxes.  The policies were intended to raise the standard of living for all but at the end of the day they have made the rich richer and the poor poorer.  Those in the workplace have to work harder, be more productive and pay more taxes for those that are in the position of being able to manipulate finances and control financial resources. Indeed Deputy Mac Giolla surprised me yesterday when he suggested that the way out of capitalism is to borrow more money.  The borrowing of money is what sustains capitalism.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he would like to see Ireland at the forefront, not a depressed nation on the periphery of Europe.  I fully subscribe to those sentiments, but we must examine our own conscience when we make statments like that.  In reality we are treating part of our own country in the same way as Europe is treating us.  We are now looking at the poorer agricultural areas, at the western counties in particular, the way that Europe looks at us generally.  We are trying to keep all the resources for development within the Pale.  We are denuding the countryside of population and resources that would sustain and make viable a rural economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that essential services will be maintained.  If that is so, what has been happening over many years?  If we are able now to maintain expanding essential services with virtually half the staff, what an indictment of us that we have been running the country with twice as many staff for a long number of years.  The shake-out in industry came ten years ago.  The increased cost of Government utilities because of the labour content in the services which the State was offering meant that those who were self-employed or in industry had to do away with employment to meet these increased costs.</P>
    <P>I would have to challenge the Taoiseach on his assertion that it is untrue that administration has been protected at the expense of services, particularly in relation to agriculture.  While our exports <Col N="991" /> have been showing a favourable trend, agricultural exports as a percentage overall have been declining, and those of the multinationals have been expanding. There is a danger of not striking a balance and the figures do not tell the whole story. I suppose the best substitute for working for a foreign company abroad is working for a foreign company in Ireland.  One can get home every night but there is not very much difference in terms of the value of such jobs to the economy.</P>
    <P>The figures do not reflect the true position. It is the position that you make the most profit in the country where you pay the least tax.  There is a large element of that in the figures now being used to try to explain to the public at large, who know differently, that things are improving, that the imports bill is falling and the exports bill rising.  The fall in the level of imports is a great guide to the actual fall in the level of consumerism which we have had here over a number of years. False assumptions have been built into it. I know that in my area the number of houses that will be connected this year to the electricity grid in the mid-west region is half what it was five years ago.  I know from statistics that the sale of new cars is half what it was five or six years ago. That, in itself, deflects more money in the short term into the consumer non-durable market and gives the false impression that things are picking up.  It is only a switching of resources from more costly goods to cheaper goods and has a short term effect which gives the lie to the belief that things are much better then they really are.</P>
    <P>In the United States 90 per cent of the market depends on internal consumerism. There must be some stimulus to consumer spending in Ireland.  We cannot continue to be in a position in which we pay more tax while those in multinational companies have tax holidays. Those of us who work at home in Irish companies or, generally speaking, in any job, whether in the Civil Service, the goods and services industry or the manufacturing industry, are now in a position where we cannot stimulate the <Col N="992" /> economy about us because we have no spending power.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking on the motion noting the Estimates, said that schemes that have outlived their usefulness or are not serving purposes that are identified as affordable could now be counted as unaffordable luxuries.  In this situation I should like to address myself to agriculture. The Estimate for Agriculture this year showed a reduction of 18 per cent.  It is more like 25 per cent because within those figures there is a £10 million takeover to pay in 1988 for certain schemes such as the farm modernisation scheme and the scheme for installation aid for young farmers.  In fact, the Minister in a circular letter actually admits that and I admire him for it.  In reality, it takes £10 million more out of circulation and the real reduction in the agriculture vote based on those figures is more like 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the Government and the EC are withdrawing their support relentlessly from agriculture.  One has only to look at the figures to see that in 1970 some 15.5 per cent of Exchequer spending was spent on agriculture.  This year we have the lowest Exchequer Estimate expenditure of 2 per cent.  I cannot understand how an industry that relates to 40 per cent of our people in terms of direct or indirect incomes should now stand for such a poor Exchequer return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For clarity, did the Deputy say 1970?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1970.  Our EC partners and, in particular, our friends in Brussels who see this country as having a very high dependence on agriculture&mdash; seven times more, I believe, than any of our EC partners in terms especially of the products which are now subject to quota restriction &mdash; would find it incomprehensible that at a time when we should be supporting our agriculture we are actually cutting Exchequer support for it.  I have heard many examples from all sides in this House in relation to Dutch agriculture of how tremendous an industry it is, but that industry is recognised for the <Col N="993" /> contribution it makes to that nation.  It is recognised also in the contribution that that state makes to agriculture by way of finance, encouragement and many aids, mostly hidden from view.  They recognise that agriculture must have a high level of investment if there is to be a high level of return.  Their incomes, based on 1986 figures, are about five times our income per farm before taxation.</P>
      <P>If we are serious, there is no point in retreating from an industry which we have in place, which is traditional, in which we have a huge investment as a nation and, at the same time, scouring the world looking for multinational companies to come here.  We are quite prepared to put money behind them to create jobs for many people who have been thrown off the land because we have failed or are unwilling to create policies and Exchequer support to bring these people through these difficult times and to develop an industry which will give them alternative employment in a national context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the ACOT-AFT merger. The Minister knows the figures and has been honest enough in his circular to spell out the position.  I put it to him that some months ago we were talking about a 10 per cent cut and in the context of his meetings with the people involved 500 people or about a 25 per cent cut was mentioned.  Now it has gone up to a 43 per cent cut.  If we are in the position to cut 43 per cent, or take 1,000 people out of 2,200 in an employment that we are saying is going to be an engine for growth and a future part of our economy, are we then saying that Government policy over a number of years has created a position where we had two people doing one man's job?  I cannot find any other explanation as to why we should cut back at this time.  If, on the one hand, we are saying we are supporting agriculture &mdash; I accept that and I accept the Government's intent in supporting agriculture &mdash; why are we saying on the other hand that we are going to get rid of 1,000 people out of 2,200 on the education and research side?  Are we saying that for <Col N="994" /> every job available it was Government policy to have two men doing it?</P>
    <P>On the ACOT-AFT merger, and I am sure that the Minister knows much more about that than I do, I put it to him that it is very difficult to merge a research branch and an essentially teaching branch.  They are absolutely different things.  In terms of economy and in difficult times I accept his point in having to look for savings in overheads, but to merge totally the identity of ACOT and AFT is to discard the research side of the merger.  If you have to have research you must have it as distinct from education. AFT could play a far more positive role. We must involve them far more at the coal face, which is a euphemism or a buzz word in this House.  We must involve them far more in industry, in solving real problems.  We must get them into a position where they can justify their retention, where they will be part of the economy and will contribute directly to the creation of new products and the solving of technical problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has avowed it as Government policy to create 10,000 new jobs to make Ireland the food provider of Europe in a clean environment.  I accept that all of those things amount to the best aspirations for the future of agriculture. On the other hand, if you say that, are you saying that we will have no new products, that we will maintain our slaughter house mentality and that there will be no added value for our products?  The only added value I see in the foreseeable future for agricultural produce is the added value which the farmer can gain by spending less.  Saying that we will put added value on products that will give the farmer a better return for primary produce is a pious aspiration especially when we consider that we have thrown those with initiative, those who would be a help to the industry, on the ash pit, forgotten them and consigned them to getting out of an industry to which many of them have given their life's work, whether in an experimental or professional capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> I would now like to deal with disadvantaged areas.  Undertakings were given in this House during the past seven to eight months that disadvantaged areas would be reclassified.  The farmer organisations were misled into thinking that our special circumstances in respect of quotas were now being fully recognised in Brussels.  I was appalled to see that there is to be an 8 per cent cut in funding this year.  I am inclined to the view that all the debates and negotiations which were supposed to have been got out of the way never took place.  The Minister's Department have made no provision for any additions.  As regards reclassification, one thing I have learned from this House is that if you talk long enough about something it will eventually go away.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the position in regard to the Euro-loans.  The provision in the Estimates is to cover outstanding commitments.  Efforts are being made to reduce interest rates and I welcome these fervently.  High interest rates have proved to be a great disincentive for investment within farming.  I also ask the Minister to have another look at the levies which now amount to 5 per cent of turnover.  They amount to a 5 per cent tax on production.  Following the doing away of the funding for CBF, the intention is now to increase these levies. No matter what form of accounts is used the levies amount to about a 25 per cent tax on gross income, that is before income tax.  State bodies should do the work they are supposed to be doing in a professional manner and achieve results. If they fail to do so let us disband the organisations and withdraw the levies and say to the food manufacturers that the task of selling is solely their responsibility. The Minister cannot continue to take £50 million to £60 million in levies out of agriculture each year and merely provide an intervention type sales outlet.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the tuberculosis eradication scheme.  The Minister asserts that there will be no further charges this year in respect of this scheme.  I am glad to hear that but I am <Col N="996" /> disheartened and dismayed to hear that certain offices had little or no funds remaining in August to continue with the two monthly rounds of testing.  This happened despite the amount of money which was collected in milk and beef levies this year.  The Minister gave me an undertaking in this House some months ago that there would be a full round of testing and that the problem of tuberculosis would be got under control once and for all.  I accept that the Minister plans a rejig of the management and a different playing of the cards but they only amount to things on paper and what matters most to those who are paying the piper is that they can call the tune, that what they want is that we get rid of the tuberculosis menace which has cost this country so much in terms of exports and which has caused so many problems for farmers.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to see that there is no mention of regional policy in the Estimates.  Regional policy is being promoted to the Minister and his Department as being important for the future development of rural Ireland in terms of supplementing incomes and providing job opportunities for an industry which is in decline, for areas that are affected by quotas, particularly milk quotas.  A recent Government announcement, with no explanation whatsoever given, said that the Regional policy provision, which has doubled in size this year precisely because of the factors I have mentioned would be used exclusively in Dublin this year and next year.  I realise that Dublin has many problems and I am not one to drive a divide between rural and urban communities.  I am all for bringing them together.  This divide has been cultivated by certain sections for their own ends and has amounted to a blight on our primary industry.  I ask the Minister to have another look at the regional policy in terms of how it affects agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that marketing is most important and that he intends making agriculture an engine of growth but in the Estimates he has provided very little fuel for that engine in 1988.  I accept the constraints within which he finds himself. I find it hard to explain to those <Col N="997" /> people in agriculture who ask me how it is that our major industry, an industry that embraces 40 per cent of our people, now receives the smallest contribution from the Exchequer, particularly at a time when things are very difficult for the industry generally.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to remember the undertakings he gave at the time the Estimates were being discussed last year. I might revert to the innovative side of the industry, which is where most money is made, and ask the Minister to bear that in mind in terms of An Foras Talúntais. Indeed I would ask him to realise that advice and innovation are poles apart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth of public expenditure in recent years could not be allowed to continue.  As a consequence our inflation and interest rates were way out of line with those of our competitors. This meant we were losing out on valuable export markets.  No sector of our economy suffered more from these disadvantages and burdens than the agricultural sector.  No sector stands to gain more from the Government's policy to reduce public expenditure than the farming community.</P>
      <P>The positive action we are taking will restore order to the public finances and put the economy &mdash; particularly the vital agricultural and food sector &mdash; on the road to expansion and development.  Our strategy is to reduce the country's enormous dependence on borrowing by curtailing public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main aims of our first budget last spring was to substantially reduce interest rates.  We have made considerable progress.  The benefits of lower interest rates are of crucial importance to our economy in general and to agriculture in particular.  Every 1 per cent cut in interest rates is worth £20 million to Irish farmers.  We are now in the rather strange position that all of the domestic influences promoted by Government policy are for downward interest rates while the external influences, to a considerable extent, are for upward interest rates.  The <Col N="998" /> House might contrast that with the position over the last four and a half years when the external influences were benign and for downward interest rates and when domestic pressure, through Government policies, was for upward interest rates.  The House will see, therefore, that there has been a dramatic change in the impact, particularly on the vital agricultural sector, of Government policies.</P>
    <P>There is general acceptance among the farming community that, as a Government, we must pursue our strategy until order is fully restored to the public finances. I am greatly encouraged that farming interests recognise and acknowledge that this Government are pursuing the correct approach.  Indeed it has to be said that the farming organisations were among the first, if not the first, to advocate a policy of clear and decisive action on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Lower interest rates, a stable exchange rate, lower inflation, stabilisation of the national debt/GNP ratio and its subsequent reduction to a sustainable level, halting and reversing the flow of capital out of the economy, lower and more equitable personal taxation, all of these constitute the fiscal and monetary policy of the Government under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Already significant results have been achieved in many sectors.  The greatly improved fiscal and monetary climate will stimulate investment confidence and greater economic activity, maintain existing and create new employment.</P>
    <P>Together the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the 1988 Estimates reflect the single-minded determination on the part of the Government to rebuild our economy.  We have already restored confidence at home and abroad.  With this new confidence we can and must confront the enormous task of job creation essential in ensuing years.  In particular we must create jobs in the productive sector, in this instance especially, the agriculture and food sector.</P>
    <P>From some of the comments made over the past week one might imagine that total expenditure on agriculture and <Col N="999" /> food in 1988 would be confined to the net provision in the Book of Estimates, a figure of £149 million.  The reality is that in 1988 my Department will spend a total of the order of £1,600 million.  The fact that the net Exchequer contribution is now less than 10 per cent of the total is simply a reflection of some of the benefits of membership of the EC and of the priority which this Government attach, and will continue to attach, to that membership. I acknowledge that each successive Government have done so, but I want to reiterate at this point that it is, of course, crucial to our whole development role in agriculture and food.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCoy made an objective and reasoned analysis in the course of which he made some fair comment and perhaps some fair criticism also.  But I would be entitled to say that it is not reasonable to compare the actual Exchequer Estimate for agriculture in 1970, at 15 per cent, with that &mdash; as he puts it now &mdash; at 2 per cent of total in 1987, the big difference being, of course, that in 1970 we were not members of the EC and were not benefiting from the very major contributions under the FEOGA guarantee scheme.  The Deputy himself will recognise that, to say the least, the comparison is not quite valid.</P>
    <P>The fact that the net Exchequer contribution is now less than 10 per cent of the total is simply a reflection of some of the benefits of membership of the EC. But the huge spending by my Department in connection with the EC cannot be ignored.  That expenditure is incurred to benefit the agriculture and food industry, including Irish farmers.  The expansion of the agriculture and food industry, of course, is a central element of the Government's economic policy.  The substantial expenditure to which I have referred will contribute to the achievement of that objective.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental to the Government's strategy for recovery that public finances be placed on a sound footing as a prerequisite for economic expansion and job creation.  We simply cannot afford the level of public services that has prevailed <Col N="1000" /> to date.  For as long as public expenditure and, in consequence, taxation and borrowing, remain at their present levels, productive activity in the economy will be stifled and we will not achieve the recovery in output and employment this Government are determined to bring about.  A full and thorough review of all items of public expenditure has been undertaken by the Government with a view to establishing priorities in the allocation of financial resources and providing cost-effective services which will give maximum returns to our economy. As part of this process the Government are taking steps to rationalise all State services in order to ensure that there is an elimination of duplication or overlapping and that no resources are absorbed in unnecessary administration.</P>
    <P>In line with those aims the Government decided to amalgamate An Foras Talúntais and ACOT into a single body. This step is designed to ensure better co-ordination and cost effectiveness of research, advisory and educational services in agriculture.  For 1988 a single allocation of £20 million has been made for agricultural research, advisory and educational services in place of the former separate provisions for An Foras Talúntais and ACOT.  That represents a reduction of approximately £15 million, or some 40 per cent of the total amount, provided by the Exchequer to these bodies in 1987 by way of grant in aid.  The new authority &mdash; and I suggest it is that and its priorities on which we should focus henceforth &mdash; will be created by the amalgamation of An Foras Talúntais and ACOT and will provide for services in agricultural research, education and advice.</P>
    <P>Priorities in these areas of activity will be subject to approval by the Minister. The new body will be required to secure outside funding by way of charges for services, to the maximum degree possible, following up on what was already agreed in any event in relation to ACOT and indeed by my predecessor and myself in relation to charges for services, where possible.  The aim will be to ensure that services will be geared to the essential <Col N="1001" /> development needs of the agriculture and food industry, including the application of the latest technological advances. Priority in the allocation of resources will be given to training of young entrants to farming and to research activities related to post-farm gate operations.  The special priority being given to entrants to agriculture will not be to the exclusion of the advisory services as some suggest but rather will ensure that this advice will be put to best effect by better trained farmers.  Knowledge is as vital to agriculture as to any other sector in this era of rapid technological change and the new authority will focus particularly on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Because of the constraints on agricultural production in the European Community the main focus of research activity by the new body will be directed to the post-farm stage, especially in the food sector.  This reflects the Government's recognition of the enormous potential which exists for the development of the food industry.  The National Food Centre which is being established at Dunsinea will bring together the relevant staff and resources of An Foras Talúntais and the IIRS with a view to providing a cost-effective service to the food industry funded to a substantial degree by the industry itself.  The new body will be required to develop fully commercial consultancy services for a range of farming and agri-business activities.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the single new body will require legislation.  This is being prepared as a matter of priority and I hope to introduce it shortly so that the new body can be in operation at the beginning of 1988.  The severe financial constraints limit the financial resources that can be made available to the new body and, as a result, it will be necessary to bring about a substantial reduction in staff.  I regret that such a reduction has to be made but if we are to succeed in our efforts to reduce borrowing and taxation and put the economy on the road to sound expansion and progress certain decisions cannot be avoided.  Any staff becoming redundant can, of course, avail <Col N="1002" /> of the special redundancy early retirement package recently announced by the Government.  The ultimate aim is to set in place a smaller organisation geared to provide the services which the developing and expanding agricultural and food industry will require.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some misapprehension concerning some public statements that I was apparently understood to have made.  I never indicated in any statement any figure of the order of 500 redundancies as being projected for the new authority.  Others may have anticipated that figure but I deliberately and prudently avoided any confirmation of it.  I regret that an interpretation of my lack of confirmation may have given rise to a misunderstanding.</P>

I, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, and the Government generally, in line with the reality of the Estimates and taking account of the arrangements for redundancy in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> will take every effective action to minimise any personal impact on the staff concerned.</P>

      <P>Some of the comments about the staff reductions that will be necessary in An Foras Talúntais and ACOT have referred as well to the levels and costs of staff in my Department.  I welcome constructive suggestions on how manning levels in the Department can be reduced but these must be considered <Col N="1003" /> against the background of the whole range of departmental functions.  The role of the Department is not simply confined to passing out cheques to any sector. If that were the role of the officials and advisers in the Department of Agriculture and Food I could discharge that role by recruiting young kids, even without the benefit of second level education. My Department deal with an area where there is urgent need to be in line with rapid technological change and play an important role in the European Community. It is wrong to construe the role of that Department as representing a channel for passing through funds.  It is much more than that; if it were not, it could not justify itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have taken 15 signatures previously but I assure the Deputy it takes a lot less now.  I hope by the time I am finished it will take only one signature, which is all that is ever required.  I have not had any previous indication on that matter.  I welcome constructive suggestions in how manning levels in the Department can be reduced but these must be considered against the background of the whole range of the departmental functions.  This covers not only the payment of grants and the provision of services but also a broad variety of regulatory functions and the maintenance of adequate controls on Exchequer and European expenditure. Some of the comments have ignored those functions and simply failed to give the total picture.  For example, it is incorrect to say that staff numbers in the Department have not been reduced. Staffing levels have, in fact, been reduced by about one-fifth since 1982.  The number serving has fallen from 5,164 at 30 April 1982 to 4,338 at 30 April 1987 and to 4,210 at the end of last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drop of 954, or some 19 per cent, has been spread across all grades up to and including senior management, and <Col N="1004" /> contrary to the suggestion that the administrative and clerical grades have not been affected the fact is that these grades have contributed their fair share.  The downward trend continues under the current restrictions on recruitment and the Department have already identified some further posts as surplus to requirements. The recently announced early retirement package has been offered to the staff concerned.  The 1988 pay provision takes into account a reduction of over 1,000 since 1982.  The tailoring of staff to work needs is a policy I intend to continue in line with overall Government policy.</P>
    <P>As regards the statement that the Department's pay and travelling expenses bill is more than one-third of the Vote, I must point out that the comparison relates to the net Estimate only and ignores completely gross expenditure, expenditure which is fully funded by the EC and expenditure in the purchase of intervention products which is funded out of borrowings.  Indeed, the net Estimate of £149 million for 1988 represents less than 10 per cent of the total departmental expenditure for next year, which as I have already said is expected to be as much as £1,600 million.</P>
    <P>It will be my priority to maximise the contribution to agricultural and farm development from the European Community, both in terms of FEOGA guarantees and FEOGA guidance and structure funds.  I think I can claim that many of the actions I have taken and some of the schemes I have announced relating to pigmeat investment, meat industry investment and structures, apart from the price support structure for the dairy sector, have contributed significantly to the improvement in farm incomes in the past year.  It will be my intention to continue in that direction.</P>
    <P>In the context of a total expenditure for my Department of £1,600 million, staffing costs will represent about 4 per cent and even that has to be considered against the background of the Department's wide range of developmental control and regulatory functions.</P>
    <P>A substantial item in the Estimate is <Col N="1005" /> the allocation of £31.6 million for disease eradication.  This will allow a full programme of testing to be carried out next year.  There will be a comprehensive monitor test of the national herd, supplemented by special programmes in badly affected areas.  These latter programmes will be concentrated in the midlands where the TB problem is most acute but will include also other areas where TB gives cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The national herd will also be monitored for brucellosis and the policy of depopulating infected herds will continue. As far as brucellosis is concerned, we have some 40 herds in Munster still infected and, while fresh outbreaks tend to occur, the situation is fully under control.</P>
    <P>The TB situation is more complex, with considerable progress being recorded in many counties and some setbacks in others.  The overall situation at present with some 5,000 herds &ldquo;locked up&rdquo;, or an average of less than three reactors being recorded for every 1,000 animals tested, is more favourable than had been anticipated, especially in the aftermath of the limited programme operated in 1986.  The situation gives cause for some degree of optimism about what might be achieved over the next few years and confirms the need to put in place sound arrangements that will give a major boost to the eradication effort in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a more positive outlook generally.  Rather than having an essentially sterile debate about why TB has not been eradicated in the past, I believe we must draw together the energies, skills and experience of farmers, vets and officials in a combined effort to resume the aggressive drive against the disease which was abruptly halted in 1986.  This is the motivation behind my positive response to the farming organisations for changes in the eradication measures.  As I proposed to the bodies concerned some weeks ago, farmers' and vets' representatives would be given a greater role in the schemes by way of their membership of a new management <Col N="1006" /> structure and greater flexibility of decision-making would be facilitated by the establishment of an executive office and the appointment of a national manager for the schemes.  The approach I proposed would not require new legislation and is founded on the conviction that each party concerned, farmer, vet and official, can work together in a common cause while, at the same time, recognising the rights and obligations of the other.  In the final analysis, the central role of the schemes in safeguarding animal and human health and in preserving our substantial export interests requires that the Minister has the final say and the proposed arrangements will provide for this in an effective and orderly way.</P>
    <P>I have had constructive discussions with the organisations concerned.  We are in a period of major and rapid change. They are considering my proposals and I am hopeful of having the new arrangements in place by the start of the 1988 programme next April.</P>
    <P>Another substantial item in the Estimate for Agriculture and Food is the provision of £20 million being made to cover expenditure under the farm improvement programme, the farm modernisation scheme, the scheme of installation aid for young farmers and the western measures.  This capital provision represents an increase of 37 per cent on the provision of these measures in 1987. I hope the House takes note of that.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge what Deputy McCoy said but when that money runs out that will end the payments for 1988.  Of course the delayed payments will be carried forward into 1989; they will not be terminated.  I want to state publicly that because of financial constraints, I had to take this decision and if there is a delay in payments in 1987 it will be because of those financial constraints. We cannot resume the normal rhythm until 1988.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As regards grant payments under these schemes this year, Deputies will be aware that some delays are occurring in making such payments. That is because the level of take-up of these schemes has been higher than expected and this puts some strain on the limited resources available.  However, I would like to assure all farmers who are awaiting grant payments that they will receive their grants with the minimum delay possible.  In the interests of fairness, I have arranged that claims for payment under each scheme will be dealt with strictly in order of receipt of the certified claims in the Department's headquarters.</P>
      <P>The farm improvement programme has been proved remarkably successful in encouraging farmers to carry out necessary investment with a view to increasing the efficiency of their farming operations.  To date, over 17,000 farmers have been admitted to the programme and over 10,000 investment projects have been approved involving grant aid of over £15 million.  This is quite a remarkable achievement bearing in mind that the programme has been operational for only 20 months and in view of the production constraints such as the quotas on milk.</P>
      <P>While the farm modernisation scheme ended in September 1986, grants continue to be payable on investment included in plans which were approved prior to that.  Expenditure can be expected to tail off over the next few years as plans expire.  The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was terminated on 31 March 1987 but applications received up to that date will be processed.  Proposals for the reintroduction of the aid have been put to the Government by the farm organisations &mdash; particularly by Macra na Feirme, and, as indicated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> these are being examined sympathetically in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, £20 million is being provided for these various investment schemes for 1988.  That is the maximum <Col N="1008" /> that could be made available.  The Government have decided that, if and when it is exhausted during 1988, payments under the schemes will cease and will have to await the provision of funds for the following year.</P>
    <P>While the amount of £63.6 million allocated to the disadvantaged areas scheme next year shows a reduction of some £5 million on 1987, this is largely because special weather payments were made this year under the 1986 scheme.  A further reduction of £1 million arises from the lowering of the off-farm income limit of an applicant and/or spouse from £6,400 to £5,200.  This will apply in 1988.  This was the fairest way to achieve saving as the payments made under the schemes are essentially income supplements designed to keep farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  Farmers with off-farm incomes over £5,200 need these income supplements less than those with no off-farm income at all or with off-farm incomes below that level.  In other words, the money available is being concentrated on the more deserving farmers. In connection with the disadvantaged areas, I should also say that we are pursuing with the EC Commission the question of securing an increase in the rate of FEOGA contribution to the cost of the headage grants and more rapid payment. On that basis, providing for improved rates of grants in the different areas and for extending the areas will be possible if the outcome is successful.</P>
    <P>Turning now to CBF, the Government have decided that in the present climate of financial stringency the grant-in-aid to CBF will be phased out over two years. The allocation for 1988 is £515,000 and no grant-in-aid will be paid in the following years.  I would like to pay tribute to the excellent work which CBF are doing in promoting beef and lamb exports.  Considerable successes have been achieved particularly in the area of marketing value-added products direct to retail outlets. This is especially true of the UK and German markets but, while a start has been made, much remains to be done. It is important that CBF's promotional work should continue in the years ahead <Col N="1009" /> as we try to increase our foothold in Community markets.  CBF already obtain the bulk of their financing from the meat and livestock industry and I think most people would accept that in the straitened budgetary situation in which we find ourselves it is not unreasonable to ask the meat and livestock industry which profits from the CBF activities to fully finance those activities.</P>
    <P>In my remarks I have concentrated on a few items in the Estimate for my Department which have been the subject of some comments in recent days.  Thus, I have not dealt with some of the broader developments in the agricultural sector. In this connection I might point out that at the present time intensive negotiations are taking place at EC level on proposals for adjustments to the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Community's critical budgetary situation, the Commission have put forward wide-ranging proposals for modifications to the support arrangements for most products.  The aim of the measures proposed &mdash; the agricultural stabilisers as they are called &mdash; is to control expenditure and the effect will be to limit support and make the agricultural industry more responsive to market conditions. The outcome of the negotiations will have major implications for the future operation of the Common Agricultural Policy and so the ongoing discussions are of the utmost importance to this country.  Another important EC aspect is the efforts we are making to secure improved levels of EC financing for our various structural measures which I have mentioned, including the western package and drainage programmes, and the integrated rural programme which is of vital importance.  The maximisation of EC receipts is of particular importance in enabling us to expand the scope and range of structural investment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the outturn of the agricultural industry this year.  The year has, on the whole, been a good one for the industry by comparison with previous years, but I will make no further comment on that.  Livestock prices have been well maintained and the <Col N="1010" /> harvest has been the best for some years. The food industry has continued to develop and more and more of our agricultural output is being processed into added-value products.  Farm income will be well up &mdash; probably by about 15 per cent according to the latest estimates. Feed supplies for the winter are the best for many years and this will give a good start for 1988.</P>
    <P>The agriculture and food industry is a major beneficiary of the steps the Government are taking to put the economy on a sound footing.  The basic approach being followed has already been of special benefit to the farming community and they have everything to gain from its continuation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that because of our natural advantages, because of the capacity of our farmers and those engaged in the agri-food sector and particularly because of the knowledge base of our young farmers, the direction we are following will enable us not just to react any more, or complain constantly or point to what is happening elsewhere but to demonstrate more by action, a co-ordinated approach and a degree of confidence and co-operation which I am glad to acknowledge is available to me as Minister for Agriculture and Food here and to the farming organisations, but to compete with and beat the best.  The Estimates in their proper context are a very important step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a relatively unpartisan debate so far.  Certainly, the parts of it I have heard have been free of party invective, or almost entirely free and I do not want to spoil the happy party atmosphere by saying anything disagreeable. Nevertheless, in case those who come after us, outside commentators or the historians of later ages, think that some kind of ceo draíochta has engulfed the House, has blotted out from memory events of the recent past, I cannot let the occasion go without drawing attention to a remarkable political act.  It is the amnesty awarded by the Government to themselves.  It is the first amnesty in the history of the world <Col N="1011" /> awarded to criminals by the delinquents themselves rather than by those who had them soundly under lock and key.</P>
      <P>They have given themselves a clean slate; and I must hand it to them, despite all the whinging they indulged in when they were in Opposition about the &ldquo;slick public relations&rdquo; which the Coalition were supposed to have at their disposal, that they have succeeded in creating an atmosphere in the country such that one feels it is almost bad manners to draw attention to the degree to which their own behaviour in Opposition contributed to the very environment and the public atmosphere which underlies all our difficulties. They did anything they could to soup up public resentment against the economy, to goad the people into indiscipline, to awaken and encourage among them the idea that if they shouted long enough and demonstrated hard enough they would get anything, however unreasonable.  Nothing on those lines was left undone.  Every advantage of a short-term cheap kind which the party opposite were able to draw out of &mdash; I will not say the Government's difficulties &mdash; the national difficulties, they recklessly and remorselessly drew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Memories are short; but short though they are, I know that every Member, and people outside, will recall the general burden of the criticism which the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition had to face for the last four and a half years before the change of Government.  They were described as monetarist, Thatcherite and said to be only interested in keeping the accounts; that a well-ruled ledger was more important to them than the happiness of the school leavers, than the prospects for the economy.  That was the song which was being sung.  In case any Member wants chapter and verse or thinks I am inventing this, or in case their own memory is getting a bit dulled and needs to be reminded about what was being said, I should like to go back no further than the budget debate of 1986, the last occasion on which the National Coalition produced a real budget rather than a proposed one, and quote what the <Col N="1012" /> party leader said.  I will only quote a little of his speech, on the subject of the then Government's general policy, as reported at column 1631, volume 363 of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
    <P>Monetarist policies have been tried and found wanting.  They have not worked. </P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>We see this Government's preoccupation with the financial difficulties and a blind refusal to look beyond them as the principal intellectual constraint on any attempt to initiate economic revival.  The obsession with budgetary arithmetic to the exclusion of everything else is preventing positive thinking.  It is an intellectual straitjacket.  The pluses and the minuses of the budget arithmetic have become the reality, not the economy, but we must break out of this strait-jacket.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is not civil war politics that this country needs to get away from but Victorian economics and financial precepts. </P>
    <P>Members will agree that I am not choosing out of context a completely unrepresentative sample of what was then Fianna Fáil thinking.  That was the message which they proclaimed up and down the country whenever they got the chance, going for the soft touch, trying to awaken that side of the people's reactions, making out that the people led by the last Taoiseach, Dr. Fitzgerald, were academic economists who never looked outside their windows, who mostly lived in Dublin 4 or, if they lived in the country, lived in large mansions of gentleman farmers and were out of touch with the people.</P>
    <P>That message was echoed by what I may call the glue-sniffer school of political commentators, the people who are ready at all stages with intoxicating narcotic raiméis about how poor Dr. Fitzgerald was only trying to run an economy, but that if Deputy Haughey was let in he would run a country, build a nation, shape and mould it.  That was the message <Col N="1013" /> that was coming from the glue-sniffers in the media who were not interested in and, perhaps, could not understand the concrete realities of economic and political life.  However, they were glad to hype up the kind of atmosphere in which tyranny has often thrived, which underlay the rise in western Europe of ferocious tyrannies 50 years ago; get the crowd cheering, raise a cheap cheer with some simple phrase or simple glittering idea, no matter how childish or cheap, and everything would be swept aside that stood in their way.</P>
    <P>That was the general picture over the last five years, and I should like to contrast it, if I am not being too abrasive, with what we heard in the House less than 48 hours ago.  What I am about to quote is material with which I absolutely agree.  It comes from the contribution of the Taoiseach on Tuesday afternoon. Almost at the outset of his speech he said:</P>
    <P>It is that millstone, the enormous cost of servicing the national debt, that is at the heart of our economic and financial difficulties. </P>
    <P>It might have been Deputy Bruton, or Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Finance, or former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave or Willie Cosgrave talking; but those were the words which Deputy Haughey quite rightly used in the House two days ago, and I agree with them. Later the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The things we all want, good incomes and employment, high quality public services, a caring system of social welfare and health; all depend vitally on our maintaining sound public finances. </P>
    <P>If that is not Thatcherism or monetarism what is?  It is a view with which I completely agree; but we are supposed to acquiesce in this self-awarded amnesty and to be too well-mannered to draw attention to the contrast I have put before the House.</P>
    <P>It will probably amaze you to learn that I do not particularly resent the chagrin which many people on my side of the <Col N="1014" /> political fence must feel at seeing the message which we sweated to put across &mdash; not just during the term of the previous Government but since the first oil crisis &mdash; being implemented by Fianna Fáil. The Fine Gael Party richly earned the disappointments which we now have to live through.  No doubt we will put this period behind us but we cannot complain because our disappointments were largely brought on by our foolishness in entering Coalition Government at a very difficult recessionary time with a party, an adequate representative spokesman of which on economic affairs might be Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I know he will not take that remark in a disparaging personal sense, it is not meant like that. You cannot run a Government in difficult times with an element in it &mdash; which naturally has the whip-hand in determining whether you have a majority &mdash; represented by the position Deputy Higgins, I know, sincerely upholds.  It cannot be done and we should not have attempted it.</P>
    <P>I know all the arguments in favour of having a shot at Coalition.  The strongest argument was that there had been three general elections in a period of 18 months and the people would have gone stone mad if they had been asked to vote a fourth time.  Nevertheless, we should not have entered into that arrangement.  I do not know to what extent the sheer ambition of a certain number of my colleagues played a part in the mad rush to get into Government at all costs with the Labour Party.  Perhaps they saw themselves sitting behind ministerial desks being photographed with their ear to a telephone, having subordinates reminding them that the press were waiting for them, that their car was ready, or that their wife had rung up.  A role may also have been played by fond memories, which I share and am glad to avow, of the much happier Coalition in Brendan Corish's time which was not so strong on ideology.  That would have been understandable, but even so, we should not have done it and we are now paying the price.  I acknowledge that, and I admit that it lessens the resentment I would <Col N="1015" /> otherwise feel at what I can only think of as a hypocritical performance on the part of the party opposite.</P>
    <P>Having got in under those unfavourable Coalition conditions we made matters worse by allowing ourselves to be dictated to by the Labour Party in areas where we would have done better to say no, to leave Government and to abandon the Coalition experiment.  Other acts of foolishness, not necessarily in the economic or Coalition sphere, all played their part in leaving us on this side of the House.  I am willing to take my medicine &mdash; it is not as severe for me as it was for an office-holder &mdash; and I will grin and bear the sight of the Fianna Fáil Party awarding themselves a clean slate with the very same insouciance as the Emperor Bokassa might have pinned a couple of stars on himself, for their behaviour over the past five years, when they contributed very substantially, not to taking votes from Fine Gael &mdash; we probably would have lost them anyway &mdash; but to building up the public attitudes and psychology which will be the Government's big obstacle to overcome in the years that lie ahead of them.</P>
    <P>The Estimates which are the product of the development I described cannot be quarrelled with in their global dimensions. I will not nit-pick with them either, although I might have done them a bit differently.  In the past I have often advocated a special State board with no remit other than to wrap up State boards, &ldquo;An Bord um Threascairt Bord&rdquo;.  I am glad to see that without the panoply of a new board the Government are getting to grips with the unnecessary multiplicity of agencies.  Nevertheless, I regret the passing of the Irish Film Board, which I had the honour of setting up.  I also regret the passing of the Dublin Streets Commission; God knows it is needed. However, I do not want to chop straws in regard to the Estimates.  These are rather small matters compared to the general picture of economy, discipline and of reducing the burden of State involvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> I must draw attention to the contrast between what is happening now and what has been said by the party opposite, particularly their leader, over recent years.  Let me say before I mention this contrast, in case it is said I am the same old bitter pill I have been down the years, that I am impressed by one quite important dimension of the new Government's functioning; they have learned some lessons from their years in the wilderness, and I like their modest, businesslike approach with the minimum of flim-flam, to their problems.  If they had always been like that they might not have raised up the enemies which they did raise against themselves and which left them so long in Opposition.</P>
    <P>When they were in Opposition in the past five years we were always hearing that we needed a &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; approach.  That is a darling word which might have been invented by Deputy Lenihan; perhaps it was.  We were told we should get away from the slide rule and the bookkeeping.  If that &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; approach is supposed to be incorporated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> I am sorry that I cannot see it.  This beautifully printed document written in English, which is more than can be said for others in the past, is simply one in a long series of such global new starts on paper.  I have been in Leinster House for more than 18 years and this must be the eighth or tenth such document I have seen.  <i>Programme for National Recovery, The Way Ahead, Programme for Progress, Building on Reality</i> have all flown overhead so fast that one is inclined to look up and say &ldquo;is that one of ours&rdquo;?  On my oath, in a couple of weeks I will not be able to remember. They are all the same, all containing targets and global envisagements about the number of jobs which are perceived as possible to be attained in this or in that sector.  That is not a &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; approach and it falls far short of anything I imagine Deputy Haughey or his colleagues would have wished to be understood by the word &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Of course, things need to be done but <Col N="1017" /> they cannot be done overnight or in the term of a single Government.  Some things will be unspectacular and disagreeable and will mean imposing discipline on the people.  I am not speaking about compulsion, but discipline in the sense of directing and alluring the people into certain patterns of thought and activity.  It will have to start very far back, because the lead-in time, in order to get results from the sort of deep-ploughing which I have always advocated here, is long; it may be 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>All the areas mentioned in this document are ones in which the real problems lie far beneath the surface.  There is a paragraph in it about tourism.  I have no fault to find with it except that it does not really get to grips with the things which the Price Waterhouse report is said to have exhibited as the main obstacles to our flourishing as a tourist country, and the reasons people do not come back here a second time, which include the poor level of service in many hotels and other establishments, and the poor level of courtesy, which has declined in shops and hotels since I was a student.  It compares unfavourably with that which one takes for granted in many other European countries.  The squalor, litter and dereliction around the country makes it disagreeable for tourists.  Their impression of Ireland is something they do not wish to remember and they cannot advise their friends to come here.  Until these things are changed, which depend not just on taxation measures or incentives but on turning around public psychology and inviting public participation, we will not make the breakthrough in tourism for which we had hoped.</P>
    <P>A typically Irish &mdash; I say that as someone without a drop of any other kind of blood in my veins &mdash; operation is going on at present in regard to the preparation for the &ldquo;Dublin Millennium.&rdquo;  A millennium I understand as the celebration of a thousand years starting from year one.  Dublin was not founded in the year 988.  They chose arbitrarily to use a nonevent as the starting point for this &ldquo;millennium;&rdquo; but what is the point of having a &ldquo;millennium&rdquo; when the city is such a <Col N="1018" /> reproach to us?  We are having this festival to invite in the neighbours to admire our rags and our rubbish.  The right thing to do, but a very un-Irish thing, would be to get the place cleaned up first, so that we can drive on the north side of the Liffey from Butt Bridge to Kingsbridge and back again on the south side without being pained to the heart at what we see around us.  How dare anybody think of inviting the world in here to celebrate our &ldquo;millennium&rdquo; when the condition of the place is so disastrous?</P>
    <P>I know there are people who will say that I am letting the side down, that I am harping about and criticising something which is an effort.  People who believe in this are indeed making an effort; but I point to it as an example of why we do not really get our act together in all kinds of different fields.  A millennium, or any sort of a party, is easily thought of and organised.  We can have festivals and invite in troops of Ukrainian dancers, Norwegian cyclists and the devil knows what, but it will not change the perceptions of the ordinary common or garden tourist who is induced to spend three or four days in a Dublin hotel and walk around the Dublin streets.</P>
    <P>I am far less fitted to talk about agriculture than most other Deputies in the House.  All my life I have been hearing about how the main problem in agricultural life is land structure and the need of land structure reform.  How long is it since that was first said?  How many interdepartmental committees have sat on that matter and how many reports have been produced on it?  What has happened? There were a few voluntary schemes of which very little use has been made, in order to induce the retirement of elderly and, in the technical sense, under-educated farmers from their holdings, and to throw land on to the market so as to be available for people who are, in the technical sense, better educated and more likely to be able to make use of it.  What is radically happening in that field?  The answer is &ldquo;nothing that I am aware of&rdquo;.  Until something radical happens we will have an agricultural productivity level remaining at a small <Col N="1019" /> fraction of that which the Dutch, the Belgians and the Danes have, and we will be still whinging about structural reform in ten or 20 years' time.</P>
    <P>Local government is not mentioned here at all.  As I have said in various settings this is a very important area of potential for our economy.  The party I belonged to promised in 1982 that they would deliver local government reform. We never delivered it.  We did indeed deliver an increase in the number of begowned, bedizened councillors here and there, and we upgraded the first citizen of Galway from Mayor to Lord Mayor but otherwise we did nothing in local government reform that I am aware of.  The entire system given to us by the British in 1898 &mdash; for the purpose of killing Home Rule with kindness &mdash; should be scrapped root and branch, and replaced with what I would call a real local government with no trips and no travel expenses, none of the top dressing which brings people into local government nowadays.  I am not saying that there are not many who come in out of a genuine motive of public service; there are.  However, all the things which make the thing an expensive and farcical structure should be scrapped, and instead the local government structure should be redesigned around economic development. The local authorities should be economic development authorities, put there to mobilise local sentiment, local pride, local initiative in areas which are small enough for them to know everyone in their area.  That form of local government would be worth having, instead of the kind which, in some counties, does scarcely any business except passing section 4 resolutions in order to interfere with the planning process.</P>
    <P>Education is the last of the matters I want to talk about.  It scarcely rates a mention of any substance in this programme, but it is the most essential of the lot.  We are an isolated people, tending to live by our own standards or, if we ever look at other people's standards, those of the British or Americans, because those two nations present no linguistic barrier <Col N="1020" /> to us.  They are racially akin to us to the extent that many of our people live there, and most of us have relations in one of those countries or the other, and are familiar with the cultural element of those two societies, not by accident because we played some part in erecting them in the first instance.  Otherwise we are as isolated as the Turks were before Ataturk, or the Japanese were before the 1850s. We do not know what it is to work, to deliver, to think to the standards of the continental EC on which we depend absolutely.  Until we take measures far more drastic in the educational field than have been thought of so far, we will never get out of the isolation which really underlies all the other problems.  Tourism is weak, the land structure is weak, and the industrial development which relies on indigenous investment &mdash; as report after report indicates &mdash; is weak; our marketing is laughable, because the average Irish young man or woman has no clue about the outside world except what is transmitted by the English-speaking media from the other side of the Atlantic or the other side of the Irish sea.</P>
    <P>We will have to smash this fetish about migration.  One reason I was delighted to see Deputy Lenihan making a first stab at it last week was that migration, let it be the cyclical migration which he and I have in mind, will bring young Irish people face to face with other cultures and standards.  They would understand what other people mean when they talk about varieties of food, of clothing, of the kind of products which we could perhaps make and sell.  That is the reason for reforming our educational system and syllabus so as to intensify the emphasis on areas which up to now have been neglected; some of them have no emphasis at all placed on them.  It is a reason for making mastery of a Continental or at any rate a non-English or non-Irish language compulsory for the award of a leaving certificate, and I mean competence in the spoken as well as the written language.  It is painful to find young continentals who, when they speak good English and receive my compliments on it, say self-deprecatingly, &ldquo;I had eight <Col N="1021" /> or nine years' English at school&rdquo;.  They regard each year as a quantum which will correspond almost infallibly to a certain level of competence at the end of the day. We all had 12 years' Irish at school, every man and woman in this House.  How many of us can with certainty speak a correct Irish sentence, take part in an Irish conversation in which not a single mistake is made?  We are not in the ball-park, to use the kind of expression which the glue-sniffing school of commentators would be at ease with, when it comes to being on the same level of competence, comprehension and understanding of what the world around us is like, as the people with whom we have to compete in Belgian, Holland and Denmark.  Until we take those problems, which require deep educational and structural ploughing, by the throat, and reconcile ourselves to a long lead-in time, perhaps 20 years before the results show through, we will never produce the results which Deputy Brennan, I and everybody else in the House would like to see.  It does not matter how many natty little &ldquo;programmes&rdquo; fly across the sky between now and when we die, this country will always be a poor relation until we realise our difficulties, understand our disadvantages and understand the weaknesses which we, perhaps genetically, are burdened with, and take some radical, positive action to combat them.  Putting a few pounds into this or that scheme or incentive will not do it.  The only thing that will do it is understanding our situation and soberly coming to grips with measures which in the long run will tend to ameliorate it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I wish the Government success with their operations.  I hope that they have not absolutely sunk the ship with the severity of their cuts, but I will not be jeering at them if they run into difficulties with them.  Notwithstanding what I said about their self-awarded amnesty, their sense of realism and the businesslike modesty they have been displaying in the last six months, may mark the turning-over of a new leaf in Irish politics generally, and may even open up possibilities of a kind which <Col N="1022" /> would be important to me, of trying to see whether the similarities which stare us in the face between various interests in the House might not one day come through in support of the same Government, rather than in battling one another trying to replace one another in the useless repetition of the mistakes made by our predecessors.</P>

      <P>These Estimates are one part of an integrated economic strategy whose ultimate goal is to reduce unemployment and try to bring about a recovery in living standards.  The policies of a Government have a dual thrust; on the one hand to put the nation's finances into order and, at the same time, to encourage productive growth.  In searching for that growth in today's conditions we simply have no option but to look outside the borders of this small marketplace.  We have to look outside this economy.  We must find our growth abroad.  The key to our economic well-being lies in our capacity to trade successfully in world markets.  We must trade successfully in world markets or this country cannot and will not prosper.  To do this we have to be competitive and provide the goods and services that the market wants rather than what we think it wants.  We must provide the goods and services at the right price, not at the price we award ourselves but at the price the market will pay.  This is essential if the Government are to be successful in bringing about some economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central role of exporting and of more effective marketing on the home market is reflected in these Estimates. Two key areas of expenditure have been maintained at the same level as last year because of the importance of these areas. One area relates to the allocation to CTT of £1.5 million for the market entry and development scheme and the allocation of £1 million to the Irish Goods Council. The general allocation to CTT at £20.022 million under subhead G1 is a reduction of £3 million on the 1987 allocation.  I have told CTT that this £3 million cut is <Col N="1023" /> not to mean entrenchment of their efforts and I have been assured by the board that it will not mean retrenchment.  It will mean even greater efforts by them.  That cut will be offset by an increase of £1.3 million in CTT's own resources, as a further step in their progress towards becoming increasingly self-financing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the acceptance by the board of CTT of the guidelines which I have laid down for them that they should increasingly become self-financing and that they should increasingly share in the rewards of exporters whom they have helped.  If CTT aid an exporter and the exporter is successful there is no reason why CTT should not share in the profit. CTT are about to become an unusual State agency in that they will largely pay their own way in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>By focusing the efforts of CTT on the areas where they are needed most and can produce the most effective returns, I am confident that the net effect will be to increase the effectiveness of our export promotion in the immediate future.  Like all State activities CTT must share the impact of a reduced allocation of resources but there is no reduction in the Government's commitment to export-led growth.  There is no slackening in our determination to let more indigenous companies into exporting and to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of substantial growth in our foreign trade.</P>
    <P>I will detail to the House some of the initiatives being taken by the Office of Trade and Marketing to bring about that export growth and to increase the effectiveness of Irish firms on the home market where we have been losing ground in recent years, but first I will look at the overall economic background into which these fit.  The goal of the Estimates is to improve living standards, correct the public finances and, through that, to do something about unemployment.  Living standards have been falling here by an average of 10 per cent a year in recent years.  Unemployment in 1983 was 14 per cent and it is now at over 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>We should also remind ourselves of the critical dangers involved in not doing <Col N="1024" /> anything about public finance and unemployment. In 1983 the debt-GNP ratio was 100 per cent.  This year it is 150 per cent.  The national debt has come from £12 billion to £25 billion, taking up one-third of total tax revenue and virtually all of the tax generated from the PAYE sector.  The figure recently put before the House showing that the national debt amounts to about £28,000 for every household in the country speaks for itself. Something had to happen.</P>
    <P>The strategy being pursued is based on producing the Book of Estimates early so that we can have a real debate on those Estimates.  This marks a radical departure from what outside commentators have called the farce in previous years where outturns in the Book of Estimates were grossed up when the book was produced and then slightly trimmed back to produce artificial cutbacks.  This is the first time since 1958 that the Estimates for the public capital programme published before the budget show a fall in planned expenditure compared to previous years. Can it really have taken since 1958 for this country to have reached the stage of maturity to publish the Estimates in that way?</P>
    <P>The strategy being followed is having some success.  The Exchequer returns for the third quarter show that the 1987 budget is on target.  The current deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement will fall to their lowest level in over half a decade.  In 1983 the current budget deficit was 8.1 per cent.  This year it is heading for 6.9 per cent.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1983 was 13.9 per cent and this year it is heading for 10.7 per cent.  The prime lending rate has fallen by 4 per cent since last March and recommended mortgage rates have also fallen and are scheduled to fall again.  In January 1987 the prime overdraft rate stood at 14 per cent and the latest figure is 10.2 per cent.  The recommended mortgage rate in January was 12½ per cent and it now stands at 11½ per cent and is predicted to fall.  Most importantly, the capital outflows from the country appear to have fallen dramatically.  In 1986 the residual, so far as I can calculate it, was <Col N="1025" /> £1,566 million.  The estimated residual for 1987 seems to be about £300 million less.  I stress these are my calculations but it appears that capital outflows from the economy have been reduced by £300 million. If one compares that to the massive capital outflows of a year or two ago, this is one magnificent vote of confidence in what we in this House are trying to do, which is to get the finances into shape.  I look forward to double checking those figures, but they are not easy to quantify. Economists will know the difficulties of being precise about them.</P>
    <P>As has been obvious in recent days, the financial markets do not do anybody, most of all governments, any favours. They have a mind of their own.  Still, interest rates are falling and the capital outflows seem to be reducing.  That can only mean one thing, that the financial markets have some confidence in the direction of policy.  The real economy seems to be stabilising.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to see, and I must inquire as to the real reason for it, that cement sales are now 2 per cent higher in 1987 than in 1986.  Frankly I do not perceive an upturn in the building industry, but cement sales have increased by 2 per cent.  That would seem to indicate that there is some movement in this area.  For the first time since 1981, two successive quarters have shown an increase year on year.  Finally, the growth prediction of about 2 per cent is well in excess of what was forecast last year.</P>
    <P>The allocation on Exchequer returns is being reduced by £485 million.  I want to put something to the House and to the country in as simple a form as I can.  If one looks at the Book of Estimates and reads through the cuts on the current side, it will be seen that we spent £6.6 billion last year running this country, and that this year we are proposing to spend £6.4 billion.  That is a reduction of 5 per cent.  It is unnecessary to get into a total flap.  It is unnecessary to have screaming headlines about cuts.  It is unnecessary to have dramatic gestures.   With expenditure increasing since 1958, a sudden cut back of 5 per cent cannot in any way cause the kind of dramatics that are going <Col N="1026" /> on throughout the country.  If 5 per cent, which is the minimum any Government could do, does that then I shudder to think of the kind of outcry we would have if we attempted any larger cuts, and larger cuts &mdash; more than 5 per cent &mdash; are probably needed.  Let us put it in perspective; 95 per cent of what was spent in 1986 will be spent in 1987.  There is no need for some of the dramatics that we have seen around the country.  There is no need for the protests and the marches. Any household, any individual and most certainly any country, can manage a 5 per cent notch on its belt, and that is what we are asking for.  It is important to put it in context.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should not have cut the capital budget.  The capital budget cut is 15 per cent.  Let us be honest about it.  That is a lot and it could damage future investment, but most of that has come in a few small areas, in hospitals and schools.  Is there anybody left in this country at this stage who thinks we should build more schools or hospitals while we are waiting for the recession to pass over?  That is not an option.  On those two fronts there is no need for dramatics on the current side because of the 5 per cent cut which, I know, will be tough on some people.  But it is not as severe as it is made out to be by some vested interests who insist on portraying it as being much deeper and more serious.</P>
    <P>Let me turn, in the few minutes I have left, to my own Office of Trade and Marketing. Exports to September are 12 per cent higher than in 1986.  The trade surplus for 9 months has exceeded £.9 billion. That is twice that for 1986.  Exports have exceeded £10 billion for the first time and we are forecasting growth for the year of 11 per cent compared with an average of 7 per cent in 1981 and 1982.  I am not, as has been suggested by some people, claiming credit for the increase in exports.  We are working to underpin it and to help it.  I compliment the Irish exporters for achieving this magnificent target of giving us a £1 billion trade surplus, exporting £1 billion more than we <Col N="1027" /> import in the 12 month period to September. That is a tremendous breakthrough and it should be a boost to everybody in industry that it can be done.</P>
    <P>The Irish export board's allocation for 1988 is £20.022 million compared to £23.022 million in 1987.  That is a cut of £3 million.  As I said, they will raise an extra £1.3 million in charges so that the net real cut is £1.7 million.  I have explained to the House that the market entry and development scheme will be largely untouched.</P>
    <P>The Irish Goods Council, for which I also have responsibility, had an allocation in 1987 of £1 million.  It will retain that £1 million for 1988.  Again it has been suggested that should have been cut like every other area.  An important point to bear in mind here, and I say this in the strongest possible way, is that the Irish Goods Council tell me that we import £9 billion worth of products every year. They tell me that £1 billion of that are immediately substitutable &mdash; they could be manufactured here.  Over £1 billion worth of goods which could be manufactured here are being imported.  We have left the Irish Goods Council that £1 million to go out and try to organise that in a strong way.  The Irish Goods Council will have my full support in getting that job done.  There is £1 billion worth of business and I would invite business people, investors, the banks, people who are throwing their hands in the air and looking for visas, to go down to the Irish Goods Council and have a look at that list before getting on the boat.  They are not all highly sophisticated products. Some are very simple, very easily manufacturable by a handful of people with a bit of support from the banking system. There is business here if people will go out and look for it.  There is £1 billion's worth on offer in the Irish Goods Council.</P>
    <P>I invite Irish manufacturers, business people and investors, before advocating that people should get on boats, to go down to the Irish Goods Council to see if they can help us to replace that £1 <Col N="1028" /> billion worth of goods that we are importing with Irish made products.  The business is there and the Irish Goods Council repeatedly tell me that there are many business opportunities if we can encourage people to look at them.  I say to young people, before they look at the American visa, before they look at the advertisements for Australia, that they should look at the Irish Goods Council brochure, at the list of products we are importing, at the fact that it adds up to £1 billion. If £1 billion of Irish people's money is handed over to import those goods, somebody should get his act together and start to manufacture.  The IDA, the CTT and the Irish Goods Council are working to make sure this happens.  One of my major objectives is to make sure that the £1 billion worth of goods is manufactured here.</P>
    <P>The first commitment to do something about the state of marketing and trade in the country was the decision of the Taoiseach and the Government to establish, for the first time an Office of Trade and Marketing.  It is the first time in the history of the State that the title &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; has been attached to any office or any Minister.  That has been generally welcomed as an attempt to realise that if we do not export and trade we will not survive and the follow on from that is to ask a particular office to focus on it.</P>
    <P>In the few moments left to me I will just tell the House what I have been trying to do in that office and what I hope to do in the period ahead.  First of all, we passed through this Dáil the Finance Act and the Export Act, including sections which establish a new animal called a special trading house.  Special trading houses are private sector companies where if one exports Irish goods one gets a 10 per cent tax break and can avail of the business expansion scheme money. This is the first time that we have had specialised service companies which will buy Irish manufactured goods, particularly from smaller companies, and will export them for them, and in return for this will get this tax break.  It is an idea which we unashamedly admit has been swiped from the Japanese model of a <Col N="1029" /> trading house whereby people concentrate on the idea of getting their exports through a private sector trading house.  The EC Commission are at present processing that and I hope to have something further to say about it in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The second matter on which we have moved is to give new guidelines to the CTT, whereby we have not accepted that a State agency to support exports should be looking for State money as a continuous process.  I am delighted with the response to that and CTT now say that they can earn a substantial portion of their funds without affecting Irish exports.  To an extent, the growth of CTT and its dominance in world markets on behalf of our exporters is now limited not by State funds but by what they themselves can generate in world markets. That is a major turn around in guidelines given to any State company and I am delighted with the board's enthusiastic response to it.</P>
    <P>The new national programme gave me two additional responsibilities on which to commence work.  One is the drafting of a national marketing plan to try to do something about duplication and the plethora of approaches which we have to the business of marketing.  Ireland Limited, or Ireland Inc. to use the modern expression, is too small a country not to have its marketing focused, tightly organised and spotlighted in certain areas abroad.  We cannot be all over the place, with many agencies all trying to market Ireland through different channels with different funds.  That will not work.  I have been given the job of trying to put together a national marketing plan which will pull together Ireland's marketing efforts abroad, so that when people see Ireland abroad they see a crisp, clean image.  They will mainly get the message that this is not an island of saints and scholars, green people, green country and green money, but that this is a modern industrial State which is open to business and wants to do business with every other country.</P>
    <P>I am also at present chairing a task <Col N="1030" /> force under the plan to try to win some consultancy abroad.  I estimate that there is about £200 million worth of consultancy work which Irish firms can get if we get our act together.  I have seen abroad many times, in our attempt to win such work, not just one Irish suitcase in the waiting room of the managing director, or the people in Lomé, or the World Bank but three and four, all queuing for a little bit of consultancy work.  The Germans, French and others are much smarter.  They sort out their difficulties before they let that suitcase go abroad. They are thus able to get the support of State, embassies, agencies and Government. Some of that consultancy work abroad consists of multi-million pound projects.  We will not win this work if we encourage every second firm here to go chasing it.  The other competitiors have their Ambassadors on the phone and their Ministers talking to each other. They have Government support for their bid.  They usually win ahead of us.  I am very determined that as from now Ireland, both in the public and the private sector, will win that consultancy work by co-ordinating our act at home rather than asking somebody else who is not interested to knock our heads together.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what the Taoiseach said in his address to the Marketing Institute, in his two announcements on which the recent Office of Trade and Marketing are now working.  One is that in future our efforts abroad will come from one centre, that is our CTT representation, IDA, embassies and so on, that instead of being all over the place, where economically possible they will operate from one centre so that we get a co-ordinated focused effort.  That is a big break through.  For years we have been talking about doing this, now it is time we did it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Taoiseach quite crisply said &mdash; and we are working on it &mdash; to turn the eyes of our embassies more on to trade.  This small country cannot afford a plethora of embassies all over the world which are not first and foremost interested in trade.  Our country will survive only by trade, not by the quality of its political footwork abroad, trying to <Col N="1031" /> impress major nations.  It will only survive and progress if we trade successfully.  I welcome the interest of the embassies in increasingly helping us with that trade effort.  There will be precise proposals on that later on, as to how we can marry the CTT and IDA efforts abroad with the embassies' efforts so that we are all singing out of the one hymn book, the Irish hymn book, that Ireland is open for business, engaged in business and not in useless turf wars between various sections of the same country abroad, which is very unseemly indeed.</P>
    <P>The question of marketing education and marketing training is something that I have been asked to address.  If we are to do something about exporting we must do something about the quality of the people whom we train to export, that means doing something about marketing education.  It is not acceptable to me at this stage that we have a plethora of courses run by various institutions all over the place who have no clear co-ordination or clear direction on locking the efforts into what the market really wants.  I shall have something to say about that later on.</P>
    <P>That is what is happening in the Office of Trade and Marketing; it is exciting, it is heading up the export efforts and focusing our national will, I hope, on to the simple equation that as a small country we must trade.  We here are much more dependent on exports than the United States, Japan or the UK are proportionally. That means that if we do not trade, we die.  It has worried me increasingly that two-thirds of our exports come from multi-national companies, that in the remaining one-third there are about 5,000 firms and of those there are about 2,000 which actually export.</P>
    <P>I say to Irish manufacturing that we cannot leave it to the fine and welcome international companies alone.  We are extremely vulnerable in the long term if we do that.  While exports are climbing and we are proud of it, I want to caution that Irish owned industry is not playing its full part in that growth.  That makes <Col N="1032" /> us very vulnerable.  I invite Irish industry to look to the Irish Goods Council, to the opportunities abroad and try to play a fuller part in that exporting effort.  That is not said often enough because when exports rise we think that across the board every section of industry is playing its part.  Irish industry is not yet playing its full part.  It has only a very small share of total exports.  It is urgent that the Irish firms, firms based here with largely Irish management, play their part.</P>
    <P>I want finally to deal with the insurance area for which I have responsibility. Insurance costs are too high, both public liability and employers' liability.  Motor insurance is too high.  We are told that many of our firms now do not carry some insurance because they cannot afford it. They prefer to go into liquidation.  This has been estimated at perhaps 10 per cent to 15 per cent of Irish companies.  If that continues it will narrow the base and if that happens the cost gets higher.  We cannot tolerate that.  I do not have to tell the House how the cost of motor insurance is escalating and how unacceptable that is.  We have been doing a number of things in the last few months to try to get a grip on that.  First, I have asked the Bar Council on a voluntary basis to consider making a gesture with regard to the eight legal persons involved, possibly, in an insurance case.  Given present circumstances, I do not believe that the Bar Council would want to continue that situation.  They are considering my request and I hope for a favourable response.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, has announced that a Courts Bill is coming in which will abolish juries.  That will help considerably to get costs down. I have just negotiated a deal with the Insurance Federation whereby, once the Courts Bill is in place, they will give a 10 per cent to 20 per cent reduction in motor insurance for young drivers who have been named drivers on the policies of their parents or guardians for a period before that.  I have also entered into a partnership with the insurance industry to work further on getting insurance costs down.  We are looking at the introduction <Col N="1033" /> of a book of quantam and safety audits for insurance companies.  There is a whole programme which in the end will have the net effect of reducing insurance costs, I am convinced, in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for giving me this time.  The strategy of the Estimates is quite clear.  We have been having it good since 1958, with increasing expenditure. It is time to call a halt and we have done so.  The Office of Trade and Marketing looks forward to playing its role in achieving that economic growth by encouraging exports and by planning and managing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to begin by taking up the points made by the previous speaker, the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan.  In fact, I find his repeated invitations to the private sector to look at the volume of imports for which substitution is possible, to prepare for selling abroad and to become more involved in investment, are only new in so far as they come from a relatively young mouth.  It is an old story, it is an old sound which has gone on since the fifties and it will not delay my remarks for very long.  All I want to say is that in 1985 the cost of business tax reliefs was £994.3 million.  By 1986 that figure had risen to £1.2 billion.  If you add the figure for tax reliefs of £994 million for 1985-86 to the figure for grants and services of £372 million, you will find that this flagging cow that refuses to give milk &mdash; the Irish private sector &mdash; received in 1986 some £1.366 billion.  May the cow be electrified by the Minister of State's invitation and by the invitation of the Taoiseach. However, in his speech redolent with images of suitcases and invitations to visit the Goods Council before one heads for the boat or plane, as appropriate, I must confess to being somewhat sceptical about not only the advice but the use of language which has prevailed in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every now and again people have slipped loosely from a description of the document which was published some weeks ago entitled <i>Programme for <Col N="1034" /> National Recovery,</i> to calling it a plan.  It depends on which time of the day one listens to the debate.  Towards night time it becomes a plan but in the harsh light of morning or in the forenoon it reduces itself back to being a programme.  It is not, nor can it be taken in conjunction with the Estimates to be, what the Minister described as a part of an integrated economic package.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Kelly I was reminded of someone whose name he quoted.  It was John A. Costello who, in the Constitution debate 50 years ago after Mr. de Valera had wheeled in three Irish language speakers in a row, said he hoped it would not be taken as yet another defect of the much despised legal profession if he spoke in the English tongue. Not only did that show us of the differences at the time between Risteard Ó Maolcathain and Mr. Costello but there is also a parable in it.</P>
    <P>After this great consensus which has now emerged I feel somewhat in the position of Mr. Costello.  I would like to begin by clearing the ground just a little.  The debate has ranged from the exchange of acerbic tributes by Deputy Kelly to his opposite numbers to the more polite quiet tones of those who suggest that they are in agreement with the Government in principle but against them in detail, to other people who feel we should go further than that and adopt the full rhetoric of modern Rambo economics.</P>
    <P>There are clarifications which need to be made.  For a start, what is happening in this House, and I hope the public will be made aware of it, is not the emergence of a consensus on either social or economic policy.  What is emerging is the politics of a consensus of interests.  There is a very basic distinction between them.  A consensus on the politics of interests will enable in an unequal society those who are suffering to sink further.  It will enable the gaps and opportunities to widen and the consensus will not be disturbed.  It is not a consensus of a social kind in so far as those most affected by, for example, the Book of Estimates have not been consulted and, where they might have participated in a discussion on their rights <Col N="1035" /> the very agencies which secured their participation such as the National Social Services Board, have been abolished.  Let us have a plea for accuracy of language.  The consensus is about the interests dominated by the market and by a particular version of economic strategy.  It is no more than that.  It is bogus, deceitful, misleading and damaging to suggest that it is a consensus which goes beyond such interests.  Neither is it very original or new.</P>
    <P>I have had the good fortune to lecture on social policy in one of the colleges of the National University.  I remember the occasion when Richard Titmuss, a former Professor at the London School of Economics, and who died on 6 April 1973, gave a lecture on &ldquo;Titmuss's contribution to English social policy and social philosophy.&rdquo; It was an extraordinary contribution. His last book which was edited and brought to publication by his wife after his death and entitled <i>Social Policy</i> was published in the spring of 1974.  In it he drew attention to the assumptions which lie behind much of the economics we now hear of.  He referred, for example, to the definition of social policy. At that time people were arguing as to whether employment or unemployment policy should be part of social policy. There were those who argued that it should only be about housing, basic health and so forth, but he argued for its extension because he saw the connection between unemployment and poverty.  At that time a debate raged in England about the definition of social policy and its extent into nature.  Others such as Professor Action who represented a different view on social policy built on the work and the contributions made in that period by Von Hayek.</P>
    <P>It was a simple argument.  It was about equality versus inequality.  At the root of this consensus of interests &mdash; let me mark it in in so far as Deputy Kelly is interested in hearing the historical &mdash; this debate this week represents a consensus of interests in favour of a society deeply marked by inequalities.  It represents a massive achievement of inegalitarianism, <Col N="1036" /> in the destruction of what egalitarian thrust there was in Irish society.  I will now spell that out for those who would like to dismiss my remarks as being simply reflections.  I mean by it an increase in the poverty statistics in terms of consumption and an increase in the gross inequalities measured in terms of income, expenditure, taxation, transfer payments, wealth and participation in society.</P>
    <P>It does not surprise me that newspaper commentators can borrow from that great liberal, Ralf Dahrendorf, and even find themselves upset.  I think the Leader of the Labour Party made a remark last Sunday about a columnist, Des Peelo, discovering the concept of under-class, suggesting that there were two classes emerging in Ireland, a class who participate and an under-class.  Dahrendorf pioneered that view about a year and a half ago.  But I am not interested in that kind of distinction.  I am saying that even the most right wing people realise that what is taking place is the deepening of inequality and a major assault on welfareism, a major assault not only on that but on egalitarianism itself.  It was described in the seventies, in terms of its implications for the role of the State, as the night watchman's State.  That is what we are getting.  Every now and again it creeps into the speeches.  We will be watching out in the six monthly review for the worst casualties.  We will sweep the people with the most blood on the streets in front of our noses from in front of the citizens who participate in this great coalition of interests.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to say any of this but the values that lie behind it are very simple.  In that book entitled <i>Social Policy,</i> on page 29, edited by Professor Titmuss's widow, this remark occurs:</P>
    <P>The main spring of social policy may be said to be the desire to ensure that every member of the community has certain minimum standards and certain opportunities. </P>
    <P>Professor Titmuss had his opponents at that time.  I will read only one more quotation for the House, those are the last <Col N="1037" /> remarks written in his own hand by Richard Titmuss which were these:</P>
    <P>For many consumers the social services that they consume are not essentially benefits at all; they represent partial compensations for disservices, for social costs and social insecurities which are the product of a rapidly changing industrial society.  They are part of the price we pay to some people for bearing the part of the costs of other people's progress: the obsolescence of skills, redundancies, premature retirements, accidents, many categories of disease and handicap, urban blight and slum clearance, smoke pollution and a hundred and one other socially generated disservices. </P>
    <P>That was his view in the seventies and that debate was taking place at that time. Of course, after his death, there was the rise of Thatcherism in Britain but Thatcherism was able to draw on Professor Richard Titmuss's greatest critic when he was alive.  He was Professor Acton who had written:</P>
    <P>... less Government, less public bureaucracy and a resurrection of the work ethic in the private workplace. </P>
    <P>I wonder sometimes &mdash; no more than the previous speaker &mdash; is there ever anything original in anything that is happening in Ireland at policy level?  Is everything to be borrowed slavishly?  Is everything to be simply copied as if it was some kind of immutable script, something handed over, which could not ever be changed? I find it depressing to think that there is nothing original in these proposals before us.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to concentrate my remarks on a few key areas.  What I want to emphasise immediately is that it is time in this country we realised that what has been described as a programme or plan has at its base certain assumptions about the nature of Irish society and about the nature of participation in Irish society in particular.  There is, in the introduction to the plan, an honest recognition of the volume of emigration at present.  It is accepted that it will run at 30,000 per <Col N="1038" /> annum and more for practically the third time this century ignoring the beginning of the century.  In the fifties there was an exodus from this country.  We are sitting back and waiting for the next exodus. And we have the effrontery to write down in our official documents that we can live with 30,000 a year emigrating, that we can live with an unemployment rate that is probably described officially as somewhere approaching 19 per cent but which, in reality, is probably nearer to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I find it very strange that we never ask ourselves: what kind of economy is it that is willing, for example, to live with such a high unemployment rate?  For example, in 1986 we paid £273,470,000 on unemployment benefit including pay-related benefit.  That is an estimated figure provided by way of written reply to a parliamentary question of mine on Wednesday, 14 October.  The unemployment assistance in the same year amounted to £391,537,663.  Redundancy fund payments were £27,043,194.  This amounted in total to £692,050,857.  In addition to the cost of servicing an unacceptably high level of unemployment, the loss of human intelligence and creativity represented in the emigration statistics, we must add the loss of direct taxation and the difference between the indirect taxation that would have been paid had such people been in receipt of an average wage and the amounts they actually receive by way of benefit.  This is an appalling record.</P>
    <P>I do appreciate if people want to say: well, the fault is not that of the Government. Let us not get involved in apportioning blame but I do want to question some of the assumptions made.  I read the Taoiseach's speech with great interest.  The Taoiseach sees himself as some kind of inspirational source at this point in our history.  He is fond of using phrases such as, &ldquo;creating an atmosphere of confidence&rdquo;.  Indeed, in his second sentence, he told us that confidence was back.  It is like when the children are terrified at night and worried, lest Mammy or Daddy should not return, the Taoiseach is back to console the Irish <Col N="1039" /> people and we are on our way again.  As we go through the Taoiseach's speech we find that every single item of expenditure should be fully justified on its merits; because Mammy is cross we have to listen to this.  I take it that the phrase &ldquo;... every single item of expenditure could be fully justified on its merits&rdquo; included an examination of the merits of abolishing the National Social Service Board, the Health Education Bureau and An Foras Forbartha.  I will not talk about the corresponding aspirational allusion to 25,000 extra jobs in tourism while, at the same time, abolishing the very Department that had looked again and again at those very agencies, that had looked again and again at our environment and said: if we wanted an ecologically clean base for our tourist industry there were all the reports of An Foras Forbartha to be referred to. If we wanted to save a great deal of expenditure on the later effects of people abusing themselves by not eating properly, or through the intake of different kinds of addictive items, ranging from cigarettes to alcohol and beyond, the Health Education Bureau was there.  If we wanted citizens to participate in decisions affecting their lives the National Social Service Board, with its 80 different advice agencies, was there. But they had to go in the review of the once benevolent, returning parent to this nation of upset children.</P>
    <P>There are other more serious assumptions which I must say appal me and which have not been spelled out in the debate so far.  There is an assumption that a reduction in interest rates will follow automatically from the fiscal measures being taken.  I challenge that assumption. For example, anybody who is half literate in economics can see that the exposure of Irish interest rates to external pressures, in particular international interest rates, affected as they are by the beggar-my-neighbour economics of the United States, knows full well that that strategy could come unstuck.  But it is one illusion built upon another illusion.  The assumption is &mdash; and I have heard it again today &mdash; that a reduction in interest rates will <Col N="1040" /> lead to an increase in investment.  Where is the evidence for that assumption in our economy?  Where is the evidence even that there is a semblance of a credit policy that would lead in that direction?</P>
    <P>While I am at it this is the appropriate time in my remarks to nail in another little point about who exactly is doing well out of the Irish national debt which everybody, my wife, myself, my dog and my cat are supposed to be carrying shares of around our necks in the crude way statistics are used in this country.  The fact of the matter is that the Irish domestic banking sector is doing very nicely, thank you, out of the national debt.  It is lending to all of the Government agencies.  The kinds of sums it is lending are very interesting. Indeed, the kinds of interest payments it is getting are very interesting.  It is drawing an enormous amount of money from what are effectively State guaranteed, no risk advances to different State and semi-State bodies.  Time constraints prevent me giving all the details but at the end of the year 1986 good old RTE paid £921,000 in interest to their bank.  I presume that the bank were taking a risk and had to consider whether RTE might go out of business altogether.  Maybe it is shaky by their standards.  Telecom Éireann, for which the taxpayers borrowed £100 million in 1974, paid £94,377,000 to the banks in 1986.  The list goes on through AnCO, CERT, all the private hospitals and the health boards. AnCO paid interest amounting to £1,375,480 in 1986.  I can circulate all these figures.  If we take it that 40 per cent of the national debt is owed domestically, there are people who want to miss the point that Irish banking profits are being fuelled by the fact that they have been able to lend in cosy, non-risk situations to different semi-State bodies.  Let us take a typical example.  Since people want examples, let us lead by example.  If all the health board bankers decided to give a 50 per cent reduction in interest rates for the next five years to the health boards with which they have been doing business, we could retain all of the primary care workers in the health board regions for those five years.  But that sacrifice will <Col N="1041" /> not be asked for.  The sacrifice that will be asked for will be paid for by the citizens who are watching their services being destroyed and being dismantled by illiterate economic thuggery, built on a consensus of interests that simply does not care and is committed to the values of an inegalitarian society.  The people who will have to pay for the destruction of the health services are the people who have to wait longer for operations of an orthopaedic kind, such as the man who hopefully will not die before he goes to Merlin Park Hospital in Galway for his orthopaedic operation.  There are children who will grow up without ever having been seen by an orthodontist.  I must make reference to this integrated piece of economic planning for recovery fuelled by confidence from the Taoiseach, blessed by him and recommended to the public by the three major parties in this House.</P>
    <P>I will say a few words about the areas for which I have special responsibility, namely education, which includes youth affairs, foreign affairs, encompassing overseas development aid, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  Regarding the kind of cuts taking place in the basic level of primary education, the figure of 1,300 fewer teachers has been mentioned. There is a view somewhere that because the population of school children is projected to fall in the years immediately ahead we no longer need teachers.  The recommendation made by successive educational reports over several decades has been that we should reduce the inequalities brought about by disadvantage by reducing the ratio of pupils to teachers.  We should use the availability of more teachers to improve learning and to build in the possibility of therapeutic teachers to deal with special needs and so forth.  That is not to happen. We will be looking at empty classrooms to which the emigrants can come back and say they were once taught there.  Of course, far more than 1,300 teachers will go from the primary sector.  The INTO are conducting a nationwide survey to look at the immediate impact on all their <Col N="1042" /> schools.  A spokesperson for that organisation told me that it would be a conservative estimate to say that 2,000 teaching positions will be lost in the primary sector.  Class sizes of over 40 will be the norm and class sizes of 45 will be quite common.  The notion of an administrative principal is being done away with.  Now the administrative principal will return to the classroom.  What an incentive there will be to become a principal.  I have not time to deal with the effect of class sizes in second level education.</P>
    <P>I almost lose courage at times when I consider what happens to the research which has been initiated by the State or semi-State bodies like the Economic and Social Research Institute on education and disadvantage.  The literature is there. If you want to make sure that people will be incapacitated in terms of participating in the economy, even if work is available, the thing to do is to increase the size of the classes.  There has been a massive cut in funds for both the vocational and secondary sectors.  Teachers are bringing in their own photostatic machines illegally and charging pupils for sheets of paper to be copied.</P>
    <P>In the third level sector where I worked extensively for 17 years, I notice notes circulating to the effect that people are not to go on leave any more.  I loved Deputy Brennan's notion on that matter. We will be expecting people to come to see us.  Recently in Holland I told a scientist that we need his visits even more because we will not be able to travel abroad to attend conferences or exchange scientific ideas.  There has been a decimation of services in education.  I believe there will probably be 5,000 job losses.  There has been a 20 per cent increase in transport costs in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other areas for which I have responsibility, I would ask the Government to read the surveys that have been carried out in relation to the Irish commitment to overseas development aid.  When another Government were in office and I was a Labour Deputy I made the point again and again that there was more support for our reaching <Col N="1043" /> the UN target in relation to overseas development aid than existed within Iveagh House.  We were committed to reaching 0.7 per cent but we got as far as 0.25 per cent.  I think we are back to 0.19 now.  Can one imagine a more pathetic refutation of the Taoiseach's remark that every cut is carefully thought out than his decision to take 21 per cent off overseas development aid and international co-operation?  The week before last the news from Ethiopia was that there were no rains in Tigre province and that there would be another famine.  At that very time the Irish Government in their most niggardly cut of all reduced overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>It used to be a fine refrain that Ireland is a great country full of young people.  It is full of young people but now they are being allowed to go.  I have met the youth organisations who have seen practically all their budget disappear.  They tell me there has been a cut in the revised Estimates for youth services from £3.9 million to £2.1 million but they have been told they may get the money back from the National Lottery.  May I throw a 20-second question to all these constitutionally accountable democrats who sit around me?  It is for the press, too. How accountable is it to walk in here with a programme which is called a plan and a Book of Estimates from which money is being lopped off, while nodding outside to people that they may get the money back in the National Lottery? Take £1 million from the Arts Council, throw them £800,000 to shut them up, promise them £200,000 and hope it will work.  Equally the youth services have been told that they may get the money back from the lottery.  Will the money be in the Estimates next year?  Will we ever debate in this House the disposal of revenue from the lottery?  How accountable is that public expenditure?  It is making a nonsense of political accountability for financial expenditure.  It is as close to being illegal as I can envisage.  I accuse the Government of not being willing to come into the House and say how they have planned the disposal of the lottery <Col N="1044" /> moneys.  Are the cuts being replaced by lottery money to be made good in next year's Estimates?  How will we ever debate it?  This is King Santa Claus again constructing his national Christmas tree, with himself shining on top, handing out little bits of parcels around the country to the beggars who will come along.</P>

    <P>I am not going to repeat that in English because I do not have the time.

      <P>I will conclude with this.  There are many things to which the Fianna Fáil Party have pledged loyalty and one of them is the Irish language but they can hardly do so any longer in terms of the cuts thay have announced in relation to the agencies dealing with the Irish language and with the propagation of industry in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy and Minister for Communications (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Higgins one could be forgiven for forgetting that until very recently he was chairman of a Labour Party which, for four years, was a member of a Government who brought about the financial crisis which this Government are trying to tackle.  He cries for various vested interests in this House and says the solution to our problems is <Col N="1045" /> to throw more public money at them, money which has to be borrowed or raised by way of taxation on an already over taxed public.  The solution proposed by Deputy Higgins and his party is to borrow money for these interests, as they did, and which gave us a national debt of £25 billion.  That is not the easy road we are going to take.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to participate in this debate on the Estimates published last week.  The Estimates represent a continuation of this Government's consistent, integrated strategy which began with our first budget in March, to deal with the twin problems of the public finances and the lack of growth in the economy.  These Estimates can strengthen the foundation already laid for long-term economic growth which has now been recognised by all the social partners as the only basis for secure progress in increasing employment and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The problems of the economy and the public finances are closely related.  This essential truth is now accepted by the vast majority of the Members of this House, by economic commentators and indeed by the general public although it has not got into the minds of the Labour Party. Sustained high levels of borrowing over many years brought the national debt to the point where it was causing major uncertainty and instability and a loss of confidence, both at home and abroad in our economic future.  More directly it led to high interest rates and high taxation caused by the spiralling servicing costs of such a huge debt.  This has dampened and smothered initiative, investment and growth which are essential for our economy. Thus, the solutions to the budgetary problems and our economic difficulties are the same, a reduction in borrowing by the State to a sustainable level and process of identifying and fostering a number of key sectors where there is potential for early and significant growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adjustment on the lines set out in the Estimates for 1988 is a necessary condition for securing economic growth.  To be successful, however, this Government recognised from the outset that it must <Col N="1046" /> be matched by active policies and strategies to get growth going in those key sectors of the economy which have undoubted potential for growth.  This Government have identified areas where there are opportunities and these are being vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>In tandem with their management of the public purse, this Government have achieved, in the recently concluded <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a major breakthrough in the divisions which have historically separated the approach of trade unions, employers and farmers to economic advancement to the detriment of growth.  We capitalised on the broad consensus between the social partners in terms of the analysis of our economic problems as published in the NESC Report, <i>&ldquo; A Strategy for Development&rdquo;,</i> by securing a consensus as to how those problems would be tackled.   The three year programme takes account of our inability to continue to provide the current level of services across the board; the need to stabilise and reduce the debt/GNP ratio; the need for pay moderation combined with tax equity and tax relief and the need to protect the position of the underprivileged in our society. Combined with the development and employment policies already being carried out by this Government, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provides us all with the opportunity and responsibility to contribute towards the revitalisation of our nation.</P>
    <P>It was an essential precondition to realising the economic and social goals in the recovery programme that we demonstrate emphatically our determination to improve the budgetary position and reduce spending and borrowing.  We had commenced that process immediately on coming to office and I hope it is now patently obvious that we intend to continue doing so until our objectives are reached.  Our approach, in its totality, will ensure that the priorities for national recovery which we have identified will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for next year show total reductions in Exchequer expenditure of £412 million in 1988 compared with 1987. <Col N="1047" /> In fact, if we were to continue to provide services in 1988 at their existing level, the Estimates involve reductions of £485 million.  Apart from the unusual case of 1984 when expenditure fell following the establishment of Telecom Éireann and An Post, this is the first time in 30 years that the pre-budget Estimates and Public Capital Programme show a fall, compared with the previous year, in planned Exchequer expenditure.  These Estimates follow a painstaking review of all aspects of public expenditure and are designed to ensure a more rational use of essential public services and that taxpayers get the best value for their money.  These aspects take on an increased significance in the light of the fundamental reality that we cannot afford to continue to provide the current level of services across the board.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved this year in reducing net non-capital supply services by almost 2 per cent of GNP and net Exchequer borrowing requirements for capital purposes by a further 1.5 per cent of GNP, making a total of about 3.5 per cent, generates considerable scope for a significant reduction in the overall borrowing requirement in 1988.  We cannot be precise about the actual borrowing requirement in 1988 until the changes in tax revenue and any adjustments in the 1988 budget are taken into account.  It could be said, however, that the reductions now achieved are sufficient to bring the national recovery programme target of 5 per cent to 7 per cent almost within reach in the first year of the programme. It is now therefore a realistic and attainable target.</P>
    <P>Reducing public expenditure is not, however, a simple arithmetic process.  It has to take account of today's needs and future prospects of the different sectors of the economy.  Reductions in non-capital expenditure were carried out with the greatest possible sensitivity to the needs on the social services side.  On the capital side, the Government minimised the reductions on economic and infrastructure investment which form the basis for sustaining future gainful employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> The Government's approach has already boosted confidence in the economy and has been accepted by the financial markets.  This has been brought about first and foremost by the sharp reduction in the level of Exchequer borrowing.  The alarming drain of capital out of the economy has been cut and interest rates have fallen considerably.  I am confident that the firm action we have already taken and continue to take, together with the climate for stability inherent in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> will see a continuation of these favourable trends.</P>
    <P>Despite the direct short-term impact of savings in public expenditure on domestic demand, the economic outlook for 1987 is very encouraging: manufacturing output for the first six months of the year and the trade surplus for the first nine months are considerably up on the same periods last year and I now think that the full year figures will be surprisingly good. Capital investment has recovered, inflation for the year will be about 3 per cent and, while the level of unemployment remains unacceptably high, employment in the key sectors, manufacturing and private sector services, has started to increase.</P>
    <P>These favourable trends give us grounds for renewed optimism in the future of our economy and serve to illustrate that the Government's approach to solving our economic difficulties is the correct one and must be continued.  Let me assure this House that our strategy will be continued and will create the conditions for faster, sustainable growth and higher employment in the future.</P>
    <P>Net expenditure in the Energy, Forestry and Communications Votes has been reduced by 9 per cent as compared with 1987.  This level of reduction is about twice that of the total reduction in supply services.  On the capital side, reductions are being made on investment programmes in electricity production and distribution now that sufficient generating capacity is available for our foreseeable needs.  It is necessary, however, to continue development of our gas <Col N="1049" /> resources, forestry potential and our telecommunications network.  Overall, capital investment for the three areas for which I have responsibility will increase in 1988 by over 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>This contrasts with an overall reduction of 15 per cent under the Public Capital Programme.  The Government are firmly of the belief that investments in the areas I have mentioned are vital in order to attain the level of economic growth that is necessary to maintain and increase employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is the context in which the recently published Estimates are set. I intend, a Cheann Comhairle, in the rest of my intervention today to discuss the impact of those Estimates on, and the direction in which I see progress in, the various areas of Government which have been entrusted to my care.</P>
    <P>With regard to future developments in the Energy area, I am pursuing a programme to achieve as rapidly as possible:</P>
    <P> (1) the re-establishment of Ireland as a prospective territory for further oil and gas exploration following on the recently announced amendments to the licensing terms;</P>
    <P>(2) the exploitation of our natural gas resources by the extension of the natural gas grid northwards to Dundalk, so as to expand the benefits of natural gas supply to industry, commerce and domestic consumers;</P>
    <P>(3) the lowest possible energy prices by ensuring that the full benefits of the relatively low and stable international oil price and the knock-on effects of these oil prices on other fuels, are passed on to consumers. </P>
    <P>As already indicated to the House earlier this year, I have put in train the preparation of a White Paper on Energy Policy.</P>
    <P>One of my primary objectives is to revitalise our oil and gas exploration programme. The omens for exploration, as I found them when I came into office, were not favourable.  The price of crude oil had stabilised at a much lower level than applied a few years ago.  There was <Col N="1050" /> still intense pressure on oil companies' exploration budgets and our drilling results in the previous couple of years were not encouraging.</P>
    <P>Prior to the announcement of the new terms I was faced with a situation where deferment of the two obligations wells listed for 1987 was being sought on technical grounds and where there were only two firm drilling commitments for the next five years, one for 1988 and one for 1991. Our 1987 wells did not live up to expectations.  There was a distinct possibility that exploration might simply dwindle away in the next few years.  Once the exploration companies had left the Irish scene it might be impossible to attract them back.  I decided that radical action was necessary to reverse the trend.  This was only possible in the area under our direct control, i.e., the licensing terms.</P>
    <P>The new terms have the important virtue of simplicity.  Briefly, they provide for the elimination of royalties, free depreciation of exploration and development expenditure against corporation tax which remains at a rate of 50 per cent and no other State participation in profits except that, where production exceeds 100 million barrels of oil or equivalent gas, an additional levy will apply to bring the State take to 60 per cent of net revenues.</P>
    <P>I cannot guarantee that the new terms will produce a new wave of exploration. Other factors apart from the financial régime will be taken into account by the oil companies.  What I have done is to throw down a challenge to the oil companies. We have now gone as far as is realistically possible and it is up to them to respond.  Already I have been able to announce an exciting new well in the Porcupine area to be drilled in 1988 by BP and I am fairly confident that a second well will also be drilled in that area.</P>
    <P>These wells would not have happened if the terms had remained unchanged.  I am vigorously pursuing with the oil companies the question of further expanding or accelerating drilling programmes in the light of the new terms.  Some results in the way of early seismic programmes <Col N="1051" /> have already been achieved and negotiations on other possibilities, including the drilling of wells, are being actively pursued.  The early response to the new terms is encouraging and companies are looking at Ireland again with interest and, indeed, certain large companies, which some years ago had taken conscious decisions to abandon the Irish offshore, have been in touch with us again since the new terms were announced.  I expect, in the short term to 1989, that as a minimum the number of wells previously envisaged will be doubled.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of exploration I would like to briefly mention minerals. I am pleased to report a buoyant situation with regard to minerals exploration. The increase in prospecting activity arises from the extension to Ireland of the renewed interest worldwide in the search for gold. Reports so far are encouraging but hard minerals prospecting is not something that achieves results overnight.  I will ensure that applications for minerals prospecting licences will be processed by my Department as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With successes in the past in the discovery and the bringing into production of base metal mines &mdash; zinc, lead and copper &mdash; coupled with the encouraging results in recent times of exploration at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, the minerals industry remain optimistic about Ireland's potential for further economic base metal mines and exploration for these is continuing.</P>
    <P>I have been reviewing the present practice of leaving State mining lease terms for hard minerals for settlement at the time an ore body is fully delineated and its economics determined.  In doing so I have had due regard to the concerns of industry as expressed in the submissions that have been made to me.  I expect to complete my review of this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board's non-voted capital expenditure for 1988 will be of the order of £109 million.  This represents a decrease of 14 per cent on <Col N="1052" /> the 1987 anticipated outturn of £127 million and reflects the continuing trend of reduced capital expenditure by the board following the completion of the Moneypoint project.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the ESB do not envisage any price increase over the next few years and I will ensure that any possibility for further price reductions will be kept under continuing review.</P>
    <P>The sum provided for the western package electrification scheme is £0.9 million.  To date, 4,763 applications have been approved under this scheme at a cost of over £11 million and it is anticipated that a further 600 farms will benefit under this scheme in 1988.</P>
    <P>Included in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are a number of major expansion and development projects by the ESB of their external activities.  Projects being actively pursued and examined cover overseas consultancies, commercial fisheries, small hydro-electric installations and transhipment facilities at Moneypoint.  A special unit of top people within the ESB is being given the job of seeking new development opportunities on both the home and export markets.  It is hoped that such expansion will provide up to 600 jobs.  In this context I will shortly be circulating to Deputies a new Bill, the main purpose of which will be to allow the ESB greater commercial flexibility to expand in the areas which I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The integration of the European energy infrastructure is an important step towards European cohesion in the Community. Internally the ESB and my Department continue to study the question of inter-connection between Ireland and either UK and/or mainland Europe. This is a major question with far-reaching policy considerations and very significant capital costs.  Studies are not yet complete and, as Minister, it will be my task to ensure that all aspects of the validity of the case for a supply of electricity from this source will be exhaustively examined. Electricity is not, however, an end in itself, and the case for inter-connection of gas must also be kept in mind.  It is not a question of rivalries; it is a question of <Col N="1053" /> optimum economic benefit and when one is tailoring one's cloth with care one endeavours to get the best value.  Inter-connectors can operate in both directions and be of interest and benefit to both parties.  The entire subject is one which this country cannot afford to ignore.</P>
    <P>The work of gas mains replacement and network renewal in Dublin is continuing and is likely to continue at a high level for several years.  A major part of the Bord Gáis Éireann allocation in the public capital programme will be on the distribution systems in Dublin and other areas.  My Department will, of course, continue to monitor closely the implementation by BGE of the recommendations of the various safety reports which have been published this year.</P>
    <P>Another major item for which funds have been allocated is the extension of the national gas grid northwards to Dundalk. This is in line with the Government policy which is to extend the benefits of natural gas supply to industry, commerce and domestic consumers in the area from Dublin to Dundalk.  During the construction phase of the project, an average of 200 jobs will be created and I expect that up to 70 per cent of goods and services used on the project will be Irish. The estimated cost of the project is about £31 million.  A proposal for funding for the project under the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund has been submitted to the EC, for inclusion as part of the EC programme for the economic and infrastructural development of the Border regions.</P>
    <P>A number of major industries, including the horticultural industry are located in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline and access to a secure and efficient source of energy will ensure their continued development.  The availability of natural gas in the region will, I hope, pave the way for the expansion and development of new industrial and commercial opportunities.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation continues to be an important component of energy policy.  I am anxious to get the message across to the public that saving energy saves money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> In so far as Bord na Móna are concerned, I am very happy to announce that following the two difficult years of 1985 and 1986 when, owing to adverse weather conditions the harvests were down and the board's finances were badly hit, the 1987 harvest is slightly above target.  The House will note that in the 1988 Estimates an amount of £52,000 is provided for currency exchange loss on certain borrowings by Bord na Móna.  This arises from a 25 million Eurocurrency loan taken up by Bord na Móna to deal with their financial difficulties from 1985 and 1986 and the exchange losses are borne by the Exchequer to help alleviate these difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Valoren Programme will inject capital into the board's development activities.  This, together with the Eurocurrency support, will help the board to complete elements in the third development programme which would otherwise have been postponed or abandoned, with very serious employment consequences, because of its recent financial problems.</P>
    <P>These strategies are, of course, directed towards achieving the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which aims for the development over five years of more than 8,600 hectares of additional bogland at a cost of £22 million which between new jobs and jobs which would otherwise be lost, accounts for almost 500 jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government have placed strong emphasis on forestry as a means of job creation and to ensure an expanding programme of forestry development, have decided that the existing Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which are suitable for this purpose will be immediately transferred to the Forestry Service.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, two projects are proposed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> First, the upgrading of the jetty at Whitegate is being examined.  The objective is to achieve savings in the areas of freighting costs and purchasing flexibility. At present the jetty is restricted to cargo sizes of 480,000 barrels of crude. Upgrading could increase this capacity to 600,000 barrels.  The second proposal <Col N="1055" /> relates to fish farming at the Whiddy Island oil terminal.  At present the INPC in conjunction with a Norwegian joint venture partner is conducting a pilot project on salmon farming utilising one of the dormant crude oil tanks.  The pilot project will be completed by the end of 1988 and decisions on its continuation as a commercial project can be taken then. I should say here that the integrity of Whiddy as an oil terminal will be maintained irrespective of developments in relation to fish farming.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on nuclear matters is to ensure that nuclear plants do not pose a threat to the health of the people or pollute our environment.  As Deputies will be aware, I have been using and will continue to use every opportunity at international level and in contacts with individual countries to seek support for such measures.  I am encouraged by responses I am getting.  To implement that policy I will shortly be introducing legislation to set up a new Radiological Protection Institute with the task of monitoring radioactivity and controlling the use of radioactive devices and advising the Government and the public on all measures necessary to protect health and safety.</P>
    <P>Despite the very difficult financial situation, the Government attach such a high degree of priority to safeguarding the public that the funds available for radiological protection are increased in 1988.  As I announced to the House recently, the Estimates include a provision of £250,000 to enable the commencement of the phasing-in of an emergency plan to deal with the effects of a nuclear accident.  The plan is being finalised at present and I will shortly be putting my recommendations on the matter to the Government.  I will announce the details of the plan when it has been fully worked out and approved.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Forestry Vote for the funds needed to develop and exploit our natural advantages in relation to the production of timber.  Apart from the beneficial effects <Col N="1056" /> that increased production and utilisation of Irish-grown timber would have on our balance of payments through import substitution, there will be very firm export markets available for many years ahead for any surplus timber we may produce due to the forecast deficit in world timber production in relation to anticipated demand.  The Government's confidence in the potential of our forestry and timber industry will be matched with appropriate policies to ensure that this potential is realised and exploited.</P>
    <P>While it has been found necessary, in line with other State activities, to reduce in these Estimates the funding available for the purchase of land for State afforestation, this does not, however, mean a curtailment in this Government's determination and commitment to increase the State forest base by record planting levels.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the Government decision that the Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which are suitable for forestry will be transferred in future to the Forest Serivce of my Department.  This will apply to any cutaway lands which are at present available for planting and also to those areas which will become available in the future as Bord Na Móna bogs are exhausted for turf production purposes. The mechanisms for the orderly transfer of these lands from Bord na Móna have now been established.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the Forest Service will plant some 10,000 hectares.  This will be achieved largely through the planting of lands in the Forest Service's own land reserve and the planting of 1,000 hectares of Bord na Móna cutaway.  This, together with anticipated private sector planting of 3,000 hectares, will give an all-time national planting record of 13,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>While the Government will be pressing ahead with the expansion of State afforestation, they will also be taking more positive steps to secure a significant sizeable expansion of the private forestry sector.</P>
    <P>The grants available under the forestry element of the western package are such that a tree crop can be established at a <Col N="1057" /> very much reduced cost when the grants are taken into account.  While these grants may be available at present only in the western region of the country, proposals are being examined in Brussels for the extension of the scheme to the disadvantaged areas of the eastern region.  I am confident the proposals will be favourably considered by the European Commission because they make economic sense for Europe in the long term and fit in well with the &ldquo;Delors Package&rdquo; ideas for reform of the structural funds and greater economic cohesion within the Community.</P>
    <P>The extension will cover an additional 635,000 hectares of land east of the Shannon which will qualify for much higher rates of afforestation grants than at present.  Farmers in this region will benefit, as those at present in the western region, from grants amounting to 85 per cent of their afforestation costs subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare.  Non-farmers will qualify for 70 per cent grants also subject to £800 maximum.  Approval is also being sought from the European Commission for a scheme of afforestation grants for full time farmers outside the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Effectively there will be considerably higher afforestation grants available throughout the country than heretofore. Farmers who afforest even part of their land will continue to be eligible for headage payments.  A free technical advisory service will be available for all those considering the afforestation of all or part of their holdings.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there be a substantial take-up of these grants as up to 50 per cent of the cost will be recoupable from the EC. EC funds will be available for publicising and promoting the schemes.</P>
    <P>Preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the previously announced decision to create a new State company to manage State forestry along commercial lines is now well advanced and it is hoped that the new company will be ready for launching early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the House is <Col N="1058" /> aware, decided to sell a small proportion of the State forests in 1987 in order to generate additional funding for an expanded planting programme.  While the response to the initial advertisements was disappointing it has, nevertheless, given some hope for optimism in so far as where sales were successful the amounts tendered were in line with the Department's valuation expectations.  There is a market for medium to long term investment of funds in forestry and, with the development of a greater awareness by fund managers of this investment medium, the feasibility of attracting a greater level of funding is worth pursuing further.  For this reason I have decided in 1988 to again generate £3 million through the sale of immature forests as a means of financing ongoing forest development.</P>
    <P>The 1988 public capital programme includes an amount of £135 million for Telecom Eireann, including £15 million from the European Regional Development Fund, compared to the 1987 Estimate of £120 million.  All of BTE's capital expenditure will be met from non-Exchequer sources and there will be no drain on Exchequer funds.  After taking into account the Regional Fund moneys of approximately £15 million, most of the capital expenditure will be met from the company's own resources rather than by borrowing.</P>
    <P>It is likely also that funds will be available from the STAR Programme.  This is a major new programme of advanced telecommunications developments which will be aided by the EC.  The prime aim of this programme is to foster the economic development of the least favoured regions of the Community and to make them more attractive as locations for investment by improving access to advanced telecommunications services in line with the Community's objectives in this field.  Under this programme, the European Regional Development Fund may aid the establishment of the basic infrastructure necessary for the provision of advanced telecommunications services and may also assist the promotion of measures to boost the supply of, and the demand for, these advanced services. <Col N="1059" /> The programme proposes to allocate approximately £39 million to Ireland over a period of five years from 1987 to 1991. I hope to be able to make a further statement about this programme before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>After achieving static postage rates for letters and postcards since spring 1986, it is the objective of An Post to maintain current rates for another year.  The success of An Post in the operation of the national lottery is an excellent example of the ability and professionalism of the company.</P>
    <P>There is a need to improve, refurbish and extend post office accommodation in a number of post office areas.  An allocation of £8 million has been provided in the 1988 public capital programme for An Post.  As with Telecom Éireann, this expenditure will not represent a draw on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>To turn to broadcasting, the Estimate for Communications provides for payments of grants-in-aid to RTE of amounts equivalent to net receipts from television licence fees and cable licence fees, based on total receipts from the sale of television licences and receipts from cable licences minus an appropriate deduction for costs.</P>
    <P>An Post has been delegated responsibility for the collection of television licence revenue and the detection of evaders.  The Estimate provides for a payment to An Post to cover the costs involved.  In the year to end September 1987 An Post managed to meet the target of licence sales set for the company.</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann itself is, happily, in a fairly healthy financial position and results so far would indicate that the outturn this year will show an improvement over the very good results posted last year.</P>
    <P>Still on broadcasting matters, I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question last week that I would be introducing necessary legislation in the current session to provide a legal framework for the development of local radio and thereby put an end to the present unsatisfactory <Col N="1060" /> situation.  Concurrently, I will be reintroducing the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill which is designed to strengthen my powers to suppress illegal broadcasting and illegal wireless telegraphy activity generally.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the co-operation of the House in processing these two pieces of legislation speedily and thereby regularising what has been a most unsatisfactory situation for many years.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, our priority in Government is to restore confidence in the economy quickly and open up new opportunities for employment.  To achieve this objective we must improve investment, bring down interest rates and encourage flows of capital into the economy.  An essential precondition was that we demonstrate emphatically our determination to improve the budget position and reduce spending.  This we have done.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1988, together with all the other initiatives, will in the lifetime of this Government bring about economic recovery and stability, providing employment for our people and hope for the future.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Birmingham and I will be as concise as I can. This debate is timely.  It is only proper and right that the Dáil respond to the economic and national crisis which faces us and that people like me should have an opportunity of contributing to this debate.  We are living at a time of crisis with more than 250,000 unemployed and emigration in full spate again, with young people especially running out of the country daily.  Our national debt has reached £24 billion and all income tax paid and PRSI are servicing that debt and not the production of wealth and the creation of employment.  Therefore, it is proper today to see if we can find some solution to the problems.</P>
      <P>In this House we should not just fritter away our time with ephemeral arguments about the national malaise.  Let us look back at the economic strategy that has been used mainly by Fianna Fáil Governments since we gained independence 65 years ago.  At that time world trade markets were already tied up by the major economic powers and it was difficult for us to impinge on those markets to gain even a toehold.  Then as now, agriculture was our main industry and we had to fight an economic war with Britain in the thirties to find some place in that market. There was decimation of employment then, not only in urban areas, farm labouring was wiped out in the twenties and thirties.  Historians, including our Labour historians, have written little about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil came into power in 1932 as the party of the small farmers and small businessmen, the economic champion of the small man.  Fianna Fáil have spoken about a programme for national recovery and regenerating the national spirit.  They brought a good deal of industrial expansion to Ireland in the thirties.  Employment figures rose gradually throughout the thirties because Fianna Fáil were able to adopt protectionism as part of their economic policy.  They gave aid in subsidies <Col N="1062" /> and grants to people who produced for the home market and they put tariff walls on outside goods.  All that had a beneficial effect in the short term.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately while they could protect native industry, they could not make it efficient in terms of world markets and world competition.  That policy failed at the end of the thirties.  It lasted for about eight years before it fizzled out.  A new class arose then about whom Seán Ó Faolain wrote very eloquently as a &ldquo;class of middle men who contribute nothing to the country but a distribution service at a high cost&rdquo;.  They were unable to tackle the fundamental problems of our society.  That legacy of a high cost is with us to this day. Fianna Fáil were caught as a Government with a strategy which had run out of steam then.  We had very high unemployment throughout the forties and fifties.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil then did something which at the time seemed miraculous.  They were able to turn their back on the policy of protectionism and open the economy to free trade and to multinationals and still retain power.  The historians have not written about that either.  To turn a somersault on your entire basic policies, adopt reverse policies and still retain power was a miraculous achievement. Fianna Fáil then had no option because in 1957 &mdash; a year I remember well because I was one of the emigrants then &mdash; emigration was running very high with about 70,000 people leaving the country, the economy was stagnant and we were forced, as we are now, to do some fundamental thinking.  Unfortunately we seem to be bereft of economists to do the fundamental thinking we need to find the way forward.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan and Dr. Whitaker came forward and Deputy Seán Lemass was there to avail of the strategy of free trade in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which was formulated at that time.  Again the effect was dramatic.  We brought in the multinationals and we made changes in our education system. The body later known as AnCO were set up to train workers for the new system of industry where new skills were needed. We established RTCs throughout the <Col N="1063" /> country and we founded NIHEs in Limerick and Dublin.  Other changes took place to facilitate the new drive in the economy such as foreign capital coming in.  We brought in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and in the seventies we joined Europe.  The effect was dramatic. There was an increase in employment and in output as a result of industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have run out of steam again.  We are at another crossroads. That bubble has burst and we are left with the effects of it. Deputy Seán Lemass described the tide lifting all boats.  The tide is no longer rising, it is receding and I am afraid the ship of State has been scuttled and no one is able to refloat it.  The documents before us today offer little in the way of a new programme for economic expansion.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to many of the speakers in this debate, expecially the Minister for Defence, Deputy Noonan, who to some degree spoke about agriculture. The money we have got from the EC has been largely squandered.  We have very poor results from it, and that was not mentioned by the speakers.  What has happened in the EC was like throwing apples into an orchard.  We exported beef and milk into that market which was already cluttered with beef and milk. That cannot go on.  Whether we like it or not, there will be changes in the CAP which will be forced on us. Our farmers must meet them intelligently and efficiently.  They must diversify in the production of food, otherwise they will face a great deal of trouble.  There is no reference to that in the document. Farmers are an extremely strong lobby to this House and people are afraid to say what should be said relating to agriculture. Too often land has been seen not as a means of production but as a status symbol giving somebody status and security in the community, but that day is gone.  Land will have to be used in the interests of all our people, not merely of a small élite.  We must be interested in <Col N="1064" /> creating jobs inside and outside the factory gate if agriculture is to play a part in this so called national recovery.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have been criticised in this debate for making a deal with the Government.  I would not go down that road.  The trade unions did the best they could in the circumstances and time will tell whether they were hoodwinked or gulled.  I do not think it would be very fruitful for me to engage with the trade unions for taking part in this agreement. The trade unions are intelligent and practical enough to understand that this was the best deal they could get in the circumstances. There is no point in using that situation to settle old scores, although I am sure that some people have good reason to go down that road, but we must be objective about the whole question.  I will not deal with that further today.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, private enterprise has failed to solve our unemployment problems.  We need State involvement in food processing so as to provide employment.  That has been obvious for a long time.</P>
    <P>The documents before us are very vague about the role of the banks and the role of society.  The banks cannot just stand aside, because they have contributed a great deal to our problems. The Minister for Defence referred to the Wall Street crash.  He mentioned people who were hiring hotel bedrooms at the time and no one knew whether they were using them to sleep in or as places from which to throw themselves out the windows. The Minister referred to sheep being led to the slaughter.  That was an unfortunate analogy.  The Minister did not really say why a crisis has occurred in the world money markets now.  The crisis in the world money markets can be attributed to the greed of the people who manipulate the markets, who have used them to inflate the price of stocks and shares, to make killings on the market and who do not care about employment, production or anything else.  They use the money markets in a negative way and without social responsibility.  The Minister might reflect on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The banks must contribute to finding solutions to our problems.  They cannot be let off the hook.  They must pay more taxes and use their funds to fund productive enterprises, to create employment and to boost our export trade.  The cutbacks themselves will do nothing to create employment.  There is room for savings right across the board.  The Minister for Labour knows that we have a whole plethora of bodies dealing with unemployment.  We have AnCO, team work schemes, youth employment schemes and so on.  I am not sure what role the Minister has in mind for the National Youth Council but certainly there is need for co-operation in the area of all these schemes and organisations. All these agencies have the same objective. Surely there is room for amalgamation, co-ordination and more efficiency in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins talked about the National Social Service Board.  This body did excellent work and it was noted for its independence.  The board served all politicians irrespective of party affiliations and it served independent bodies and voluntary organisations and groups. Some of the people from this board have come to see me and they have been devastated that that body has now been wiped out with the stroke of a pen.  I would like the Minister to consider that, too.</P>
    <P>If one has plenty of money and is not dependent on social welfare it is easy to talk about social welfare cuts and about social welfare abuses.  One is looking at it from a different perspective.  The people here who talk about social welfare cuts and abuses are well off and never had to draw social welfare.  These people believe in the survival of the fittest, in jungle warfare.  That is a narrow negative attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister Deputy Burke, spoke about local radio in his address to the House.  The spread of illegal radio throughout Ireland is an indictment of this House.  We pussyfooted about talking about introducing legislation to deal with it and only now is the Minister bringing a Bill in.  It is to be welcomed although <Col N="1066" /> it is a decade too late. Our handling of this whole question reflects on the legislators. It was a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made to the effect that we have too many people living on this island.  That is utter nonsense. Holland has 14 million people living in an area the size of Munster.  They have full employment.  They have good engineering and industrial capacity and they send their surplus food to Ireland, to Limerick.  Every day in Limerick one can buy Dutch vegetables.  It is silly to say that we have too many people living here.  We have not enough people.  We need our young people to generate employment and wealth.  It would be like saying that we should give Australia back to the Aborigines because the immigrants in the settlements were overcrowded.  It would be like saying that America should be returned to the Red Indians on the basis that the European settlements and the people who emigrated there overcrowd it.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>We should take advantage of the natural resources of our country.  We are only scratching the surface in relation to tourism. Tourism has great potential and should be developed.</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks one can take £485 million out of a small economy like ours without causing distress and hardship does not know much about economics. The economists are very good at telling us about what went wrong about 20 years too late but they are not so good at finding solutions to the problems when they occur.  The only economist I know of who has shown an interest in finding an alternative strategy is Eoin O'Malley of the ESRI.  I do not know if the Minister or the House has seen the document called <i>The Irish Engineering Industry: Strategic Analysis and Policy Recommendations.</i> It is set out in eight different sections.  One section which the Minister and his advisers might read is called, &ldquo;Suitable Industries for Irish Indigenous Development&rdquo;.  That is an attempt to look at what is wrong with our society, how we have gone wrong and how we can pick ourselves up out of the morass. It is the best thing I have seen, far better <Col N="1067" /> than anything contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> or in the Estimates.  Any document I have read in the last few years concerning the malaise in our society does not deal with the problem in a fundamental way as does this one.  It is in the Dáil Library and is worth looking at.  I would commend it to the Minister and his advisers.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is a pie in the sky document.  We are promised pie in the sky when all that is in this document has taken place.  We are all to be trimmed down, lean, healthy and active again. That is nonsense.  We must think of the people now, not at some date in the future.  That is only wishful thinking, not economic forecasting with much to offer. There is nothing behind the document except the hope that something will turn up.  We are hoping we will find oil or something like that.  That attitude is no good.  The Government should tackle the problems on the ground and use our resources and our people to create employment here.  The Government should go after the tax evaders who are a disgrace to us.  Then and only then will we find a programme for national recovery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>In a situation of limited resources it is necessary, despite, the difficulties, to define priorities for action.  In the Manpower area, my major priorities are to help the long term unemployed and early school leaver experiencing difficulty in entering the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the long term unemployed, we have this year introduced a more structured approach to assisting people through the Jobsearch programme.  As a result, a significant number of places on existing Manpower programmes is being reserved for Jobsearch participants identified by the Department of Social Welfare and referred to the National Manpower Service.  To ensure that those unemployed for a longer term, benefit <Col N="1070" /> from the programme a live register qualification is essential.</P>
    <P>As regards school leavers experiencing employment difficulties, my priority has been to maintain the assistance given under the social guarantee for youth with little or no qualifications.  The main programmes are the skills foundation and workshops in AnCO.  Deputies will be aware of the operation of these programmes and the benefits they offer to young people.  I am concerned that claims that the agencies have stopped recruiting young people under 18 may reduce young people's motivation to come forward for these programmes.  I would like to assure early or unqualified school leavers that they will continue to enjoy priority access to relevant programmes.</P>
    <P>As far as employment schemes are concerned, Teamwork continues to make places available to young people under 18.  While the social employment and enterprise schemes have never been open to persons under 18, a live register qualification was introduced to the employment incentive scheme from 2 June 1987 and the work experience programme has been suspended.  The numbers of 16 to 18 year olds who have been given places on Manpower programmes since 1985 are as follows:</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is abundant evidence that those who find it most difficult to obtain employment are those who leave the educational system early?  In those circumstances how does he justify putting impediments in the way of their obtaining training and temporary employment opportunities?  Surely, by any standards, this is a group who have a claim on the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Birmingham that it is the people who leave school early who have the greatest obstacles to overcome, and I am anxious to try to do something about it.  In the first place, young people should not be leaving school until they are 15 years at least, but that is not what happens.  What is on offer to people leaving before the <Col N="1071" /> age of 18, are workshop courses and skills foundation courses, lasting for six months, if they are lucky to get on a course.  After that they revert back to the role of an early school leaver with no advantages.  I announced during the summer that, in conjunction with the Department of Education, we will endeavour to structure a proper programme. First, it should be said that, at all costs young people should be discouraged from dropping out of the educational system because the statistics prove that there is very little future for people dropping out at a young age.  They get off to a bad start and it is difficult to reverse the trend later.  What happens is that they spend six months on a course, then a year or two doing nothing and then on to another course, perhaps a Teamwork course and later on another course.  After all that they have still failed to advance themselves by getting any kind of sustainable job or qualification. What I have announced is that we should set up a scheme for people who drop out of school at a young age, lasting one, two or three years.  If a person of 15 in the educational system requires three years of full time education to make the break from school to work, surely a person from a disadvantaged area requires longer than six months?  For that reason I think some of the present resources are not being used to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's plans for the future are very interesting.  Will he confirm that the effect of his announcement in the present context is that those young people who have left the educational system who are under 18 years of age will be condemned to enforced idleness?  Whatever plans he has for the future, the effect of his decision is that they will not be able to avail of training opportunities or temporary employment opportunities that were previously open to them.  The effect of that is that when they apply for a vacancy, already disadvantaged by the fact that they have left the educational system at an early age, they now suffer the further <Col N="1072" /> disadvantage of having to admit to an employer that they have been through a prolonged period of idleness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The main courses, as the Deputy knows, are the social guarantee places in AnCO, that is for disadvantaged area school leavers, and they are being maintained at the present levels.  The programmes catering for these trainees would be the skills foundation for group/intermediate certificate holders and workshops for unqualified early school leavers.  The relevant figures in respect of the skills foundation programme up to the end of September this year was 764; the figure for the same period last year was 784 and the previous year it was 359.  For the workshop course the figure is 1,624 as against 1,488 last year and 1,397 the previous year.  I would not accept that the most disadvantaged people are being hit.  Under the enterprise employment incentive scheme there is now a period where early leavers would have to be on the dole so they cannot take advantage of that scheme.  But there is also considerable evidence to show that in the past employers used that scheme to take on young people and get a grant from the State.  I am not saying it was abused in all cases, but there is an argument that the money should be used for better structured programmes and that is what I am going to do.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 2, will the Minister indicate whether he accepts there are quite a number of young people who are not on the live register simply because they will not get any benefit by being on it?  They are either means-tested out of assistance or indeed the assistance they would receive is so low that it would not pay the bus fare to get into the labour exchange. Does the Minister not think that, as a consequence, the regulations which preclude them from availing of AnCO or Manpower services are an unfair discrimination against them?</P>

Equally, it discriminates against women who up until now may have worked at home and, therefore, are not on the live register. They may want to re-enter the labour force or acquire some training to enable them to re-enter the labour force.  They are a second group who are discriminated against by these regulations.</P>

      <P>They would not be excluded from all the courses, only some of them.  The Teamwork scheme which is a very attractive &mdash; or at least popular &mdash; scheme with those over 18 years and under 25 years has a requirement that a person must have been unemployed for at least six months and registered for at least four weeks with the National Manpower Service.  Being on the live register is not a requirement.  The category which the Deputy referred to continually take up that scheme.  They would be excluded from taking part in the employment incentive scheme or any of the other schemes which have a stipulation that one must be on the live register. Those who are aged over 18 years and under 25 years are still eligible for AnCO training courses in the normal way and they can apply to take part in the Teamwork scheme.  The employment <Col N="1074" /> incentive scheme is the only one from which they are excluded.</P>

      <P>I would like to commend the Minister for his concern for the long term unemployed.  I have been concerned about them for a long time.  As a result of the moves the Minister has taken, the reduction in the number of places available to 16 year olds to 18 year olds has amounted to approximately 6,000, if one takes all the schemes for which the Minister has given figures.  Would the Minister not agree that this is, in effect, a cosmetic exercise to reduce numbers on the live register?  Only those over the age of 18 years are eligible for entry on to the live register.  Therefore, if you take them off the live register and place them on courses the numbers will be reduced.  I am very concerned that those aged between 16 and 18 years of age who have no vote and cannot express their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just coming to the end.  Essentially, these young people have no voice.  They have been taken off the schemes with those on the live register replacing them.  Would the Minister not agree that this disregards their rights and the need to cater for them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that this is not a cosmetic exercise and it is not an attempt to clear out some of those on the live register.  While the Jobsearch scheme could be regarded as an attempt at shaking up the live register, that was not its prime purpose.  However it may have been one of its effects.  Over 100,000 people will be interviewed this year for the Jobsearch programme. There is a great demand for courses by <Col N="1076" /> those who are over the age of 25 years and those who are long term unemployed. Unlike the last three or four years, there has been a much higher take-up by the long term unemployed of courses they have traditionally not gone for.  The figure for this year will be more or less similar to the one for the last couple of years but next year there will be a reduction in the number of places available because of the cutbacks.  The expenditure for this year amounts to £57 million and 19,831 places will be available through AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and CERT.  This figure is similar to that in recent years.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the numbers went down from a figure of 5,000 to 2,600 to date?  The Youth Employment Agency figures have gone down from a figure last year of 1,776 to 334.  There is no doubt that 16 year olds to 18 year olds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his earlier reply justified the decision to exclude this age group from the employment incentive scheme, which is a scheme whereby employers receive a premium <Col N="1077" /> for increasing their workforce, on the basis that there is some evidence to indicate that in the past some employers received payments for taking on people that they would have taken on anyway and to that extent it was wasteful expenditure. Would he accept that that argument, if it is one of validity, applies to the taking on of people of any age whatsoever? Would he not further accept that in the case of this category composed of people who have left the educational system at an early age and a category which is now going to be disadvantaged in regard to training, it is very necessary that employers should be given an incentive to make their selection for whatever vacancy exists from among that category lest we create a hard core of unemployed young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the reason that certain employers, not to generalise, take people from that category is because they get a grant from the State and then add a very small amount of money to that, something which they could not do with older people.  Secondly, I would far prefer to work towards other uses of the money rather than, as Deputy Kemmy was saying earlier, work experience, social guarantee, CERT and AnCO programmes, to have some type of rationale for people who drop out of the educational system at 14 and 15 years of age. All that I can offer at present is a six months' course.  These young people leave school to get money, which is the subject matter of a later question.  They spend six months on the course and go back out into the world as young school leavers with no future.  This system has been getting us nowhere with regard to helping such people.  The system is fundamentally wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to those who have an opportunity to participate <Col N="1078" /> in social guarantee programmes, skills foundation courses and so on, would the Minister accept that to date in many cases the progression has been from there into mainstream trading and that if one excludes that option from many young people there is a real danger that the money spent at the first stage on the skills foundation course will be absolutely wasted?  The period of the skills foundation course will be followed up by a period of enforced idleness.</P>

      <P>This dispute commenced around 1980.  Efforts have been made over the years to find a settlement formula acceptable to both sides.  These have included independent mediation, a rights commissioner's investigation, a formal hearing of the Labour Court and more recently an industrial relations officer of the court had intensive discussions with all the parties involved. Those discussions produced a formula which at the time was acceptable to the workers in dispute, but it is understood that difficulties have arisen with the result that the dispute continues.  I have no doubt the House will appreciate that every effort has been made for the last <Col N="1079" /> seven years to settle this long-running and difficult dispute.  In view of the damage being done to the commercial life of Waterford port, I would urge once again the parties involved to continue their efforts to find a solution to the dispute. The dispute settling agencies of the State remain available to the parties should they wish to avail of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute has lasted more like eight years than seven.  It commenced about November 1979.  Mediation has not succeeded and the conciliation officer was not successful. Can the Minister offer any form of solution? Can he actually impose such a solution?  Waterford port is crippled and so is the commerce of the city and the surrounding region to a certain degree because of this strike.  It is basically due to a clash of personalities, inter-union rivalry, call it what you will.  It is something which obviously cannot be resolved by operating through normal channels.  It needs something extra and I am asking the Minister to provide that something extra.  Whether it be an enforced settlement or whatever, I want to see a resolution to the problem.  Could the Minister promise us something in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  All the normal ways, as the Deputy said, have been tried &mdash; independent mediation, a rights commissioner's investigation, a formal hearing of the Labour Court and an industrial relations officer of the court trying independently to bring about a settlement.  The one major power that a Minister for Labour has under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act of 1946 is to investigate and the previous Minister used that procedure on 15 November 1985.  The Labour Court as part of its investigation commissioned a report on the economic and financial background of the dispute which has substantiated a number of the matters which Deputy Deasy has outlined. <Col N="1080" /> Following on the Labour Court investigation an industrial relations officer's report was made available to the parties, again to try to bring about a solution after considerable discussion by all the parties, particularly the trade unions concerned. The industrial relations officer followed the set of proposals which seemed to be getting agreement by saying that the proposals, if accepted by the unions, constituted an extraordinary means of resolving an extraordinary dispute.  That still remains the view.  I would be very anxious, if I could, to be of help.  I have had discussions with the people in the Department who have been involved in this matter for almost eight years and have tried every form of agreement.  I should be very glad to meet the Deputies from Waterford who, I understand, would have a major concern here.  If there is something I can do, I should be only too glad to attempt it.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this dispute has gone on for over seven years, of the bitterness that exists among the <Col N="1082" /> workforce in Waterford, and of the damage to the local economy, is there any mechanism by which the Minister could order a public sworn inquiry, or any formal inquiry by members of his Department?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The most extensive inquiry I can order would be one under the provisions of section 24.  That took place already almost 12 months ago.  I will examine the matters raised. As Deputies representing Waterford will know, there is no easy answer to this dispute.  Almost every channel has been tried, some of them several times over the last seven years within the terms of office of three successive Governments.  If anybody can give me any assistance, I will investigate the matters raised to ascertain whether there is anything further we can do.</P>

      <P>I do not believe I can do so on an industrial relations matter. But the inquiry held under section 24 is one not dissimilar to what the Deputy is requesting.  The Deputy will be familiar with the findings of that inquiry.  There have also been the normal rights commissioner's investigations and inquiries, and the Labour Court's efforts in this regard have been extensive over the years.  As I said in my reply, in view of the damage being done to the commercial life of Waterford port &mdash; and here I accept what the Deputies representing the area have said &mdash; I would urge the parties involved to continue their efforts to find a solution.  We can never give in in trying to resolve a dispute.

      <P>The IMI is, of course, a private organisation.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office, I have met the Chairman and Director General of the IMI as part of my regular discussions with the bodies associated with my Department.</P>
      <P>The 1988 allocation of £430,000 to the Irish Management Institute is being made against the background of the difficult Exchequer position and the need for an overall reduction in Government expenditure. The level of allocation in 1987 at £730,000 was exceptional.  It took account of the institute's deficit situation and an unexpected shortfall in assistance from the European Social Fund because of changes in the fund's rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, on a few occasions I met and explained to the IMI the difficult financial position and particularly discussed the budgetary position.  While I would not have outlined the exact figure at those meetings I did make it clear that their normal allocation was about £530,000.  Last year was a special case in point because the IMI had been refused assistance from the European Social Fund on foot of applications they has submitted.  In the March budget I argued for the maintenance of the figure contained in the draft Estimates prepared by the last Government.  The position this year is that there was no prospect of their being able to receive an amount in excess of £530,000 but, because of the difficult Exchequer position, I found I had to further reduce their allocation.  In regard to whether it will affect the courses they provide or how they will disperse the allocation of £430,000 for 1988, they have asked me to meet them to discuss that matter, which I shall be doing within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that a fair translation of what he has said is that, as a result of his discussions with the IMI, they had every reason to believe they would get £530,000, it being the traditional level, and that, as a result, the cut actually proposed came as a very unpleasant shock?  More fundamentally, would the Minister accept that weakness in management has been one of the major causes of our difficulties in recent years? Has he had any discussions at all with the people who drafted this remarkable document entitled <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which, amongst other things, proposes to place emphasis on <Col N="1085" /> management training?  Would the Minister say how that is consistent with what we have here?</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy will be supportive of my initiative in setting up the Advisory Committee on Management Training.  Because of the proliferation of agencies in management training I have set up that committee to ensure that the source of funding, costs of training and structures of payment are properly organised within the State.  I believe there are a number of organisations involved in management training who could usefully come together in providing a much more cost effective service. The report of that Advisory Committee on Management Training will be available next summer, from which we should be able to advise a much better management training system.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether he has satisfied himself that the State funding which the IMI receive is in fact being spent in the most effective way possible in the light of the emphasis laid thereon in the document <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>?  Furthermore, in that light, has the Minister made any suggestions as to how the IMI could spend that money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the roles of that Advisory Committee on Management Training &mdash; on which the IMI is strongly represented, along with a number of other bodies, the universities and various users &mdash; is the examination of the IMI present allocation, from private and State sources so that it is used in the most cost-effective way.  I cannot confirm at this stage whether or not it is.  That is something that will be examined by that advisory committee.  I must say that the people who run the IMI and other very active committees work extremely hard in the interests of management training.  I should like to have been in a position to allocate them the necessary resources this year but, because of the budgetary constraints, I was not in a position to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that there are a number of private organisations, companies, running courses that perhaps the IMI would argue they should control.  Also within the universities there is a considerable amount of work done for outside agencies as well as their own internal university work.  The IMI have argued at some length that perhaps it would be better were they the sole organisers of management training in the country. They have put forward that case very strongly.  Rather than my trying to decide that issue the new Advisory Committee on Management Training I have recently established will investigate that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 14 and 16 together.  I took the decision to revise the training allowances on Manpower schemes on foot of recommendations made by the Social Gurantee Advisory Board and endorsed by the Youth Employment Agency.  The Social Gurantee Advisory Board was established by a former Minister for Labour as a body representative of Manpower and educational authorities, youth interests and the social partners and has as one of its terms of reference &ldquo;to advise the Youth Employment Agency on the level of allowances for participants in youth training programmes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Training allowances for AnCO and CERT adult trainees are harmonised with unemployment assistance levels. Special rates are payable for 15 to 17 year olds who are not entitled to unemployment assistance.  Where individuals have entitlement to a higher rate of social welfare compensation, the higher amount will be paid as a training allowance. Trainees who were recruited before 17 August have retained their old allowance level.  Meal, travel and accommodation allowances are also payable where appropriate.  Free training is also provided.</P>
      <P>Because of the need for financial stringency in the public service I have no proposals to restore the previous allowance levels.  My main concern is to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from training opportunities within the limited resources available to me.  I am also concerned not to attract young people from the education system and claims were made that the AnCO training allowances for young people were having this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to state how many entrants to training courses after the operative date (i.e. 17 August) <Col N="1104" /> will be affected by the new allowances. Information on their age and social welfare entitlements would be required.  On the major assumption that the characteristics of trainees will not change, I estimate that Exchequer savings in the region of £1.5 million should be achieved in training and accommodation allowances in a full year.  Some of these potential savings could, however, be offset by higher unit training costs resulting from changes in the trainee profile.  Generally speaking, Exchequer expenditure on training allowances attracts matching funding from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>For community training workshops, AnCO plan to provide approximately 1,700 training places throughout the country for 1988, of which approximately 40 will be located in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>As the average duration of training in these workshops is around 6 months it is estimated that about 3,400 people in the country as a whole will be affected of which about 80 will be located in County Kildare.  It is estimated that most of these people will be affected by the reduction of trainee allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has accepted it as his decision to reduce the amount of payment to AnCO trainees. Would he accept that the scheme as it now stands is a closer step to nothing more than cheap labour by young people and nothing more than an incitement or encouragement to young people not to engage in the scheme but to remain on the dole, enjoying all the free time which would not be available to them if they were fully engaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained earlier that many of the courses for 15 to 17 year olds, while beneficial in their own right, are not structured in a way that help young people.  A number of these courses were considered by the advisory board who reported to the Youth Employment Agency.  It was finally my decision but it was based on the considerable advice of people in a number of walks of life who made up AnCO, CERT, the Youth Employment Agency, the educational <Col N="1105" /> sector, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the ICTU and the FUE.  They reported to the Youth Employment Agency and then to me.  It is argued that people leave the education system to go on six months training courses and then they become young school leavers with not future.  That is a fact.  Since the cuts were introduced, I have spent time speaking to the individuals concerned and a few points were raised which I should like to put on the record.  None of the school leavers see these courses as training courses, they see them as employment schemes which will help them for six months but there is no future for them.  In that way the State and the agencies involved con these young people because they believe they are getting a job with a future but the reality is that that never happened and is unlikely to happen.  It would be better if these young people were encouraged to stay in the education system.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, there is a category of people in the disadvantaged areas who are out of the school system and for them I would like to see a properly structured course of two to three years.  I initiated discussions with ACTED, who represent some of these community bodies, particularly workshops, to try to get under way properly structured courses which would genuinely help young people.  I am not saying there is anything really wrong with the present courses, but they are too short and they do not provide a future for young people.  If young people think school is no good, they leave and go on one of these courses.  This is not a good way to treat these young people.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Would the Minister agree that people between the ages of 15 and 18 years old who are on these courses are normally from deprived backgrounds and are encouraged by community leaders and others to avail of these courses?

Does he also agree that the only thing he has done is to take £5 from the 16-year-olds, £7 from the 17-year-olds and £7 from the rest to put them on the dole level?  Would he further agree that the only effect this will have is to ensure that young people will not even get involved in this bad scheme, and that he has done nothing about bringing forward proposals for a better scheme except to talk about it here today?  The effect of this will be to drive even larger numbers of young people onto the Minister for Foreign Affairs' Utopian emigration boat, and all <Col N="1107" /> for a total savings of a miserable £1.5 million.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education and I, at official level, are endeavouring in the short term to put together a scheme which will give some kind of continuity to people who leave school early.  My view is that it takes students in the second level institutions four or five years to prepare for the transition from school to work but the people in the most deprived disadvantaged areas are expected to do this in six months.  This is not reasonable.  With the advice and help of people with experience in this area, I hope we can set up a course for two or three years.  I agree with the Deputies when they say that these people are deprived and need assistance but the way we are trying to do this is counter-productive and the advisory board strongly recommended that by paying this money we are providing an incentive for young people to leave school, a move which will damage their future careers.  That is why I believe we have to restructure the system.</P>

I want to refer particularly to a unique centre in Gweedore, County Donegal, which is charged with the responsibility of providing courses for people from Donegal to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Meath and all Gaeltacht areas.

The discussion document I referred to will be issued, I hope, next week and interested parties will present submissions on it.  A number of submissions have been submitted to the Department.  One area of concern is that the tribunal has become too legalistic which was not the original intention.  I should like to tell Deputy Birmingham that I do not know anything about the events he referred to.  I had a meeting with the chairman and perhaps he may have thought, arising out of what I said, that I intended to go further than I intend.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if there will be any changes in relation to the allowances paid and other conditions applicable to trainees and those involved in the Teamwork scheme and social employment scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No changes are envisaged at present in the allowances paid and the other conditions applicable to those involved in the Teamwork scheme and the social employment scheme.  The last change in the Teamwork and SES allowances was on 1 April 1987.</P>
      <P>As regards trainees, AnCO and CERT trainee allowances were revised with effect from 17 August 1987, on foot of recommendations made by the social guarantee advisory board, which is representative of Manpower and educational authorities, youth interests and the social partners.  I also decided to revise accommodation allowances for trainees from 7 September 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to revision and I should like to ask him to confirm that when he mentions revision he means a reduction, that the revision of the Teamwork allowance involved a reduction of £10 per head. Does the Minister regard it as being in any way inconsistent that at a time when there is a proposal on the table to pay an increase to those in the public service every year for the next three years those who are in vulnerable areas, on the margins of society, apparently do not need any increase at all?  Does he see any inconsistency in trainees receiving no increase while those who administer the training empire will receive an increase of 2½ per cent per year for three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the reductions he referred to came into operation last April and there were not any reductions since.  At the time of the budget in March I succeeded <Col N="1112" /> in getting 1,000 extra places on the SES scheme.  There was no money available at the time but the cost of the increase in recruitment was partially offset by a reduction in the allowances paid to new participants without dependants from £70 to £60. Participants in receipt of an adult dependant allowance from the Department of Social Welfare prior to the commencement of the SES scheme continued to get the £85 allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying he believes that the needs of those who are on the Teamwork scheme, or those who are trainees in community workshops, are less than those of the Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Principal Officers and so on in his Department? Is he saying that their needs are less than those who sit in Baggot Street and administer these schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not. I would like to be in a position to pay more to recipients of trainee allowances but we are living in difficult economic times.  Many of the people concerned are on the maximum unemployment assistance of £38 but the majority are on less because those involved in the Teamwork scheme live at home.  The unemployment assistance they are entitled to is small, an average of about £15.  When we cut the allowance from £70 to £60 last April we were able to maintain the number on the Teamwork scheme and increase the number on the social employment scheme by 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the claims made by the Minister is that his schemes pay attention to the needs of the low paid and I should like to know, if that is one of his boasts, if he agrees it is unbelievable that those who are in secure employment are to receive increases while those who are paid less than the lowest paid in the public service will not receive any increase and, in fact, have been the victims of cutbacks in the last few months?</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that no persons who were on a course administered by my Department had their allowance reduced.  The reduction applied to new entrants and it is unfair of the Deputy to allege that there was a cut in the rate.  I ask the Deputy to consider that most of the people were on an allowance of £15 per week and were placed on a training course for which they received £60 per week plus a meal allowance and, where appropriate, a travel allowance. By reducing the amount paid to new entrants I was in a position, in our difficult economic circumstances, to maintain the numbers and, in one area, to increase them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will outline his intentions in relation to the work experience programme; the proposals, if any, he has to facilitate the transition of school leavers into the world of work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided to suspend the work experience programme in its present form.</P>
      <P>The work experience programme was, of course, one element in the transition from school to working life.  A problem I have found with a number of initiatives taken over the years to assist school leavers in the transition from school to work is that many of those availing themselves of the initiatives were least in need of assistance.  On the other hand, the majority of those needing assistance tended, for a number of reasons, to be excluded from these schemes.  This problem was addressed, to a large extent, by the social guarantee process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, and myself have been discussing what further can be done to assist those least able to make the transition from <Col N="1114" /> school to working on their own in recent weeks with a view to taking some further initiatives over and above the continuance of the social guarantee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that at a time of high unemployment, when there are far more applicants than vacancies, a premium is placed on experience?  The work experience programme provided young people with an opportunity to combat their lack of experience and to compete &mdash; if not as equals &mdash; then as less disadvantaged than they otherwise would have been in relation to older and more experienced job seekers.  Will the Minister accept that this decision will make it ever harder for school leavers to break into the world of work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of people who succeeded in gaining employment under this scheme were those who had the leaving certificate and a percentage of them were graduates.  Over two-thirds of those who secured places on the scheme had the leaving certificate or a higher qualification.  The undisputed facts are that employers, instead of advertising in the newspapers for an individual, rang their Manpower office, were supplied with a worker paid for by the taxpayer for six months and then decided whether that person was suitable.  It is my view and that of most people involved in the scheme that it was subsidising employers who intended to recruit workers anyway. That is a luxury which we cannot afford at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that for any existing vacancy there will be people coming forward with qualifications out of proportion to the job? Graduates are applying for positions that in the past would have been reserved for school leavers, people with high honours in their leaving certificate are applying for posts which in the past would have been booked for those with the intermediate certificate.  The effect is that employers are in a position to choose and are likely to employ someone with <Col N="1115" /> experience.  This means that the school leaver will have no opportunity to break out of the chicken and egg position of no experience, no work, no work, no experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The logic is correct but we are talking about the work experience programme.  When employers wanted an employee they got one subsidised by the taxpayer.  They did not have to pay that person for six months and if they liked him or her they paid the salary after that from their own resources.  If they did not think the employee's performance was up to standard they let the person go and looked for another person under the scheme.  At a time when I have difficulty in maintaining allowances for the travelling community and other courses for truly disadvantaged people, I am confident that employers will continue to take on new employees.  A section of the people who use the work experience programme may be disadvantaged but well over two-thirds have a good educational background.  A number of people may require assistance and they will be covered by the review I mentioned earlier.</P>

    <Col N="1202" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that this Government's success in negotiating a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with employers, unions and some farmers and the action it is taking through reductions in public expenditure in order to stabilise the national finances has left the Opposition spokesmen in something of a dilemma.</P>
      <P>They could not face up to the question of whether to bring the social partners into their confidence.  They were fainthearted about trying to get the maximum consensus possible in support of the steps necessary to deal with grave national problems.  For Fianna Fáil securing the widest and possible support for remedial action to get us out of serious economic and social difficulties is a matter of political philosophy.  Consensus is never given in modern life.  It has to be worked at.  It takes political courage to pursue stringent financial policies, exercised in the national interest in the medium and long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In facing up to the grave financial problems of this country, we decided as a matter of principle that it was better to bring the social partners along with us as far as possible.  As everybody knows, the Coalition Government turned their backs on such an approach.  They spurned the idea of consulting the social partners and far from facing up to the increasingly serious financial crisis, they simply added to the problems.  Consulting the social partners does not mean that we jettisoned the Government's responsibility to govern or that we have abandoned the capacity to take the hard decisions.  The publication of the Book of Estimates for 1988 bears this out.  The fact that Government action to reduce public expenditure involves doing what many Opposition spokesmen and virtually all economic pundits had been advocating has left both groups searching frantically for some basis on which to criticise the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the reductions in proposed expenditure.  The results of their frantic search are surprising to say the least.  The total of the cuts is acceptable, they say, but the individual cuts <Col N="1203" /> which go to make this total are open to question.</P>
    <P>The expenditure allocations for 1988 reflect our commitment to distributing the burden evenly across all sectors, while conserving resources to ensure that the weaker sections are protected to the greatest possible extent.  We have protected some services from any appreciable reduction and have agreed to maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits.  Our commitment to working with the social partners is no hollow exercise.  In agreement with the trade union movement, the Government have ensured that the interests of the low paid and of those on social welfare are given priority in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and are protected to the greatest possible extent in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Opposition &mdash; and some economic experts &mdash; have homed in on the pay increases for the public service over the next three years or so.  Feeling they have a soft target in public servants, they say the increases proposed are excessive or that there should have been no increases at all for these groups.</P>
    <P>Do they think they could win general approval for immediate action to tackle our serious economic and social problems by leaving pay determination to a market free-for-all?  Would they hope to secure industrial peace by imposing a pay freeze?  They would have left the weaker sections of the workforce without any protection for their standard of living. They would not have been thanked either by the many middle income earners who, with little clout to win themselves special pay terms in a free for all, would be forced to face greatly reduced living standards.</P>
    <P>I find this attitude most difficult to understand.  Anybody who has a notion of industrial relations and the pay determination process can recognise a realistic pay settlement when he sees one.  The pay increase is reasonable and worthwhile for both sides.  The stability it gives is invaluable for the Government and the private sector in planning for the medium term.  It would be hard to justify a pay <Col N="1204" /> freeze of up to three or four years for public servants and for public servants only, as is implied in some Opposition criticisms.</P>
    <P>Reductions in public expenditure require some rationalisation and reduction in numbers and this would be so regardless of whether any pay increases were negotiated for public servants. We simply cannot continue to employ more people than we can afford to pay.  A pay pause of six months after the expiry of the current pay agreements in the public sector will apply.  The Estimates were framed on the basis that no further general increases would apply in 1987 and this position will now be realised when the current agreement expires.  The programme puts a limit of 2.5 per cent on pay increases throughout the economy for the next three years.  Indeed, unless the Opposition are advocating a total suspension of conciliation, arbitration and the Labour Court for public servants, it is hard to see what they are about.</P>
    <P>The programme contains pay agreements aimed at achieving long term stability in an environment of low inflation. By providing a framework for pay agreements over the next three years the possibility of industrial conflict is lessened. Employers will be able to predict cost increases due to pay in the medium term and plan accordingly.  It is also important for all concerned in the public service that pay increases are clearly set out.  A three year pay agreement removes one element of uncertainty in stabilising the national debt.</P>
    <P>The Government as employer have given a clear lead in the area of pay.  An agreement now exists in respect of the private sector.  The Government have consistently made the case that pay moderation is vital if we, a small trading nation, are to remain competitive in world markets.  Pay moderation is also central to our efforts to compete for employment-creating investment.</P>
    <P>No collective agreement, however well-intentioned, can provide a total guarantee of industrial peace.  However, the maturity and awareness of economic reality which have been so evident during <Col N="1205" /> discussions on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> gives me cause for optimism that the incidence of industrial disputes can be minimised.  This same clear-sighted, pragmatic approach should contribute much to reducing tension in difficult situations.  It should also make the resolution of disputes much easier, when they do occur.</P>
    <P>The Government do not underestimate the seriousness of the problems which face us.  Confronting these problems will require hard work and tough decisions on all sides.  In recent years the average number of strikes and days lost from industrial action have declined.  The commitment to co-operation on all sides has been underlined and strengthened in the process of drawing up the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> With increased co-operation, I am confident that the number of strikes and days lost will continue to decline.  This can only improve the environment for job creation.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the maturity of the leaders of the trade unions, the employers and the farmers that a broad-ranging agreement has been hammered out through these discussions.  The social partners realised that a narrow defence of sectional interests could provide no basis for national recovery and that what was demanded was that everyone work together to achieve economic growth.</P>
    <P>There are those on the opposite side of the House who said it could not be done, whether because of their fatalism or their contempt for working on the basis of consensus.  They believed that the social partners lacked the sense of responsibility necessary to translate the principles agreed in the NESC report into a workable agreement.</P>
    <P>It is a major achievement for all concerned to have concluded the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in a few months in a very difficult economic environment. The seriousness of the economic problems facing the country meant that there was little room for manoeuvre.  Nonetheless a programme has been concluded. It is simply outrageous to imply that the Government have succeeded over the course of six months in manipulating the <Col N="1206" /> Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Farmers Association, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society.  Those who make this kind of charge should cop on to themselves.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope, and the hope of the Government, that this programme will be formally ratified by the national bodies representing the various social partners.  I believe that the programme will in fact be ratified, because the Irish people, be they farmers, trade unionists, employers, self-employed or unemployed, realise that it is only by working together that we can make progress in overcoming the problems we face.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that once the programme is ratified the real work will begin.  The programme itself provides a framework and lists a range of activities and further work to be undertaken with a view to achieving economic growth. The programme also sets down the basic principles that should govern our efforts. Progress is envisaged in four broad areas: creation of a fiscal exchange rate and monetary climate conducive to economic growth; movement towards greater equity and fairness in the tax system; diminishing or removing social inequities in our society and the intensification of practical measures to generate increased job opportunities on a sectoral basis.</P>
    <P>The negotiation of the national programme has shown that with the right will, progress can be made in difficult areas.  I hope that the social partners will approach the proposed discussions on industrial relations reform in the same constructive manner as they showed in the talks on achieving a national consensus. Action in this area is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been much discussion of industrial relations reform with little progress being made.  I am heartened by the commitment of the social partners, as expressed in the programme, to the conclusion of discussions with me as soon as possible.  I hope that <Col N="1207" /> we can now move forward and take action in an area where useful changes and reform can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> gives special prominence to the European Community dimension.  This reflects the wholehearted public endorsement which our membership of the Community was given a few months ago in the referendum on the ratification of the Single European Act.  The programme specially welcomes the proposals of the Commission known as the Delors Plan.  The Delors Plan contains proposals for a range of measures which are designed to implement the provisions of the Single European Act relating to economic and social cohesion within the Community.  These are of major importance for this country.  The intention is that the narrowing of the gap between the standards of different Community regions will be achieved in particular through the structural funds.</P>
    <P>The plan proposes a concentration of the structural funds &mdash; the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Fund &mdash; on those regions whose gross domestic product is less than 75 per cent of the Community average.  Ireland as a whole falls within this definition and will, therefore, be one of the regions entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>I feel that the impending re-organisation of our training and manpower services under FÁS &mdash; the new body which will take over and integrate the functions of AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service &mdash; will undoubtedly help us to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Delors Plan.  In particular, the proposal to increase the rate of ESF assistance will enable us to expand and develop our programmes without further demands on scarce national resources.</P>
    <P>In the reformed Social Fund, special priority will be given also to helping the long term unemployed and young persons looking for their first job.  These are categories which accord very closely with Irish national priorities.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to <Col N="1208" /> move towards a programme basis for application for assistance from the funds. As the Taoiseach indicated on Tuesday, this new approach will represent a learning experience.  We will have to work out with the Commission how best to apply it in our circumstances.  Although a lot of hard negotiating lies ahead, I am confident that the Government's efforts in the reform of the structural funds will yield results which will be to this country's benefit in future years.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines a significant legislative programme in my own area of responsibility as Minister for Labour and details some of the activities which I will be pursuing in the coming months.  It provides a framework for pursuing consultations with the social partners on the realistic medium term strategy which underlines both the programme itself and the 1988 Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The whole notion of an integrated or programme-based approach to problems is a novel development in our public administration practice.  Too often the design and implementation of public policies has been restricted by the jealously guarded boundaries of particular administrative bodies.  This is understandable. Working within the limits of what exists can often be the quickest way to respond; interdepartmental committees do not always guarantee a fast track for decisionmaking and agencies can very often be forced to act on their own by virtue of the system of Vote accounting.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, many of the problems with which Government now deal are so complex that we must not merely unite the public agencies but also co-ordinate their activities with those of relevant private bodies.  This is what building a consensus is all about&mdash;and it is a paramount principle in many areas of my Department's work.  The area of safety and health at work is a case in point.  It is high time we set about launching a unified effort embracing the whole complex of activities and bodies which impinge on the safety, health and welfare of people at work.  I am not just speaking of my Department, the legislation and the <Col N="1209" /> inspection of work places.  I am including the activity of industrial bodies, trade unions, insurance companies and all those with an interest in general health protection or the protection of the environment. A test of the new safety and health authority to be established under the forthcoming safety, health and welfare at work legislation will be the extent to which it can create alliances with groups which have common interests.</P>
    <P>The success of the measures taken initially in the 1987 budget and further developed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Book of Estimates, especially those directed to tackling unemployment, will ultimately depend on the understanding and support of the community as a whole, on the responsiveness of the administrative machinery, and especially on the efforts of employers and trade unions at local level.</P>
    <P>The only complete and satisfactory solution to unemployment is the creation of jobs.  It is clear that new jobs will not materialise unless all the resources of the community are mobilised in a positive and co-ordinated way harnessing the talents, skills, creativity and energy in our community.  We know the full scale of the problem.  The programme does not begin with starry-eyed aspirations.  It opens with a clinical analysis of the extent of the difficulties which have to be confronted. These difficulties are such that they must be tackled now, in the short term, with concerted efforts by all interests.  The programme sees these efforts to achieve our full economic and social potential being directed to the better utilisation of our human and natural resources.</P>
    <P>Our labour market policies will be directed to achieving higher rates of job creation as distinct from simply preserving existing employment.  The programme has identified in some detail where the opportunities for job creation are to be found.  We will be monitoring sector by sector performance under the job targets which have been outlined in the programme.  In the interests of achieving greater social equity every effort will be made to enhance the job <Col N="1210" /> prospects of the unemployed and socially disadvantaged so as to prevent their total exclusion from participating in economic activity.</P>
    <P>The problem of widespread unemployment continues to afflict our society. Although registered unemployment has continued to rise over the past year, there are now some positive indications that the rate of increase is at least beginning to stabilise.  One encouraging sign in the unemployment statistics over the past year has been the fact that the level of youth unemployment has started to fall.</P>
    <P>We now have better information than ever before on the situation of young people in the labour market, and on the characteristics of young people who are likely to encounter protracted unemployment. In particular, we know that young people with the lowest levels of education are most likely to fare badly on the labour market.  So far, we have already made headway through the social guarantee programme by setting up systems and procedures to identify and track each and every young person who has left the school system and is eligible for participation in a manpower programme; by making efforts to retain potential early school leavers within the education system through programme interventions like vocational preparation and training programme; and by developing programmes whose assessment procedures, curricula and programme methodology have been shaped to reflect the particular needs of the disadvantaged young persons.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to underline my commitment to the social guarantee process.  It represents the most important step which we have taken so far to reduce inequalities in the youth labour market. The significant improvements already made in identifying vulnerable categories and providing specially tailored services point the way forward for FÁS.  The social guarantee is a model of how the resources of the education training and Manpower agencies can be harnessed to address the needs of the least qualified young people and to improve their ability to compete for the jobs that are available.</P>
    <P>I am working jointly with the Minister <Col N="1211" /> for Education to identify the elements of an action programme to break the cycle of low educational attainment leading to a high risk of unemployment.  The vocational preparation and training programmes are examples of a more responsive education system.  We are seeking to target these courses more directly to those who would otherwise leave the education system with few or no qualifications. The importance which the Government and the social partners attach to this aspect of the achievement of social equity through fostering the participation of the disadvantaged is reflected in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We need to broaden the range of occupations covered in the VPT courses and to avoid a concentration of boys and girls on courses which reinforce traditional sex roles.  The full range of facilities available through FÁS, ACOT, CERT and VPT to those who do not complete second level education will need to be looked at in a comprehensive way to see how to make the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to see the enthusiasm of those engaged in tracking eligible school leavers dampened by an excessive burden of recording or reporting information. My preference is for a system which combines the efficiency and enthusiasm of the present managers of the guarantee with a minimum of bureaucracy.  While the introduction of Jobsearch put pressure on the resources available for the social guarantee for part of 1987, I am satisfied that the guarantee will not be downgraded in status.  Neither would I want to see flexibility sacrificed in favour of an unduly rigid procedure.</P>
    <P>Over 39,000 persons were engaged on various employment and training programmes at the end of last month.  The provision of funding for these schemes is a heavy burden on the Exchequer, even with assistance available from the European Social Fund.  My priority has been to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from the opportunities which we are able to make available.  Despite the restraint on public expenditure, the <Col N="1212" /> volume of activity and the level of participants on the employment and training programmes featured in the 1988 Estimates will be maintained at their 1987 levels.</P>
    <P>In the case of the social employment scheme, the additional resources provided in the 1987 budget and the part it has to play in the nationwide Jobsearch programme show that it is regarded as an effective means of assisting unemployed workers to regain a foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to detail to the House some of the tangible benefits which SES projects have brought not only to the participants involved but to local communities throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>In the environmental area, the social employment scheme has been used by local authorities and local development bodies to promote the position of tourism in the Irish economy and to explore its potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the local environmental projects sponsored by the Kinsale Chamber of Tourism and the Sneem Development Association.  Kinsale Chamber of Tourism put 19 persons to work on a project which was instrumental in the town's success in the 1986 Tidy Towns competition.  The Sneem Development Co-Op also attribute their success in the 1987 Tidy Towns Competition to the social employment scheme.  Their scheme was approved for 16 workers and the work involved the care of the village greens, church and sports grounds and landscaping and tree planting around the town.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council also availed of SES to develop the Irish Heritage Park in Ferrycarrig, County Wexford.  The council employed 20 workers to carry out landscaping and construction work.  The park portrays life and events in Ireland through the ages.</P>
    <P>Since the opening of the park in June, 1987, over 40,000 people have visited the park.  Bord Fáilte have contributed £80,000 towards the reception-visitor centre at the park and hope in the long <Col N="1213" /> term to locate a tourist office there permanently.</P>
    <P>The achievement of social equity and the protection of the disadvantaged are cornerstones of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The mobilisation of local community groups to take responsibility at local level for employment and training projects is part and parcel of the great, unified effort called for in the NESC report and the programme.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector has effectively used community-based employment schemes to assist in providing a wide range of back-up services to disadvantaged groups at local level.  This has proved very useful at a time when the limited resources of more formalised social services are stretched so thinly.</P>
    <P>The Cuan Mhuire Rehabilitation Centre in Limerick, for instance, has sponsored an SES project employing 20 people to perform the daily tasks which contribute to the running of a large residential facility for the rehabilitation of people suffering from alcohol related problems.  Efforts are made to find employment for those currently undergoing rehabilitation treatment at the centre.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, an SES project is carrying out amenity improvements in Coolock to the gardens and grounds of a residential property used as homes for the handicapped. Ten participants are renovating these houses.  The social employment scheme is also making an immense contribution in a wide range of heritage projects. These include renovation work for the National Museum in Daingean.  The SES has been used to get skilled craftsmen to undertake restoration work there. In Kilbeggan, another project has helped to realise the full community/amenity potential of Locke's Distillery.  The distillery building has been repaired, partly reconstructed and modified and is now an industrial and archaeological museum. Craft shops set up with SES assistance have provided an opportunity for local craftsmen skilled in glass cutting, pottery, embroidery, etching, weaving, and ceramic arts to use facilities at cheap rents. The project employs 14 participants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I have only cited a few examples but they show how employment schemes are a means of contributing both to better employment prospects and to the welfare of the community.</P>
    <P>The gravity of the unemployment situation is heightened by the realisation that the achievement of the ambitious targets in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will not be sufficient to absorb the great majority of those who would like to have a conventional job.  In order to ensure the economic and social health of our society in the years to come we need not just the highest possible rate of job creating growth but also the development of new forms of employment and a strengthening of the social fabric by providing as many citizens as possible with an active role in society both as a means of income and self-identity.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Government to see that burdens and gains are equitably shared with particular reference to those at the end of the jobs queue and in greatest need.  Special measures are obviously necessary to provide for the needs of the unemployed and those whose jobs are most at risk.</P>
    <P>Developing preventive strategies will require nothing less than a recognition that all the instruments and resources of the State should contribute to ensuring that vulnerable groups are not excluded from economic and social opportunities. The significance of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is that it recognises the links between economic performance, job creation, social equity and cohesion.  Just as important, the programme is built on the co-operation between employers, Government and trade unions without which social solidarity cannot be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not take offence if I say that I found that contribution just a little tame and just a little disappointing.  The gravity of the situation we face might have led us to expect something more than a tourist guide of the social employment schemes of the country.  Some of them are admirable, and some of them I had some <Col N="1215" /> pleasure in approving and vetting when I was in the Department of Labour.  But I think we might have reasonably expected a little more.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate a number of speakers on the Fine Gael benches have been expressing concern about the way in which the balance has been struck between the relative generosity with which those in secure employment have been treated and the less generous way in which those depending on services have been treated.  That was put in stark terms by Deputy Gemma Hussey, the party spokesperson on education, when she contributed here yesterday and contrasted bulging classrooms, fewer teachers and higher remuneration for those left at work.</P>
      <P>That contrast is particularly starkly outlined in the Estimate for the Department of Labour and in particular, as emerged at Question Time, it is evidenced in the contrasting fortunes of the trainees under various programmes and those whose role it is to administer the training empire.  In the course of summer it emerged that trainees under various programmes were to experience slashing cutbacks on their already meagre allowances. I say it emerged, and we learned something more about this at Question Time as well, when the Minister told of his forays to Kerry and out to the Dingle peninsula.  But I have to say that there was no excessive enthusiasm on the part of a usually very diligent publicity machine in the Department of Labour to see to it that these changes received much public attention.  They are substantial changes &mdash; reductions of the order of 30 per cent on allowances that are already meagre in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard it as rather curious that a Government, who apparently take the view that the expectation of an annual pay increase for those in the public service is so sacrosanct that it cannot even be addressed, should regard it as acceptable to launch such a swingeing attack on the disadvantaged and voiceless sector. The trainees in the community workshops, who are to take reductions of the <Col N="1216" /> order of £10 a week and more, do not have an organised trade union movement to speak for them.  They do not have union bosses anxious to share a camera with a grinning Taoiseach.  They do not have the clout, so they are the ones who lose out.</P>
    <P>I said that I find that somewhat surprising but perhaps I should not be surprised because of course there have been other decisions of a similar nature.  One of the earlier decisions taken by the Government was the decision to reduce the wages of young people on Teamwork projects by some 15 per cent, and at the same time to reduce the wages of those who are participating in social employment schemes by a similar amount. Again, at Question Time, the Minister indicated that no upward review in these allowances was to be expected.  I find it inconceivable that it is regarded as socially just to say to those who are in this very marginal area of society, who are the lowest paid of the low paid, that their lot is to be reductions in allowances, that they can have no expectation of increases.  But those who are in secure and permanent employment are to know their fate; their fate is one of a guaranteed increase in each of the years of the plan.</P>
    <P>Over the four years or thereabouts that they occupied these benches the party opposite, whenever proposals were put forward curbing public expenditure, denounced those proposals.  However, the Government have rather belatedly come to the view that there is no better way, and they have been converted to the message that we have been articulating so consistently and so firmly.  But their conversion has been altogether less than complete, because in making a partial conversion they have apparently determined that those who are strong and organised will not be expected to pay, but that those who are voiceless, those who cannot mount resistance, will be left to shoulder the burden.  They have correctly taken the view that very substantial cuts in public expenditure are required. But in taking that view they have, almost unbelievably, decided that they will pursue that policy without addressing the <Col N="1217" /> question of public service pay which accounts for 43 per cent of net total expenditure.  But while prepared to deal with the unions, they are apparently perfectly content to leave aside the interests of those who are disadvantaged &mdash; the long term unemployed, striving to obtain a foothold in the world of work; the youngsters in the community work shops, many with literacy and numeracy difficulties. Not for them any prospect of guaranteed pay increases.  For them the reality is cutbacks now.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the disimprovements in conditions that will now apply to so many of the participants in those programmes, those young people who will find themselves on one of them have to count themselves fortunate in comparison with the plight of some of their contemporaries, because it has now emerged that one of the decisions taken by the Government is to exclude those who are not on the live register from participation in training programmes. Effectively what that means is that those who are under 18 years of age will not be able to participate.  That decision is quite extraordinary.  It is quite mind boggling because every survey that has been taken establishes beyond doubt the closest possible correlation between high levels of unemployment and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I accept &mdash; and this was the defence put forward by the Minister for Labour at Question Time &mdash; that in the past there has been a concern as to the existence of some of these programmes and a fear that they could, if not properly monitored, serve to entice people out of the education system, which is clearly the exact opposite of what any of us would want to do.  Again, in Government, I had certain responsibilities in that area and I introduced various changes and safeguards designed to reduce or eliminate that risk.  Quite clearly it is in no one's interest that young people should leave school and search for training programmes. It would be very much better indeed if they decided to remain and to take the various public examinations and sit for the various certificates.  But while <Col N="1218" /> that might be the ideal, the reality is that large numbers of children will leave at the minimum school leaving age and a number will leave even before that as was so honestly admitted by the Minister for Labour earlier this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Those young people need support if they are to break through.  Excluding them from participation in training programmes simply means that having been let down by the education system they will now see the training world turn its back on them as well.  And for what?  So as to allow an opportunity to open up for massaging the unemployment figures. What is involved here is a sideways shuffle. These youngsters are to be excluded from the training opportunities they so badly need in order to leave space into which can be slotted people from the Jobsearch programme.  The hope and expectation is that that will produce a more direct effect on the live register figures.  That so evident disregard for the young job seekers is to be found as well in the Government's decision to abolish the work experience programme.  Since that programme was initiated it has been remarkably successful.  It has directly seen tens of thousands of school leavers finding employment and has over the years of its operation smoothed the transition from school to work.</P>
    <P>The explanation offered is that this is going to prevent some employers from making windfall gains, to prevent situations where employers needed to take on people anyway but were taking them on and getting paid for it by the State for six months.  When we were in Government we introduced a whole series of measures designed to guard against that possibility of abuse.  We introduced a quota system so that the number of work experience places that might be available to an employer would be related to his or her total workforce.  A number of areas of the economy were excluded where it seemed that the possibility of abuse was particularly live.  We introduced a requirement that people could not take on consecutive participants in the work experience programme.  If the Minister had real concerns in this area, I would <Col N="1219" /> have been happy to see further refinements but that is not what we have. Instead, we have had summary execution.  I find that quite objectionable.</P>
    <P>No one at this stage is disputing the fact that we have rampant emigration or that we are going to have for the period of the plan continuing high levels of unemployment.  The Minister for Labour has accepted that it will get worse before it gets better.  In that situation there will be far more applicants coming forward for every vacancy and every employer will be in a position to pick and choose for even the most menial task &mdash; in so far as it is proper to talk of any job as being menial but for what in the past might have been thought of as a menial employment opportunity.  There will be quite a field from which to select.  It will inevitably be the case that the employer will select those with the most going for them, those who can point to a track record, to experience. The result will be that school leavers will be shaken out and that it will be ever harder for them to find their way into the world of work.</P>
    <P>Again, one must ask is it possible that is not entirely contrary to what the Government are about?  The effect of that would be that more of the vacancies &mdash; whatever number they are &mdash; would be filled by people coming directly off the live register.  Again, the effect would be that much more direct, that much more dramatic, on the figures.  The effect would also be that we would be building up a core of young people denied the opportunity to participate in the world of work, these young people in all likelihood finding themselves placed at an impossible disadvantage from which it would take them a great length of time to recover.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the allowance paid to participants in the Teamwork and social employment scheme programmes. I must express my disappointment with the schemes themselves.  They have been cut back and there is not an opportunity for expansion.  In the case of the social employment scheme, what is involved is a very small reduction in the Estimate <Col N="1220" /> but in the case of Teamwork it is contemplated that the scheme will be reduced by no less than 15 per cent.  Both of these schemes have proved very successful. Both have offered community groups around the country an opportunity to play a part in the battle against unemployment and, at the same time, have offered them an opportunity to improve their environment, to provide themselves and their neighbours with services which otherwise would not be possible. Given the high levels of unemployment and the very real need that exists right across the country, one would have hoped to have seen an expansion of those schemes.</P>
    <P>What we are about, clearly, is getting value for money.  One thing that we surely should be about is trying to achieve the loudest possible bang for every button.  What is involved in these schemes is that the State putting its money on the table produces a volume of activity way out of proportion to the pounds it spends because of the fact that community groups become involved in fund raising or whatever to provide matching and greater funding.  The real value of those schemes was most eloquently testified to in this House by Deputy Mattie Brennan who spoke during the Labour Estimates on 27 May last.  Let me quote a paragraph:</P>
    <P>I welcomed the social scheme when introduced by the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn.  I remember going to their launching at Summerhill College in Sligo.  We in Sligo and the unions agreed that people should be on the social employment schemes and had no difficulty in finding people to work on those schemes.  When one represents a rural area where people and, in particular small farmers are drawning unemployment assistance, one finds these people crying out for a job. The social employment schemes brought these people back to work, not five days a week but three days or three mornings a week.  Their children saw them going out to work and this was the only employment available to them <Col N="1221" /> in a rural area.  That is why I support these schemes. </P>
    <P>He then went on to make a very powerful plea for the expansion of those schemes. If we are anxious to get value for money, it seems that an expansion of the social employment schemes and Teamwork would represent just that.</P>
    <P>Of course, while I have been arguing for an expansion of the scheme it is, unfortunately, the case that in parts of the country the social employment scheme does not operate.  It does not operate, at least, in the public sector with its main potential sponsor, the local authorities. That is so in Dublin where the trade unions have seen fit to impose a veto on the opportunity for long term unemployed to break into the world of work. I have raised this question a number of times in the House, at Question Time and on the Estimates debate and the Minister has been concerned about it.  I know he was concerned about it when in Oppostion and has told the House of his efforts to regularise the situation.  It really is just unacceptable at this stage that in the capital city, an area where there is a huge number of eligible people, those who have been out of work for a year or more, they are denied the opportunity that is available to their contemporaries and to those in a similar situation right around the rest of the country because trade unions have said no.  The same trade unions are operating the scheme with just about every other local authority and doing it quite successfully.  It is just intolerable that people should seek to exercise a veto on the opportunities of their fellow citizens for employment.</P>
    <P>The question of care and concern for the disadvantaged, particularly disadvantaged young people, also requires me to express some real disappointment about the allocation in the Estimate to deal with the emigrant welfare agency. Again, it seems the response of this Government which pegs the grant at the same level as last year is in contrast with the approach taken by their predecessors. I believe firmly that our Government were uniquely responsive to the concerns <Col N="1222" /> of our emigrants.  That was shown by the degree of attention paid by Deputy Peter Barry when Minister for Foreign Affairs, by Deputy Quinn when Minister for Labour and in my own role in the Department of Labour and Foreign Affairs.  It was easy to show concern but uniquely, our Government put their money where their mouth was.  For example, last year's Estimate showed an increase of 61 per cent in the allocation for emigrant welfare services.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Labour met with the Federation of Irish Societies and I understand they met also with other members of the Government.  I met them, as did my party leader, Deputy Alan Dukes, and Deputy Peter Barry.  It will be a real disappointment to them that even in this time of stringency it was not possible to allow even a small increase.  I have to say that it may well be that the Minister fought off much worse and that he did not have any enthusiasm from the Department of Finance for even maintaining last year's level.  If that is so, I am glad he at least achieved what he did but even a small increase was clearly called for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The relationship between this country and Britain is a uniquely complex one.  There are so many areas where we share common values &mdash; a common commitment to democracy, a common working language and all the ties of history.  Because that relationship is so complex and so intimate, the opportunities for squalls and misunderstandings are uniquely prevalent. The Irish community in Britain form a very important part of the ties between the two countries.  Many British people see Ireland and form their opinions of Ireland through the Irish community in Britain.  The existence of an organisation like the Federation of Irish Societies has been tremendously important to successive Governments in showing the positive face of Ireland.  One has only to <Col N="1223" /> think, for example, of the hostility which was directed against the Irish community in Britain in the past following atrocities perpetrated by the IRA in Birmingham, at Harrods and so on.  Again and again, British people were able to come to terms with the fact that those atrocities had been perpetrated by a tiny minority, who had no substantial support, by looking to their neighbours who were making a contribution to Britain and who were serving their adopted country and their home country well.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the role which has been played by the Federation of Irish Societies, and more particularly the role of the emigrant welfare services, most notably those in London where the greatest pressure has been.  I heard the Minister say across the floor of the House that something may be happening in regard to their administration costs.  I do not know the details&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if that is the case I would be very glad to hear about it.  In the course of some of the contributions, particularly that of Deputy Noonan, attention was drawn to the improbability of identifying areas such as tourism, the marine, the food sector and so on as areas for growth while, at the same time, reducing expenditure on these areas.  There seems to be similar evidence in the Department of Labour's Estimates of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.  Let me give one or two examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, let us look at the allocation to CERT, the body responsible for educational training in the hotel and catering area.  Their allocation in this year's Estimates shows a reduction of 12 per cent.  Yet, the authors of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contemplate CERT expanding their training activities so as to cater for an additional 300 trainees.  One has to ask whether the authors of these two documents even speak to each other or is there an explanation?  Is what is contemplated <Col N="1224" /> a reduction in quality of the training programmes so that more people can be sandwiched in so that it will be possible to achieve the expenditure figure while, at the same time, cramming in the required number of trainees to meet the planning commitment?  We will have to look to the Minister for an explanation of that.</P>
    <P>During Question Time today I raised the question of the allocation to the Irish Management Institute which has been reduced by 41 per cent.  Again, look at what the authors of the plan had to say about the importance of management training.  In that document they make eloquent statements of intent about the importance which will be placed on training. There will be training grants expenditure which will give greater emphasis to equipping Irish companies with marketing, management, technological and commercial language skills but the body which does that find their allocation cut. The question is, how will they respond? My fear is that they will respond by increasing their charges so as to put their courses out of reach of many small and medium sized companies and return to a position, which was the case some years ago, where the IMI will cater for the high flyers and the elite and will train those who scarcely need training.  That would be a most unfortunate development.</P>
    <P>It would seem that in a whole series of ways the Estimates for the Department of Labour are a real disappointment and that disappointment is all the greater because of the fact there were other options available.  At this stage it is all but universally accepted that in recent years, perhaps because of the availability of European Social Fund moneys, a bloated training empire has developed. That is a matter about which successive Governments have been concerned and it led to the National Employment Training Authority Bill being introduced by the previous Administration and the Labour Services Act which substantially reenacts that Bill from this Government.  It seems extraordinary that the administration there remains all but unchanged.  They will continue to enjoy <Col N="1225" /> liberal access to external trainers who will continue to enjoy very generous remuneration and instead the burden is to be picked up by the most vulnerable and the most at risk.</P>
    <P>There are two other areas I wish to refer to and they are the Estimates for development co-operation and the youth service.  With regard to the Estimate for development co-operation, I have to say that I am deeply and bitterly disappointed. There are other areas of public expenditure where our approach has been to say it was right to try to make this saving but that we wished it could have gone to another subhead.  However, in the case of development co-operation what is contemplated, quite simply, is immoral.  This country is listed among the 30 most wealthy countries in the world &mdash; we rank either 26th or 27th on the list. We have a responsibility to the poorest nations to offer assistance.  Instead, there are massive cutbacks.</P>
    <P>For the first time since the programme was launched in the early seventies, the percentage of GNP which we allocate for development co-operation will tumble from 0.25 per cent to 0.18 per cent.  That is a massive reduction and one which is altogether unjustified.  When we consider that we have mandatory responsibilities from our membership of the United Nations and the European Community, then the apparent cuts in the Estimates are, in fact, much greater because the cuts will, of course, fall only on the discretionary element of our programme. That means that that programme will be altogether devastated.  Therefore our response to the needs of some of the poorest countries, such as Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, the Sudan, our priority countries among the very poorest countries in the world &mdash; in the bottom league, defined by the United Nations as least developed countries &mdash; will be altogether inadequate.</P>
    <P>Indeed it seems that it was the wish of the Department of Finance to cut our bilateral aid altogether, that they did not achieve that but effectively what was provided for was a stay of execution.  Therefore, instead of chopping the aid off in <Col N="1226" /> one go, it will be allowed die off over the next couple of years.  That is a shameful betrayal of those in need.</P>
    <P>The other area about which I am concerned is the provision for youth services. The Estimates contain no such provision whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The funding which was available in the past from the Exchequer towards voluntary youth work is gone.  As Minister of State responsible in that area I well recall being harassed on a weekly basis by the then Opposition spokesman, Deputy Frank Fahey, seeking higher expenditure in this area.  Following publication of the Government's youth policy in the last few days of International Youth Year I recall Deputy Frank Fahey taking space on the leader page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> to complain that it was a policy that had failed young people because of the inadequacy of the funds made available.  The Estimates, as published, provide nothing.</P>
    <P>There is an expectation that there will be some make-up when it comes to the allocation of funds from the national lottery. That seems to me to be quite inadequate. It is inadequate, first of all, because if we are to believe the interview given to <i>The Irish Press</i> by the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, the most that youth organisations can look forward to from the national lottery is an allocation that will come close to last year's level.  That is very disappointing in an area which has been identified &mdash; I thought right across the House &mdash; as one for priority expenditure.  I might reiterate that it is an area in which the injection of a relatively small amount of money by the Government provides a level of activity way out of proportion to what it would generate if spent in other areas. Every pound the State provides towards the employment of youth workers is matched by youth clubs, scout organisations and the like by way of holding raffles, jumble sales and so on.  There is a second reason it is disappointing, that is, that even if the amount they received from the national lottery was as much as last year, that was not what the national lottery was intended for.  That represents simple substitution.  The national lottery <Col N="1227" /> was intended to provide extras in areas identified as important &mdash; youth, sport, culture and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking in this debate.  I listened with interest to what Deputy George Birmingham had to say, much of which impinged on the areas for which I and the Minister for Labour are responsible. He was both constructive and productive in the many points of view he advanced.</P>
      <P>As the House and the country generally will be aware, in the short period this Government have been in office, there has been ample evidence of our commitment to face up to the financial and economic realities.  Difficult decisions have had to be taken and measures implemented to redress the situation as we found it.</P>
      <P>In the past previous Governments did not show the same resolve in tackling our economic difficulties.  During the period from 1976 to 1986 the current budget deficit, as a percentage of GNP, grew from 4.4 per cent to an all-time high of 8.5 per cent in 1986 while the national debt increased almost seven-fold in the same period and now stands at £25 billion. That is a very high figure and there is no need for anybody here to lecture on that.  We all know it is a very high figure and particularly dangerous to live with. To pay the interest on it alone costs the nation over £2,000 million every year. At present almost the entire yield from PAYE is used in servicing this debt.  It is a situation we simply could not allow to continue.  If allowed continue it would present a real threat to our independence as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be obvious to everybody that an open economy like ours cannot continue to borrow.  If we did, within a very short time, we would reach the point at which we could not borrow any more and then would be unable to repay our current debts.  As it is, the cost of servicing the national debt constitutes a serious constraint on progress being made in a <Col N="1228" /> number of areas.  We must reduce the amount we borrow.  Indeed it must be said that a reduction in borrowing is an essential priority.  The only way that can be done is by living within our means, by providing a level of public services we can afford.</P>
    <P>The 1987 budget showed the country in general that this Government had the will and competence to manage the affairs of the nation effectively.  That budget was designed with the specific objectives of progressively reducing the cost of servicing the national debt and the level of borrowing and creating a suitable environment for investment, geared to productive economic activities and enhanced employment opportunities in wealth-generating enterprises.</P>
    <P>Within a short period of seven months we have seen quite dramatic and encouraging results on account of the budgetary strategy that has been adopted and which is to be continued.  A new sense of direction has been given to our economy.  For the first time since 1980 the current budget deficit will be below 7 per cent. Indeed we are extremely hopeful that our target of 6.9 per cent will be attained.  By adhering to a strict budgetary discipline and maintaining tight control over Government expenditure, despite our many critics, we have managed to achieve increased economic growth.  Revised forecasts of economic growth indicate that the estimate of 1 per cent made at the time of the 1987 budget will be exceeded.  At the same time prime interest rates have fallen by 4 per cent and industrial production and exports shown marked improvements.</P>
    <P>In September this year we saw the biggest ever monthly surplus of exports over imports, a surplus in excess of £220 million, which was more than double the amount for September 1986.  Indeed it is possible that we will have a record £1.5 billion export surplus for 1987.</P>
    <P>In 1986 the total Exchequer borrowing requirement was at a high 13.7 per cent of GNP.  This year, on account of Government initiatives, the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been lowered to 10.7 per cent of GNP.  Therefore it will <Col N="1229" /> be seen that we have made a very positive start on the road to national recovery.</P>
    <P>It is now generally recognised that the fiscal and economic strategies of this Government are beginning to show signs of success.  It is realised that the Government have created the climate in which confidence has been restored, with incentives for investment, opportunities existing for businesses and entrepreneurs to use their skills and expertise to capture more markets at home and abroad. Therefore, the foundations for national recovery have been laid.</P>
    <P>Difficult decisions must be taken to ensure our continued economic viability. But it is evident that our people are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices in the short term, to accept a level of services we can afford to provide rather than burden future generations with an enormous debt so that we could live beyond our means at present.  In recent days we have seen the successful culmination of important talks with employers, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the farming interests.  It is clear that there is a national consensus in support of a medium term plan for economic recovery.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be afforded ample opportunity for discussing the education provision when the Estimates are put before the House following the budget I do not intend to go into specific detail now.  I will be afforded an opportunity at Question Time in less than two weeks time of in-depth questioning.  Some of the publicity in recent weeks will not have given the public a balanced view of the prospects facing the educational services in 1988 and, indeed, may well have caused unnecessary concern.</P>
    <P>In line with the policy adopted by the Government and which has been adhered to in preparing the budget for 1987 and the Estimates for 1988, certain cost-reducing measures have been decided on in the education area, as indeed in all others.  In different circumstances these measures would not have been introduced but financial reality stares us in the face.  The measures adopted were <Col N="1230" /> carefully selected after much consideration in order to achieve the necessary reductions in costs in the fairest and least disruptive way.  It would be easy to exaggerate the effect of those measures. Some will choose, for different reasons to represent them as a major assault on the fabric of our education system.  That is far from being the case.</P>
    <P>It is true that the provision for the education services in 1988 in the Abridged Estimates Volume shows a reduction of £86 million, representing £43 million on current and £43 million on capital expenditure.  These figures must be viewed in their correct perspective.  I want to place those figures on record because they do have a bearing on the many misconceptions which have arisen in regard to the Education Vote.  In 1988 we will be spending £1,129 million on current costs.  On the face of it this represents a reduction of 2.8 per cent on the 1987 provision.  However, one must be very careful of conclusions based on such simple comparisons.  For a purely technical reason we need approximately £37 million less to pay the same salaries in 1988 than we needed in 1987.  This occurs because of the date of a week in which salary payments fell due.  The matter has been explained to the INTO and they have accepted the explanation.  When account is taken of this one factor, the £1,129 million represents a decrease of less than 1 per cent on the 1987 provision, not 2.8 per cent, and a small increase of 0.4 per cent over the outturn is now being projected for 1987.</P>
    <P>This £1,129 million is a substantial outlay by any standards.  By way of comparison it should be noted that the net Exchequer expenditure on education for non-capital services is approximately 8 per cent higher than that provided in 1986. Also, 16.5 per cent of the net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services was spent on education services in 1986, while in 1988 this Government have allocated 18 per cent of such expenditure to education services.  This means that this year, as last year, £18 out of every £100 which the Exchequer will spend will be spent on education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> Similarly, no less than 6 per cent of GNP will go on education.  This is, in fact, a higher percentage of GNP than in any year up to and including 1986.  Before 1979 we were spending less than 5 per cent of GNP on education.  With the many other demands on the public purse, all of which are being articulated by Ministers and spokespersons, we simply cannot afford to divert a larger slice of our resources to education.  It is far better, indeed it is imperative, that we address ourselves to making the best use of the resources which are available.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the allocation for 1988 in the light of these factors one can see clearly that this Government, who have done so much in the past in this area, continue to be committed to the provision of the best possible education service for the people, even in these very difficult times.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years we have had an unprecedented expansion in the education system.  The population of our schools and colleges reached an all-time record in the present academic year and it is estimated that some 975,000 young people are receiving full-time education. However, due to the falling birth rates which we have experienced in recent years, projections indicate that enrolments in primary schools will decrease by over 100,000 by the year 2000.  In the same period total student enrolment in the whole education sector is projected to fall by 150,000.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, in 1988 approximately 18 per cent of the total Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services will be spent in the education sector and 82.8 per cent of this amount &mdash; a total of £935 million &mdash; will be required to meet salaries and pensions.  It is a staggering amount of money but is well spent.  It must be realised by everyone that decisions on education expenditure cannot be made in isolation but must be made in association with parallel decisions on demands from other competing social sectors such as health, housing, social welfare, etc.  It is necessary to <Col N="1232" /> increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the education sector in order to achieve necessary savings in education expenditure.  Because so much of the expenditure is on salaries, it is in this sector that savings must be made.</P>
    <P>A revision has been made in the schedule of average pupil enrolment figures required for the appointment and retention of teachers in national schools.  The revision will in most cases raise from 35 to 38 the number of pupils required for each teaching post in a national school and the schedule will not provide specifically for non-teaching principals.</P>

    <P>Currently the number of eligible pupils using school transport is about 156,000, of whom 86,000 are at post-primary level. Over 39,000 of these benefit under the medical card exemption scheme.  In addition, approximately 13,000 pupils who are ineligible for school transport <Col N="1233" /> avail themselves of special school transport services in travelling to and from school.  The average cost of providing school transport is about £245 for each eligible pupil.</P>
    <P>With a view to achieving economies in the school transport system, I am arranging that four pilot projects be undertaken, one in each of the provinces. These will come on stream next September and when they have been properly evaluated we will extend the pilot projects throughout the country over a period of time.

      <P>It also reflects the Government's desire that my Department should in 1988 take the opportunity to examine in depth the thrust of this programme in the light of forecasts of a significant fall in enrolments between now and the end of the century.  It is already clear that there is a substantial surplus of permanent accommodation in urban areas, particularly in Dublin city and county, and the possibility of using at least some of this, where it can suitably relieve the pressure of space in newer developing schools, must be examined.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, my Department will, despite the present financial difficulties, address itself to the backlog of building projects in the rural schools system.  This backlog I inherited when I assumed office.  During the budget debate earlier this year I referred to some 40 contracts which had been authorised by the previous Minister to proceed at the earliest possible date in 1987, subject to compliance with the usual rules and procedures. Most of the contracts have now been placed &mdash; the ones bequeathed to me &mdash; but unfortunately such is the impact of these commitments that they will eat heavily into the 1988 capital provision and, consequently, it is not envisaged that there will be scope during 1988 for any further substantial number of releases to contract for projects involving permanent accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level education was designed <Col N="1235" /> to consist of a three-year junior cycle, age 12 to 15 years, followed by a senior cycle, age 15 to 17 years.  In the past there were some deviations from this pattern of second level schooling.  A number of schools offered junior cycle programmes of four years duration while a relatively small number provided a three year leaving certificate programme.</P>
    <P>Clearly, education policy at any level must be seen to be catering equally for all participants and one cannot condone or continue to support a situation where pupils in different schools follow the same curricula but some are given the opportunity to spend six or seven years to complete their second level studies while the majority of pupils complete their studies in the prescribed period.  In 1985 schools were informed by the previous Government that all four year junior cycle programmes and three year senior cycle programmes were to be phased out.  I agree with this and in future all recognised post-primary schools will be required to complete the prescribed junior and senior cycle programmes in three years and two years respectively.</P>
    <P>We have now progressed a long way from the days when the courses being provided in secondary schools were fundamentally different from those provided in vocational schools.  Post-primary schools in the free education scheme now have non-selective entry and their programmes cater for pupils with different abilities and aspirations.  The differences between the types of schools have become blurred, and this is a good thing. There are now virtually as many secondary schools as vocational schools offering programmes in mechanical drawing and woodwork while there are more secondary schools than vocational schools providing instruction in home economics, commerce and art.  Almost all vocational schools provide science and French.</P>
    <P>In terms of standards and range of ability of pupils catered for, whatever may have been the case before Fianna Fáil introduced post-primary education <Col N="1236" /> for all, nowadays the average post-primary school &mdash; whether it be secondary, vocational, community or comprehensive &mdash; is catering, thankfully, for a wide range of ability levels.  Consequently, I believe the time has come to put all second level schools on the same footing as regards pupil-teacher ratio and this is now being done with the introduction of a common pupil-teacher ratio of 20 to 1 as from the beginning of the 1988-89 school year.</P>

On the other hand, I do not believe that the solution is to abolish the VECs as we know them, as was proposed by the previous Government, or to create unnatural divisions and unmanageable regions.  I am confident that the amalgamations, details of which I shall be putting forward shortly, will lead to a more efficient organisation which will preserve all that is best in the vocational education system and will enable it to give of its best in service to the public.  I want to put on record the general feeling of Deputies from all parties that the VECs have given a very fine service to the country and which I hope they will continue to give in the restructured arrangements.</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy not change his vocabulary?  As its immediate task it will have the comprehensive revision of the junior cycle programme in order to facilitate the early introduction into the schools of the new unified examination combining the group and intermediate certificate examinations.  The council will also take over responsibility for the recently initiated review of the primary curriculum.  It will also advise me on matters relating to curriculum, assessment and standards to be attained in primary and post-primary schools as well as providing advice on the co-ordination and rationalisation of work on curriculum reform carried out by agencies under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>I believe the professional standing and the professional competence of teachers generally will be enhanced by the formation of a teachers' council, something the teachers have been seeking for the past decade.  I have invited the teachers' unions to meet me to discuss the setting up of such a council and I look forward to meeting their representatives in the near future and to hear what we can mutually agree in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have again made provision in 1988 for adult literacy and community education. In providing this service, the adult education boards of the VECs have particular regard to the needs of disadvantaged areas.  The sum to be made available is £400,000.  This is the same as the amount provided in 1987.  I am happy, in these difficult times, to be able to keep provision for this service.  Incidentally, this is £50,000 more than was provided in <Col N="1239" /> 1986 and £250,000 more than was provided in 1985.</P>

      <P>The capital allocation in the Estimates for the provision of post-primary school buildings, furniture and equipment, has been quite substantial over a long period of time.  During the past 20 years some 150,000 permanent places were provided at post-primary level.  Apart altogether from the present financial constraints, it would be unrealistic, due to declining birth rates and falling enrolments, to sustain funding of school building programmes at the same level as in previous years.  In the 1988 Estimates the allocation for post-primary school building and capital grants is £21 million.  This will meet all contractual commitments and will provide for all unforeseen contingencies.</P>

    <P>As stated earlier, in the present year education will account for 18 per cent of Exchequer spending and at 6 per cent of GNP it represents a great proportion of national resources.  Given these facts and the overall Government budgetary strategy, it would be absurd to suggest that the education sector should not play its part in achieving the financial targets set <Col N="1240" /> by the Government.  Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that all levels of the sector should carry their fair share of the burden.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that the reduced provision for the institutions funded through the higher education authorities will not cause some difficulties.  I am confident, however, that given the goodwill of the management authorities of these institutions, the difficulties will be overcome. Institutions will have to critically examine every area of spending so that the best possible use will be made of available resources.</P>

      <P>A reappraisal will have to be made of their operations over the widest possible spectrum and economies effected while, at the same time, preserving the essential aspects of services and maintaining academic standards. Ways will have to be found by which our higher education system can become still more efficient, more productive and more cost effective if we are to meet the challenge presented to us.</P>
      <P>With regard to additional productivity, I will be having a study carried out which will look at the savings that could be made or the additional student numbers that could be accommodated at no extra cost by reducing the length of courses where qualifications are awarded by the NCEA.  That point was in one of the action plans produced by Deputy Hussey. I have also asked the Higher Education Authority to carry out a similar exercise in their own sector by examining the question of shortening four year degree courses.  I will also be presenting proposals to Government on the establishment of an interdepartmental committee representative of the Departments of Education, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour, Health and Agriculture to examine the provision of third level places, the rationalisation of third level departments and institutions and the funding of these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee will take into account <Col N="1241" /> the two studies I have already referred to and such factors as demographic trends, personnel requirements and the existing number of student places in third level institutions.  There is no doubt in my mind that huge changes have taken place in what were regarded up to now as &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; academic type institutions.  The universitities, NIHEs and other third level institutions have shown that they are opening their windows, their doors, their minds, their hearts and everything to the public.  &ldquo;Campus Ireland&rdquo; at UCD was a good example and the people of Dublin, and elsewhere, flocked to UCD to see what was on offer and to see how the university had changed.  It was a marvellous experience to visit the college during that week.  There is no need for any of us to lecture the HEA, and its agencies, on what they should be doing.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I met the heads of all third level institutions and had a most productive meeting.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  I am very proud of the record of achievement in growth of the VEC colleges, in particular of the RTCs, a growth illustrated by an enrolment of approximately 24,000 in 1986-87 as against 11,000 in 1980-81. Having been closely associated with the regional colleges, I am well aware of the excellent courses provided in them and of their valuable contribution to their regions and, indeed, to the economy.  I am particularly glad, therefore, to be in a position to hold the non-pay provision for these colleges at the 1987 level.  While the cut of 3 per cent is made in the pay area in order to comply with the Government's policy on numbers, I am satisfied that the agreement arrived at between the Departments of Education and Finance will allow for the implementation of the cutbacks with sufficient flexibility so that the colleges can maintain their existing level of services.</P>

It has provided a means of transmitting our traditional values and culture; it has contributed to improving the quality of life and has played an important role in the economic and social developments we have experienced in the past.  Our past successes are due to the dedication, commitment and calibre of the teaching profession and the ways in <Col N="1244" /> which they meet challenges and overcome difficulties.  I have no doubt that educational demands and challenges will continue to be with us.  I am also sure that, within the limited financial resources available to us, with the support of everybody involved in education and especially with the co-operation of the teaching profession, we will not only be able to meet those new demands and challenges but we will also be able to continue to improve still more the quality of the education being provided in our schools, colleges and universities.  I assure the House I will continue to seek ways and means to improve the effectiveness of the education system given the inevitable budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>I am glad I was in the Chamber to listen to the contribution of the Minister for Education.  Giving a week of Dáil time to a debate on the Government's Estimates will be a futile exercise and a waste of time unless we can convince the Government to radically alter the way they intend to prepare their budget.  I did not hear anything in the contribution by the Minister for Education that convinced me that will happen.  I had hoped that in the debate we would consider how we can live, work and survive within the budgetary parameters set down by the Government.  I expected the Government would consider the suggestions made and, where appropriate, would alter their strategy accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the debate the Taoiseach claimed that his Government had created a new climate and a new belief in the process of Government itself.  That is not true and it will not be true unless the Government are prepared to use such <Col N="1245" /> debates to help them shape their spending proposals.  The Government should be prepared to listen to and act on the constructive advice of Opposition Deputies. It is lamentable that in the contribution of the Minister for Education we had the same sterile and cynical use of Dáil time in an effort to pretend that the cutbacks that affect children and their education and deprived families will not have severe consequences because she says so.</P>
    <P>Before I rose I had decided to concentrate on the effects the Government's programme will have on women in our society.  In regard to education, it is worth noting that two-thirds of our primary teachers are women.  The Minister's proposals to raise class sizes and to cease to allow principals to hold non-teaching positions will be a blow to education and will lead to massive unemployment of women.  That the Minister then could compound this by saying that by increasing class sizes, which we had patiently and painfully tried to reduce over the years and that we can do without the administration, planning and direction of principals within our schools, something that was considered one of the great innovations and contributions to education, particularly at primary level, is facile and misleading and is not part of the kind of constructive debate I had hoped we would have this week on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and his Government truly wish to have a new climate for our political debates and a new confidence in the political process &mdash; which formed part of his speech &mdash; then let it be seen that this debate can have some substantial impact on what takes place in the Chamber this week and, as a result within the budget, and on society.  Two days ago the Taoiseach in the same speech asked this House to face up to the reality and requirements of our situation with maturity and responsibility.  Maturity and responsibility are two-way and the Government, if they wish to have support in the House for the budget, should take account of the analyses offered this week in sincerity and constructively from this side of the House.  They should change <Col N="1246" /> the provisions within the Book of Estimates which are repugnant to the vast majority of our citizens and which certainly offend against the political obligation resting on all elected Members, especially on the Government, to provide for the care and wellbeing of the most vulnerable sections of society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education said in her recent contribution that because she says so the fabric and quality of education will not be damaged.  In the same way, there is no point in the cant from the other side of the House in this regard.  The Taoiseach said that to assist the debate he would like to enunciate the principles by which the Government were guided in deciding on the general pattern of reductions, the need to protect the most vulnerable sections of the community when implementing the necessary policies and the need to ensure fairness between sections of the community. Unless the Taoiseach and his Ministers listen carefully to constructive and costed alternatives based on those two principles offered from this side of the House, it is cant and cynicism and only leads to greater disappointment and disillusionment by the electorate with regard to what we are supposed to be doing in here.  We have slipped so far in that estimation that the Government should realise that we cannot afford to slip much further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that my esteemed constituency colleague made. We all want to alleviate the disease of poverty which comes in many forms.  It can be seen in the entrenched attitude of <Col N="1247" /> elite groups, the haves of society, the vested interests who will vote, either within their own organisations or at a general election, to ensure that their interests are preserved to the detriment of those who have no voice, no power and no choice.  They have the wealth, resources and the organisation to do that. There is desperation among those living on the meagre provisions of social welfare who are trapped at the lowest level of expectation and opportunity.  Another way in which it makes itself apparent is in the levels of crime and violence and disregard for the normal and acceptable values of codes of behaviour which guard our social order.  We, as the elected members of a democracy, have a particular responsibility in that regard and it is one we should not take lightly or treat cynically.  Lack of power, drift and desperation are the characteristics of real poverty and, unfortunately they are the only characteristics of many people at that level, especially women and children.</P>
      <P>I will not indulge in adversarial politics. I am trying, within the scope and representation we all have in this House, to appeal to the Government, before it is too late, to take heed of this.  Estimates can be changed and priorities under subheadings can be altered.  Nobody inside or outside the House would accuse the Government of making a U-turn or of being pinned into a corner if, with the maturity and responsibility, to which the Taoiseach alluded, they take seriously the solutions within the rigid system which have been offered to them.  We do not have much room for manoeuvre but let us make sure that the deprived and disadvantaged will not bear the burden. There is still time to do this and if we are compassionate and caring and interested in justice we must do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody recognised that the whole area of health had to be examined.  Plans, budgets and estimates should be about cost effectiveness.  Short term solutions could be very wasteful and expensive in the long term.  For instance, community health centres are cutting back on smear <Col N="1248" /> testing and on screening for breast cancer.  There are long delays in getting the results of such tests where, and I am not being dramatic, it is literally a matter of life and death.</P>
    <P>Mothers and babies are being discharged so early that some of the most important tests are not being carried out before they leave hospital.  Naturally, I know the response will be that there is post-natal treatment.  The reality of women's lives in some areas is that if they are asked to come back for treatment or testing a combination of factors can and will prevent it.  Women may be struggling and striving on their own.  They may suffer from post-natal depression which leaves them with no sense of motivation and, above all, the cost of the bus journey to the hospital will deter them from going back.  This is the reality of people's lives in poverty and of the lack of choices offered to them.  It is at that level that we must organise these Estimates.  In cost effectiveness it can mean that in the years ahead we will have hospitals and clinics filled with people suffering and even dying from diseases that could easily, humanely and rightly have been prevented and which could be diagnosed now.  Nobody can tell me that that is budgeting and planning or that they are drawing up a national plan for three months, three years or 30 years based on that type of cutback.</P>
    <P>There is huge unemployment of women in that area.  The first people to be let go as a result of those and future cutbacks are what are termed part time and temporary workers, terms which hide the discrimination that has existed against women.  Because of marriage bars and age limits women have been kept consistently in a temporary capacity even when working at a full professional career.  They are left on a temporary basis without the usual features of a career such as holiday pay, sickness pay and pensions.  The first and easiest to be dispensed with in employment are that very category.  Women are the first on whom the blow falls.</P>
    <P>That might be seen as a way to solve <Col N="1249" /> our community care problem.  If we continue to discriminate against women and lay them off first as part time and temporary workers, will they not become the unpaid voluntary labour who will take up the slack when the elderly are dismissed from hospitals by reason of there being no room, no beds, or no recuperation time and when there will be no community day centres and no transport to take the elderly to day centres?  Who has always and ever carried the burden in a voluntary capacity, totally unpaid? Women have.  Government after Government have made decisions that community care based on the resources and structures within a caring community is the best way of looking after our elderly, our invalids and our handicapped but we are stripping and dismantling all of those frail structures and laying the onus of care on women who will almost <i>de rigeur</i> be expected not even to ask for anything in return but to ask that they be allowed to make the sacrifice.</P>
    <P>That is difficult enough to take but consider the social partners around the table in grand negotiation bringing out national plans with great acclaim. Women are not social partners.  I know people will rush in to say that they are represented in their unions, in their management and in Government.  They are not.  I put it to this Government, and this will apply, too, to any future administration, that we cannot talk about social partners and full representation of interest and ask people equally to bear the burden and the sacrifices that will have to be made as a result of decisions made within the social partner framework without giving a voice and a vote to women around that table.  The consequence of doing otherwise is to have in the community the poorest of the poor.</P>
    <P>People will switch off at this point and say, &ldquo;Here she goes again.  This is not important.  It is all about women&rdquo;, without taking into consideration the total exclusion of women and the burden they have to bear as a result of these decisions. Recently there was a national conference on the future of the health services.  I did <Col N="1250" /> not have occasion to attend that conference but I heard that there were 26 or 27 speakers, three or four of whom were women and that the panel, which included the Minister for Health, was all male.  The compassionate, just and fair alterations that we are asking be made to the budget would be brought about more easily if opposite measures were not introduced in the first place.  Here this afternoon I am asking for the responsibility and maturity of the Taoiseach and his Minister that they are asking of the rest of us.  I ask them to go back to the Estimates and change them in the light of what has been said here.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Board within a small budget have produced most remarkable results.  They were independent and professional and they had trained voluntary workers all over the country in 79 community information centres.  In their knowledge of the rights of the people they changed lives for the better to a degree that probably we will never fully appreciate.  Now with one fell swoop the NSSB are to be abolished. Socially, from the health point of view and from the point of view of people's development that is a total denial and in economic terms it makes no sense.  For instance, 52 per cent of their small budget which they use so well is salary.  The Minister has assured us that the staff of the NSSB will be deployed, so 52 per cent at least of that small budget is already taken up.  Therefore, for the small sum that is left we are going to dismantle a network of information about people's rights that we all rightly felt proud of.</P>
    <P>Who gained most from the services and the professionalism of the NSSB? Women did.  I know from training courses that have been run by members of the NSSB that sometimes the numbers taking part were 20 women to one man, because women work voluntarily in the community for historical and social reasons; therefore, this was an opportunity for them to become more skilled in the work they were doing.  It has been alleged that the health boards can take up the work the NSSB were doing.  If one talks to anyone on any health board today, the <Col N="1251" /> first thing one will be told is that not alone will they not be able to take on extra work but that they cannot even cope with the work that they used to do because the cutbacks have been so savage.</P>
    <P>For an apparently inexplicable reason and a minute amount of money, we are going to lose the training that helped voluntary organisations to fund raise, to operate holiday play schemes within the community, that helped to train home helps and to set up directories of national voluntary organisations, social service agencies and other public bodies who work to keep the social fabric going.  This strategy stops organisations from printing useful booklets, for instance, about visiting old people in the community, it inhibits access to a library of audio visual training aids which voluntary organisations could get for a small fee.  That whole framework of caring, voluntary but necessarily skilled help is to be abolished. Where will people turn?  Will they have to swell the clinics of TDs, which was the situation before we set up the National Social Service Board?  Will we engender in poverty-stricken people the idea that their very entitlements are privileges? Will they have to queue confession-like for hours outside TDs' overcrowded clinics to beg for what the National Social Services Board through its network was giving professionally, skillfully and above all independently?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech introducing the Estimates gave as a reason for the abolition of the Health Education Bureau:</P>
    <P>In some cases they are carrying out tasks in an elaborate environment that could be much more economically performed as normal functions of their parent Department. </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was referring to agencies which the Government intended to abolish. This is the nub of it.  In a brave new Republic where we all pay lip service to decentralisation, because of these Estimates, we will see before our very eyes the dismantling of the small progress and efforts made towards decentralisation to <Col N="1252" /> allow people have independence in their own communities.  We were working slowly towards allowing people have some agencies outside the sphere of Government Departments, which would critically analyse needs and would do research and tell people in an objective professional fashion what they needed to know.  The long term effects of this strategy cannot be over-estimated.  There is not much money involved here so I would ask the Taoiseach and his Cabinet to reconsider their decision.</P>

      <P>In relation to decentralisation the parent Department raised all kinds of difficulties.  The last thing a parent does when her children have struggled to become independent is pull them back into the suffocating love and care of the original home.  I find this attitude of the Department depressing.</P>
      <P>The women in enterprise programme abolished by the Government had been extraordinarily successful.  The Government's recognition of the need for positive or affirmative action for women is summed up in the statement made by the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, when he said that it would be patronising to have a separate active enterprise centre that would encourage women into business, because after all they could go out into the wide world and if they are successful and had enough initiative they could survive. I could take the rest of the Dáil time for the week telling Deputy Reynolds why positive action is needed and why women cannot glibly go into the marketplace and take up their banking and IDA grants in the same way as men. First, the greatest number of women go into service industries which is one of the greatest expanding areas of employment and job creation, but it is an industry not served by the IDA.  So, where should women turn?  Five out of six of the small successful enterprises started in the US in the last five or six years have been started by women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to indicate some of the priorities and policies in the marine area.  Until March of this year no fewer than nine Departments of State had varying degrees of involvement in marine development.  This fragmentation of policy led to the absence of an overall cohesive marine policy and prompted Fianna Fáil, while in Opposition, to put together a blueprint for a new Department to be known as Roinn na Mara. Following his election by the Dáil on 10 March, the Taoiseach announced the establishment of Roinn na Mara and the new Department came officially into being on 19 March.  The main marine functions of fishing, shipping, harbours, marine safety, conservation, recreation <Col N="1254" /> and amenity aspects are now the responsibility of the new Department.</P>
      <P>Now that I have the departmental structure in place, I am getting on with the review of marine policies, the establishment of priorities for action and the preparation of programmes and strategies for the achievement of my departmental objectives.  These objectives must, of course, take account of the Government's plan to reduce the volume of public expenditure to a level that our resources can support and sustain but within that constraint I am doing everything possible to divert these resources to the areas where results in the form of job creation and marine economic development can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The organisational structure of my Department has been finalised and it follows closely the model suggested in the policy document.  In effect there are two commercial development divisions, one concerned with fisheries development while the other is concerned with harbours, both commercial and fishing, shipping policy, including ship and boat building, and maritime safety.  The fishery area comprises three branches &mdash; sea fisheries, inland and aquaculture.</P>
      <P>One might get the impression from comparing the 1987 allocation and the 1988 provision for salaries that there has been a very substantial increase in the numbers of staff in my Department.  The impression is, however, misleading.  With the exception of a handful of extra staff, the total numbers involved comprise those who were involved in fisheries activities in the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry and those employed in the Marine Division of the former Department of Communications. The latter includes the Marine Survey Office which is the technical arm of the Department responsible for all aspects of maritime safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a coherent policy has inhibited the development of inland fisheries and has been for many years the subject of adverse criticism of successive Administrations.  In its election programme for fisheries this Government <Col N="1255" /> recognised that inland fisheries was a significant growth area which had been relatively neglected in the past.  It proposed the development of this area with a view to increasing employment in tourism and angling related activities.  I will be recommending that explicit objectives be set for inland fisheries development in Ireland and I will be seeking to have these objectives adopted as Government policy.  I believe that these objectives should clearly articulate employment generation, income generation, income distribution, development and conservation of amenity, ownership rationalisation and community involvement as the targets of policy.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering proposals for the restructuring of the central and regional fisheries boards with these objectives in mind.  In addition to the powers and functions already vested in the fishery boards, I intend that the new board will have a clear mandate in relation to the generation of employment and the development of the resource.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a major natural resource in its stock of wild Atlantic salmon but there is considerable evidence that we are not maximising the value of the resource because of the manner in which salmon stocks are exploited.  A Salmon Review Group was appointed by the previous administration because of its concern about the conservation of salmon stocks and the level of illegal salmon fishing. When I was appointed Minister for the Marine I extended the terms of reference of the group to include policy objectives as well as the best measures and structures to achieve these goals.  This group has completed its report and I received it this week.  I will be giving careful consideration to its recommendations in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In regard to the control of the salmon fishing industry, we had to introduce at the start of this season a system of quotas and tagging to enable an accurate balance to be maintained in the exploitation of the salmon stock.  It is no secret that the salmon fishing industry has been chaotically running out of control for the past <Col N="1256" /> number of years and further protection is needed to avoid the total wiping out of salmon stocks.  One of the recommendations of the review body which I totally support and hope to implement is the system of quotas and tagging to ensure rational exploitation of the salmon stock.</P>
    <P>The angling potential of our rivers as a source of leisure for our people and as a means of attracting angling tourists from Britain and mainland Europe has not received the recognition it deserves. I am committed to do all I can within the resources available to me to develop and expand this very valuable resource by means of improving and enhancing stocks, continuing research, co-operating with relevant Government colleagues in monitoring and combating pollution in our rivers and making people more aware of the great potential of this amenity.</P>
    <P>As I already indicated, I intend to bring before the Government soon new proposals to strengthen the legislation in the whole area of pollution controls which we will have an opportunity to debate before the end of this session.</P>
    <P>I think it is only fair to say that those benefiting from angling developments should make some effort in return to the further development of the resource.  The Government have decided to introduce a licence fee for trout and coarse fish angling the proceeds of which will accrue to the fishery boards as additional revenue towards financing their conservation, protection and development work.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that a properly planned exploition of our sea fisheries resource offers very significant potential for economic expansion and job creation. These opportunities have been recognised fully by the Government in their recently published economic plan.  Over the period of the plan specific policies will be advanced to ensure that the targets set down for sea fishing are achieved.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next five years it is envisaged that there will be a total <Col N="1257" /> investment in excess of £80 million in essential modernisation of the fleet. Without this level of new investment our fisheries fleet would soon become uncompetitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> its main competitors. Our aim must be to modernise the industry and reduce the overall age structure of the fleet.  The new EC structures package, coupled with BIM's revised marine credit plan will, I have no doubt, provide the necessary incentive to our fishermen to invest in the future modernisation of equipment and streamlining of our fleet in an effort to fully compete with the very sophisticated fleets in the Community. This is essential at this time.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in the next five years the total catch will increase from 218,000 to 366,000 tonnes &mdash; an increase of two-thirds over that period.  It is further anticipated that this level of expansion will generate an increase of about 2,000 full-time jobs and 2,000 part-time jobs in fishing, aquaculture, processing, marketing and ancillary support activities.  I am confident that these targets are both realistic and achievable in the current more favourable climate of better fish prices, sharp reductions in fuel oil prices and the increasing demand for fish and increase in consumption of fish, both here and within the Community and worldwide. We have the opportunity of substantially increasing the total value of the catch and the total number in employment, thus increasing the revenue to the economy and increasing the number of jobs in this whole sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The 1988 provision for Bord Iascaigh Mhara is £9.355 million.  This includes a capital allocation of £2.096 million to be spent mainly on grants for the purchase of new fishing vessels, the modernisation and improvement of existing vessels and the setting up of mariculture projects. A further £2.385 million is provided for loans by BIM to fishermen for the purchase of a new or secondhand vessels and for vessel improvements.  The BIM investment will, as I have already mentioned, be supplemented by EC grants under the Community's structures package and also by bank loans.</P>
    <P>In the EC context, we continue to <Col N="1258" /> work within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The single most important element of the CFP from our point of view is, of course, the quotas or shares available to the Irish fishing fleet.  Negotiations on the 1988 quotas will not take place until December and I will be pressing in these negotiations for the maximum quotas possible so that the industry here may realise its full potential. Earlier this year both the Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, and myself went to Brussels to meet with the Commissioner with responsibility for fisheries, Mr. Cardoso e Cunha.  During the discussions, which covered a wide range of issues, we raised the question of Irish quotas generally, with specific emphasis on those species of greatest importance to us.  As Deputies will be aware, the Commissioner subsequently visited Ireland in July at our invitation and saw the situation at first hand for himself.  He was impressed with the rate of development of the industry.  He recognised that we had particular problems here which needed to be dealt with and was most willing and co-operative to assist in any way possible within the Common Fisheries Policy to improve the environment for the further development and expansion of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that fishing of the balance of the mackerel quota commenced earlier this week.  This is a vital fishery from an Irish point of view and I wish to assure the House that every effort is being made to secure an increase in the mackerel quota by way of exchange with other member states.  However, the industry cannot rely entirely on the mackerel fishing alone.  In the future new species and new areas for potential will have to be identified and exploited and new fishing efforts must be directed into areas where we have resources which are at present underdeveloped or under-exploited. Overall, working within the constraints of the quota system which we have to operate within the Common Fisheries Policy but recognising that there is a huge potential which is relatively underdeveloped, untapped and unexploited up to now, in a balanced way <Col N="1259" /> we can achieve substantial increases in revenue, employment and economic activity in the whole area of our sea fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware of the difficulties facing the authorities from the activities of the so-called &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo; vessels.  I will not tolerate a situation whereby vessels on the Irish register or indeed other register will be allowed to fish when they are making no real contribution to the Irish economy. My Department will continue to pursue this matter in the courts.  However, because of the situation I have outlined and the deep resentment I know Irish fishermen feel at the activities of these vessels, I raised this matter specifically at the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 29 September 1987 and received an assurance that the Commission would work towards an early solution to this problem which is causing anxiety within the industry and which is a very clever way taken by some member states to get around the regulations.  The activities in this quota hopping flag of convenience mechanism are threatening the very stability of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Commission and the Community must act against this clever means of evading the regulations and I am glad that the Commission and the Council recognised that there was a particular problem here to be dealt with and indicated that some initiatives in that area would be forthcoming shortly.</P>
    <P>Regular inspection patrols of our exclusive fishery limits continue to be carried out by the Naval Service in conjunction with the Air Corps to ensure compliance with fishery regulations.  To date in 1987, some 69 fishing vessels of mainly Spanish origin have been detained by the Naval Service in the course of inspection patrols for suspected breaches of fishery regulations.  Legal proceedings have been or will be instituted for the bulk of these detentions.  It is estimated that receipts in the form of fines and forfeitures for fishery offences will exceed £0.5 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to <Col N="1260" /> pay tribute to the Naval Service and the Air Corps for their work in sea fishery protection and in ensuring that the various conservation, control and technical measures are complied with.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture, more than any other sector of the Irish seafood industry, offers unique opportunities for increasing fish output and exports and has the potential to make a major contribution to income and employment in coastal and island communities.  Fish farming, unlike the fishing industry, is not hindered by restrictive EC quotas, conservation measures or stock depletion.  Since production takes place under controlled conditions, it is much easier to produce the type and quality of product required by the market place and to achieve continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>The pattern internationally is that aquaculture is supplying an increasing share of world seafood landings and consumption. World fish production in 1985 is estimated to have amounted to 84 million tonnes, with about 8.6 million tonnes or 10 per cent of the total coming from aquaculture.  Over the next five years, aquaculture's share of total world fish supplies is expected to increase to 14 per cent in volume terms.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the contribution of aquaculture to total fish supplies was 5.6 per cent in 1986, which is lower than the world average.  The rate of growth in Irish fish farming into the next decade is projected to be much greater than the average elsewhere and by 1991 should account for about 10 per cent of Irish fish supplies in volume terms.  Aquaculture tends to concentrate on the production of high valued species which have a strong market demand and for which there are limited supplies from wild fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Government are convinced that aquaculture has a very important role to play in developing the economy in maritime areas.  It offers opportunities for employment in the more underdeveloped regions of the country.  In order that the full potential of aquaculture is achieved it is essential that a coherent policy for this developing industry is put in place.  This is a priority for this <Col N="1261" /> administration.  I am at present finalising my plans for the co-ordination of fish farm development in that context.  I hope to be able to indicate our policy and priorities in that area in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Given proper management and State support, the industry is capable of rapid expansion over the next five years, resulting in a trebling of output during that period.  A total of 14 areas have already been designated for aquaculture development. Designation of a further six areas is under consideration and the designation procedure is about to commence shortly in respect of a further 13 areas.</P>
    <P>Approximately 300 licence applications for salmon and shellfish licences are being processed and licences in respect of areas in the designated areas will be issued when I have finalised my plans for fish farm development to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In establishing the Department of the Marine, the Government had as one of their objectives the bringing of all harbours &mdash; commercial and fishery &mdash; under one administrative and planning umbrella.  The integration of the harbours division of the former Department of Communications and of the fishery harbours division of the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry in a single division of Department of the Marine has largely achieved that objective. Arrangements are now in train for the transfer of the major fishery harbour centres of Howth and Dunmore East and of Dún Laoghaire harbour to the Department of the Marine.  I am confident that the centralising of control in one agency will facilitate the orderly development of our harbour infrastructure and result in the best use of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>Government policy on ports and harbours is contained in the Harbours Acts of 1946 and 1947.  Twenty-five harbour authorities, known as scheduled harbours, are governed by the Harbours Acts.  Scheduled harbours are generally viewed as a more commercial type of local authority and this is reflected in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The basic philosophy underlying Irish <Col N="1262" /> ports policy has been that ports should, in principle, be operated as commercial undertakings and be financially self-supporting, with management and development left to local interests with a knowledge of local needs, subject to the Minister's overall control.  The policy with regard to harbour grants has been that they should be provided only where improvements are essential to meet well defined commerical needs, and where a harbour authority's own resources are insufficient.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure on harbours in the five years to 1986 was some £45.4 million.  Almost two-thirds of this was provided from Exchequer sources by way of State grants or borrowings from the Local Loans Fund, with the balance coming from commercial borrowing and revenue surpluses.  Exchequer grants amounted to £21.7 million &mdash; some 48 per cent of total capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The capacity of Irish ports to meet the future needs of the State was last examined in detail in 1975.  At that time, it was estimated that capacity would be adequate to cater for the needs of the country to 1980, when throughput was expected to be almost 23 million tonnes. In the event, the throughput in 1980 was 19.4 million tonnes and in 1986 throughput was 22.3 million tonnes.  Furthermore, since 1975 additional capacity for roll on-roll off, Ro-Ro and load on-load off, Lo-Lo, traffic has been provided and there have been improvements in capacity at Dublin, Foynes, Cork and Sligo.  Thus, it seems likely that overall port capacity is adequate for national needs for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Ports account for almost 80 per cent by volume of the State's external trade, with most of the balance crossing the land frontier.  A review of portal traffic for 1986, including traffic at non-scheduled harbours such as Rosslare, Arklow Jetty, Greenore, Dún Laoghaire, Killybegs and Dungarvan, shows that traffic at the four major ports, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, accounted for 76.5 per cent of travel by volume through the ports in 1986.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in the 1988 <Col N="1263" /> Capital Programme for the payment of State grants totalling £2 million for commercial harbours.  A number of reconstruction projects in these harbours are under consideration where the money can be spent to ensure not alone the continued employment of those associated with the ports but to generate additional employment in the areas by assisting growth in these ports.  I am reviewing strategies in this area with a view to rational and integrated planning of harbour development to ensure that the resources available are used in a way which will ensure maximum return to the State.  I hope to bring proposals for the establishment of an estuarial authority for the Shannon before the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>£1.1 million has been allocated to fishery harbour works.  Of this amount £0.7 million is being made available for ongoing works on the provision of a much needed boatlift at Killybegs to service the large and very valuable local fishing fleet in which the State has a substantial investment. A further £0.33 million is for works on a harbour development scheme at Greencastle to relieve an acute berthage problem and provide deeper water for the harbour.  This will facilitate quicker turnabout and will enable the bigger boats in the fleet to use the port, particularly in the early part of the mackerel season when the fleet is working off the western coast of Scotland.</P>
    <P>I believe that harbour development should be viewed within a consistent framework.  Harbours can be used for shipping, for tourist traffic, for fishing and for recreational and amenity use.  I intend to ensure that in relation to the planning, organisation and development of harbours the options for complimentary and alternative uses of existing harbour facilities are fully pursued.</P>
    <P>The Irish merchant fleet has in recent years suffered a decline to a level which is wholly disproportionate to Ireland's position as an island and as a country having plans to become a maritime nation.  The factors surrounding this <Col N="1264" /> decline are complex, and cannot be attributed to any single cause.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited it became necessary to undertake a review of the country's strategic shipping needs.  The Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements, established in 1985, in their report concluded that there was an overwhelming case for the provision of incentives for the maintenance and development of the Irish fleet.  The committee recommended that the appropriate Departments of State consider what measures could be taken to provide an effective stimulus to existing shipowners and attract new investors to the industry.</P>
    <P>A package of incentives, designed to maintain and develop the shipping industry was announced earlier this year.  A major component of this was the shipping investment grant scheme.  Other fiscal incentives which formed part of the package were introduced under the 1987 Finance Act.  These reduce the level of corporation tax payable by shipping companies to 10 per cent and allow such enterprises access to the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>The Shipping Investments Grants Bill, 1987 is at present before the Dáil.  This Bill, as Deputies are aware, is designed to provide a boost to Irish shipowners to expand their fleet capacity and so increase the share of our trade carried in Irish ships.</P>
    <P>The grants scheme provides for a maximum allocation of £7.5 million.  I expect that some £515,000 will be provided in grant-aid during 1987 while a further £1.03 million subject to budgetary constraints, will be available in the first full year of the scheme's operation in 1988.</P>
    <P>I expect that the introduction of the shipping incentives scheme will result in an increase in the size of the Irish fleet, will improve both the balance of payments through increased foreign earnings and import substitution, and the employment prospects for seamen and shore-based personnel.</P>
    <P>On the safety front, it will be a primary <Col N="1265" /> objective of the Department of the Marine that the highest internationally accepted standards will continue to apply on board Irish ships in relation to their construction, equipment and operation and in relation to the standards of training of the personnel on board.  Ireland is a party to all of the principal safety conventions drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation, the specialised agency of the United Nations who are responsible for safety at sea matters. Ireland is also a party to the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control, an agreement between 14 maritime nations of Western Europe.  The parties to this agreement implemented a rigorous programme of inspection of ships calling to ports in the regions to ensure adherence to the standards of internationally accepted conventions designed to achieve safety at sea and prevent oil pollution.  Through my Department, Ireland will give a full commitment to these objectives.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very difficult economic circumstances, I look forward to further improvements in marine safety and search and rescue facilities in 1988. A sum of £450,000 has been earmarked for electronic equipment for the coast radio station.</P>
    <P>One of the most cost-effective means of reducing the risk of loss of life at sea is the extension of the chain of coast VHF radio stations.  VHF portable transmitters are relatively inexpensive and do not require specialist knowledge to operate. They are already carried on almost all fishing vessels and many larger yachts. A 24-hour listening service for emergency calls is provided by VHF radio stations. VHF emergency communications facilities now cover from Rathlin Island to Ballagh Rocks on the north-north east coast, from Slyne Head to the Old Head of Kinsale on the west-south coast and from Wicklow Head to Carlingford Lough on the east coast.  I am anxious to complete the chain as quickly as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident to which I must refer has focused attention on marine pollution from ships.  Since I took <Col N="1266" /> up office, I concentrated initially on removing the bunker fuel from the ship. This work was carried out comprehensively and undertaken in very difficult conditions.  As Deputies will be aware from my reply to parliamentary questions on 20 October 1987, the claim for expenditure by the State arising out of the incident has now been submitted to the insurers.  This claim will be pursued vigorously.  In the context of the experiences gleaned from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster I propose to introduce here and in the Seanad, as a matter of urgency, a number of legislative proposals to strengthen our legislation in the whole area of maritime pollution control and protection. There is legislation already before the Houses to enable us to comply with some international conventions on the control of maritime pollution.  It is our intention to press ahead speedily with the introduction of further legislative measures to ensure that all our laws in relation to oil pollution and the control of activities associated with the shipping industry are in line with and up-to-date with the present international situation. This will take our maritime pollution laws and regulations into the 20th century, remedying the defects of almost 20 years neglect in this area.</P>
    <P>We have also decided to establish a marine research and technology institute. Given the state of neglect of our maritime resources, our laws in this whole area and the total neglect of the maritime economy since the foundation of the State in the very short time since this Department was established, we have already made a major contribution.  We propose to press ahead vigorously in all the areas I have mentioned.  In the very near future we hope to be able to say that already the establishment of this new Department of the Marine has had a major impact on economic activity in marine and related industries and activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Just over a year ago, in the middle of October of last year, the Progressive Democrats published a policy document on public finances and <Col N="1267" /> on the regeneration of the economy generally. We identified the level of public debt in the country, the level of borrowing and the consequential level of taxation as matters that cried out for immediate tackling and the immediate implementation of radically different policies.  At the time I pointed out that they were necessary because of the fiscal and economic realities we faced then.  I said they had nothing whatever to do with ideology or matters of left or right divisions or anything else, but were dictated by our very economic survival.  At the time I pointed out also on several occasions that Governments all over the world of every political hue, who were faced with difficulties, which in most cases were a great deal less severe than those facing us here last year, were implementing these measures.  They were seeking to control public expenditure, reduce taxation, lessen the input of the State into the economy generally and they were seeking to privatise a wide range of economic activities in which the State was, in their view, unnecessarily engaged.</P>
      <P>That message which we preached at that time had very little impact on political parties at least.  As we saw later, it had quite an impact in that general election on the public at large, a significant segment of which quite clearly agreed with us but I remember in this House and outside it being subjected to constant derision and criticism for the views we expressed.  The then Government said it was nonsense, that it could not be done, that the cuts were too large and so on, that we were crazy to publish any such programme.  The then Opposition, Fianna Fáil, used a limited number of words only but they were generally: Thatcherite, monetarist and all the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this debate takes place the general situation in the country is marginally worse than it was this time last year, not fundamentally worse, similar in its underlying problems but simply a year older and a year deeper in debt and, to that extent, marginally worse off.  For that reason it was not without some <Col N="1268" /> amusement and satisfaction that I heard the Taoiseach on Tuesday last deliver himself of the following remarks in the course of his introductory speech:</P>
    <P>The policies which we have adopted are dictated entirely by the fiscal and economic realities.  I wish to state again categorically that they are not being undertaken for any ideological reason or political motives.  They are not policies of the left or right, but policies dictated by the sheer necessity of economic survival.  All over the world governments with totally different political philosophies are all compelled to follow the same course of action that we are following because they have no alternative but to do so in order to survive. </P>
    <P>To that I say Amen.  I say, if that is valid in October 1987 &mdash; as I believe it is &mdash; was it not equally valid in October 1986? Who is fooling whom?  Why should something that can be clearly said now with total validity have been derided in the rather extraordinary, almost unanimous, manner in which it was in this House last year?</P>
    <P>The people are able to make their own judgments.  In making their judgments on what has happened over the past year, inevitably they will have to make judgments about who they can believe in the years to come when it is necessary to assess what people have to say at that stage.  I will grant the Government this; they have the grace &mdash; it is remarkable, because I thought they would not &mdash; to smile broadly when these matters are pointed out, as the two members of the Government opposite me now are, and as the Taoiseach is frequently reduced to doing.  They do not have the gall, thank God, to try to argue their way out of it. Indeed, perhaps the one member who does not smile gracefully and keep her down is the head prefect herself who does not agree that things are not as she expressed them last year at all.  She simply says: &ldquo;This year I am the Minister for Education; last year I was not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad that both the Government and Fine Gael have brought their earlier <Col N="1269" /> opposition to Progressive Democrats' policies to a conclusion and begun to put them into practice to some limited extent. It is important for the sake of this country that this process should have begun.  It is important that the task be continued until the problem has been solved.  My anxiety is that there should be no weakening of resolve, no pandering to particular interest groups, no short-term relaxation to win some temporary popularity, as unfortunately we saw in the publication of this so-called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> just under a fortnight ago.  It is in the interests of every man, woman and child, and especially in the interests of young people, that this task of restoring national financial stability be completed. I say it is especially in the interests of the young because if there is failure it is they who will bear the heaviest burden and pay the most bitter price in terms of having to repay, at some stage, the massive burden of debt that will have accumulated while also being deprived of the employment opportunities that would provide the national wealth from which any payment must come.</P>
    <P>I broadly agree with the direction of the various cuts proposed.  They are very much on the lines of what the Progressive Democrats had the guts to publish last year when no other party would agree with them.  No other party would publish any such programme in advance of an election.  It is right, for example, to cut down on capital spending for areas such as new hospitals and new schools.  Much as we would desire to see more improvements there is no point in pretending that we can afford them now.  We have seen the sorry spectacle of new hospital buildings remaining unopened for years because we cannot afford the staff or other facilities needed to operate them.</P>
    <P>In the case of education the experts are already warning about the way in which the numbers of school-age children will fall over the coming years.  There is little point in rushing ahead now with new buildings that will become empty shells in a few years.  Already in the cities we have seen how the shift of population from one place to another has led to 20 <Col N="1270" /> or 30 year old buildings which are less than half full being threatened with closure, while there is pressure to build new schools a mile or two away.  Why are children not transported by bus to prevent this waste?</P>
    <P>Let us put this question of cutbacks in capital in perspective.  There is little danger that these reductions are going to damage our chances of restoring economic growth.  If capital spending were the only thing needed for growth we should have been booming for years past because we have had one of the highest proportions of capital spending of any country in the Western world.</P>
    <P>And indeed if one notes that the largest reduction is in spending on house improvement grants &mdash; a reduction of £55 millions &mdash; the scheme has been suspended since earlier this year so the cutback has largely taken place already.</P>
    <P>Of course it is current spending that poses the greatest headache.  This year's current deficit of £1,200 millions will take years to eliminate.  Some commentators criticised the Progressive Democrats' proposals prior to the election because we suggested that it could take up to a decade to achieve this result.  The difficulty of the task becomes clear, however, as we look at the prospective 1988 budget which might emerge from the spending Estimates.  The current spending total for next year shows a reduction of £177 million or 3 per cent on this year's figure.  We know that there are several items which must be added to the spending for next year.  There is the cost of the public service pay rise, put at about £70 million.  There will be improvements in social welfare payments. Depending on the month from which they operate and the size of the increase, the cost could vary substantially, but it would not be unreasonable to expect that £40 million will be needed under this heading in 1988.  There will be the increase in the cost of servicing the higher national debt, which is greatly increased by this year's borrowing.  The extra cost here will be affected by interest rates and we all know how unstable financial markets have been in recent times.  Clearly we cannot put a <Col N="1271" /> precise figure on this item but an extra £100 million or more would seem in prospect. So there is the likely prospect of more than £200 millions being added to next year's spending by budget time.</P>
    <P>To meet this there should of course be some rise in tax revenue from existing taxes, but part of this will be needed to meet the commitment to provide tax reliefs of £75 million.  There cannot be much rise in tax revenue because of deflation and heavy unemployment. There is also the commitment to raise some revenue by bringing farmers into the PRSI net.  It is possible, but unlikely, that on balance the net additions to tax revenue will be sufficient to balance out the cost of the additional spending items, so that the current deficit for next year may possibly be reduced by the £177 million in the Estimates for the spending Departments.  But this would still leave a current deficit well in excess of £1 billion. And as the process of further reductions continues it must be assumed that the difficulty in securing further economies will intensify.</P>
    <P>That is why we have been critical of the agreement to give a pay rise in each of the next three years to public servants. Supporters of this agreement have pointed to the fact that it represents a smaller rise than was the case with earlier pay rounds.  But that misses the point. The Exchequer is in no condition to commit itself to increases.  Higher pay for staff means that the task of cutting overall spending by £1 billion or more will lead to much greater cuts in other areas of spending.  One area which cannot be cut is the cost of servicing our debt.  This in combination with public service pay accounts for about £5 billion of spending next year.  All other spending amounts to about £3.5 billion.  This means that roughly one-third of all other services &mdash; including social welfare &mdash; would have to be cut out if the deficit were to be eliminated now.</P>
    <P>Naturally nobody is proposing such a drastic action.  The point, however, is that if there are to be severe economies for <Col N="1272" /> years to come in order to gradually eliminate this current deficit, there is a need to spread the burden as fairly as possible. Our view is that it would have been fairer at the present time to hold public service pay at the present rates.  This would not necessarily imply any great hardship because take-home pay would be improved by any reductions in taxation, and indeed the Progressive Democrats have suggested that cutting out PRSI on the first slice of earning would give a tax saving that would be particularly beneficial to lower paid workers.</P>
    <P>Similarly if £70 million was not being spent on increased pay it could be used to slow down the rate of redundancy until there are more job opportunities in the private sector, and so ease the unemployment pressures even to a modest extent.</P>
    <P>For these reasons we cannot give wholehearted support to the Government's proposals, even though they represent some progress in the right direction.  There is scope to make even better use of the limited resources, and we in the Progressive Democrats will continue to advocate reforms to improve the system.  In addition to our tax proposals of last year, we recently published a discussion paper outlining some possibilities for reforming the social welfare system. These will be finalised in the light of the contributions made by our members at our party conference and elsewhere.  But already it is clear that there is scope for simplifying and revamping the services so that greater support can be made available to those who are genuinely in need, even within the constraints of the existing budget.</P>
    <P>The need for fresh thinking and further reforms will continue in the years ahead if we are successfully to resolve the nation's difficulties.  We are determined to continue forcing the pace of that reform.</P>
    <P>The political misjudgments of the Government are clearly underlined in the case of the education cuts outlined in next year's Estimates.  The Progressive Democrats regard this as an area where the bankruptcy of this Government's policies is fully exposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> We believe as a fundamental principle that whatever areas of the educational budget must suffer, the axe should not fall on the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools.  But look at what is now facing our children and their parents.  The Minister for Education has already admitted to the likely loss of up to 1,300 primary teaching jobs.  The number could be even greater than this.</P>
    <P>This year there are 21,161 primary teachers, receiving average salaries of £15,796.  In the Estimates for 1988 the provision for primary teacher salaries comes up £312.3 million.  If we take the average salary for this year that means a pay allocation for only 19,770 teachers, a drop of 1,391.  To pay those 1,391 teachers this year's average salary next year would cost in the region of £20 million. Should we not do this out of the £70 million that is thrown away in an unnecessary pay increase provided for in the so-called national plan?</P>
    <P>What we have boldly stated since the publication of that rather unfortunate document in a rushed fashion on 9 October last is: freeze public sector pay and maintain essential public services to the greatest extent possible.  That means retaining the present number of primary teachers and it would be possible without upsetting one iota of the overall Government targets for next year, if the public sector wage plan did not exist.</P>
    <P>We keep congratulating ourselves on our educational system.  For historical reasons, which need not detain us here, it is geared towards the best 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the system and towards those who will go on to third level education. Is that right?  Has society not an equal duty to all children, especially the least able?  Why should the least able, in practice be pushed aside in favour of the gifted?  Is it any wonder that we end up with so many social problems in a country that is allegedly so well educated?  The only part of the educational system that is common to all our children, including the weakest, is the primary sector.  That is where we should cut least but it is where the Government are cutting most. I believe that is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> The treatment of agriculture in next year's Estimates is another case of crazy and unjust priorities on the part of this Government.  What is the sense in cutting the budget for farm research, advice and training by 43 per cent and making only a minute 2 per cent in the central administrative bureaucracy of the Department of Agriculture?  We cannot maintain a proper research and advisory service for the country's primary industry if we are going to virtually slash one in every two jobs in this sector.  I am not saying there cannot be economies under these headings; indeed, the Progressive Democrats were the first, a year ago, to propose the amalgamation of ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>When all these cutbacks in field services are effected, if the present unjust proposals stand, what will the civil servants in Agriculture House be left to administer?  There are many divisions there, most notoriously the former Land Commission, ostensibly abolished by the previous Government as long ago as 1984 but all of whose staff are still being paid without any functions to perform.  Part of the Land Commission was transferred into the Land Classification Office for a period but that, too, has been abolished. We also have the farm development service and the disease eradication section of the Department where I believe greater economies in staff numbers could be made in order to maintain a greater level of field services in the research and advisory areas.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the scale of the proposed ACOT-AFT cuts throws up another interesting point, highlighted by me in my recent national conference address. Some of the AFT and ACOT staff who have contacted our party in recent days have made it clear that they would happily accept a pay freeze, even a pay cut, as the price of retaining more jobs in their sectors.  This underlines again my contention that public servants know the reality of the public finances.  They know full well that if half of Exchequer spending is to go on public sector wages and cuts have to proceed then the quality of their job deteriorates and fewer of their <Col N="1275" /> number can be retained.  That is why our call for a pay freeze in the public sector so that essential services be maintained, makes sense particularly for those working in that sector.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see a repetition in the Department of Agriculture of the errors made earlier this year in the Department of Health where those who are being withdrawn are at the coalface providing the service to those who need it and those who are relatively untouched are the large bureaucracy which nowadays has less and less to administer but which itself is untouchable.  That is why even with relatively small savings we are forced to endure huge cuts in the delivery of services, as we had to endure in health in particular over the last six months.</P>
    <P>This national programme as it is described, is in effect only a national wage agreement for the public sector. National wage agreements may sometimes be justified &mdash; I have known occasions in the past where, on balance, they were probably beneficial but normally they should not be promoted unless there is a very definite reason for them &mdash; but this is not one of those times.  That is recognised by the fact that the private sector succeeded in extricating themselves and are not bound by this national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>If normal criteria applied, the State is perhaps the weakest of all the commercial undertakings which have to meet a pay bill in the current year.  It appears to me that buying off confrontation in this way may be very foolish particularly when, in this case, it is clearly proven that a wage increase was bought at the expense of jobs in those sectors.  I believe confrontation is likely to arise from the unnecessary threat to jobs and it may well be a greater confrontation than anything that might have arisen in relation to wages.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting debate taking place in this House about how a saving of £250,000 might be achieved in the overall Estimates we are discussing in this debate, that is, the Oireachtas and Ministerial Pensions Bill which this party are <Col N="1276" /> promoting in Private Members' time. The fact that the saving to the national Exchequer would be only £250,000 tempts some people to suggest that it is largely immaterial in a budget of approximately £8.5 billion.  That particular £250,000 which is at issue in the debate is a very important sum because it represents more than just that figure.  It represents a challenge to people in this House and to people in the public service generally to face up to what our obligations should be in a properly and equitably run society.  It is assumed by almost everyone that in a properly run society wealth should be shared where it is available but from listening to the debate in this House over the past few nights it is clear that in this House there is no such assumption.  Equally, where sacrifices are called for and where wealth is not available, that sacrifice should also be shared in a properly run society.  There is a feeling in this country today that sacrifices are not shared, and are not seen to be shared.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is a clear indication of the unwillingness of some relatively privileged sectors not to share sacrifices.  Whether we like it or not, we are the centre of attraction in many respects because it is from these benches that a great many lectures are given about the necessity to tighten belts and so on.  If there is a glaring anomaly which to 99 per cent of the people seems unjust and unjustifiable, and if it is retained by the deliberate decision of this House at the end of six hours debate on it, then I think the prospects of getting acceptance for the kind of sacrifices that are requested in this Book of Estimates for 1988 will decline greatly.  That would sadden me because in my view a general acceptance that there was a sharing of sacrifice here would be enormously beneficial in the solution of the national problems.</P>
    <P>The Government should think very deeply about this nominal or symbolic £250,000 because if that anomaly is removed and the Government are seen to agree to its removal then it opens up great possibilities for them in terms of <Col N="1277" /> what they will be entitled to ask the people to do.  There will, for the first time, be seen to be a sharing of that sacrifice.  Under the national plan we have no sharing of it.  We have the consumers or recipients of State services, the less well off, being asked to bear more and more of the burden while those who provide those services and those who lecture about those services and make the ultimate decisions bear proportionately less and less of that burden.</P>
    <P>It is from something like that that we will get a consensus of a genuine kind, a kind that we need and not the sort of spurious consensus the Taoiseach spoke of when referring to this national plan. The Bill to which I have referred and in respect of which three Members of the Oireachtas have voluntarily made a sacrifice is a more important Bill than the simple £250,000 it deals with.  It is the key to a lot of things and the Government should ponder deeply on it between now and next Wednesday because if they are prepared to grasp that nettle and take the lead we have sought to give them, then the rocky path that is ahead of them in the proper administration of the country over the next couple of years will be made much smoother and much easier, not just for them but for everybody.  We will achieve for the first time in a long time the beginnings of a genuine feeling of consensus and sharing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an essential part of the Government's strategy to restore confidence in the economy that public sector expenditure and the borrowing necessary to sustain it would be reduced.  It is an inevitable consequence of the Government's strategy that some public services will have to be reduced and that those services that remain are provided in the most cost efficient and cost effective way.  Only in this manner can we address the economic problems facing our society and ensure that more people are in employment, levels of taxation are reduced and a future with some security for our children is achieved.  As the Taoiseach said in his speech to this House last Friday, we are <Col N="1278" /> now paying nearly the whole of the revenue collected from PAYE to service the national debt which now averages £28,000 per household.  This quite rightly, is unsustainable.</P>
      <P>The health services will consume over 17 per cent of the total Exchequer spending in 1988 and it would be naive if not misleading to say that it could escape some spending reductions in these critical times.  Some of the agencies have very considerable budgets.  For example, the Eastern Health Board budget for 1987 is £183 million, the Southern Health Board is £134 million, St Vincent's Hospital's budget is £20.5 million while the Mater Hospital's is £23.8 and St James's Hospital is £30.5 million.  The level of these spending reductions will not, however, be as severe as would appear from a first reading of the Book of Estimates. While the total grant provision for services in 1988, that is £1,096.876 million, shows a reduction of 6 per cent on the provision made for 1987 the overall gross non-capital amount available for services, that is £1,289 million, is a reduction of only 2 per cent on the amount available this year.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that my highest priority will be to ensure that the disadvantaged sections of our community will be protected.  The provision included for the health services in the Book of Estimates now published reflects both the need to reduce public spending and the necessity to protect the disadvantaged. Despite the difficulties which have been experienced during the year I am glad to be able to say that there have been a number of positive developments.  These include the development of radiotherapy facilities at Cork Regional Hospital.  In this case Exchequer funding was provided to supplement extensive fundraising at local level.  Another development was the opening of a lithotripter unit at the Meath Hospital to crush kidney stones.  Other developments included: the opening of a cardiology unit at Galway Regional Hospital and the opening of a new geriatric hospital at Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also given the go ahead for <Col N="1279" /> major developments at Sligo General Hospital and Wexford County Hospital. The tenders for these projects have now been approved and work will commence in the near future.  The development of Sligo and Wexford general hospitals in 1988 will represent the completion of the plan for the modernisation of the general hospital programme which was first announced ten years ago.  We have since seen a major expansion of the hospital system, an expansion which was absolutely essential if the requirements of a modern health system were to be met.</P>
    <P>In 1988, despite the reductions in the Exchequer's capital budget to £41 million, there will be a continuation of the general hospital building programmes in a number of important developments. These include St. James's Mullingar, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, Ardkeen and Castlebar.  The community health programme will include provision for health centres at Athlone, Carlow and Gorey.</P>
    <P>The non-capital provision figures take account of the full year effect of the 1987 budget measures.  Those measures involved significant reductions in pay and non-pay expenditure and have been implemented throughout this year.  The savings made by the health agencies will obviously reflect on their real needs in 1988 and the allocations have taken note of that fact.  The agencies are continuing to cut costs and this process will continue up to the end of the year and beyond into 1988.  Savings have been made very largely in the institutional sector, particularly in the acute general hospitals, whether they be health board or voluntary hospitals and this has been at my request.</P>
    <P>It is at the very least an illusion to think that the spending habits of recent times can be changed without some impact on those major service programmes funded by the Exchequer.  All programmes have been closely examined by the Government to establish their usefulness and determine the level of State support that would be proper in 1988.  Health cannot be an exception to the critical approach <Col N="1280" /> adopted by my colleagues in Government towards public expenditure if only because, as indicated already, the health services consume a significant proportion of overall State spending.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the health services will account for about 6.7 per cent of GNP.  As I mentioned in my statement on the 1987 Estimates we have seen a big rise in health spending since 1973-74 when it was 5.2 per cent of Gross National Product reaching a peak of 7.9 per cent in 1982. The reasons for these increases are well known.  Inflation both in pay and non-pay, new technology and improvements of services are among the main causes. Of course, it is easy to identify the causes but far more difficult to tackle them and put in place curbs on excessive spending. I believe that this Government are attempting to solve the inherent problems faced by any modern State in controlling health services expenditure and the resolution shown this year in cutting out waste will prove to be of continuing benefit to the services and the taxpayers who must fund them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for making time available to me to raise this matter. Although I am appealing to the Government to provide compensation and moneys to Donegal County Council to repair roads and bridges and to help homesteaders and business people to pay flood damage costs, I feel obliged to put on record our very deep concern at the <Col N="1281" /> flooding in Strabane across the bridge from Lifford, County Donegal, where the town has been almost devastated.  I know that all Members of the House will join me in extending our deep concern to those people who have been so grievously inconvenienced.  They have lived through a nightmare and we wish them well.</P>
      <P>The difference between what has happened in Strabane and County Donegal is that in County Donegal the damage stretches over the whole county.  It is, therefore, not so apparent and does not make the news headlines.  Nevertheless, the damage in Donegal is quite substantial. People have been on the telephone to me all day asking what can be done.  Bridges have been washed away and access roads, which were already in bad condition, have been destroyed. Homes have been flooded and the contents of business houses have been damaged. I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Government to make moneys available.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation for the services rendered by the fire brigade, civil defence crews, workers of Donegal County Council and the good people who helped their neighbours in distress.  Roads are so bad in some areas that cars could not proceed any further. Farmers are faced with the difficulty of crops being flooded, especially potato fields, as many are covered in water. Many of these householders are quite unable to meet the cost of the damage from their own finances as they are old age pensioners living alone on fixed incomes.  We must have a compassionate approach to this problem.  Business people whose properties and stock have been damaged should also receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problem will be the repair of roads and bridges.  In Carndonagh a bridge has been washed away which means that the waterpipe serving the area has broken in two with the result that there is no water supply.  The bridge also carried the sewer pipe and sewage is now being discharged into the river.  People cannot get to the public dump because <Col N="1282" /> they had to cross the bridge to do so.  That is an immediate problem which must be dealt with urgently.  I understand that a number of other bridges are in dangerous condition and all of them that are suspect will have to be examined as a matter of urgency.  The Government should send the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and senior civil servants to Donegal immediately to establish the extent of the damage.  There is no doubt that it will run into figures far beyond the ability of Donegal County Council to meet and, therefore, the Government must help.</P>
    <P>The Inishowen Peninsula seems to be the place most badly hit.  Clonmany, Carndonagh, Buncrana and Moville where roads in outlying areas have been almost washed away, are very badly hit. Will the Minister give urgent consideration to providing funds for the county council to meet the immediate needs of the community?  The roads in the county were not good to start with and now they are impassable.  Many people cannot get to the main roads because of the condition of access roads.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for abusing anyone. The rainfall was an act of God and I know that the Members on the other side of the House will be as sympathetic to this matter as I would like them to be.  Perhaps Deputy Conaghan would like to avail himself of the few minutes I have left to put his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Harte for giving me some of his time so that I can speak on this urgent and important issue raised by him.  I wish to be associated with Deputy Harte's remarks in relation to the terrible inconvenience that has been caused to people in Strabane.  As chairman of Donegal County Council I was on to the county manager this morning and it is heartening to know that every effort has been made by Donegal County Council to give assistance to the council in Strabane to alleviate their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Harte rightly pointed out, this is a very serious situation where people in County Donegal cannot go <Col N="1283" /> about their business.  We experienced one of the worst summers in Donegal in recent times despite the fact that the rest of the country had good weather.  Unfortunately, it was impossible to effect improvements to the roads over the summer months because of the bad weather.  There is a daunting task facing the engineers because of the havoc brought about by the severe flooding last night.  This has been aggravated by the fact that along the Swilly Estuary a lot of the land and road structure is dependent on the release of water into the Swilly through the pumping and canal systems which were built over 150 years ago. These systems could not contain the water because of high tides and this has also created serious problems.  The Inishowen Peninsula has sustained severe damage in relation to many of the roads and bridges.  As Deputy Harte said, the Government should send the Minister of State or a Departmental inspector to assess the difficulties which now confront local authorities in the area.  Unless special consideration is given, much of the money which has been spent on works carried out over the last year or so will be of no avail.  In the special circumstances which prevail I appeal to the Minister to look at the matter and ensure that any and every assistance that can be given will be forthcoming to Donegal County Council and the engineering staff to alleviate the serious problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with what has been said in the House today.  The destruction of the road structure is most severe.  The area that has had such severe gales is not in my constituency.  The only major problem that has arisen there is in relation to the Bord na Móna bog in Glenties where 1,000 tonnes of turf have been cut and are now lost at a cost of some £50,000 which is devastating for Bord na Móna in Glenties.  Therefore, I appeal to the <Col N="1284" /> Minister to look into the matter in relation to helping Bord na Móna in this area.  I ask, too, that a special subvention be given to Donegal County Council to help them to resurface many of the county roads and minor roads that were damaged by the flooding last weekend.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputies Harte, Coughlan and Conaghan for their contributions. Let me join them in their expressions of sympathy to the people who have been affected and, in particular, to the people of the town of Strabane.  We saw this evening what the flooding was like there. We find it difficult to comprehend the damage done.  I would like to place on record, as Deputy Conaghan suggested, that the county manager stated he has made an offer of engineering assistance to Strabane Council and that we are all happy the manager felt he should make that offer.</P>
      <P>The local authorities as yet have not been in touch with the Department of the Environment in relation to any of the happenings that have been described here.  I accept what Deputy Harte, Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Conaghan said.  Our information is that the main problem seems to have been in the Inishowen Penninsula.  The fire brigades in Letterkenny, Stranorlar, Moville, Carndonagh and Buncrana answered calls and assisted in the pumping out of the flooding in houses and premises during the night.  The county fire officer and two of his assistants were on standby all night.</P>
      <P>As I said, we have no definite information as to what damage has been done. Donegal County Council will be in touch with the Department of the Environment and will monitor all the damage.  I will ask the Department to send an engineer to the county to help the county council in the monitoring and assessing of whatever damage has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of roads, unfortunately the Department have no <Col N="1285" /> responsibility for any lanes, as the Deputies know.  However, works could be carried out under the local improvements scheme provided these roads serve two or more people.  There is no statutory authority on the State to contribute to the cost except in the context of the local improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>The problem as far as we in the Department are concerned is that we have no definite information.  It is probably too soon yet for the whole picture to emerge but from what the Deputies have said it is obvious there has been a considerable amount of damage.  All I can guarantee is that the damage will be monitored and the Department will be in touch with Donegal County Council to see exactly what the damage is and what it will amount to.  The Minister for the Environment will then make any decision in relation to what can be done.</P>
    <P>We have no evidence at all from Donegal County Council that any serious damage has occurred.  However, I accept that the Deputies have been in touch with the local areas and from my experience of situations like this I know the local people would have been in touch with their Deputies in relation to what happened last night and today.  I can give the Deputies no guarantee at all as to what can be done.  A decision can be made <Col N="1286" /> only when the Department have a definite assessment of the damage and we will be able to assess then what help may or may not be given.</P>
    <P>In the first instance much of the responsibility is that of the local authority but I accept the statement that the county council may have some difficulty in carrying out the repairs.  We will be in touch with them tomorrow or very early next week.  I will bring the Deputies' statements to the Minister's attention and once the situation is assessed it will be a matter of consultation between the council and the Department.</P>

      <P>As regards the amount of debt in January of each of the next three years, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> does not contain projections for the level of debt on those dates nor is any specific year by year timepath for the evolution of the debt implied by the programme. The trend in debt will depend, <i>inter alia,</i> on the specific budget targets to be set in due course for each of the years concerned. These targets will be set by reference to the objective of stabilising the national debt/gross national product ratio during the course of the programme.  This will involve reducing Exchequer borrowing requirement to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP, depending on developments in economic growth and interest rates.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if indirect tax levels will be harmonised in member states in 1992, in line with the Commission intentions; and if he will indicate the likely gains and losses for the Irish Exchequer under each <Col N="1125" /> tax heading, if harmonisation at present average EC tax levels were achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>1992 is the target date proposed in the European Commission's proposals for harmonisation of indirect taxes which were recently made public.  These proposals are currently being examined by member states of the Community and have yet to be discussed by the Council of Ministers.  Considerable discussion and negotiation may be anticipated before the proposals are adopted finally.  It is not possible to indicate at this stage the likely outcome of this discussion and whether the target date for implementation will be adhered to.</P>
      <P>An indication of likely gains and losses under specific headings could prove misleading as, particularly in relation to VAT, there is a wide range of possible options open to member states. However, a preliminary assessment suggests that implementation of the Commission proposals as they stand would result in a substantial revenue loss to the Exchequer of the order of £350 million, excluding the once off revenue loss arising from the abolition of VAT at point of entry (estimated at £120 million). The revenue loss would arise principally on excise duties.</P>
      <P>While the Government are generally in favour of the principle of harmonisation, it is clear that a loss of the order mentioned would have very serious consequences for the Exchequer and that some means of compensation for such a loss would have to be found.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the Commission proposals are simply the starting point for detailed negotiations among member states and that the final arrangements may turn out to be quite different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>As regards means tests operated by the Department of Finance, the facts are as follows:</P>
      <P> 1. An income threshold may be applied under section 8 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 &mdash; (retiring age for civil servants)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a), (h) a maximum income level of £50 a week applies for a person <Col N="1127" /> with no dependants plus £23 a week for a spouse;</P>
    <P>(b) yes; a spouse's income from all public funds is taken into account;</P>
    <P>(c) no;</P>
    <P>(d) yes;</P>
    <P>(e) the imputed value of home ownership is ignored;</P>
    <P>(f) no;</P>
    <P>(g) July 1985; the levels are not formally index-linked;</P>
    <P>2. Under the Civil Service Spouses' and Children's Pensions Scheme (and corresponding schemes elsewhere in the public sector), a pension may be paid in respect of a child under age 21 who is in full-time instruction or training for a vocation, profession or trade.  However eligibility for pension ceases if the child is in receipt of payment from his employer during the training period, sufficient to make him self-supporting.  The income limit applied in practice for the purposes of this rule is the maximum personal rate of contributory old age pension (currently £55.10 p.w.).</P>
    <P>3. As regards taxation matters, the Revenue Commissioners have advised that, as the provision of the information requested would require detailed examination of a large number of provisions of the various taxing statutes, it would not be feasible in the time available to supply the details sought by the Deputy.  If he would repeat the questions in two weeks any available information on the lines requested will be provided.  </P>
    <P>No other &ldquo;means test&rdquo; is administered by the Department or by any of the Offices under the aegis of the Minister for Finance (with the exception of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as indicated above).</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that £2 million health contributions has been collected from farmers in respect of the period from 1984 to date.</P>
      <P>The total amount of health contributions outstanding from farmers in respect of that period is £9 million.  On the basis of previous experience this amount will be subject to downward revision on closer examination, on appeal, and for various other reasons. The Revenue Commissioners estimate that as a result of these factors it is likely that the further amount to be collected for that period will be £1.3 million.</P>
      <P>The arrears of the health contributions represent only a tiny fraction of the arrears which arise in the collection process under all tax heads.  Available resources have had to be deployed in the enforcement of much larger sums of tax outstanding.  However, every effort will be made within the constraints of the available resources to enforce collection of the outstanding health contributions.</P>

    <P>Directors' fees have been increased since they were first set.  The last two occasions on which there was a general increase in directors' fees were in 1964 and in 1974.  In 1964 there was an increase of 25 per cent in all directors' fees under £500 p.a. subject to the increased fee not exceeding £500 p.a.  Fees at or above £500 p.a. were not increased.  This revision did not result in an increase in the levels of directors' fees payable in respect of bodies under my aegis.  In 1974 there was a 60 per cent increase in all directors' fees.  This increase was based on movements in fees for directors of private sector firms.  There has been no increase in fees since 1974.</P>

The present (1987) cost of public service pensions is estimated at £191 million.</P>
      <P>The recently announced voluntary redundancy measures to apply in the public service will naturally lead to an increase in pension costs.

      <P>The levels of remuneration of the non-executive directors of State companies under the aegis of my Department were first set when these bodies were established.</P>
      <P>These fees have been increased since they were first set.  The last two occasions on which there was a general increase in directors' fees were in 1964 and in 1974. In 1964 there was an increase of 25 per cent in all directors' fees under £500 per annum subject to the increased fee not exceeding £500 per annum.  Fees at or above £500 per annum were not increased.  In 1974 there was a 60 per cent increase in all directors' fees.  This increase was based on movements in fees for directors of private sector firms. There has been no increase in fees since 1974.</P>
      <P>The level of remuneration originally set for the non-executive directors of State bodies under the aegis of my Department, the year such fees were first set, and the current level of such fees is as follows:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a British study <i>The Reform of Social Security</i> by Dilnot, Kay and Morris, published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, page 44, estimated that the administrative cost of operating the means test for supplementary benefit was 10 pence for every pound paid out; the calculations, if any, he has done in respect of each of the means tested schemes or income thresholds operated by his Department or by agencies under his aegis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study referred to by the Deputy was a critique of the British tax and social security systems and the interaction between the two systems as they affect individuals.  It was argued that the existing systems represent an inefficient use of resources and the cost of administering the supplementary benefit scheme was quoted in support of this. The 10 per cent figure referred to represents not only the cost of means testing as such but the overall cost of administering the scheme.</P>
      <P>Administration costs overall represent around 4 per cent of total social welfare expenditure. A breakdown of those costs into amounts appropriate to different schemes is not available.  However a review of administration costs is being undertaken within the Department with a view to providing a more efficient and cost-effective system.  All aspects of administration are being taken into consideration in the context of this review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare operate means tests/income thresholds to determine eligibility and amount of the entitlement under the following schemes:</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance, widow's (non-contributory) pension, orphan's (non-contributory) allowance, social assistance allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women aged from 58 to 66, old age pension, blind pension, family income supplement and rent allowance for tenants affected by the decontrol of rents.</P>
      <P>The health boards operate a means test in respect of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which they administer under the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Welfare. They also operate means-tests under the national fuel scheme for applicants who have not been means-tested already under other social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>All the schemes, with the exception of the rent allowance and national fuel schemes, are provided for in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1981, as amended by subsequent Social Welfare Acts, which contains the rules as to calculation of means: see section 146 (unemployment assistance), section 210 (supplementary welfare allowance) and Third Schedule &mdash; rules as to calculation of means (other schemes).  The upper means limit for payments under these schemes is related to the level of social welfare payments, which are increased annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rent allowance for tenants affected by decontrol of rents, and the relevant <Col N="1144" /> rules for the assessment of means, are provided for in the Social Welfare (Rent Allowance) Regulations, 1982 (SI No. 220 of 1982). The income level at which the maximum allowance is payable is adjusted by amending regulations to take account of general increases in social welfare payments: the relevant Statutory Instruments are Numbers 186/83, 171/84, 236/85, 218/86 and 152/87.</P>
    <P>The national fuel scheme is a non-statutory one which is targeted at certain categories of persons who are receiving social welfare payments and have no other significant income and persons over 66 years of age who, while not receiving a social welfare payment, have a corresponding level of income.  Applicants under the scheme who are receiving payments which are not subject to a means test already are means tested to establish if they meet the criteria mentioned; those receiving means-tested payments are accepted as meeting the means criteria of the Scheme.</P>
    <P>Pay-Related Benefit Ceiling</P>
    <P>Section 73 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides for a limit to be prescribed to the reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year to be taken into account in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable. The ceiling, which currently stands at £220 a week, was last increased in 1983 by the Social Welfare (Pay Related Benefit) (Amendment) Regulations 1983 (SI 92/83).</P>
    <P>Benefit Limits</P>
    <P>The combined total of flat rate benefit and pay-related benefit payable in any case is subject to a limitation of 85 per cent of current net weekly earnings in the case of unemployment benefit claimants and 75 per cent of gross reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year for disability benefit claimants.  These limits are prescribed in the Social Welfare (Pay Related Benefit) Regulations, 1979 (SI 141/79) as amended by the Social Welfare (Amendment of Miscellaneous Social Insurance Provisions) Regulations, 1984 (SI 90/84).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> Pay-Related Social Insurance Contribution Ceiling</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides for the payment of pay-related social insurance contributions by employed contributors and their employers.  It also provides that such contributions are not payable on earnings above a certain level which, in accordance with section 5 of the Social Welfare Act, 1987, stands at £15,500 since April 1987.</P>
    <P>The following additional information applies to unemployment assistance:</P>
    <P> (a) Means vary according to the circumstances of the applicant and household and the period is the succeeding year or the previous year;</P>
    <P>(b) Yes, in accordance with the provisions of section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which set down the rules for the calculation of means;</P>
    <P>(c) Yes, in accordance with section 146 (e) when assessing the value of benefit and privilege;</P>
    <P>(d) No, but if UA/UB is paid then allowances are also paid for dependent children;</P>
    <P>(e) Social welfare payments are not taken into account and neither is the value of home ownership personally used;</P>
    <P>(f) Yes, in accordance with section 146 (c);</P>
    <P>(g) Means are subject to review and such review would reflect the current position;</P>
    <P>(h) Payments provide for aggregate needs of married couples and account is taken of aggregate means in these cases.  In the case of an unmarried couple who are living together, in assessing the means of the applicant, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him or her from any source, including the person he or she is living with, is taken into account. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> Income Thresholds</P>
    <P>On the implementation, in November 1986, of the equal treatment provisions contained in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, a limit of £50 a week was set in the case of a spouse's income for the purposes of determining adult dependancy &mdash; see SI 369/86.</P>
    <P>Regulations made under Section 29 (5) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 provide for a person engaged in subsidiary occupation to be treated as unemployed if his earnings or profit from this occupation do not exceed £4 a day. This rate was set in July 1986.</P>
    <P>Section 73 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 as amended by section 7 of the Social Welfare Act, 1987 provides for the payment of pay-related benefit where earnings exceed £62 a week.  This weekly earnings figure has been revised annually in recent years.</P>
    <P>The following additional information applies to old age (non-contributory) pensions:</P>
    <P> (a) the upper means limit for eligibility, subject to (d), is £50 weekly; the income assessed is normally that which may reasonably be expected to be received in the year following the date of calculation</P>
    <P>(b) yes; the applicant's means are taken to be one half of the total means of the couple</P>
    <P>(c) no</P>
    <P>(d) an increase of pension is payable, and in certain circumstances the upper means limit may be extended, in respect of a dependent child</P>
    <P>(e) income from a number of sources, including social welfare payments in general, is disregarded as is the value of a dwelling owned and occupied</P>
    <P>(f) means derived from property are calculated on the basis of the capital value of the property in accordance with the method set out in the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981</P>
    <P>(g) July, 1987</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> (h) persons living together but unmarried are treated as single individuals.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The following additional information applies to the non-contributory schemes for widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives:</P>
    <P> (a) the upper means limit for eligibility, subject to (d), is £50 weekly; the income assessed is normally that which may reasonably be expected to be received in the year following the date of calculation</P>
    <P>(b) No. By definition, there is either no spouse on these schemes or, where there is a spouse, he is not contributing substantially to the claimant's support.</P>
    <P>(c) no</P>
    <P>(d) An increase is payable, and in certain circumstances the upper means limit may be extended, in respect of a dependent child</P>
    <P>(e) Income from a number of sources, including social welfare payments in general, is disregarded as is the value of a dwelling owned and occupied</P>
    <P>(f) Means derived from property are calculated on the basis of the capital value of the property in accordance with the method set out in the Department's booklet SW4</P>
    <P>(g) July, 1987</P>
    <P>(h) Not relevant to these schemes. If the claimant is cohabitating, this disqualifies her under the schemes. </P>
    <P>The following additional information applies to the scheme for single women aged from 58 to 66:</P>
    <P> (a) Means vary according to the circumstances of the applicant and household and the period is the succeeding year or the previous year</P>
    <P>(b) By definition, there is no spouse in these cases</P>
    <P>(c) Yes, in accordance with section <Col N="1148" /> 146 (e) when assessing the value of benefit and privilege</P>
    <P>(d) These claimants would not have dependent children</P>
    <P>(e) Social welfare payments are not taken into account and neither is the value of home ownership personally used</P>
    <P>(f) Yes, in accordance with section 146 (c)</P>
    <P>(g) Means are subject to review and such review would reflect the current position</P>
    <P>(h) Not relevant to this scheme.  If the claimant is cohabitating, this disqualifies her under the scheme. </P>
    <P>The following additional information applies to supplementarty welfare allowance:</P>
    <P> (a) Any means up to a ceiling equal to the maximum rate appropriate to the person's family circumstances are relevant for SWA purposes.  In keeping with the short-term and emergency nature of the scheme, current means are assessed.</P>
    <P>(b) Income of a spouse is assessed in the same way as the income of the claimant</P>
    <P>(c) The net profit on contributions received by a head of household from other members is assessed.  In the case of a person who is a member of a household, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed, such as free board and lodging, is factually assessed</P>
    <P>(d) Rates of weekly payments etc. correspond to family sizes</P>
    <P>(e) Property, personally used or enjoyed, is not assessed; neither are child benefit payments and domiciliary care allowances for handicapped children</P>
    <P>(f) The value of property not personally used or enjoyed is assessed. The capital value of any such property, including savings and investments, is  <Col N="1149" /> accorded a weekly value under the statutory rules for calculating means</P>
    <P> (g) means limits are related to the rates of payment and rise in step with increases in rates of payment</P>
    <P>(h) Payments provided for aggregated needs of married couples and account is taken of aggregated means in these cases. In the case of unmarried persons living together, each would be assessed in his or her own right as would, for example, any profit derived from contributions made in respect of board and lodgings by either party. In the case of rent supplements payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, members of the household are expected to contribute to rent according to their financial circumstances and such contributions, whether actual or imputed, are assessed.</P>
    <P>The following additional information applies to family income supplement:</P>
    <P> (a) Thresholds depend on numbers of qualified children, for example £104 a week for a one child family and rising by steps of £22 a week to £192 a week for a five child family, which is the maximum covered.  Income for the previous six weeks (weekly paid) or two months (monthly paid) is taken into account</P>
    <P>(b) Yes; the procedure is the same for both partners.</P>
    <P>(c) The net profit on contributions received by a head of household from other members is assessed</P>
    <P>(d) Account is taken of dependent children (maximum five) in the threshold steps</P>
    <P>(e) Yes; the disregards are specified in article 4 of the Social Welfare (Family Income Supplement) Regulations, 1984</P>
    <P>(f) No</P>
    <P>(g) 23 July 1987</P>
    <P>(h) Yes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> The following additional information applies to rent allowance for tenants affected by decontrol of rents:</P>
    <P> (a) Thresholds for maximum allowances are £96 a week for married couples; £55 a week for single or widowed persons.  The income assessed is normally that which may reasonably be expected to be received in the succeeding 12 months</P>
    <P>(b) Yes; the procedure is the same for both partners</P>
    <P>(c) Members of the household are expected to contribute to rent according to their financial circumstances and such contributions, whether actual or imputed, are assessed</P>
    <P>(d) Yes, the threshold rises for each dependent child</P>
    <P>(e) Disregards are specified in article 6 of the Social Welfare (Rent Allowance) Regulations, 1982</P>
    <P>(f) The value of property not personally used or enjoyed is assessed. The capital value of any such property, including savings and investments, is accorded a weekly value under the statutory rules for calculating means contained in the article referred to in (e)</P>
    <P>(g) 16 July 1987</P>
    <P>(h) Yes, an unmarried tenant would be treated as an applicant who was single and the other person would be required to contribute to the rent as in (c) above.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy requires further information on these subjects, the Department will make it available to him.</P>

    <P>Note 1: The allowance for children applies to every child under 16 years of age or who being over 16 but under 21 is attending a full time course of education and is wholly maintained by the tenant.</P>
    <P>Note 2: The principal earners allowance will be doubled in the case of old age pensioners, deserted wives, (receiving deserted wives' allowance only), widow (receiving widow's pension only) and social assistance recipient.</P>
    <P>(b) One-seventh of the basic income of a subsidiary family earner (which could be a spouse) which exceeds £1,671 per annum and, does not exceed £3,380 per annum i.e. a maximum of £1,709 is taken into consideration in arriving at family assessable income.</P>
    <P>(c) Account may be taken of the income of household members other than spouses as described at (b) above.</P>
    <P>(d) Account is taken of the costs of maintaining children. An allowance of £120 per child is deducted from family assessable income as outlined in (a) above.</P>
    <P>(e) Social welfare payments are taken into consideration in arriving at family assessable income.  As the scheme is aimed at people who require rented accommodation because they do not have their own accommodation, home ownership is unlikely to arise.</P>
    <P>(f) The value of property, real or personal is not taken into consideration in calculating the graded rent.</P>
    <P>(g) The income threshold levels and allowance are revised annually in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>(h) The income threshold operation does not distinguish between married and unmarried couples.  With regard to your question in relation to the British study</P>

      <i>The Reform of Social Security,</i> I was not aware of the results thereof.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the specific administrative cost of operating SFADCo's graded rent scheme. However it must be remembered that the scheme operates on the principle of social equity and is similar in most details to the differential rent scheme operated by local authorities throughout the country.</P>

    <P>Note: There have been two general increases on the remuneration of non-executive directors.  The first was in 1964 when a 25 per cent increase was given in respect of fees less than £500 p.a. subject to a ceiling of £500 p.m.  The second increase was in 1974 when a 60 per cent increase was granted.  This was based on the level of fees being paid to Directors in the private sector.</P>

      <P>The main conclusions of the Jakobsen report in regard to the pricing of privately generated electricity are that such schemes should be countenanced only to the extent that they would have the effect of lowering the costs to the consumer, that the consumer and the ESB should be neutral in relation to private generation and that the ESB should not abuse their monopoly position.  I am in full agreement with these conclusions.</P>

    <P>The last two occasions on which there were general revisions in the above fees was in 1964 and 1974. In 1964 all fees under £500 per annum were increased by 25 per cent subject to the increased fees not exceeding £500. In 1974, there was a 60 per cent increase, based on movements in the fees of private sector directors. There have been no increases since 1974.</P>
    <P>No remuneration is paid to some directors who are civil servants and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation has one non-resident specially qualified director who is paid at a higher level.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a British study <i>The Reform of Social Security</i> by Dilnot, Kay and Morris, published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, page 44, estimated that the administrative cost of operating the means test for supplementary benefit was 10 pence for every pound paid out; the calculations, if any, he has done in respect of each of the means tested schemes or income threshold operated by his Department or by agencies under his aegis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he, or any body under his aegis, operates means tests or income thresholds for any purpose, for example tax exemption, eligibility for charge or benefit; in respect of such means test or income thresholds (a) the levels at which they operate and the period over which they are assessed; (b) if account is taken of the income of a spouse, and if so, the way in which this <Col N="1176" /> has been done; (c) if account is taken of the income of other household members; and if so, the way in which this has been done; (d) if account is taken of the costs of maintaining dependent children or other dependants; (e) if any income for example social welfare payments, or the imputed value of home ownership is ignored or discounted in any way; (f) if the value of property, real or personal, is included and if so, the basis on which it is included; (g) when the levels were last revised in line with inflation; and (h) if there is a distinction in the way the means test operates between a couple who are married and a couple living together but not married.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for housing loans from local authorities is subject to the income of the applicant or that of his/her spouse &mdash; whichever is the greater &mdash; not exceeding £10,000 in the preceding tax year.  The limit of £10,000 has applied since mid-1986 in the case of annuity and convertible loans and since April 1983 in the case of income related loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Criteria for determining entitlement to local authority houses, assessing differential rents and waiving service charges are set by individual local authorities and may vary from one authority to another.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the services involved, which do not involve a direct payment of benefit to an applicant, it would not be practicable to establish a relationship between the costs and benefits arising from the operation of income limits and an assessment of the services in this way has not, therefore, been done.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85, 87, 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>These grants were allocated on 9 March, 1987 but were withdrawn shortly afterwards, along with all other amenity grant allocations, so as to permit a review of the grants scheme in the light of the budgetary position.  Following the review, fresh allocations were made but the projects referred to in the questions were not among those assisted from the reduced provision of £4 million available.</P>
      <P>I might add that, in the original allocations, the Dublin area was to receive a total of £4,186,000 or 70 per cent of the available funds while 12 counties received no allocation at all.  A more equitable arrangement was achieved in the revised allocations: All areas received some funding while Dublin's share at £1,967,000 or 49 per cent of the available funds, was still maintained at a high level.</P>

      <P> 1.  Of the various agencies under my control, fees are payable to board members (non-executive directors) in only two instances &mdash; The Voluntary Health Insurance Board and An Bord Uchtála (The Adoption Board).</P>

      <P>2.  The revision of these fees is undertaken from time to time by the Government.  There have been two increases in the level of fees payable. In 1964 an increase of 25 per cent was applied in instances where fees were less than £500 per annum.  Where fees payable exceeded that amount, no increase was applied.  In 1974 an increase of 60 per cent was applied to all fees payable.  This increase was based on the movement in the level of fees payable in the private sector.</P>

      <P>The staffing level at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, as at September 1987 was 794 compared to 818 in July 1986.  In the same period the in-patient population in St. Ita's was reduced from 871 to 834.  The main change in working conditions at St. Ita's Hospital, related to the reduction in staffing levels as indicated which was in line with the overall reduction throughout the Eastern Health Board service generally together with the implementation of revised duty rosters which eliminated rostered overtime on both day and night duty.  The Eastern Health Board is satisfied that it is providing an appropriate service at St. Ita's Hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These allowances are additional to the <Col N="1192" /> normal social welfare benefits and are intended for the needy.  A means test is therefore essential to ensure that the maximum benefit is channelled to those whose need is greatest.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> A means test is included in the scheme of special allowances for veterans of the War of Independence and allowances for widows of service (1917-1921) medal holders.</P>
      <P>A special allowance is an annual sum of such amount as when added to the applicant's yearly means will not equal or exceed a prescribed sum.  Yearly means in the context include the means of the applicant's spouse.  The value of assessable means is based on reports furnished by social welfare officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test for these allowances has been relaxed progressively over the years and is now far from severe.  Social <Col N="1193" /> welfare benefits are only partially assessed as means and budgetary increases in those benefits are either substantially or entirely disregarded.</P>
    <P>Items assessed as means include:</P>
    <P> (1) the yearly value of a plot, or farm. In assessing the value of a holding, the social welfare officer makes allowance for all outgoings, including annuity, rates, seeds, fertilisers, labour and stock. Generally assessments are low;</P>
    <P>(2) the yearly value of capital &mdash; the first £200 being disregarded, the next £375 taken at 5 per cent and the remainder at 10 per cent;</P>
    <P>(3) the amount of wages, superannuation, profit from business or other cash income;</P>
    <P>(4) one-half of the amount of disability benefit payable under the Social Welfare Acts as at the 5 January, 1969.  All increases granted from the 6 January 1969 are disregarded;</P>
    <P>(5) a nominal amount in respect of various pensions and allowances for invalidity, and retirement pension, old age and blind pensions, widow's pensions, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance;</P>
    <P>(6) the amount exceeding £30 of a military service pension or a disability or wound pension or a combination of such pensions as at October 1964.  The increases granted in such pensions since 1 August 1965 are not taken into account.  The amount exceeding £30 of one-half of the 1 October 1964 rate of pension is assessed in the case of an allowance payable to a widow/widower of a military service pensioner;</P>
    <P>(7) the profit from the weekly contributions of members of a family over 18 years who are living at home; the amount contributed for <Col N="1194" /> board and lodging is not assessed. (A nominal allowance of £12 a year in respect of each child under the age of 18 years or over that age if incapable of self-support, is included in the prescribed sum.);</P>
    <P>(8) the value of free maintenance, to the extent to which it does not impose a hardship on the provider, and the value of earned maintenance whichever is the higher; the maximum assessment for a spouse's maintenance is £104 per annum;</P>
    <P>(9) the yearly value of free lodging or a house free of rent, which is taken at £2.60 per annum in the case of an individual and at £5.20 per annum in the case of a married couple.</P>
    <P>Awards of these allowances are made for a period of four years.  During that period, the allowance is not reviewed by my Department regardless of any improvement in the applicant's means. However, the allowance holder is entitled to seek a revision of his allowance at any time during the currency of the award if his means have worsened, in which event his case would again be investigated by a social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>A minimum figure of £185.00 per annum was determined in 1980 for persons who qualify on means for a special allowance.  The current rate is £435.  This is also the minimum rate paid to widows of medal holders.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made in the scheme to cover the case of a couple living together but not married.</P>
    <P>The only other area in which a means test is applied by my Department is that relating to the extension of service beyond the normal retiring age in the case of certain employees on grounds of hardship.  I understand that particulars of the relevant amounts which apply to Departments generally are being furnished to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>No body under the aegis of my Department operates a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of standardised tests, diagnostic or otherwise, is not formalised in our primary schools.  Children who are demonstrating signs of serious learning disabilities are referred for assessment to clinics administered by the health boards. These referrals are often initiated by routine school medical examinations and it is now normal practice to report back to the schools on any areas which have a bearing on the child's education.</P>
      <P>Remedial teachers use standardised diagnostic tests as a matter of course when children are first referred and at regular intervals thereafter.  The results of such tests are made known to principal teachers and class teachers as appropriate. All remedial teachers receive training in the administration and interpretation of these tests.  For the past number of years, in-service courses have been held at a number of venues for teachers of small schools which do not have the services of a full time remedial teacher.  These courses include familiarisation with the use of diagnostic tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers generally use informal methods of diagnosing particular characteristics of children's learning. Both pre-service and in-service courses for teachers highlight the importance of observing children's learning strategies <Col N="1197" /> by analysis of errors and by the use of techniques such as cloze procedure.  It is felt that such techniques are more appropriate in the generality of cases than the use of standardised measures.  Information based on these observations is shared with principal teachers and other class teachers.  When more serious problems arise children are referred for more sophisticated testing as outlined above.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the Dublin VEC has withdrawn funding from the final year dental technician's course, while students are being taken on at first year elsewhere; <Col N="1200" /> the way in which she expects dental technicians to complete their course, in these circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the College of Technology, Kevin Street, in consultation with the City of Dublin VEC decided, in the light of financial circumstances and because of the very small numbers of students in the class groups concerned, that the course for dental craft apprentices would be discontinued as and from the 1987-88 session.  The particular City and Guilds examination for which the course is designed is, in any event, scheduled to be phased out with the last intermediate examination being held in 1988 and the last final examination being held in 1990.  I understand from the College, however, that provision is being made to allow existing apprentices to complete the course in question.</P>
      <P>Cork Dental Hospital also provide a course for first year dental craft apprentices.</P>
      <P>The Dentists Act 1985 provides that the Dental Council may establish classes of auxiliary dental workers and determine the training and qualifications necessary to become a member of any particular class of auxiliary dental worker.  I am advised that the council are at present considering the determination of training requirements prior to establishing a class of dental technicians.</P>
