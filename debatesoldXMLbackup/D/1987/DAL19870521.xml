    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an adequate opportunity over the past two days for all sides of this House to dwell on the past in relation to health policy and the current budgetary difficulties faced by the health services. The Dáil in the votes last night has accepted that the financial parameters within which the health services must <Col N="2617" /> operate this year should not be altered. The health boards and other health agencies have been notified of their allocations and in the first place they must ordain their affairs to live within those allocations. All but two of the health boards have drawn up their plans to live within those allocations and I would hope that those two, the Western and the Mid-Western Health Boards from whom I met representative deputations yesterday will now draw up their plans to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Senior officers of my Department have met with all boards and agencies in the past fortnight and with the submission of the two outstanding plans they will be enabled to complete their global analysis of what is proposed.  They will be able to determine both the reality of what is proposed and proceed to the rationalisation and integration of the plans to ensure that the services available locally, regionally and nationally are capable of meeting the essential needs of the Irish people.  I emphasise it is the fundamental responsibility of the health boards, with their local knowledge, to produce a plan to live within their allocation.</P>
      <P>It is high time we raised our sights beyond the immediate difficulties and gave some serious thought to the steps needed to move the Irish health system from the position in which it now finds itself to the type of system we would like to see developed, and which we need to develop, in the future.</P>
      <P>Of course, the present financial constraints make any form of developmental thinking difficult and they cannot simply be wished away.  However, financial problems are not an excuse for doing nothing other than compressing the existing system.  If anything, the financial constraints within which health services will have to be provided for the foreseeable future underline the urgent need to think afresh about the whole approach to health policy and to question in an open and unrestricted way the assumptions which underlie the health system as it currently operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined, in the course of the past two days, some of the main elements of the change now needed in <Col N="2618" /> the health system.  They include a review of the funding arrangements; the rationalisation of the acute hospital system; the development of primary health care services; the development of health promotion and preventive services; and an improvement in managerial arrangements at all levels in the system.</P>
    <P>The funding question is of fundamental importance and is closely related to other policy issues such as the nature of the health system we want in terms of &ldquo;demand lead&rdquo; or &ldquo;supply constrained&rdquo; and the distribution of available resources towards high priority services and high risk groups in the population. The choices facing us in this regard have wide implications and it is of crucial importance that decisions are made on the basis of a sound analysis which draws on the best expertise available.</P>
    <P>The phasing out of the contribution from local revenue sources towards funding the health services over the period 1973-1976 had the effect of shifting virtually the entire burden to central taxation. The current concern to contain the volume of health spending reflects the broadly acknowledged need to redress the imbalance in the public finances by placing limits on the volume of public spending generally.  Obviously, major spending areas such as the health services come under particular scrutiny in these circumstances and, given the scale of the adjustment to be made in public spending, the constraints applying in 1987 are likely to be a continuing feature of health service provision, if funding remains almost entirely reliant on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to consider other options for funding the health services or contributing towards the cost of particular services.  The pressure on Exchequer support for health services should not rule out a modest growth in health spending, even if that growth can be funded from other sources.</P>
    <P>In speaking of growth, I am not suggesting that we return to an era of unbridled growth in health spending. Apart from the concern about public expenditure on health services, any unreasonable growth in total spending on <Col N="2619" /> the health services would also be a matter for concern.  It may be appropriate to agree on some guidelines, expressed, for example, as a proportion of gross national product, which would define the parameters of total health spending and within which the contribution from the Exchequer and other sources could be determined.</P>
    <P>Apart from the overall size of the allocation of public funds for health services, the distribution of that resource also needs examination, bearing in mind the service priorities which have been articulated for many years and the particular onus to protect and provide for those most in need of health care and least able to afford it from their own resources.</P>
    <P>These are some of the issues which I expect will be addressed by the Review Group on Funding the Health Services, the establishment of which I announced on Tuesday last.  I will be asking this review group to report to me as soon as possible and I see their report as one of the basic elements in framing future health policy.</P>
    <P>There will also be a concentration upon value for money.  I have set up a special cost containment and efficiency unit in the Department to provide a support service to all health agencies to seek to make savings through efficiency improvements. The purchasing of supplies is clearly one area upon which they will concentrate.</P>
    <P>I have already announced a review of the acute hospital system, the progress of which will now be accelerated.  The purpose of this review, which will reach conclusions within a matter of months, is to identify precisely the adjustments now needed to adapt the acute hospital system to present requirements.  The acute hospitals represent the single largest care programme in terms of the amount of resources they absorb.  Therefore, they must be a particular target of scrutiny in attempting to reconcile the size and nature of the health care system with the level of resources now available for health services.  It is beyond doubt that the outcome of this exercise will involve <Col N="2620" /> the phasing out of a significant number of beds from the acute hospital system. The proposals developed in this regard will provide a good litmus test as to how genuine are the motives of those in this House who have repeatedly criticised the inefficiency of the health system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>A particular concern in health policy internationally is the diffusion of and growth in high technology medicine.  This concern is rooted in the belief that high technology medicine has played a significant role in the escalation of health care costs in recent decades. Health policy internationally now favours a more critical and cautious approach to further diffusion and development in this area.</P>
      <P>This is an issue which will be explicitly addressed in the review of acute hospital services, which I announced in the Dáil on Tuesday night.  The review will be a comprehensive consultative process at local health board level and will involve the boards, the voluntary hospitals and the staff interests concerned.  My Department will collate the work nationally and a definitive plan for the hospital services will be drawn up following a national conference in July.  The review will also consider particularly the distribution of the higher specialties, like cardiac surgery and organ transplants and specialised treatment units, such as the bone marrow transplant unit in St. James' Hospital and the sexual assault treatment unit in the Rotunda Hospital.  Decisions on such services will not be made in the context of short-term funding problems of individual hospitals but rather on the basis of an objective assessment of national needs and the most efficient way of meeting those needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One objective of that review will be to free resources which can be deployed to the development of a quality primary health care service.  The development of primary health care has been one of the most frequently announced objectives of health policy over many years.  While a certain amount of progress was made in the development of the community care programmes in the seventies, the limited extent of investment in these services <Col N="2622" /> belies the publicly proclaimed priority they were supposed to enjoy.  Despite the attempts made by the Department of Health over a number of years to ensure that community services were protected in implementing the cutbacks in health spending in each of those years, it is quite clear that individual health agencies did not totally comply with this guideline and that community services have suffered.</P>
    <P>The reality is that if we want to develop a quality primary health care system and reduce dependence on institutional care, resources will have to be set aside specifically for this purpose.  Obviously, in the current economic climate when no new money can be provided for this purpose, the necessary resources must be freed up within the system and within the total current spending level.  I recognise that the transition period, during which additional investment will be needed to strengthen primary care services before institutions can be phased out, will present difficulties and this is another area on which I will be seeking the advice of the review group on funding.</P>
    <P>The picture which has been painted therefore, of a health service which is in total decline is a totally false representation of the true position.  Certainly, change is necessary.  I can assure people that nobody will suffer unnecessarily or unduly as a result of the savings being effected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the Members of this House accept that savings have to be made.  I am satisfied that we are providing sufficient resources to ensure that proper and adequate services will be provided for all those who need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Change is necessary.  That change will involve a decline in some services and development in others.  Many objective commentators, looking at our health system, have concluded that it is overbedded and that the alternatives to institutional care are under-developed.  It is now time to redress that imbalance.  The <Col N="2623" /> working principle that now needs to be emphasised is that all health problems are dealt with at the lowest level of complexity in the system.  This is no more than good commonsense but it will also make for a more efficient system and a better use, overall, of resources.  It is also a more humane approach that people should be treated in their own community where possible rather than having to go into hospital where they very often feel vulnerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of primary health care, as an alternative to institutions, will also facilitate a more humane approach to patient care, resulting in a better quality of life particularly for the chronic sick.</P>
      <P>Specifically, we now need to give more attention to the development of general practitioner and community health nursing services and the broad range of other community based health and personal social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the former, while there remain a number of obstacles to be overcome, we have a clear idea of what now needs to be done in terms of developing the service.  A review of the community health nursing service has started and should lead to a set of planning guidelines for the development of this key service.  Similarly, other service reviews, either recently completed, as in the case of the psychiatric services, or currently in progress, as in the case of services for the elderly and the mentally handicapped, have adopted a perspective which seeks to maximise the potential of community based care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing a reasonable period of time for the completion of service reviews now in progress, we will shortly have up-to-date planning guidelines for virtually the <Col N="2624" /> whole spread of the health services, which take account of more recent social and demographic developments as well as changes in practice, and the overall budgetary constraint under which the health system will have to operate for the foreseeable future.  I see the combination of these various review exercises, coupled with the work of the review group on funding, as providing a firm foundation on which rational decisions can be made about the future allocation of resources in the health services.</P>
    <P>While this process will set short term decision making in the health area on a more rational footing, we also need to broaden our horizons somewhat, if we genuinely want to generate debate on health policy.  Our health policy must go further than simply deciding which of the curing and caring services get what level of available resources.  Even the most cursory analysis of recent epidemiological trends suggests that there is great potential in this country for a preventive health strategy in its broadest sense.</P>
    <P>The Irish health system has been likened to one which has as its objective the provision of an efficient health repair service rather than a system which promotes health in a positive way, a point which Senator Robb made very effectively in the Seanad last night.</P>
    <P>While undoubtedly there are significant elements of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention incorporated in our existing services &mdash; the vaccination and immunisation programmes are good examples &mdash; it is my view that there is a lot more we can do in the whole area of health promotion and prevention.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, we need to debate and clarify the divide in responsibilities for health.  While it seems reasonable that each individual should be prepared to accept personal responsibility to some extent for maintaining his or her health, how far should personal responsibility be expected to go and what should be the residual role of the wider community or the State in the protection and maintenance of health?</P>
    <P>Clearly, there are aspects of health <Col N="2625" /> promotion which, because of their wide implications, can only be effectively undertaken by the State, through public policy.  This leads on to the question of what priority should be accorded to health relative to other national objectives.</P>
    <P>Under present circumstances there may be a temptation to de-emphasise areas of public policy which do not immediately impact on economic growth and employment.  The counter argument is that in the medium term a healthier population may well be an economically more productive population and that the resources currently absorbed by the treatment of avoidable morbidity would be available for other uses.</P>
    <P>In arguing the case for health promotion, the most fundamental and immediate problem we face, therefore, is one of attitude.  In what might be termed our &ldquo;national value system&rdquo; we have not, as a community, tended to rate positive health as a high priority.  While the significant contribution of health to general wellbeing is frequently acknowledged we have not tended to reflect this strongly enough in the practical workings of everyday life.</P>
    <P>The question being posed is whether we are genuinely committed to maximising the contribution of positive health to human wellbeing.  The real extent of our commitment will be measured by the changes we are prepared to make in society towards that end.  Of course, this is not just a health sector problem.  Within the public domain, the policy issues extend across practically the entire spectrum of public policy.  Inevitably, the private sector &mdash; in industry, agriculture and the services sectors &mdash; will also have to be involved.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of a health promotion policy can only be realistically contemplated if there is a broad consensus across the community that it is worth the effort.  That is why it is so important to encourage informed public debate on the various issues involved.  That debate has been considerably assisted by the publication last December of the consultative statement on health policy &ldquo;Health &mdash;<Col N="2626" /> The Wider Dimensions&rdquo; and the health promotion report &ldquo;Promoting Health Through Public Policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some will find it convenient to argue that the whole notion of developing health promotion as a significant element of health policy is irrelevant to our immediate problems.  Taking a short-term perspective, this is probably valid. However, we have responsibilities beyond 1987 and 1988, and if there is a genuine concern to develop a health policy for the longer term, these are the issues we should be debating.</P>
    <P>This is not just an abstract concept. In my two months as Minister, I have introduced the AIDS information programme which is a very positive attempt to encourage people to be responsible in their sexual behaviour and in their approach to drug abuse.  I will soon be introducing a tobacco Bill which will control smoking in public places.  This Bill adds to the promotion and advertising controls on tobacco products which have been in place for some years.  I have set in motion the work necessary to develop a comprehensive strategy to take on the problem of excessive drinking and alcoholism in our society.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for managing the health services have become one of the standard targets of criticism in the current debate about the health system.  Unsubstantiated allegations about the cost of administration and management failures are made with abandon.  It is time that such loose allegations were challenged. While clerical and administrative staff account for about 10 per cent of all staff employed in the health services, in fact less than 2 per cent of the total staff are engaged in central administration.</P>
    <P>Neither was there any substance to the allegation that clerical and administrative staff were being specially protected against the effects of the embargo.  Given the facts, as distinct from these unsubstantiated and inaccurate allegations, I do not regard the administrative overheads in the health services as excessive. That is not to say that some improvements are not possible in the current <Col N="2627" /> organisational structure and we are looking carefully at this matter.  I have already stated in the House that many people working in administration, while they are not directly in the frontline, are essential to the delivery of a proper health care service.  I refer to persons such as community welfare officers, secretaries involved in making appointments and typing reports and many others.</P>
    <P>Over the last year or more there have been a lot of rumours floated about proposals for the reorganisation of the health boards.  These rumours varied from the total abolition of the boards, to a reduction in the number to five or three or one, to the transfer of their functions back to the local authorities.  It was stated that proposals were before Government and that in due course announcements would be made.  Because of the secrecy it was impossible to comment, let alone debate, the issues that might be involved.</P>
    <P>I have yet to be presented with clearcut evidence that would convince me that such a reduction is necessary.  I will retain that view until such evidence is presented to me.</P>

      <P>I have made no secret of my own confidence in the health board system as an appropriate model for the delivery of an efficient and responsive health service in this country.  My belief in the health boards stems from my own long membership experience which has given me an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of the current system.</P>
      <P>Much has changed since the boards were established in 1970.  The range, sophistication and cost of services has changed dramatically.  While earlier, the boards acted very much as development agencies, latterly, the nature of their role has of necessity moved in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every organisation needs an in-built monitoring and review mechanism so that, as circumstances and conditions change, its ability to effectively carry out <Col N="2628" /> its remit can be assessed and the necessary changes made.  It is now appropriate that such an assessment be carried out in relation to health boards.</P>
    <P>Basic aspects of this assessment, I believe, must include a renewed understanding of the service needs of the population, how these needs can best be met and the most efficient and effective organisation of the provision of the services. Within this, we must have an agreed assessment of the kind of health service we should aim for in the future. We must look at the existing statutory functions and responsibilities of health boards and agree where and to what extent these should be strengthened or changed.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to examine the management needs of health boards and the lines of demarcation between the management function and the functions of the health boards.  In addition, the relationship between both the management and health board functions and the Minister for Health and the Department of Health requires review.</P>
    <P>I would not make any assumptions about the outcome of this exercise.  I have my own views on areas which require examination and the direction which might be taken in resolving problems but, given the recent history, it is more important that the exercise be seen as a genuinely consultative and co-operative undertaking, rather than the imposition of decisions by diktat.</P>
    <P>The approach I propose is that a suitable area or areas should be identified which would be used as pilot sites for the development and testing of new organisational options.  The level of need for each service would be assessed, as would the service requirements to meet that level of need, and how best to organise the delivery of those services.  From this should emerage a clear picture of what requires to be done, who should do it and the relationships necessary between the various levels of responsibility.  New organisational structures could then be developed which could be tested, monitored and modified as appropriate.  The result would be that, rather than having <Col N="2629" /> untried, conceptual propositions for organisational development, there would be available options which have been proved on the ground.</P>
    <P>In taking such an approach, there would have to be an explicit understanding among all concerned as to its scope and purpose.  The exercise would be futile unless it were fully accepted by all the relevant bodies, including staff organisations, health boards, health board staff, health board management and the Department of Health.  It would have to be carried out without commitment to the permanency of the arrangements tested or their application elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It should not be seen as a replacement for the normal negotiating mechanisms. It should be seen as an experience-based action oriented approach to developing future arrangements for health service reorganisation.  I intend now to set in motion the process of getting agreement on the establishment of these pilot projects as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Given the critical resource problems we currently face, there are two possible reactions.  One is to do nothing but compress the present health care system &mdash; warts included &mdash; to match the more limited resources available from central taxation.</P>
    <P>The other is to analyse the problems in an objective way and to seek to develop solutions which will achieve our objectives for health policy within the financial constraints and in a way which is acceptable to the community.</P>
    <P>Any responsible Minister would always take the latter course and that is my objective in the range of initiatives I am now taking in relation to health policy.</P>

      <P>Over the past eight weeks I have visited half of the constituencies. Everywhere I go I meet people who are frightened by what they see as a collapse in the health services.  This is the Government's responsibility, however much they might try to disguise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health could have told the health boards to cut back more on administration and less on the delivery <Col N="2630" /> of services.  The bureaucracy of our health boards, in spite of the general philosophical considerations in which the Minister has just indulged, has increased faster in the past 17 years than the provision for the delivery of services.  Yet the Government chose not to tackle this bureaucracy, not to direct the health boards to make economies in administration rather than in services.  The result is that vital services are threatened. These cover a very wide range including the bone marrow transplant unit and the haematology unit in St. James's Hospital; the sexual assault treatment unit in the Rotunda Hospital; the vocational training programme for GPs in Dublin and Cork; the young persons' unit in St. Stephen's Hospital, as well as the psychiatric section of that hospital; the national cardiac surgical unit and many more.  All these services are now in danger or in doubt because the Minister and the Government did not give the health boards any direction as to the way in which the expenditure reductions were to be brought about.  We see it all around the country.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that a great deal of the trauma of recent weeks could have been avoided even within the context of getting our finances in order.  A large part of the problem is, as the Government say, due to heavy overspending by health boards in recent years.  Have the Minister and the Government forgotten that Fianna Fáil controlled the health boards over those years?  They cannot avoid the responsibility for that and I would applaud the Minister for his enthusiasm in bringing attention to that overspending if he had the decency, not to speak of the guts, to admit that the overspending was due in very large part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have shown none of the foresight needed to manage our health services successfully and compassionately.  I will deal with each of those points.  Section 31 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, provides as follows:</P>
      <P>A health board shall not, save with the Minister's consent, incur expenditure for any service or purpose within any period in excess of such sum as may be specified by the Minister in respect of that period.</P>
      <P>That section gives the Minister a key role in guiding the provision of services by the health boards.  It gives the Minister and the Government both the opportunity and the means of determining the range and level of services to be provided.  It is important that that be so in a small country like this, particularly when some services, including those I have mentioned, for any one of a number of reasons cannot in practice be provided in each health board area.  The Minister and Deputies will know what I mean.  The EHB, for example, provide certain services which cannot be made available in other health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central point is that the Minister and the Government have the means of playing a determining role in the level and range of health service provisions. The Minister has so far abdicated his responsibility in this regard.  He has said in this House that he provided guidelines for the health boards at the beginning of April.  I have read the guidelines.  I have read the letter sent by the Department to the health boards on 2 April last setting out those guidelines.  They are set out in the most general terms.  They make no reference whatever to the pattern of service which the Government think desirable. There is no indication whatsoever <Col N="2632" /> of the priorities as to the different types of service nor is there any indication that the Government have the slightest idea about the tailoring of resources to meet essential needs.  Perhaps that is simply because the Government have no idea what the essential needs might be.</P>
    <P>If this is so it is, in some respect at least, in sharp contrast with the relevant section of <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> which, for those who might, have forgotten, was the Fianna Fáil election earlier this year.  Ironically enough, that section is entitled &ldquo;A Sensible and Caring Approach to Health&rdquo;.  It starts off with a ringing declaration, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will shift the emphasis towards the promotion of personal health care through better lifestyles and to community rather than hospital-based care.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>An equally fundamental shift will be the gradual transfer of resources from hospital care to community care... Upgrading out-patient and day hospital facilities, which are inadequate at many centres, will be part of this change in emphasis.  Residential care will continue to be provided for those who need it.</P>
    <P>It declared also:</P>
    <P>Our overall aim will be a comprehensive health service geared to the future needs of all the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Those declarations now have a very hollow ring.  It may be that the rest of us misunderstood what that document really meant.  It appears now that the Government are clearly determined to bring about not just a gradual transfer of resources from hospital care but a rapid transfer of patients from hospital care, but they seem to have forgotten about the community care aspect.  There is no indication of this in the Department of Health's letter to the health boards. There is not a single indication in that letter of any sense of priority as between schemes and services.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister not try to pretend that <Col N="2633" /> this lack of specification arises from a concern with local democracy.  He pleaded in this House last Tuesday night that he failed to understand how any Minister for Health could be criticised for allowing local democracy to have an input into decision making.  He pleaded that he had made the allocations to the health boards and to the voluntary hospitals and left it to them to decide how they would effect the savings.  He did not want to be accused of being dictatorial or of not giving local people an opportunity to decide what their priorities were in their own areas.  Then he went on to say that he had sent a team of senior officials to every health board and every voluntary hospital to examine how the savings are being made and to report back to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot pretend that he should not have his own views &mdash; or at least the Government's views &mdash; on where the priorities should lie.  He cannot pretend that he will be doing wrong to the health boards in giving them some inkling of the Government's view of priorities. However, it is just possible that what he really meant to convey to the health boards was that the Government have no sense of priorities.  If that is the case, let him say so clearly and we will all applaud him for his honesty and wish him God-speed and the sooner the better.  Yet, though that might be the honourable thing for him to do, it would not be consistent with his other actions.  I will take only one example.  In the Government's allocations to Subhead G.4 of the Health Vote the Minister appears to be saying to the health boards that grants will be given on their behalf to hospitals, homes and so on other than hospitals and homes administered by the health boards, with no indication as to priorities but with the proviso that the grant for the North Infirmary, in Cork, for example, is to be reduced by 19.8 per cent, that the grant for the Monkstown Hospital is to be reduced by 22.4 per cent, that the grant for the Drogheda Cottage Hospital is to be reduced by 22.7 per cent, that the grant for Portiuncula Hospital is to be reduced by 9.9 per cent, and so on.  The <Col N="2634" /> Minister is in grave danger of inventing a new paraphrase of the saying of the great Henry Ford, &ldquo;You can have any hospital you like as long as it is smaller.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a letter dated 23 April last to the CEOs of the health boards, to the secretary &mdash; managers of public voluntary and joint board hospitals and to the administrators of homes for the mentally handicapped the Department of Health directed that &ldquo;every effort is to be made to spread staff reductions evenly across the grades, and frontline staff should be protected as much as possible in the interests of maintaining services&rdquo;.  That is a laudable objective, but I find no evidence of effect being given to it in practice. Everywhere we turn we see that the staff reductions being contemplated are at the front line as far as the delivery of services is concerned.  Take the example of the national cardiac surgical unit where two non-consultant hospital doctors, two perfusionists, two theatre nurses and ten intensive care nurses appear to be about to be let go: where is the concern there for protecting frontline staff as much as possible in accordance with the prescription of the Department of Health? No attempt at all is being made to ensure that even that vague guideline &mdash; if it could be called a guideline &mdash; is being given effect.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Minister's investigation teams have now reported back to him and that he is considering the results of their travel around the country in order to ensure that we have a rationalised health service in place.  If his officials are reporting to him now on how savings are being made by health boards and voluntary hospitals around the country and if the reports we have heard and seen in public are a true reflection of what the Minister is being told, I have no confidence whatever that we will see a rationalised health service as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister has biased the whole operation by his failure from the very beginning to give any indication of the Government's priorities and by his failure even to consider the rationalisation of the administration of our health services.  I am appalled that the Minister could <Col N="2635" /> deliver today a fairly lengthy speech introducing the debate on the health services and not reach until quite late in that speech any consideration of the structure of the machine we have for delivering services.  He then spent some part of that consideration in philisophical discussion about models, pilot programmes and his own conviction that the present structure has served us well.  Does the Minister not know that since 1970, in the last 17 years, even the simple business of telecommunications, document transmission and data transmission have revolutionised management of a service like that?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware we have eight structures around the country all doing the same job, all replicating functions that could be carried out centrally?  The Minister comes into the House to tell us he is not convinced there is any better way of carrying out that job.  I cannot see any great hope that we will see a rationalised health service as a result of the Minister's efforts.  The sad part of the matter is that his refusal even to consider that seriously will mean we will have a continuation of this year's scenario in which people who need health services delivered to them will be denied them because resources are being used unnecessarily in an over-elaborate structure.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised in this House about the relevance of that structure. On all occasions in the past four years when such questions were raised we have seen one predictable knee-jerk reaction from the Minister and his colleagues. I believe the problem is that the Minister, his colleagues in Government and in Fianna Fáil will not consider rationalisation of the structure of our health services because they have been trapped by their own repeated intransigence over the past four-and-a-half years on those issues.  During that time the slightest hint of rationalisation of structures was enough to send Fianna Fáil members of health boards into paroxysms of indignation about local democracy, to <Col N="2636" /> prevent them from giving any consideration to the fact that local democracy also requires that taxpayers, people who pay any kind of tax, have a right to demand that public expenditure be managed efficiently to give value for money.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been the biggest single obstacle to the rationalisation of our health services.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the spurious claim, the most spurious of all the claims made by the Minister and parroted by his Minister of State last evening in relation to the health services, that is the claim that the level of over-spending undertaken by health boards in the past four years was due in some way to negligence by the previous Government.  It is not. Responsibility for that problem must be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of those who have consistently obstructed every effort to control&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let the Minister and the Government not try to claim they have not had time to do this.  The Minister keeps reminding us he is the third Minister for Health this year.  I must say he is a damn poor third at that.  Let them not say they have not had time to examine what might be done to rationalise the structures, to reorganise.  They have had access to the benefit of four-and-a-half years of work on the part of Deputy Barry Desmond in defining what needed to be done to rationalise the health services. Their problem is not that they have not had time but that they have wasted four-and-a-half years of their time in Opposition in a profligate refusal to make a single proposal about the rationalisation of health services.</P>
      <P>The same applied to public expenditure generally.  The only proposals that party when in Opposition made in terms of rationalising public expenditure was the magnificent proposal by the current Minister for Agriculture and Food that we should save public money and cut the AnCO budget by not admitting married women to training programmes.  That is the only provision of any kind that ever emanated from them.  They spent four-and-a-half years sitting, looking and doing nothing about rationalisation of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price this Government are now paying &mdash; and it will be a heavy one &mdash; is the price of having opposed for the sake of opposition.  That would not be important were it not for the fact that the old, the sick and the handicapped are now being obliged to pay the price of Fianna Fáil's irresponsibility.  That need not be the case.  The Government can still decide to adopt a more caring, compassionate and enlightened approach to the health services, such as the one set out in the budget proposals on January last.  If the Government wished they could tailor those proposals still further to remain within the overall allocation they have proposed for this year.  Yes, the Minister may indeed prompt his colleague to talk about prescription charges. He can take that out and look at it.  I suggest to the Minister that there are a <Col N="2638" /> great many people all round this country who would find that a far more efficient way of reducing the expenditure on our health services, on doctors services and on drugs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than the unspecific directive, guideline, given in the letter of 2 May that expenditure on drugs has to be reduced by £1.5 million &mdash; or is it £3 million &mdash; simply by wish of the Minister without any indication as to how it is to be brought about.</P>
      <P>The Minister must rethink his approach for this year.  He must say today he has changed his mind, that he now has some clear view of the priorities in the provision of health services.  He must give a clear indication to the health boards, the voluntary hospitals and the people that he is giving priority to the needs of those who require health services, that he will not allow them to be crushed by the burden of an over-elaborate administration. In a time of financial stringency he must show that concern for people's needs can and must be accommodated in an enlightened fashion within the financial restrictions imposed on them.  Unless he does that, the Government of which he is a member and he himself will stand accused of an attempt to deceive the people, of putting an uncaring, unfeeling, unimaginative and inefficient approach to public expenditure before the needs of people who have no option but to have recourse to the State to safeguard their health and well-being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not impossible to do that.  The Minister, I am sad to say, shows a great reluctance to venture into this area.  At the beginning of his remarks the Minister set out some of the main elements involved in the change now needed in the health system.  There are five areas, which include a review of the funding arrangements, the rationalisation of the acute hospital system, the development of primary health care services, the development of health promotion and <Col N="2639" /> preventive services and an improvement in managerial arrangements at all levels in the system, all of them needing revision.  But we are talking now about things that will not happen in a way that would make a difference within the span of 1987.  There is nothing here about the structures of the health services.</P>
    <P>As a general matter of philosophy in relation to the health services, we find the following suggestion by the Minister:</P>
    <P>It may be appropriate to agree on some guideline, expressed for example as a proportion of gross national product, which would define the parameters of total health spending....</P>
    <P>Why should he propose that?  There is no magic in any proportion of gross national product being spent on the health services. There is no magic in 7 per cent, 6 per cent or 7½ per cent.  What we want to examine is the level of service we can provide for our people, not a percentage of gross national product.  If the Minister goes off along that track he could very happily spend the next three months working on something that is basically irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister goes on to talk about the review of the acute hospital system. I have no doubt that will be a useful exercise but he continues to say:</P>
    <P>It is beyond doubt that the outcome of this exercise will involve the phasing out of a significant number of beds from the acute hospital system.  The proposals developed in this regard will provide a good litmus test as to how genuine are the motives of those in this House who have repeatedly criticised the inefficiency of the health system.</P>
    <P>The Minister need have no worries about that bit of litmus paper.  The real test will be whether the Minister himself, his colleagues in Government and those on the back benches of Fianna Fáil, will have the guts to put up any analysis of how we should adjust our acute hospital service in order to meet the needs of this country within our present financial constraints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one more point to make.  The Minister has shown more than his slip in his speech today.  He tells us of a proposal for a conference in July that will review acute hospital services and that will deal particularly with the distribution of the higher specialties.  He said: &ldquo;Decisions on such services will not be made in the context of short term funding problems of individual hospitals but rather on the basis of an objective assessment of national needs and the most efficient way of meeting those needs.&rdquo;  We hold the Minister to that.  So far, he has not given any indication that he has any notion of where the priorities lie and basically that is what we must accuse him of today.  That is the injustice he has done, not just to the health boards but to the people generally.  The Minister and the Government should tell us what they believe are the priorities in our health system and not hide behind these spurious guidelines that have been sent out to the health boards.  The Minister could have said, and he has the power to say, how the finances should have been allocated and he should have attempted in some way to make them meet our needs.</P>

This is not a debate moving from side to side, it is a series of statements within which context it is perfectly logical and only to be expected that the appropriate spokespersons for each party would get an opportunity of putting their views on record prior to the statements going from side to side.  We happen to be in the somewhat unfortunate position of being in the middle.  Are we to assume that we will not get in at all?</P>

However, it is my desire in this limited debate that the spokespersons for the various parties should be heard and heard quickly in the debate.  Therefore, when the Minister has concluded his remarks, spokespersons for the various parties should be heard.  I have already heard Deputy Dukes of the Fine Gael Party, the Progressive Democrats spokesperson should be heard, the Labour Party spokesperson should be heard and also the spokesman for The Workers' Party.

May I draw your attention to Standing Order 41 which is the only one relevant to the issue we are discussing?  It says that a member of the Government who has given prior notice to the Ceann Comhairle may make a statement in the House on any matter.  No debate shall be permitted on any such statement but further statements may be allowed at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle from a spokesman nominated by a party in <Col N="2653" /> Opposition.

      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for acceding to the wishes of the House this morning.  I am sorry there was such a waste of time in an effort to eliminate contributions on this very important discussion on the health services.  It is sad that children present in the House this morning were able to see that performance.  I will say no more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this week in the Dáil the Progressive Democrats have sought to separate fact from rumour and threat so far <Col N="2660" /> as the health services are concerned.  The matter has now been further confused by the claims in the Dáil this week by the Minister for Health that all is well and that the system needs no change.  In particular, the Minister's satisfaction with the existing health board system is deplorable.  His failure to address this party's call for the abolition of local health committees is regrettable.  These are expensive talking shops and they are a luxury we cannot afford when frontline key medical care personnel, such as doctors and nurses, are facing the sack.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Southern Health Board area which covers Counties Cork and Kerry there are four of these committees. The travelling expenses run up by the three committees in County Cork amount to £144,000 or £3,000 per meeting. There is no justification for this when health boards are sacking nurses.  The Progressive Democrats also believe it is time for an urgent review of the health board system.  I am sure the Minister will verify that I have on many occasions expressed this view to him.  It has spawned a huge administration bureaucracy in the past 50 years and makes no sense, especially when all the money spent is raised centrally by the Exchequer.  It means that the taxpayer ends up with the worst of all worlds.  He or she provides all the funds through the Exchequer but retains little or no control over the Government on how money is spent.  That powerful position passes to the health boards and the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to achieve is greater accountability and to ensure that there is no waste of the taxpayers' money.  This party also are very concerned to ensure that any health cuts are apportioned fairly.  The brunt being felt on the frontline now by the doctors and nurses is entirely disproportionate.  I know that the Minister said in the House on Tuesday night that clerical and administration grades in the health agencies comprise of only 10 per cent of total staff and that <Col N="2661" /> less than 2 per cent of total staff in the Health Boards are employed in central administration.  He went on to claim that the demands for possible savings and staff reductions in these areas had been greatly exaggerated.  We would get a different picture if we were to categorise health workers into medical and non-medical. That would be a more accurate distinction to draw in the present controversy; if those figures were provided, then clearly the non-medical staff would total much more than 10 per cent.  In that regard I do not believe that the burden of the cutbacks is being shared fairly between medical and non-medical staff. Also it is vital that we discover what the picture is regarding overtime payments to staff in the health services and what level of absenteeism levels exists in different areas.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government were panicked into measures without calculating the severity of the consequences throughout the service.  They have shown clearly in recent weeks that they are not in control of the situation.  This is plainly underlined by the more recent decision of the Minister to send out officials from his Department to the health boards around the country to examine how the cutbacks are being administered.  What is most deplorable about the ongoing controversy is that fear and panic are being engendered among the ordinary members of the public.  They are being caught between the Government's ineptitude on the one hand and the undoubted scare tactics being resorted to by many of the unions in the health area and some health professionals on the other.  The latter have been making very alarmist and irresponsible statements about the possibility of people dying as a result of the cuts but the Government must take ultimate responsibility for this deplorable situation.  They have failed to govern, to get up front and run the system.  The vacuum they have created is being filled by sectional interests working within the health system.</P>
    <P>I appeal, even at this late stage, to the Minister to forget his pride and put the interest of the people first, to alleviate <Col N="2662" /> the hardship he is inflicting on the aged, the mentally ill and the handicapped children who depend on institutional care and the thousands who depend on our existing health services to an enormous dimension.  I have worked on health boards for many years and know of the many abuses that exist within the structure. We have been spending additional millions of pounds every year and seeing no worthwhile improvement in our health services.  We are no better off now than we were 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some aspects of our health services.  The Minister mentioned community care and I have heard many of his predecessors talk a lot about community care which, of course, is the most economic and worthwhile service for any community.  When we talk about community care, we are talking about preventive medicine but we never make available sufficient money to make this service effective.  For instance, let us take the geriatric service as an example.  It costs something in the region of £230 per week to keep an old person in long term care in a health board institution.  I want the Minister to take note of this because I have been expressing it in the health boards and on any other platform available to me where the care of an old person is concerned; we have a number of private homes throughout the country, well organised and which comply with all the regulations, but health boards refuse to pay a subvention in addition to a person's pension which could maintain an old person at less than half the cost of a health board hospital or institution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Why on earth can we not see what is happening in this field?  I have visited a number of private homes and have been amazed at the efficiency that exists there, the comforts and every possible facility available.  When a person is admitted an application to the health boards is made for some subvention to help the family to maintain that unfortunate old person in a private institution but these requests may be refused.  I <Col N="2663" /> would ask the Minister to remember that there are hundreds of these homes throughout the country, well run and well organised.  Above all, now that nurses are losing their jobs in hospitals and in health board institutions, there may be an opportunity for those girls to get employment in the private homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the things about which we should be talking rather than preventing these girls from exercising their skills.  These girls' one dream of life was to become nurses, they qualified but now they are running around Great Britain in the hope of finding some employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned on Tuesday last in the Dáil that he had directed agencies that community care services should be protected as far as possible, including key services for the old and the house-bound, such as community nursing services, services for the mentally handicapped, home health services, meals on wheels, child care services and particularly day care and pre-school services for the deprived and disadvantaged communities and after care programmes for children leaving long term residential care.  These are all essential and cost saving.  There is no doubt in the world about that.  Community nursing services are practically non-existent because sufficient money is not available to health boards to ensure the effective working of such services.  When we take on such a range of services as I have just mentioned, we are not talking about costs, we are talking about savings.  For that reason, I would make a very special plea to the Minister to devote much of his attention and of the attention of those especially appointed to go around the country investigating as to how health boards and hospitals are going to exist with the present cuts, towards ensuring that community care services get top priority at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever one talks about waste and deficits, one must direct one's attention <Col N="2664" /> to management.  If management are not efficient and capable of carrying out their responsibility we have a duty to examine their function.  The working of health boards must now come under careful scrutiny as to performance and effectiveness. Members of health boards are very far removed from the daily working of a hospital or institution.  I speak from my knowledge of being a member of the South Eastern Health Board for many years.  How can members of the Southern Health Board who live in Cork be aware of what is happening in hospitals in the Kerry Area?  What do the members of that board who reside in Kerry know about the Cork hospitals?  That anomaly should have been obvious to the Minister and his predecessors.  The Minister should examine the position of voluntary hospitals.  It is my view that small boards of management, representing politicians, doctors, trade unions and the business community, should be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like a big board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Voluntary&rdquo; is the operative word for the members also.  I am on two such boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and the Minister of State is aware of the position. Each member of such boards should be aware of what is happening in the hospitals.  Such small boards would be more efficient and the members would get more information than they get at present.  We should try to have more efficiency in our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of unnecessary waste in regard to the purchase of drugs, appliances and disposable items in our hospitals.  The Minister should consider establishing a central distribution centre for such items in each health board area. Those in charge of such centres would be in a position to get more information about the drugs on the market and, above all, the cost.  It must be remembered that our concern is to save jobs while at the same time making our hospitals and health boards more efficient.  I have no <Col N="2665" /> doubt that the setting up of distribution centres would result in huge savings.  The recommendations of the working party on the general medical services in regard to drugs are worth considering.  I hope the Minister will have them investigated.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that unless something positive is done now the hospital services in the Cork area will be in disarray within a few months and that the general public will suffer untold hardship.  There will be chaos during the holiday period when staff who are on annual leave are not replaced.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, is aware of the position in the North Infirmary in Cork.  That hospital caters for a very big working class area and has given a great service to the people.  Another important hospital in Cork city is Erinville on the Western Road.  I understand that a block and a half of that hospital has been closed and that during the summer the gynaecology unit will be closed.  The Minister must do all in his power to prevent any further disruption in the health services in Cork.  There is room for greater efficiency and I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to the workings of the health boards because in my view they have come to their end.  They are not serving the purpose for which they were established and it would be better if we established small boards of management in our hospitals.  Such a move would result in more efficiency.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party appreciate the efforts of the Chair to include us in the debate.  I am glad the important point of principle has been resolved and we appreciate the efforts of the Chair to resolve it.  This is not the type of debate needed to discuss the one <Col N="2666" /> issue that is fundamental in the country. Every village and town is in uproar about the savage treatment of the health services by the present administration.  It is unfortunate that we are not having a longer debate so that all Members can get an opportunity to present his or her views on the issue.  It is unfortunate that at the end of the debate we will not be having a definitive vote.  To allow parties to make statements on the matter is the minimum acceptable to us.  I regret we are not having an open-ended debate so that we could suggest amendments to the decisions by the Government.  The Labour Party will not let the Minister, or the Government, off the hook in regard to the health services.  We will raise again and again the issue of the destruction of essential services which were built up over generations but are now being demolished in one fell swoop by the Government.  Those services cannot be replaced.</P>
      <P>As the spokesperson on Health for the Labour Party I will avail of every opportunity to highlight the implications of the policy decisions of the Government and the complicity of two Opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, in those decisions.  Those parties support the basic strategy on cuts and have tried to distance themselves from the logical consequences of that strategy at local level.</P>

      <P>I voted against the budget that proposed those cuts.  The Labour Party withdrew from the Coalition Government when Fine Gael proposed similar measures.  The Progressive Democrats subscribed to the overall Estimate and in the course of their motion debated this week stated: &ldquo;That Dáil <Col N="2667" /> Éireann, wishing to remain within the 1987 revised Estimates for Health...&rdquo;. Last night Fine Gael stated that they wished to remain within the 1987 revised Estimates for Health.  That is the kernel of it.  We can hide behind local issues and gyrate and indulge in all sorts of humbug but the reality is that the net Exchequer allocation to the health services has been reduced.  The provisional outturn for last year was £1,117 million.  The Fine Gael alternative budget, rejected in the first instance by the Labour Party and then by the people, was to provide £1,115 million for this year.  The Fianna Fáil solution and budget provision, having gone to the people on the basis that health cuts hurt the old and the sick, a national scandal and an unprecedented con job, was to provide £1,111 million, a decrease below even the Fine Gael miserable allocation. In order to maintain services at even the level of last year, an increase of at least 3½ per cent over the £1,117 million spent on the health services last year would be required.  However, roughly £35 million have been lopped off with the consequent loss of 3,500 jobs.  This has obviously led to closures of hospitals because there is not enough staff to provide the service. I listed last night every single area of operation that has been adversely affected.  Transport has been reduced to cater for emergencies only.  Acute hospital wards have been closed in every single instance.  Five support hospitals are gone in the south east and at least 20 more are gone throughout the country. The community care budget has been slashed leaving no opthalmic and dental benefits.  If the Minister is so convinced that his policy is correct, let him at least recognise what is happening on the ground and recognise the confusion and anger his policies on the health services are causing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An area highlighted in a recent RTE programme was in relation to child sexual abuse which has become a grave and serious problem, a problem with which every member would be concerned.  The only child psychiatric service in Munster is provided at St. Stephen's Hospital in <Col N="2668" /> Cork.  This unit has assessed and treated 598 children on an in-patient basis since it was opened in February, 1987.  They have treated children suffering from sexual abuse, physical abuse and children who are emotionally disturbed.  Some of these children are there under &ldquo;unfit persons&rdquo; orders or &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; orders from the courts.  There is no place else for them to go and yet that unit is being closed down.  The out-patients' department in the same unit is treating some 250 cases.  The Minister's public assertion that it is his ambition to ensure that nobody will be left without an adequate health service, is patent nonsense, given the situation which exists.</P>
    <P>I listened with rising anger to the PD spokesperson, Deputy Wyse, whose only solution to the health crisis is to talk in terms of reducing the bureaucracy.  The Deputy said he would save £150,000 here, and another £150,000 there, but that is only peanuts in the overall context. The Deputy was only providing a useful smokescreen for the Progressive Democrats to screen their fundamental support for this policy of cutting public expenditure, a policy which they put before the people but the logical consequences of which they are afraid to address.  Similarly the Fine Gael proposal accepting the strategy but refusing to accept the downstream consequences is a smokescreen.</P>
    <P>We have raised repeatedly the issue of private medicine.  Applications are coming in in increasing numbers for extensions to the Blackrock clinic and all the private hospitals around the country. Deputy Wyse now wants to privatise care for the elderly.  The UK experience surely indicates that we have enough grotty private homes which are inadequately monitored into which to dump old people. What we want is a proper public service available to those who need it regardless of ability to pay.  The Government have tried to smokescreen the whole issue with all sorts of gyrations over public spending. Deputy Desmond last night indicated the supplementary budgets that were brought in by Fianna Fáil Ministers year after year and indicated that when <Col N="2669" /> he came into the Department he refused to allow those supplementary estimates and insisted that the Fianna Fáil controlled health boards would live within their budgets.  The health boards overspent and had yearly rows with Deputy Desmond as Minister and Deputy Desmond had to meet deputations supported by Fianna Fáil members of this House demanding more and more money.  This has been an unprecedented U-turn by the Government.  We have a crisis in the hospital health service and it can only be solved by providing resources.  We can get those resources by restoring a land tax, by beginning to tax capital, by beginning to collect the VAT outstanding, some £700 million, by beginning to collect health levies due from the self employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Energy for his intercession in the difficult situation this morning.  His co-operation is much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech has been criticised, but I would prefer to regard it as a somewhat thoughtful contribution to the future development of health policy. The Minister asked if it were possible <Col N="2670" /> perhaps for some political consensus to emerge as to the proportion of GNP which would define the parameters of total health spending.  The Minister has set up a review group on funding the health services and he is accelerating the special cost containment and efficiency unit within the Department.  He is holding a national conference in July on the plan for the hospital services.  The Minister is preoccupied about the distribution of the higher specialities and so on.  The interesting point in his speech was the equally interesting reply by the Taoiseach this morning that he proposed to set up in the Dáil a number of the revised committees, including the Committee on Women's Affairs to which he referred specifically in reply to Deputy Colley.  I strongly suggest to the Minister for Health and to the Taoiseach that in view of the proliferation of statements made in the House relating to the health services in recent weeks and in view of the massive media attention related to the health services and of the many multitudes of comments made, it is essential that there be a political awareness and a true political understanding in the Dáil as to policy indications of the health services. I hope we will not see the return of that awful committee on public expenditure. I would implore the Taoiseach not to bring that about as the committee's reports were abysmal in their analysis of public expenditure.  We will have the Committee on Public Accounts, but then it is time to have a select committee of the House on the health services.  There have been such committees before.  I know that many of us take a jaundiced view of Dáil Committees but if a select committee of this House could dispel some of the mythology which relates to the health services and could secure an education of public opinion as to what constitutes real health in this community, then we could do a great deal of work and it would not be circumscribed by the very attentuated and emotionally charged debates such as we have today. The Taoiseach would be well advised to set up such a select committee which would receive submissions from the <Col N="2671" /> public at large and interested bodies.  A political consensus might emerge as to what proportion of GNP we should devote to the health services and how they should be financed.</P>
    <P>We have the ludicrous position that health boards are dominated by members of local authorities, although the funding from local authorities ceased in the mid-1970s. In terms of the review of the structure and management of the health boards and their relationship with the Department of Health, I would implore the Minister not to make 24 political appointments to the health boards.  He should give himself some breathing space to deal with the critical issues.  A select committee would remove the necessity for a Committee on Public Expenditure which made so many erroneous comments and analyses of health expenditure.</P>
    <P>No Government will ever succeed unless we amend the health legislation, particularly the Health Act, 1970. Deputy O'Malley asked last night why the Minister did not close down voluntary hospitals.  The Minister cannot close down voluntary hospitals unless there is an amendment to the 1970 Act.  Voluntary hospitals are self-appointed, self-perpetuating and independent.  The only way they can be closed down is by removing their budgets.  The Minister has taken decisions relating to some voluntary hospitals and has half closed down half of them.  We need amending legislation to clear up the position between the Minister and the health boards.  The Minister cannot close down a health board hospital &mdash; the Monaghan Hospital fracas proved that conclusively &mdash; without a public inquiry held in the emotionally-charged atmosphere of a local community.  The 1970 Act is riddled with ambiguities and is in dire need of amendment.  It must be amended to give statutory control over the registration and operation of voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals.  One cannot open a psychiatric hospital without a licence from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that we are to have a <Col N="2672" /> proliferation of new private hospitals. Health boards will close down small local hospitals which will be bought by a group of consultants or local GPs who will open them up under some other guise. Mayhem will ensue in the health services.</P>
    <P>I make an earnest plea to the Minister to bring in revised statutes.  I know, not from the Department of Health, &mdash; lest my sources be regarded as exceptional &mdash; but from Government gossip that the Minister put specific proposals before the Cabinet but they were thrown out in the helter skelter rush to bring in the £10 charges.  There is a great need for statutory control.  I am glad that the Progressive Democrats are not opposed to the control of the voluntary hospital sector.  I have nothing against voluntary hospitals but some of them are so preoccupied with what other politicians think of them that they imagine they will all be closed down.  Many of them have done very good work.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will bring in a retention tax in relation to professional fees, but simultaneously the Government have failed to deal with a retention tax in relation to consultants' fees paid by the VHI.  I know that the payment is made to the subscribers, not directly to the consultants.  All hell will break loose when the GPs discover that they are to be docked 35 per cent by the GMS payments board while the consultants, who are effectively receiving money through a State-sponsored body subsidised by tax relief, are not obliged to pay any retention tax.  That anomaly had better be rectified fast or this Finance Bill will face great difficulty in the Dáil.  The Minister for Finance failed to bring the VHI into the schedule of the bodies mentioned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to lift the embargo in relation to the staffing of the Department of Health.  I found it excruciatingly difficult to deal with a situation where we were shedding and losing staff due to the embargo, yet we were expected by the then Ministers for Finance and the Public Service to run a massive budget of £1,300 million gross.  At least remove the embargo on the internal staffing of the Department.  Let the <Col N="2673" /> Department take on an additional coterie of qualified health economists, not the kind of nonsense that floats about in some of the public sector areas.  Let them take on specialists capable of rationalising the health system.  The Department is denuded of staff, with a very limited number of middle management staff to operate the system.  The Minister for Finance should endeavour to rectify the position. This is a personal observation; I am not making any special pleading on behalf of any staff in any Department.  I admire the heroic efforts of the Department of Health to deal with changing political cultures and changing political decisions as we go from one mad political decision to another.  Expectations were raised by Fianna Fáil which had to be stifled when they faced the exigencies of the public finances.</P>
    <P>I would equally ask that we deal with the management expertise of voluntary hospitals.  It is ludicrous that a voluntary or health board hospital with a budget of anything from £15 million to £30 million is run by a secretary/manager who is paid £16,000 or £17,000 to administer it.  He has no status or remuneration.  Major budget centres in the Health Vote should, perhaps, be run on a public service contract basis.  People should be well paid to look after the budget for five or seven years so that it will be run on an effective basis.  We must also try to improve the management expertise and organisation of such hospitals.  Generally speaking, both are miserable.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in relation to the GMS vote, which is now back up at £107 million, to bring in a capitation system for GMS payment.  It is possible to do so and save a great deal of money on drugs, on which we are currently spending £60 million a year.  A capitation system would have exceptional payments for exceptional visits, with incentives to doctors such as some prospect of a non-public service superannuation scheme, just as the common contract provides a pension scheme for consultants.</P>
    <P>With these positive observations I urge the Minister to consider the setting up of a select committee of the Dáil so that we <Col N="2674" /> can continue to make a rational contribution in an atmosphere which is less emotionally charged.</P>

      <P>The public debate which has been going on during the past few weeks has highlighted a number of fundamental issues which I would like to touch on to-day.  It has shown the deep and widespread concern of the whole community regarding the highly emotive and personal public service, the health service.  It has demonstrated that generally the community have come to expect a level of services which has been dramatically developed in the past 15 to 20 years.  It also raised, possibly for the first time in such stark terms, the cost of providing and maintaining that level of service.  The public debate generally has revolved around the argument that it was essential that the level continue to be maintained.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the debate has not been infused with a consideration of some of the basic matters that are at the kernel of the problem.  At this stage, I would suggest it is accepted by virtually everyone in the country that for too long our demands for services &mdash; not just health services but all public services &mdash; have not been matched by our capacity to pay for them.  I think it is generally recognised that the country has finally come to the stage where everyone has to have the courage to say &ldquo;halt&rdquo;.  It is time that someone checked the uncontrolled slide into economic chaos with all the horrifying implications of that.  That is what this Government are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the health services are concerned, there would appear to be an attitude in some quarters that, while measures were necessary to protect the fabric of the economy, the health services should remain immune from the consequences. A similar attitude applied in relation to other public services.  It is an attitude that just is not sustainable.  Certain measures are necessary.  That has to be accepted generally.  It is, therefore, a question of how best to implement these measures so that at least the essential <Col N="2675" /> components of the services are preserved. This has been the intent of the Government from the start and we will ensure that this is carried through.</P>
    <P>Surley the message must now be coming home to everyone that for some time past something has been seriously wrong in our health services which demanded an ever-increasing input of resources.  Each year saw a further escalation of the demands being made on the services.  Did this mean that, despite the resources being poured into the services, the health of the nation was such that even further levels of service were required?  There are no statistics I have seen which would suggest that the general status of health in the country was deteriorating on such an alarming scale on an annual basis.  Even the motion which was before the House last night recognised that this Government increased expenditure on health services from £1.298 billion in 1986 to £1.315 billion in 1987.</P>
    <P>I listened this morning to Deputy Dukes' contribution to this debate, and one would be forgiven for wondering if Deputy Dukes had ever served in Government.  Was he really the Minister for Finance for three of the last four years?  Was he a senior member of that administration?  Was he one of the front spokesmen on behalf of the Fine Gael party during the last general election? When he talks about cutbacks in health, let me remind him and this House that the 1987 Fine Gael projected allocation for health as published in their document in January last was £1,293 million.  The Government turnout in our budget for our Book of Estimates is £1,315 million, an increase of £16 million on what Deputy Dukes and his party were going to do for the people.</P>

In fact, he remained <Col N="2676" /> Minister for Health even when his Taoiseach wanted to fire him at one stage. He refused to be fired and stayed on as Minister for Health.  The Labour Party, the PDs and Fine Gael come into this House and criticise this Government, a Government who have increased expenditure on health this year despite the Government restraints.</P>

      <P>By implication, it is recognised that to keep the same level of service in 1987 as in 1986 would have required a significant increase in the amounts made available.  The unfortunate facts of life are that it just is not possible to continue to provide indefinitely for that kind of annual incremental increase which the Opposition parties are now calling for but which they did not call for while in Government.  The time had to come when it was necessary to ask what is the country receiving for this huge expenditure of taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was time to ask whether the whole and complex range and level of services which were being made available should be examined as to how necessary they were.  The exercise, which really should have commenced some years ago, to determine what should constitute a proper health service and at what cost, is now being undertaken.  That exercise will have to be completed as a matter of urgency as most certainly time is not on our side.  The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon has clearly spelt out <Col N="2677" /> the main areas in which a special and urgent assessment of need would commence immediately.</P>
    <P>Let me say when I mention my colleague, the Minister for Health, that a sustained, vicious and personal attack on that Minister has been carried on in the past couple of weeks by vested interests around this country and by political opponents.  Deputy O'Hanlon is the Minister for Health fronting the Government decisions on behalf of the Government.  It is not Deputy O'Hanlon as an individual Minister for Health, it is Deputy O'Hanlon as a member of a Government who are making the running on this issue.  We have collective responsibility which was so sadly lacking in the last administration. Let there be no misunderstanding about it, Deputy O'Hanlon is carrying out Government policy in this issue and in that he has the full support of everybody in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>For my part, I hope that the undertaking which Deputy O'Hanlon is involved in in relation to the review will be seen and its outcome accepted for what it is &mdash; that is an essential and rational look at elements of the health service to meet real rather than perceived needs.  I am well aware that during the years a number of similar studies were undertaken, and from that experience I know there is a danger that these new studies could degenerate into talking shops and excuses for discussion without any meaningful results.  This cannot be allowed to happen and it will not be allowed to happen.  With the agreed plan of reform, there will be a strategy for carrying it through and this Government's determination will not be deflected.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dukes this morning refer to the need for review, the need to carry out changes within the health services and the need to look at the structures. For all of his failings, and they were many indeed, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, at least was putting forward some proposals.  I would have disagreed with many of them vehemently, but he got no support at that time from his Fine Gael colleagues for <Col N="2678" /> proposals for reviews of the structures of the health service.</P>
    <P>The concern being expressed at the moment about the health services and the implications of the resource curtailment for them is understandable. Individual apprehension about specific services and specific institutions is also understandable.  What is a grave disservice is the impression being given by many people who should know better that the health services are in immediate danger of total collapse.  This, of course, is not the position.  Certain cutbacks will be necessary but there is no doubt that the essentials can and will be maintained. Yet these wild statements continue to be made.  They are not justified.  It is of particular concern that, unfortunately, these allegations are being believed.  I know from my own experience that many people, especially the old and the less well-off, are very worried that their basic health requirements will not be met.  I want to emphasise here today that this is not the case.  This Government have been especially conscious of the need to protect the most needy in society.  In introducing charges for out-patient and inpatient services these were the criteria used and I think any objective person will admit this is how they are operating. Those elements in our society, whether in this House, or vested interests outside it, are doing no good to the less-well-off and the old by their scare-mongering tactics.</P>
    <P>The need to curtail the level of provision of some services, the need to trim the number of staff employed in the service, constitute part of the measures we have to take.  The fact that it is possible, arising from the plans which have been considered by health boards, that some institutions may have to change their character or may have to close is being presented as a particularly draconian measure arising from the resource curtailment.</P>
    <P>It seems to me this is a very narrow way in which to look at the problem.  I would have thought it is really a question of putting the right mix of services together in the most efficient way and if <Col N="2679" /> that means an institution or part of it is not required &mdash; that should be accepted. Such resources, as become available, can then be redeployed to support those aspects of the service which are regarded as essential.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition were to be honest they would acknowledge that this is also the way in which they have seen things for many years.  Like so many other aspects of Irish life, whether economic or social, unfortunately they had neither the will nor the capacity to see it through. They wanted to be all things to all men at all times.  An example of their mismanagement allowed an overrun to the tune of £55 million up to the end of 1986 in the health boards.  Unfortunately, again &mdash; from a national point of view &mdash; they were too divided among themselves to take effective action.</P>
    <P>We just cannot continue along this path of self-delusion and double-think.  There must be an ordering of priorities and the pattern of expenditure must reflect these. We cannot sustain every facility just because it happens to be there.  I do not want to give the impression that this will and must lead to a major change in the quality of service which will be available. Indeed, as the Minister for Health said on Tuesday evening last, there is now a golden opportunity to emerge from this period of difficulty with a leaner, fitter and more effective health service.</P>
    <P>It is not just in the health services that this process of rationalisation and renewal is taking place.  In other sectors of the public service, similar adjustments have had to be made and out of what is often a painful processs a new realism has emerged.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are no strangers to this reality.  I would have thought from their experience of the commercial semi-State area in recent years they would have a full appreciaiton of the task facing the Government and the Minister for Health now.  When we were in Opposition we were not found wanting when difficult choices in the interests of the country had to be taken in this House.  I should like <Col N="2680" /> to think that patriotic approach would be reciprocated now.</P>
    <P>Given the terms of the motion before the house during this week, I do not see any reason why we cannot work together to reshape the health srvices.  I want to make a special appeal to the staff in the health services.  I know many of them are angry, perhaps fearful, about what is happening and about what may happen. Many, particularly those who are young and anxious to make a career in the service of people, may well feel, that their contribution is poorly appreciated.  They may feel they are the victims of an unjustified assault on the service to which they are committed.  I want to take the opportunity in this House of saying to them today that nothing could be further from the truth.  It is well recognised that the provision of a good health service requires particular personal dedication and a wholehearted giving of one's talents and energies.  We know that in many areas of the service people have had to work a great deal harder in recent years and that the advance in technology has made acute medicine a great deal more complex for all involved in it.</P>
    <P>The health services have not been discriminated against by the Government. They happen to be very expensive and in some respects, they become more costly as they gain in efficiency.  Our commitment to the services is demonstrated by the Government's decision to maintain non-capital public expenditure at 7.2 per cent of estimated GNP, a level which is well above that of many other European countries.  For example, only ten years ago the percentage of GNP devoted to such expenditure was 5.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>All of these figures, all of this commitment, all of the increases in funding that this Government have given above the outturn of the previous administration in 1986 and the projected expenditure in the Fine Gael budget of January last seem to have been forgotten by the Opposition at this time.  It suits them to jump on band wagons but the reality is that this Government have increased the expenditure by £16 million <Col N="2681" /> at a time when other services are being severely constrained.</P>
    <P>If we are to put the country back on a sound footing, ready to avail of the opportunities for growth within the western economy, for a while all of us will have to accept sacrifices.  Different sectors will be affected at different times.  I need hardly remind the House of the impact on people in the industrial and commercial sector of the enforced changes of recent years.  Much though we might like to do so, it is just not possible to protect the public service from the harsh reality of our difficult economic position.</P>
    <P>I hope that staff will appreciate the reasons such unpopular decisions have had to be taken by the Government, the Minister for Health and the health authorities. I want to emphasise that the actions of the Minister for Health are part of overall Government action.  The scurrilous attacks on him are just that &mdash; scurrilous &mdash; because he is not acting as an individual but rather as a member of a combined and united Cabinet.  The sooner we sort out what has to be done now the sooner will certainty and assurance be reinforced in the health services. We in this House should not add to the difficulties of achieving that aim.</P>

      <P>In this context I am pleased to have the right to speak here today, to make my protest against the health cutbacks. It is the democratic right of Deputies like myself to be allowed to speak in this House and to have our voices heard.  It is also the right of people to protest peacefully on the streets against these cutbacks.  Democracy is a two-fold exercise in this context.  People such as myself in this House should speak out loudly and clearly on this issue and the people outside the House who are opposed to these health cuts should do likewise and should march in support of their case. These cutbacks are not only cutbacks on jobs but they are a violent assault on vulnerable people such as the sick and the poor.  They are also an assault on health workers, not only on nurses and doctors but also on tradesmen and others operating in the service.  They have all been targeted in terms of the cutbacks in health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2683" /> Lower paid workers will be among the first casualties of the cutbacks and the poor will suffer most of all.  Socialists like myself cannot stand by and allow this to happen without opposing these cuts on all fronts.  Not only the people in this House but also the nurses' trade unions and the entire trade union movement should fight these cuts.  The politicians and parties should not be let off the hook on this issue.  I hold no brief whatsoever for Deputy Barry Desmond, indeed I had many disagreements with him and his party both inside and outside this House but not one health board worker lost his or her job while Deputy Desmond was Minister for Health.  At least that can be said in his favour.</P>
    <P>He also tried to do something about controlling the power and the wealth of consultants within the health service but sadly, he got very little help from anyone in the House or from the trade union movement.  Consultants are faring very well from the health services.  I do not see much sharing in that area.  Consultants and doctors speak a great deal about the sanctity and the privacy of the relationship between themselves and their patients.  That privacy is often very profitable for them.  The consultants have the best of two worlds; they have the very best of the VHI service and also of the public health service through the health boards.  Among themselves consultants have a saying, that these hospitals are milking parlours for them because they can milk both services quite easily and they are quite adept at doing that.  They have become very wealthy from the health services in dealing with the poor and the sick.  At the same time they use the public facilities we provide for them. We allow them to use for their private patients private beds and private rooms in public hospitals and we allow them the full range of nursing and secretarial services.  Deputy Desmond, while he was unsuccessful in this regard, tried to pin-point that scandal and that abuse within the system.  The present Government and the Minister do not seem to be making any effort to take on these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2684" /> When talking about waste of public money it is essential that we have some sharing process in this area.  There is no point in some people at the top of the scale faring very well from the system while the lower paid workers are being turfed on to the streets and made pay the price for this waste of public money. There should be some equity in the system.  I would like to see the Minister and the Government following up that area because in a society like ours, in a small country with a small population, we should have more of a caring and compassionate concept.  This, unfortunately, is not coming across in the Minister's proposals.  Far too much money is going to the wrong areas in our health services.  Far too much money is going into private pockets.  It is time to stop this lopsided development of our health services and it is also time to stop the drift towards a two-tiered system of health services, one system for the rich and one for the poor.  I can see that happening if the Minister's proposals are allowed go through.</P>
    <P>There are blueprints for this in America where the President, Ronald Reagan, took on the welfare lobbies.  He did so successfully from his point of view but at a terrible price.  In his own city of Washington there are very many poor people within a short distance of the White House and that is a very obvious indictment of the system.  It reflects on the American system of competition. That kind of system is very much involved in the present attempt to cut health services here.  I am in favour of a return for public money; I am not in favour of wasting public money but unfortunately the blueprint is there and it is a very obvious one which we must follow.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in Britain Mrs. Thatcher succeeded in dismantling a good deal of the welfare system.  As somebody who lived in Britain and saw the welfare system there working I realise that it had very good and valuable points.  Despite the fact that we look at Great Britain as a different kind of society with a different ethos we could learn a lot from their compassion in that regard.  Mr. Nye <Col N="2685" /> Bevan did an excellent job in putting in place that welfare system after the war, against very strong opposition at that time from the doctors.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Thatcher was able to dismantle much of that system.  We are now going down the same road and I deplore that.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the crunch has come for us in this regard.  In this House it boils down to numbers, as to who will stand up and be counted?  I am glad to say that I voted against every aspect of this budget because I felt it was a badly balanced budget but it went through, cuts and all. The reality is that all the votes on the various aspects of this budget have been passed, including the one on the hospital charges which involved a division here three weeks ago.  Last night the health cuts were again approved.  It should be stated loudly and clearly that only 16 Deputies out of 166 in Dáil Éireann voted against the health charges being imposed. Last night only 12 Deputies out of 166 voted against the health cuts.  That is the reality facing this House and facing the Irish people.  This is not only about the whole question of health cuts, it is about politics and about the policies and priorities of our parties and politicians.  The electorate must decide what kind of parties and politicians they want to send to Dáil Éireann to legislate on their behalf.</P>
    <P>As I said elsewhere, there is no point in marching to the polling booth one day to vote for a politician or a party and a few months later marching around the streets protesting because that party or politician has taken away your job, has imposed health cuts and has refused to do anything about tax equality.  It is about time that our people woke up to the consequences of their actions in this regard.  Above all it is time for them to do something to change the position.  It is time that Irish politics became more responsive and amenable to the interests of the PAYE earners and to the unemployed. As I said elsewhere, if the 250,000 people who are unemployed joined forces at the ballot box and the 70,000 PAYE earners and the families of <Col N="2686" /> all of them Irish politics could be transformed in a relatively short time.  Unfortunately, the unemployed and the PAYE sector stop short of taking action and pull back from the consequences &mdash; more is the pity.  Sadly, they have been unwilling to learn the obvious lesson from their inconsistent record so far as what they do at election time and what they do otherwise is concerned.  It is a savage indictment of our society that at a time when health cuts are being imposed and the Government state they have no money, hundreds of millions of pounds of public money in the form of VAT remain uncollected.  This tax has to be paid by the ordinary person.  Similarly, hundreds of millions of pounds in income tax are also uncollected.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned earlier, the farmers have been most reluctant to pay modest health charges or to pay land tax.  I will confine myself to their reluctance to pay health charges.  About two years ago the health boards were given permission to collect these health charges from farmers but unfortunately they were unsuccessful in doing so as were the Revenue Commissioners. At the same time as we are facing those health cuts there are other matters such as the hundreds of millions of pounds in VAT collected by individuals, which is going into private pockets instead of to the State and which will soon be written off.  A vast amount of income tax remains to be paid by farmers, professional people, the self employed and others.  The farmers refuse to pay any kind of taxes at all.  They refuse to pay rates, income tax and health charges. They have no qualms about making the poor pay for the crisis in our economy.</P>
    <P>It is time that all people created a party that will not stray from the issue of social justice in our society.  It is time our people created a party that will stand up to the powerful and influential vested interests that dominate our society.  This party will come about, not of its own accord but only when the people who are marching and protesting loudly outside the House realise this.  I hope the people will come to this conclusion and will make the necessary action to bring this about.  In <Col N="2687" /> this House I will continue as best I can as a lone Deputy to oppose the health cuts and to speak out against them as much as possible.  I do not know and I do not think anybody knows, what the final outcome of these health cuts will be. They have been far too drastic and unplanned.  They are an assault on the sick, the poor and the working people. I do not know how the Government can expect health boards to provide the same level of services they provided over the years while imposing these cuts. Commonsense tells us it is not possible to give the same treatment to the sick, the handicapped and the poor if the same level of money and resources are not provided.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as condemning these health cuts as being insensitive and utterly lacking in compassion.  I know more about the operation of the Mid-Western Health Board and the private hospitals in Limerick than I do about the health boards throughout the country. The officials of the health boards have told me and other public representatives that hundreds of health board workers are about to lose their jobs.  For instance, there has been a cutback of more than £5 million in the budget allocation for the Mid-Western Health Board.  I do not know how the Government can introduce such a cutback and still expect the same services to be provided.  Commonsense would decree that that is not possible.</P>
    <P>Lower paid workers have come to me because they have been given notice from the Mid-Western Health Board.  Some of these people, strangely enough, have been on short term contracts for four or five years.  It is an abuse of the work of the Employment Appeals Tribunal when workers are kept on short term contracts to frustrate the aims of the tribunal.  Since these people are on short term contracts, they are not in line for redundancy payments and so on.  All they will get is a week's wages when they finish with the board after four of five years.  This is a flagrant abuse of the labour legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2688" /> This is a fact which is not generally known.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister, Deputy Burke.  He said the Government's aim was to reshape health policies and put the health services in order. These are very laudable objectives and everybody would agree that reshaping the health services is long overdue, but it is the manner in which the Government are doing it which calls for opposition. The Government cannot take these measures without expecting some trouble from Members of this House and on the streets.  Even at this late stage I appeal to them to draw back from the brink of this upheaval in society.  This would not be a sign of weakness.  In my opinion it would be the civilised and compassionate response of a Government to the pressures of public opinion.</P>
    <P>I am not directing any abuse towards the Minister concerned because I do not see any point in personal abuse.  I am against that because, as has been said, it is the Cabinet who are responsible and I do not see any point in singling out the Minister for that sort of abuse.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to rethink their position.  I realise the Government are not bloodyminded.  The Fianna Fáil Party have the record of being a populist party I do not like Fianna Fáil, their record, or their performance and I have many ideological differences with them.  They are certainly not being bloodyminded in dismantling our health services and imposing these health cuts.  This step is insensitive and perhaps is a measure of the gloom and doom felt throughout the country, but I do not believe making the health services the scapegoat for cutbacks in wasteful expenditure is the answer to the problem.  This is tackling the problem at the wrong end.  It would be more profitable to tackle the areas I have mentioned rather than taking on the poor lobby, the welfare lobby or the health lobby.  In my view, the Government are wrong, insensitive and these steps are too drastic.  I appeal to them, even at this late hour, to rethink their attitude to these cutbacks.  While there is a need to save <Col N="2689" /> money and to make more productive use of public money, the Government have made a fundamental major error.  It will not be to Fianna Fáil's credit if they persist with these measures in view of the wave of opposition inside and outside this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend Deputy Kemmy when he said he would refrain from any personal abuse of the Minister for Health.  It is only what I would expect from him and he is to be commended.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party will never follow a philosophy of one law for the sick and another for the poor.  Fianna Fáil is the largest party in this House, representing every sector of the community, and has done so for over many decades.  While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Kemmy, when he talks about areas of social deprivation he should realise that the new measures do not affect medical card holders.  I am putting it on the record of the House that the very modest VHI scheme covers people who are in somewhat better circumstances and will, I believe, be very effective.</P>
      <P>We are not copying the <i>modus operandi</i> of any other Government or any other country.  I appreciate what the Deputy said about the construction of the health schemes in a neighbouring country.  I was working in that country at the time and was very much in support of the Minister who brought them in.  As I said, we are not copying the existing policies of any Government in any other country.  We are dealing with the situation as we find it.</P>
      <P>Over and over again it has been brought to the attention of the House that we inherited a situation where £55 million overspending took place last year, and this had to be dealt with now.  I will be referring to the North-Eastern Health Board area later, but if their example had been followed throughout the country, we would not have the present serious financial crisis in the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government assumed office <Col N="2690" /> just over two months ago there was a broad consensus among the parties representative of nine-tenths of the electorate that the containment, and where possible the curtailment, of Government spending was an essential prerequisite to economic recovery.  I want to stress that I would not like to be part of containment or curtailment which was taking place for its own sake.  Containment, and where possible curtailment, with the objective of bringing a stimulus to economic activity and employment is the purpose of the exercise.  Divergences were apparent between the parties as to the relative emphasis to be placed on economies in the different sectors, but the fact that urgent action was imperative was not disputed at that time by anybody.  Excessive public spending &mdash; and I mentioned the £55 million overspending a few moments ago &mdash; and the inexorable growth in the proportion of the country's resources which were being spent by the State, were recognised as playing a key role in depressing efforts at effecting growth.  A fall in interest rates resulting in new investments and the spirit of renewal so critical to turning the tide of unemployment and the general malaise which has paralysed our economy for the past few years were all seen as dependent on restraint in Government spending.  As far as the fall in interest rates is concerned, the movement has started.  It may not be as rapid as some of us would wish but it has started and is a healthy indication that the economic objectives are being achieved.</P>
    <P>The budget introduced by the Government endeavoured to re-examine expenditure and effect economies in a wide range of areas.  Since then, attention has focused almost exclusively on the current year's provision for health expenditure. Interestingly, while two of the parties opposite proposed global Government spending levels broadly in line with those being adopted by the Government, they have tried to slither away from the practical consequences of spending which they had exhorted.  The pretence of unspecific assertions about how expenditure savings in health and other areas <Col N="2691" /> could be effected peacefully and effortlessly, coupled with assurances that the parties of which they are members retain a commitment to refloating the economy and lifting the burden of excessive spending, must be rigorously exposed in this House.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the targeting of Government members as individuals which was referred to by Deputy Kemmy and for which I commended him.  The House should bear in mind the words of Article 28 4.2º of Bunreacht na hÉireann which says:</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The targeting of the Ministers for Finance, Environment, Education or, in this case, the Minister for Health as individuals, is a dishonest exercise in the light of the words in the Constitution about collective responsibility which I have just read.  Deputy Kemmy pointed out that personal attack and abuse were not part of his strategy for which I commend him. I also wish to express my appreciation to Deputy Barry Desmond for stating that the personal attack should be avoided and that any political attack should be directed at the Government who are collectively responsible for policies.</P>

      <P>I am far from provocative and I never was.  I am like the quiet lion, I only attack if provoked.  If we are serious about curtailment of expenditure as one of the vehicles to propel the drive towards economic recovery, it is inevitable that health spending must come into the reckoning.  To pretend otherwise would be a dishonest denial of the facts.</P>
      <P>The health sector is one of the big eaters of public money, responsible for about one-fifth of Government spending. The Irish share of gross national product devoted to health is significantly higher than that obtaining in other countries.  I will give a few examples and confine myself to smallish countries which might be properly compared with Ireland.  The figures I will give are taken from the NESC report &mdash; A Strategy for Development. Ireland's share of GNP is 8.2 per cent; the figure for Austria is 6.9 per cent; for Belgium 6.5 per cent; for Denmark 6.6 per cent; and for Finland 6.6 per cent. The figure for a large, wealthy country like Japan is only 6.7 per cent.  Norway, which is roughly equivalent to Ireland, although it has better resources of oil and fishing, spends 6.9 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Health services have tended to assume what one might describe as an unhealthy dependence on Exchequer financing with some 85 per cent of the income of the health service coming from central funds.</P>
      <P>The inexorable increase in spending of money and use of personnel have not produced a significantly healthier community. By definition, health outputs are difficult to perceive and quantify&mdash;I concede that to the Deputy opposite&mdash; but my overall impression is that the Irish race has not become healthier in recent years in direct proportion to the deployment of more money and more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of health care system we have developed is a very laudable and compassionate one.  It has allowed guaranteed access to a range of resources tailored according to income and contribution levels.  Unfortunately, in some cases, what we get too easily we tend to appreciate too little and use too freely and wastefully.  Anyone who has ever seen a hospital bill will know that the cost of the maintenance of a patient in hospital is extremely high.  Overnight charges in the most exotic hotel pale into the bargain class by comparison; you will notice my input from the tourism area.  Yet, in applying their budget to the range of services they provide, there is an impression conveyed that economies are being effected to a disproportionately high degree on services and facilities which have a high public profile.  It is strange, to say the least, that what is a very minor reduction in real terms in the health budget should provoke a relatively wide-ranging withdrawal of services.  We do <Col N="2694" /> not know but that a more staid and fundamental review of the deployment of resources at the disposal of the health boards &mdash; the Minister has hinted at this &mdash;might reveal possibilities for economies which have yet to be explored.</P>
    <P>I said I would refer to the North Eastern Health Board.  I have no expertise in the area of health but I should like to quote the remarks of a consultant in the area which covers counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, a substantial area where the financing of the health services has been carefully monitored over the years and which could provide an example for the rest of the country.  I am not being chauvinistic in that regard but if the Members care to examine the situation they will see that I am right.</P>
    <P>At an estimates meeting of the North Eastern Health Board a surgeon from Drogheda, Mr. Michael Shine, said this country had an excellent health service and would continue to have an excellent health service.  He said people were confused as they had been told they had a free health service but, in fact, like every other country they had a tremendously expensive health service.  His message was to tell the people that they need not be afraid as they had an excellent service. He would prefer to be ill in Ireland today rather than in any other country in the world.  That was said by a person of experience in the health field and is relevant to what was said earlier by Deputy Kemmy who spoke about the position in the United States&mdash;and I am no expert in this field either&mdash;where the cost of medical services is very high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it appeals to me.  The fact is that that area had a deficit in its 1986 budget of £690,000, not the £5 million or the £10 million as has been suggested elsewhere.  That area, covering a substantial sector of the population, was able to organise itself in such a way that they will not be withdrawing any services this year.  There may be some quantity reductions, as was stated at the annual general meeting, but they have to be commended for saying there will be no deterioration in the quality of the services to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2696" /> Public discussion of the health spending cuts has failed to address the tendency towards uncontained growth&mdash;this is relevant to what I have said&mdash;and a wasteful and abusive drain on scarce resources which are endemic to the type of comprehensive Exchequer funded network which we in Ireland have developed. If this discussion has been weak on intelligent political appraisal it has been strong on personal abuse and scare-mongering. To repeat what I have said already lest anyone be under any misunderstanding, the members of this Government adhere to and are bound by Article 28 of the Constitution which requires us to meet and act as a collective authority, collectively responsible for the Departments of State we administer.</P>
    <P>The levels of expenditure which were provided in this year's budget were based on well-considered Estimates of the optimum balance between what the country needs by way of public spending and what it can afford to sustain.  Those decisions were taken collectively by all the members of the Government and are ones we will continue to endorse.  No amount of pressure exerted locally or nationally will weaken our resolve to carry out decisions and policies which we have decided to be the correct ones.  No amount of personal abuse will soften the resolve of the Government to see through to implementation the policies on which we, as a Government, have decided.  The collective responsibility for and commitment to policies cannot and will not be fractured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Acting Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to speak. I would like to congratulate the Minister who has just spoken for coming into the House to support the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon.  It is rare to see Ministers coming into this House, as they have done today, to support, and indicate their political responsibility for the decisions we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the way in which the debate has gone today.  The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, opened the debate with an incredibly general and woolly <Col N="2697" /> contribution in which he referred to desirable reforms and a wide range of issues and theories.  His contribution was academic and irrelevant.  The reason for this debate has been caused by the crisis in the health services.  The decisions which have been taken have resulted in many people coming out onto the streets.  I do not encourage industrial action or protest or seek to whip it up but this debate was meant to respond to the level of concern which has been expressed at what is happening in the country.  Instead, by and large it has been irrelevant to the current crisis.  It has been very general debate, one we can have at any future time.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Deputies from the left, the right and the middle, as I see ourselves, there is room for a broad consensus on the direction the health services should take and on the desirable reforms. There is a broad consensus on having an all-party committee to examine this matter and for a White Paper which could be debated but that does not help anyone running the health services who at present are coping with the immense cash crisis.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a personal attack but I think the Minister and the Government must accept responsibility for what is happening in the health services and for the cuts.  I resent the Minister and the Government attempting to wash their hands of responsibility for the cuts in the health services.  I do not know whether he is fooling himself or his party but he is certainly not fooling us or the public who are feeling the brunt of these changes. When he was a spokesman for his party while in Opposition it was Deputy Wilson's custom to hold Ministers accountable, individually and collectively, and I hope to continue that tradition.  I refuse to allow him and the Government to wash their hands of what has been going on.  They have tried to wash their hands by placing the blame on the health boards, which is absolutely unforgivable and indefensible.</P>
    <P>Since the local elections of 1985 the health boards have been dominated by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Therefore, even if you take it at the meanest level, which I <Col N="2698" /> do not, the responsibility still lies with Fianna Fáil.  The Government, on coming into office and having examined our budget, accepted the greater part of it.  The areas in which they made the greatest changes were in both the health and education sectors and I am sure the same kind of crisis will arise in the education sector as budgets begin to run out in the autumn.  The Government have made major changes in what we proposed.</P>
    <P>We do not stand for irresponsible spending in the health services but we certainly do not support the view which was presented by the spokesman for the Progressive Democrats that all that has happened in the health services during the past 20 years has not contributed to improving the health of people.  Many valuable services have been built up during the past ten to 20 years and it is proposed that these will be cut out of the health service in one fell swoop.  We ask the Minister not to stand by the harsh position which was outlined by the Minister, Deputy Wilson, that they are going to stand firm on every element.  We ask that they stand firm on the broad principles; we will support them on that and we have said so.  But we will not support the measures taken in other areas, particularly when there are other options which were outlined by us in our proposed budget of last January.  Those options and the ones which I will propose before the end of my contribution could be looked at.</P>
    <P>The figures have been juggled about and there is no doubt that Mark Twain was right when he said you have lies, damn lies and statistics.  It is often difficult to get the true position from statistics but looking at the figures for the first time there is a net reduction in moneys allocated to the services.  If you look at our proposed budget of last January you will find that the Government have taken an extra £16 million from the services.  They have made a further reduction of £10 million in the area of recruitment and £6 million to be saved through these mysterious efficiencies.</P>
    <P>We have proposed a modest increase <Col N="2699" /> in the net estimate for the health boards which would allow them, with the increased cost they would have been facing inevitably, to have pruned gently.  I am particularly anxious about these health cuts because they represent a major blow to women.  Women form the vast majority of the workforce in the health services which is being reduced, at the Government's own estimate, by £200,000 this year.  They are in the frontline for services with their children, their longer life span; they are particularly affected by the cuts, even in geriatric beds.  The bulk of the jobs lost will be female workers, the majority of these being nurses.  The bulk of those lost already have been nursing jobs.  Why has this happened?  It is particularly because many nurses are part time and temporary. This might make people feel that it is not too serious to get rid of temporary and part time jobs, but if looked at a little more closely it is not quite as fair as it sounds.</P>
    <P>Many of the nurses in the health services have been temporary full time nurses for up to 14 years.  Some were originally forced to resign by marriage bars and came back to work when they were too old to be made permanent.  This is something which has been inadequately taken up and perhaps the nurses are not as well organised as the medical profession who are organising and lobbying to oppose the losses in their own area much more actively.  The nurses are being hit when perhaps nurses who were recruited in the last year and have been made permanent are not being affected. Will the Minister look into this area to ensure that this group of workers are protected and that the women who have been discriminated against twice in their history will not find themselves as usual being the first victims of the cuts in this area?  My mother was a 15-year-long temporary public servant in the public nursing area and I had direct experience of the consequences of all of this right through to her retirement.  These people <Col N="2700" /> are the easy and the soft options in reducing numbers.</P>
    <P>In the end of the day what will we have?  The Minister, Deputy Burke, held up for us the wonderful prospect of having a fitter, leaner health service.  I can remember that being presented to him as an option by us when on that side of the House and he was not terribly impressed with it.  I am not a bit impressed by it because at the end of this year we shall have achieved none of the radical reforms.  All we shall have will be services lopped off here and there with what remains not necessarily any fitter or leaner.  We may have all the unhealthy, wasteful elements still in place and vital services gone because of the way in which it is proposed to implement these cuts. The Minister cannot wash his hands of it. If he has views on it, he must make the health boards follow them.  The Minister and the Government have tried to have it every way in these cuts.  On one hand they are not responsible for the health cuts being implemented by the health boards and the services but on the other hand he has given them broad instructions on what they are to do.  That was to include protecting community services.  It is common knowledge and certainly to my direct knowledge that community services are already being affected.  Does the Minister intend to act on this?</P>
    <P>Let me outline some of the cuts of which I am aware which are very worrying because of their impact on public health.  They go against the whole theory of moving into the area of community care and prevention.  These are, in the Eastern Health Board area, the ending of school medical examinations and the curtailment of social work services in deprived areas; major preventative programmes in the Finglas area which were under way and on which work has been done have now been brought to a halt and the social workers involved have been called back into mainstream activity. Developmental check-ups are to go, largely because they are operated by temporary doctors.  Travel assistance to child guidance clinics are to go.  All these mean that the poor and the deprived will have <Col N="2701" /> fewer services, and there will be less likelihood of diseases in their children being caught early.  If the services are there and happen to be far flung, it will be expensive or perhaps impossible, or enough of a disincentive for the people not to attend them.  Will the Minister wash his hands of his responsibility for this backward step in the health services?</P>
    <P>One other area is worrying most people and if the Minister could resolve this in the area of community care he might have dealt with some of the worst elements of the proposed health cuts, that is, the number of unique national services that are to go in the proposed cutbacks.  The Minister has constantly maintained that essential services will be maintained.  This was repeated again by the Minister, Deputy Burke here.  He said that we would have an order of priority.  Other Deputies have dealt at length with the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital.  There has been something of a disagreement between the Minister and that assault unit as to whether the unit are funded directly.  They were funded directly by his Department and it is his responsibility to ensure that that service and that this welcome development are maintained.  The unit is only two years in existence and has given some hope, counselling and future to the hundreds presenting themselves over each of the years, increasing numbers of young people with severe problems.  I would make a particular plea to the Minister to tell us what is the future of this service which was not funded from the Rotunda budget but directly from his Department. Would he at least give us a clear guarantee that that would be maintained?</P>
    <P>I am also very concerned about the bone marrow transplant unit in St. James's, the infertility clinic there and the haemophiliac unit, all of which are unique.  Certainly these, at a minimum, must be protected.  The maternity unit in St. James's is to go.  It is a unique service in that it is the only maternity unit in a general hospital and one of the smallest. It can, therefore, offer specialised care for high risk patients that cannot be offered anywhere else, encompassing <Col N="2702" /> high blood pressure or liver problems.  It is the only place that can be said to be adequate.  It is clear that with the falling birth rate we are going to have to rationalise maternity services in the Dublin area, but it will not be an answer to close this small unit.  It will only be a very short term answer.  I argue very strongly that in whatever rationalisation occurs in the future that unit should have a place which is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I wish to give a few moments of my time to my colleague, Deputy Taylor-Quinn, but I wish to refer briefly to services, again unique, in Cappagh Hospital. Orthopaedic work is being done there almost uniquely in the country&mdash;there may be one more service in the Southern Health Board area.  The cutback of £75,000 to that hospital will mean that they will have to reduce by half their number of joint replacements.  That means that the existing two year waiting list will extend to four years.  That will affect only public patients.  The private patients who have this operation done in the Blackrock Clinic will have no problem. This is one of the saddest and most indefensible matters.  It is something that will mark out this party from the party on my right.  We are anxious in our commitment to the development of the health services to ensure that a public service is available for those entitled to it.  We support rationalisation but we do not support the development of an American style system which will create second class citizens and give them a totally inadequate health service.  We will not support an attitude that the care one gets is decided by the size of one's purse.  In Government we participated in a slow and careful pruning of the health services. The Government should have continued in that direction and not have embarked on the extensive cuts introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Flaherty for giving me some of the time allotted to her.  I am amazed at the response to the debate from the Government benches.  One would not think that throughout the <Col N="2703" /> country patients are being discharged from general and regional hospitals earlier than they should and that old people are being told they had better find some place to stay other than the geriatric and district hospitals.  Because of the closure of maternity units pregnant women are wondering where their babies will be delivered.  Thousand of people in the health services are wondering where they will get their next job.  Listening to the response from the Government side one would not believe that there is such chaos in the health service.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that the Mid-Western Health Board are proposing to close the district hospitals at Kilrush, Ennistymon and Raheen.  The board propose to close 50 beds in the General Hospital in Ennis, 75 beds in St. Joseph's Geriatric Hospital and the entire maternity service at Cahercalla Maternity Hospital.  As a result of the proposal in regard to Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital in Ennis there will not be any treatment programmes.  It is sad that the health services have been cut back in this way but it is indicative of a Government who are not concerned about the public.  There is little indication that the Government are caring or compassionate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Clare contend that they are being asked to bear an unfair percentage of the proportion of cuts suggested by the Mid-Western Health Board.  I had hoped that today the Minister would have something positive to offer for that area but all he said was that all health boards, with the exception of two, were able to work within their allocations. He said he had met the two health boards concerned, the Western Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board, and he hoped that they would follow the examples of the other boards.  Will the Minister tell us what the Mid-Western Health Board propose for that region, particularly in County Clare? I understand that the board propose to leave a skeleton service in the county and cut the number of jobs by about 300. Many of the temporary nurses who have <Col N="2704" /> been employed for the past seven or eight years are being made redundant.  In the General Hospital in Ennis 17 nurses have been made redundant and it is expected that a further 14 will be made redundant at the end of the week.  The out-patient department at that hospital has closed and ante-natal clinics are not being provided. The people of County Clare do not know where they will get a service in the future.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the health services is so serious that the public are in a state of shock.  It is serious when one finds a 96-year old patient crying because she does not know where she will stay when she is discharged.  That lady does not have any relatives or anybody to care for her.  Where will she end her days?  It appears that the Government are not aware of what is happening.  We all agree that there is a need for rationalisation and the matrons of the hospitals in Clare are prepared to do that.  Those matrons have prepared plans for their hospitals and will, if asked, submit them to the health board.</P>
    <P>I was depressed to hear the Minister's statement in regard to health boards.  The arrogance of some of the senior officials of the Mid-Western Health Board leaves a lot to be desired.  The Minister should accept that he has responsibility for their actions.  In the course of his speech the Minister said he made no secret of his confidence in the health board system as an appropriate model for the delivery of an efficient and responsible health service. However, in my view the health board in the mid-west region is not capable of delivering an efficient and responsible health service and the Minister should examine its activites.  It is not efficient or effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Health on being the first holder of that office in 15 years to face up to the problems in the health services here.  I should like to refer Members to the problems that exist in the service.  These did not arise in the last three months.  They arose because other Ministers ran away <Col N="2705" /> from them.  The Minister listed the main issues involved.  He said that to correct the problems of the health service we must review the funding arrangements and he announced those details this morning.  He said that to correct the problem of the service it was necessary to rationalise the acute hospital system, develop the primary health care services, develop health care promotion and preventative services and achieve an improvement in managerial arrangements at all levels in the system.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had to face those problems but his predecessors mortgaged the future.  When Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard she did not find anything but the Minister found a bill for £55 million in the cupboard.  We should congratulate the Minister on his efforts to ensure that we will have a proper health service in the future.  I do not accept the emotive statements about the number of people who will suffer as a result of the cuts.  The Minister did not take away the entire allocations, as some people seem to imply.  He has reduced it in an effort to bring order into the system and will be remembered for bringing about an orderly development of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Labour I have special responsibility for the maintenance of good staff relations and I have had some direct involvement in the health services, particularly in the hospital system. Before I became a public representative I worked in the administrative area of the service, a group that has been attacked in the House and outside in recent days. The impression has been given that it is only in the last few weeks that the closure of some institutions was raised.  I should like to remind the House that as far back as 1968 plans and proposals were prepared on the future direction of the hospital services.  They pointed to the need for rationalisation, a change in the type of services provided and, consequently, the demise of a number of institutions. A number of institutions have been closed and the type of service provided changed.  They include Mercers <Col N="2706" /> Hospital, Teach Ultan, Sir Patrick Dun's and Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>Since 1968 we have succeeded in greatly improving the acute hospital sector but we have not done so in the most effective and efficient way.  There has been no shortage of proposals and plans, yet outside Dublin the hospital system in terms of numbers, location and size of hospitals remains largely the same as it was 20 years ago.  We cannot now sustain at the appropriate level of competence and capacity all the acute beds and hospitals in the system.  This is obviously a matter of grave concern.  We must have a viable acute hospital system in our health service.</P>
    <P>We should reflect on why it has been so difficult to achieve rationalisation in an area in which so much sound advice has been available and when there has been so much unanimity in the general context of the advice.  There are too many reasons for this continuing problem. First, there is a perhaps erroneous view among the public and among politicians about what now constitutes an effective and an efficient acute hospital service. Secondly, our arrangements for implementing agreed plans in this area of the service have not been sufficiently adaptable to achieve the task and to tease out various problems and challenges.  In trying to make progress we must have regard to these factors.  We need to explain to the people the factors which would guarantee the availability of a good caring service.  We also need to ensure that we have sufficient statutory and effective authority to carry through the necessary changes.  The action the Minister now proposes to take will finally bring to an end a long chapter in our attempt to come to grips with the acute hospital problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to health staffs, the health services are and will continue to be highly labour intensive.  Nearly 70 per cent of all expenditure on the health services is devoted to pay.  Health boards and hospitals have tried over the past few years to avoid reducing staff numbers <Col N="2707" /> by constantialy paring away at the non-paying expenditure, which was only 30 per cent of their costs.  That brings its own inefficiencies and in any event it is limited in its capacity.  The Minister for Health has already made it clear that we wish to bring about such changes as are necessary after consultation with the various interests concerned.  The Minister is necessarily limited in the amount of time he has for this.  However, a very important initiative is being taken next week when the Minister will meet with the representatives of the alliance and health service unions.  At both national and local level this alliance which has grown out of the present difficulties presents a very good opportunity to the Minister for real and rapid consultation with staff interests.  In the nature of things, much of this consultation must take place at local level.  I am pleased to note this is happening in many cases.  I hope that the alliance will greatly facilitate local consultation in matters such as the future shape of the acute hospital system by arranging for representative groups to participate in discussions.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to involving staff through their trade unions in evolving approaches to problems which will take account of their difficult economic situation.  There is room for co-operation, innovation and flexibility and there is a need to explain fully to people the nature of the decisions which are being taken, the reason for them and their likely effects.  That is successfully being done in a number of areas.  The Minister for Communications has done that in relation to B &amp; I.  The unions have accepted this and if all the ranting and shouting and the emotion that is about the House was used in the same constructive way that the trade unions have used such forces, we might make more progress.  The Minister for Health will have the full and continued support of all his colleagues in quickly putting in place structures to ensure that this can be done. I, as Minister for Labour with a particular responsibility towards staff, now put on record the Government's commitment to <Col N="2708" /> continued consultation and involvement of staff interests in making strategic decisions.</P>
    <P>I have been distressed to hear the cynical and unfounded attacks which have been made in relation to the contribution of clerical and administrative staffs of the health service.  None of these attacks was based on proper research and they did not have much regard to the facts.  Most people do not know anything about the administration of the health services.  The Minister for Health has already made it clear that about 10 per cent of all health services staff can be included under this category.  Of these, about 80 per cent are directly and critically involved in the delivery of services, in the establishment of eligibility and in the essential support functions which make the work of doctors, nurses and others more effective and efficient.  A major contribution is made by clerical staff working in records in outpatient departments in hospitals. Without their involvement the records necessary to check on and look after patients would not be there.  Anybody who knows anything about hospital work would know that, but those staffs are included under the heading of administration. It is regrettable that people who persist in talking about the staff would not take an hour off and go and visit a hospital to see what the administrative staff really do.</P>
    <P>In relation to X-rays, it is the clerical people who organise X-rays and it is the same in pathology where they are involved in the tests.  Because one is in administration does not mean that one is not directly involved in health care.  I hope there will not be any more unjustified attacks on people who are generally among the lower paid staffs in the health service and who are among the most committed. Indeed, at a time when the wholehearted commitment of all staffs in the health services is vital, great care must be taken to avoid unhelpful comments which will be resented.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already made clear it will be necessary to take an initiative in relation to the common contract of <Col N="2709" /> consultants.  Such a review was scheduled but it is now a matter of urgency.  In this instance there is need for a rapid and positive response from the IMO.  They, as an organisation, have a number of issues which they wish to get resolved. There are many in the ranks of the medical profession who would like to see a different contract, one which has greater regard for the professional and vocational nature of the work and the reality of the consultants' commitment to patients.  If we try to maintain a unified system of health services, it would be a great pity if as a result of the adaptations which must now be made we were to end up with a dual level service and lose much of the valuable groundwork which has been done in the past 20 years.  However, it must be acknowledged there is considerable unease among politicians and the public regarding the present arrangements in the contract, particularly in relation to private practice.  We hope that in the forthcoming discussions this matter can be dealt with fully and frankly and that the primacy of the public service dimension in our hospitals will be fully acknowledged.</P>
    <P>There is a need and an opportunity for medical consultants to become much more involved in policy decisions in their own hospitals, the decisions about the allocation of resources and the use of those resources.  Equally, it is scarcely conceivable that we can go for very much longer without a much greater degree of accountability from people who are making decisions on the use of major resources and are uniquely in a position to control both the demand and the supply.  Medical consultants generally would welcome the development of much clearer accountability measures and a revitalisation of the management arrangements in hospitals.  The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has outlined how we will approach the allocation of resources to the acute hospital sector and to primary health care.  This approach would permit appropriate provisions to be made for essential and desirable developments. In order to give the people of Dublin a good hospital service, it is essential that <Col N="2710" /> the hospital at Beaumont be opened as quickly as possible, for development of the Mater and St. James's to be completed and the work at Tallaght to take place.  These are clear priorities and we must do what is necessary to bring to fruition this necessary revamping of our services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problems besetting the non-consultant hospital doctor grade, the House will recall that industrial action by these doctors was averted through a Labour Court recommendation last October which led to the establishment of a joint review group which is now nearing the end of its work.  There has been a great deal of co-operation between management and the IMO in the conduct of this review.  It would be a great pity if this work were not now to be completed and used as a basis for determining future arrangements for the deployment of non-consultant hospital doctors.  I hope, through the established consultative machinery and in the consultations which will now take place about the active hospital sector, that there will be a continuance of the constructive approach which has marked discussions in this area during the past six months.</P>
    <P>I hope this House will give the Minister for Health the support and co-operation he needs in effecting the necessary changes in our health services which will in the long term safeguard the integrity of services built up over many years.  It would be a matter of regret if the various elements which make up the services were not to work together to overcome the present difficulties.  We have found ways to deal with other major problems in recent times with the co-operation of the trade unions and others.  I hope the people involved in the health services will now think and act prudently and constructively for the betterment of those who need these services.  I am sure that with the vision and co-operation of people involved in the health services sector, this will successfully be done in <Col N="2711" /> the short term.  I congratulate the Minister for his efforts to overcome a problem that has built up over the past 15 to 20 years.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development (No.  2) Act, 1981, provided for the making of employment grants to international services projects by the Industrial Development Authority.  This provision was retained in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, and the availability of employment grants was extended also to small industry projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that 59 companies have been approved employment grants under the international services programme since the commencement of the 1986 Act.  In addition employment <Col N="2712" /> grants have been approved for approximately 70 small industry projects.</P>
    <P>For small industry projects employment grants are an alternative to capital grants and offer greater flexibility to promoters. They are particularly attractive to companies with high working capital requirements and to those wishing to use secondhand machinery which is not eligible for grant assistance.  The grants are an important addition to the range of incentives available to manufacturing and internationally traded services industries in Ireland and have the benefit of making the industrial package more employment-orientated.</P>

      <P>This is not my expectation. It is the expectation of the IDA who are charged with the responsibility of meeting their job targets.  I have no doubt that they are well aware of the devaluation of the dollar in relation to Ireland but any projects approved in the second half of last year would not be included in that type of projection because those projects would not be up and running and have jobs installed by the end of 1987.  There is a time lag between the approval of a project and when it is on stream and the jobs are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  4 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the detailed procedures of price control were allowed to lapse by the previous Government in January 1986 in favour of measures to promote greater competition and efficiency throughout the economy for the benefit of the consumer.  I do not see any need for the re-introduction of such controls at present.</P>
      <P>My Department, with the co-operation of the Department of Energy, are, however, monitoring the wholesale price levels of petroleum products at present; I am prepared to avail of the ministerial powers still available to me under the Prices Acts if that proves to be necessary to deal with any problem in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that following the withdrawal of price control regulations there is ample evidence available to both his Department and the Department of Energy that the petroleum companies took excessive advantage of that situation and that on successive occasions they either retained the clear advantage or were excessively tardy in giving the reductions, as a net consequence of which the consumer lost heavily?  On that basis will the Minister now consider the re-introduction of the appropriate legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was a member of the previous Government who took away the price control in this area.  The evidence that is available in the Department does not seem to constitute the evidence he hinges his statements on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2719" /> The situation is monitored continuously and if such action is required that action will be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the Department, having sponsored the withdrawal of the legislation, are not likely to admit readily now that they were in grievous error.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the tax exclusive prices of petroleum products in Ireland are up to 37 per cent dearer than in other EC countries as quoted by EC statistics?  Rather than reintroduce price control in a detailed way, will he consider a maximum prices order that would link Irish petrol prices to average prices prevailing in the EC and so prevent such a large margin of excess charge on Irish consumers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am having a very intense study carried out in relation to tax exclusive prices on petrol and diesel on the Irish consumer market and in general throughout the economy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what the tax exclusive prices purvey.  In two countries I have analysed so far, Greece and France, there are serious questions to be answered.  I am having it broken down because it must be broken down in relation to distribution, to margin and to the price itself exclusive of all taxes.  The Deputy is quoting here an average price throughout the EC.  I prefer to go through it country by country and look at the origin of their oil and relate it to how it went down the line. The House and the Deputy will appreciate that this exercise takes a good deal of time.  There is the problem of ascertaining information that is not too readily available, that is not made available, in order to get to the real root of what the price should be on the Irish market. However, I will continue that search.  I was not aware of what Deputy Desmond said in relation to 1986 because I was taking the position as I see it today and making the analysis accordingly.  I will welcome all information that anybody can offer in relation to carrying out the <Col N="2721" /> search.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that I will take whatever action is necessary to rectify the situation.  But I do not think that the introduction of price control is the answer.  There are different ways of dealing with it and I have power within the Department to deal with it.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that, in circumstances in which we were <Col N="2722" /> given a Sudanese Central Bank guarantee &mdash;which is now not being honoured, in a country which is arguably the poorest in the world&mdash;the likelihood of our obtaining those funds is slim indeed.  The Department will continue to press for recovery of the funds.  I am using every means at my disposal to recover them.  I should also say to the Deputy that the question of further rescheduling agreements between Ireland and the Sudan was considered in 1985.  We have kept an eye on the position since then but it was clear that other EC member states who had negotiated a number of rescheduling agreements with the Sudanese were not being paid either.  It would appear to be a difficult position.  I am not optimistic that we will succeed.  We have not formally written off the debt and will maintain every pressure on them to seek its recovery.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  6 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The total value of the investments approved by the National Development Corporation Ltd. &mdash; NADCORP &mdash; since taking over from the National Enterprise Agency on 11 June 1986 is £6.212 million. No investment by the corporation to date has required my consent or the consent of the Government.  As regards the initiation of projects by NADCORP, the establishment of wholly or partly owned subsidiaries by NADCORP requires my consent, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  No such consent was sought or given.  With the exception of investment in its subsidiaries, NADCORP is precluded, under section 28 of the National Development Corporation Act, 1986, from making an investment in an enterprise which would lead to a majority shareholding for NADCORP in that enterprise.  The number employed in companies in which NADCORP holds investments is now estimated to be 600. I have no information about the number of jobs involved in projects under consideration. In any event such information would not be meaningful as many such projects may not be regarded as viable on examination.  A provision of £7 million has been made in the Public Capital Programme for 1987 for NADCORP's capital purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2724" /> I have no direct function in regard to the day-to-day administration of NADCORP. However, details of their operations and of investments made and held will be contained in NADCORP's Annual report which is required to be made to me not later than six months after the end of the corporation's financial year, which ends on 31 December. This will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It would be inappropriate for me to make a general statement on the work of NADCORP in advance of that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister sought or had any meeting with the National Development Corporation to discuss their activities or, failing that, does he intend doing so?  Does he see that he has a role to play in discussing such projects? Furthermore, does he support the concept of a National Development Corporation for the purpose of actively and aggressively being involved in job creation which the country so badly needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had one meeting with the chairman and chief executive of the National Development Corporation and a second meeting with the chairman. With regard to becoming involved in the day-to-day activities of the corporation or in assessing projects in which the corporation are involved, that is not my function. I am precluded from becoming involved in that function.  The question of evaluation of projects to be undertaken by NADCORP is a matter for their board and that is the way it will be left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my second question with regard to his attitude to the National Development Corporation being utilised aggressively for the purpose of creating jobs. Perhaps he would reply to that.  Would he also indicate to the House what he means &mdash; bearing in mind that £7 million of public money is being provided&mdash; when he says he is not concerned in their day-to-day activities.  Surely when £30 million of public money is involved the Minister would agree that it is up to him <Col N="2725" /> to say to the chairman: what are you doing; could you be doing more; what jobs are you creating&mdash;and to give a directive to ensure that that money being provided by the Oireachtas for the purpose of job creation&mdash;through the corporation&mdash;is used aggressively for that purpose rather than, as the Minister seems to be doing, standing back, washing his hands of the whole affair and leaving them to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will carry out my responsibilities to NADCORP under the provisions laid down in the relevant Act. The Deputy can be assured of that.  In relation to the certain of jobs by the corporation, I should say that any investment by the corporation or indeed by the Industrial Development Authority will be in the area of job creation.  I cannot understand what the Deputy is getting at. Of course we are interested in ensuring that the maximum number of sustainable projects are brought on stream, through both NADCORP and the IDA.  I have no quarrel with that, so I cannot understand what the Deputy is getting at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that it is the policy of this Government to ensure that NADCORP continue in existence, that this Government have no proposals to abolish them or in any way reduce their activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to abolish NADCORP.  I am already on record in the House as saying that they have a role to play in relation to the provision of seed capital, in a vacuum created in the whole industrial development structure.  NADCORP have a role to play in that regard.  I have no doubt from the two meetings I have had with them that they are pursuing that purpose. There is a limit to the amount of good, viable projects available; it is not a question of money only in this regard.  I have already stated the Government's position. What agencies are doing and on what they are spending money will form part of my overall review to ensure that <Col N="2726" /> we get value for money from all that is invested in industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's confirmation of what he said on another occasion.  Would the House be correct in assuming that the Minister's reply, on behalf of the Government, overrides the promise that the then Leader of the Opposition&mdash;now Taoiseach&mdash;gave to the effect that he would abolish NADCORP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes me to reply to that perhaps he would give me the date of such statement; I do not have it.  If he puts down a question some other day I will be quite happy to reply to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will order an inquiry into the inordinate price disparities regarding foodstuffs which exist between Ireland and Great Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission carried out a grocery price comparison survey between Ireland and the UK in April 1985.  The results of that survey indicated that tax inclusive Irish prices were only 2.2 per cent and 6.5 per cent higher, on average, than Northern Ireland and English prices respectively. The somewhat higher Irish prices arose mainly from additional distribution costs arising in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence available to me to suggest that there are currently inordinate disparities in regard to the price of foodstuffs as between Ireland and Great Britain, or other circumstances which would justify the holding of an inquiry into the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that research was carried out under the auspices of the Consumers Association of Ireland, the representative body for consumers? I gather it has been carried out since the date of the NPC inquiry.  It showed in round figures a disparity, after tax and other deductions, of 30 per cent in relation to a significant range of foodstuffs. In view of the clear conflict with what he said, perhaps the Minister will meet with the Consumers Association of Ireland to discuss that matter because that is what they say.  Obviously, I do not know what areas were examined by the NPC.  The Consumers Association of Ireland are a body of integrity and I wonder if the Minister will meet with them to discuss what is, from their point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will go into that matter in detail with the Consumers Association of Ireland whom I expect to meet this afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the prospects he has for foreign investment in Ireland in 1987; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as foreign industrial investment is concerned, I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that, despite a very slow start this year, the authority expects the level of such investment in 1987 to be equal to the average investment achieved over the last five years, that is, in excess of £300 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had discussions with the IDA to see in what way he and his Minister of State can assist that authority to ensure that in real terms there is a substantial increase in foreign investment this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already had discussions with the IDA and I will be going to the United States in early June in that regard.  I visited Germany in the past number of weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can raise it if he wishes.  As regards the German trip, Ireland was shown up in a very poor light in relation to media coverage before, during and after the general election and that had to be put right in the first instance.  As we all know, investment abroad takes cognisance of worldwide press in relation to the Irish economy and I found a very negative attitude in Germany to the Irish economy.  When I return from the United States I will report my findings to the House.  I believe I was successful with all the various interviews with the media and in meetings with bankers, industrialists and so on in Germany in allaying their fears in this regard.  The reports in relation to the Irish economy were totally exaggerated. There must be confidence in the economy <Col N="2729" /> before we can expect to bring in investment. That was my first priority in relation to that trip and if I have to do the same job in America I will be only too glad to do so.  Every assistance will be given by me as Minister, by the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing and by the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, if it is required, to boost international investment to this country to the highest level we can achieve, not alone this year but in future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention <Col N="2730" /> has been drawn to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance, 1986</i> regarding employment which states that the prospects for employment growth in manufacturing industry over the next three years cannot be viewed with optimism, yet, the objective of the White Paper is to secure increases in the order of 3,000-6,000 jobs per annum; and if he will make a statement on these two conflicting statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement in the <i>Review of Industrial Performance, 1986</i> that the immediate prospects for employment growth in manufacturing industry cannot be viewed with optimism.  I understand that the revision of the employment projection compared with that set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy published by the Government in 1984 followed a detailed analysis of manufacturing performance for the years 1980 to 1986.  This analysis indicated that poor output performance in the traditional industry sectors resulted in a high level of job loss and that a sustained output recovery across broad sectors of industry would be required to reverse that trend.</P>
      <P>The present Government's strategy as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, is to stimulate overall economic growth which I am confident will lead to a resumption of net employment growth in manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the Minister refer to the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> or perhaps I missed it.  The question is basically about trying to reconcile the conflict which is implicit in the White Paper and its expectations and in the <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> published by the Minister's Department, a much under-considered document.  The two are clearly at odds and I wonder how does the Minister reconcile that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in reconciling it.  As I said, the previous Government produced a White Paper on Industrial Policy.  I am sure the Deputy knows full well that it included a growth <Col N="2731" /> target of between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs per annum in net manufacturing employment. The <i>Review of Industrial Performance</i> shows exactly what happened. The projection in the White Paper was for 3,000 to 6,000 jobs per year in net manufacturing employment during the following ten years.  This document shows that instead of gaining 3,000 to 6,000 jobs we lost 6,000 jobs in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of the question is to establish the purpose of White Papers and the purpose of Departments who produce White Papers.  If they are so erroneous and so wide off the mark that they are 100 per cent off target, how can the Minister defend that?  I am not blaming him personally but I am talking about the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy can blame the Department of Industry and Commerce in that regard. It is the Government's decision at the end of the day to accept or reject the plans put to them.  When a White Paper on industrial policy is published that is Government policy.  It is not the policy of any particular Department.  It is Government policy and they have to take full responsibility for it and for what happens afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that publications by the Government are based on submissions by Departments and that the actual writing of the document is more often done by the Department?

      <P>I am aware that co-operatives are restricted in the amount of share capital they can raise from each member, in the registration of charges against their assets, and that they cannot advertise for funds, but co-operatives have been very successful in devising systems to get around that.

      <P>My question was not dealing with specific instances but referred to the fact that the Minister's Department have been advised as of October 1986 of the need for updating the legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in France, Spain and the United Kingdom there has been legislative change specifically to define co-operatives?  Is he further aware of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses last year which looked at co-operatives and recommended in this regard? If the Minister talks to ICOS or anybody else he will find there is a compelling need to bring forward such legislation.  Will he consider as a matter of urgency drafting <Col N="2735" /> legislation not only to define co-operatives but to allow a sinking fund for profits to be put back into co-operatives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynold</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports the Deputy mentioned and I am also aware that co-operatives recognise distinct business structures based on internationally agreed co-operative principles and want restrictions on the use of the word co-operatives.  There are many areas to be teased out and analysed.  It is not just a question of giving an immediate answer as to when possible changes might take place.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we could impress on the Minister the need to move this matter slightly higher on the Government's list of priorities.  He will appreciate that there are small co-operatives with the potential of creating a few jobs. We are not talking about the large co-operatives which are capable of establishing subsidaries.  Would the Minister accept that there is a need to enhance the legal position of small co-operatives <i>vis-á-vis</i> banking and other lending institutions, so that they could be in a stronger position to launch themselves in the initial stages?  This has proved to be one of the major drawbacks in terms of job self-help, an area this Government are so anxious to promote.</P>

As I pointed out, there are about 70 worker co-operatives operating here and they have obviously found a way around these problems.  The reports mentioned by the <Col N="2736" /> Deputies are being analysed in the Department.  If I can do anything to help these people I shall be only too pleased to do so.

Indeed we have a major interest in seeing that our trading partners abide by their international obligations. Consequently, it is advisable for us to be seen to observe the rules.  This was recognised by the previous Government when, last September, Ireland made a commitment in the GATT to observe a standstill on the introduction of new protective measures and to roll back existing measures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>On 14 January 1987, the then Government approved, subject to certain conditions, the NÉT-ICI joint venture which has not required financial investment by either NÉT or ICI.</P>
      <P>While job losses are not expected to arise as a result of the joint venture, which, incidentally, will provide the best means of securing employment in NÉT against the very difficult trading conditions now prevailing in the fertiliser industry, staff levels in the new company at any particular time will, of course, be a matter for the board of the company. NÉT, with whom the position of their two plants has been discussed, have no plans at the present time to discontinue their operations at Arklow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that there was no financial investment from ICI or NÉT.  Therefore, could the Minister say on what basis ICI will get 49 per cent holding in NÉT without any financial input?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the agreement reached was that the plants at Arklow and in the North would be merged with the new company.  I assure the Deputy that there will be no financial investment by either side after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that NÉT handed over 49 per cent of their ownership of these investments without any financial input from ICI?  What is the benefit to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many benefits <Col N="2739" /> to the State in relation to the joint venture, including rationalisation in the market place.  As the Deputy and the House are aware, there is serious overdumping of fertiliser all over the world because of the entry of Third World countries into its manufacture.  The long term strategic objective of NÉT in the joint venture with ICI is to stabilise their future.  The Government approve of the decision in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Why could there not be just a joint venture in marketing? In the approval which the Minister said was given at a Cabinet meeting on 14 January 1987, did conditions apply in relation to consultations with the staff who had made a submission prior to that? If so, does the Minister intend to comply with such conditions in regard to consultations with the workforce and the unions involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>I agree that it has been haphazard and one of the first priorities of the Minister of State for Science and Technology is to carry out a full evaluation of the many areas within the Department of Industry and Commerce and outside it which are spending money on science and technology.  We must be certain that the scarce resources are directed to high priority areas and we must also ask if we can afford to commit the resources necessary for long term strategic research and development. Many industrialised countries have applied a significant amount of their resources to the commercialising of existing technology.  They have improved manufacturing processes and new product development.  That is how we intend to direct expenditure in the future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the IDA have yet completed their feasibility study on the establishment of a futures market in Ireland by the European Mercantile Exchange; if discussions have been held on it with the promoters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to which the Deputy refers involves the setting up of an international futures exchange in Dublin which will provide a location for the carrying on of its main activity of offering price or interest rate protection for individuals and businesses exposed to fluctuations in the prices of commodities or financial instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2743" /> There have been many discussions with the promoters of this project over the past two years but it was only in October 1986 that the promoters of the European Mercantile Exchange applied to the Industrial Development Authority for assistance towards the cost of carrying out a feasibility study of their proposal. Work carried out to that date in the course of a number of meetings with the IDA was regarded as preliminary and it was proposed to carry out a more indepth study of the feasibility of setting up such an exchange, its position relative to other exchanges, the feasibility of selling seats, financing scenarios, marketing considerations etc.</P>
    <P>In November 1986 the IDA approved a feasibility study grant towards the costs of this exercise.  The study was pursued and the promoters submitted their results to the Minister for Finance on 25 February 1987.  A copy of the study was presented to the IDA subsequently.  No payments have been made in respect of the feasibility study grant and no claims for such have been received by the IDA.</P>
    <P>Discussions continued with the promoters of the European Mercantile Exchange, and in March 1987, the Government decided to establish a working group under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance and including representatives of my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank of investigate the proposal.</P>
    <P>Clearly a development of substantial significance for the advancement of consideration of this proposal was the end-April announcement by the Government of their intention to provide in the Finance Bill 1987 for the extension of the 10 per cent corporation profits tax regime to income from financial services provided in the Customs House Dock site.</P>
    <P>Finally, many of the wider aspects for consideration in relation to the establishment of a European Merchantile Exchange are being covered in the broader work being undertaken in relation to the establishment of a Financial Services Centre in the Custom House Docks site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the enormous potential of a futures market in Ireland and the growth of futures markets in other parts of the world?  For example, in Chicago contracts increased from 90 million in 1982 to 150 million in 1984.  Would the Minister agree that there is a direct and indirect jobs potential of 1,000 jobs if such a centre was established in Ireland; that most of the business conducted would be foreign business which would bring stability to those seeking a hedge against a particular currency, and that such a development would be extremely welcome in this country and should be encouraged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with and accept what the Deputy has said.  The development of such a futures exchange market in Ireland has vast potential in respect of the various areas of foreign exchange, commodity dealings etc., but I am sure the Deputy will accept that the Governments move in setting up an international financial service sector in the dock site will be investigating and finding solutions to the many problems which existed before this decision was made, and that the evaluation of this project will continue in conjunction with the development of the international financial services sector in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister correctly to say in his reply that a working party was set up, further to the feasibility study which took place in conjunction with the IDA and others, to specifically look at a futures market?  When will that working party complete their work and what timescale will be given for decisions to be made in relation to exchange control or to the tax changes which may be necessary?  In other words, would it be possible to have the preliminary work completed in a matter of three months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The study was pursued and the promoters submitted their results to the Minister for Finance on 25 February 1987.  A copy of this study was presented to the IDA subsequently.  Discussions continued with the promoters of <Col N="2745" /> the European Mercantile Exchange and in March 1987 the Government decided to set up a working group under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance and including representatives of my Department.  Therefore, it is the Minister and the Department of Finance who are spearheading it in that direction.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the questions which will have to be addressed in relation to a futures market are very similar, if not the same in many instances, to the ones which will have to be addressed in relation to exchange control.  The Deputy can take it that the questions will be pursued on the lines I have outlined today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I think the Minister is agreeing that the working party was in operation after the result of the feasibility study.  I do not entirely agree that the two are linked.  They are related but one could go ahead without the other. Can the Minister tell us specifically when will the work of the working party to which he has referred be completed and what timescale is going to be given for decisions to be made in relation to exchange control?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will give an up-to-date progress report on actions taken to implement the specific undertakings outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which arise in relation to his Department.</P>

      <P>Although it is only two months since I took over responsibility for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I am sure the Deputy will see from my reply that I have been far from idle in this short period.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in my budget speech of 1 April 1987, I reiterated the words of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> when I spoke about the necessity of promoting a strong and competitive industrial sector.  I referred to the importance of developing strong exporting established firms and the need to integrate competitive technology with the needs of industry.  In recognition of the importance of these areas and in line with the published proposals in our programme, the Offices of Trade and Marketing and Science and Technology are now established in my Department.</P>
      <P>Initiatives to support enterprise in trade and industry are ongoing within my Department.  These include an intensive programme to restore Ireland's attractiveness as a location for foreign investment, increased emphasis on technology and marketing, indigenous industry development and the development of export services, especially financial services.</P>
      <P>I am also identifying ways in which my Department could reduce costs to industry.  In the insurance area these include a concentrated action by all interests involved in the areas of safety at work and on the road, legal costs and uninsured driving.  The Deputy will recognise that these steps are all consistent with and outlined in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too many rules and regulations also contribute to costs to industry.  Therefore, as was proposed in our programme, I am closely examining what action can be taken to simplify or abolish complicated or obsolete rules, regulations and information requirements which impact on industry.  In addition, I am having a detailed examination conducted on export documentation with a view to identifying areas where simplified procedures can be introduced.  I see this as a key element in reducing export costs and <Col N="2747" /> improving our ability to reach export markets with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, my Department are undertaking a detailed review of the agencies associated with the implementation of the Government's industrial policy.</P>
    <P>This Government have recognised and our programme specifically referred to the fact that the key to industrial expansion lies in our ability to identify and capture export outlets and I am giving particular attention to this area.  To this end I have asked Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council to set up a mechanism, in liaison where necessary with the CII, to identify potential export products. The Export Promotion Bill which I hope to introduce shortly will require CTT to concentrate its assistance on firms which have adopted a strategic marketing approach to exporting.  In addition, I am considering establishing an export services marketing committee under the aegis of my Department to co-ordinate the export of services.</P>
    <P>In a broader context, the Government have entered into discussions with the social partners.  The arrangement envisaged would enable the social partners to bring forward and discuss with Government their contributions to an integrated medium-term programme for national recovery.  A number of joint working parties are being established at official level with the social partners to consider proposals for the programme.  These working parties are to report back to further meetings which would take place between the Government and the social partners.</P>

      <P>On group marketing and exports; the Deputy is already aware of the announcement to establish export trading houses.  The tax incentives regime for those will be reflected in this year's Finance Bill.  It is a question of recognising the weaknesses which exist in smaller Irish companies to internationally market their products and services.  The same is true of some medium-sized companies. It is a glaring weakness which everybody has identified.  This is a first step.  With the establishment of export trading houses who have a very strong presence in the marketplace, they will have the expertise and the financial muscle to penetrate and stay in the markets. Irish manufacturing companies, small and medium, can sell their products <Col N="2749" /> to export trading houses which, in turn, will sell them into the various markets around the world.  That is a situation which many of those companies would not be able to achieve based on their own financial resources or the finance available to them.</P>

As the House knows, the attractiveness of a 10 per cent corporate tax regime there is evident when one considers that if a similar company had been set up before that decision was taken the tax regime would be 50 per cent.  There is a definite incentive there and we expect a fair response in regard to the setting up of group marketing. In relation to import substitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Health Policy: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Col N="2801" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to make four main points in relation to the general question of public policy regarding health.  It is important that we should bear in mind that this discussion is not just about financing the health services.</P>
      <P>First, there is the underlying mistake that has permeated the discussions all this week, that throwing more money at the health service is synonymous with having improved standards of health care, or indeed improved standards of general public health.  That is a simplistic and somewhat blinkered approach to the issue.  It does the kernel of the problem a disservice.  The kernel is not so much the level of resources we use but how we use them pursuant to policy.  The assumption is based on a very artificial notion about our health services.  That notion is that we have a health service.  I submit that we do not.  I believe that we have a sickness service, one which deals with illness and does not deal with education towards good health and the prevention of those problems that create ill-health.</P>
      <P>Secondly &mdash; and to me this is fundamental and I would really appreciate if the Minister could address it &mdash; there is the need to change from the present system of disbursement of public funds in the health service, a system which is loaded with built-in vested interests at every level, where all involved receive payments, grants and disbursements based on the amount of service, the frenzy of activity rather than the quality of results or the absence of illness.  How can we seriously expect a system to be efficient if it depends for its financial benefits, in terms of who receives them, on there being more illness, more beds, more wards, more hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, there has been a great deal of unjustified, unsustainable and irresponsible comment during the last week about the funding of the health service. The bottom line is that this year, as every other year, there is more money being spent on the health service than last year. That is in keeping with what happens <Col N="2802" /> each year when the amount spent is greater than that for the year before.  But it is never enough and there are people in this House who will always ask for more.  They have no responsibility and no prospect of having responsibility as to where it comes from.  I have no doubt that in years to come we will look back at this era and in view of the incredible pressure and ferment of criticism that has developed over the last number of weeks, we will perhaps come to the conclusion that we have had the worst of all worlds, that we have had all of the controversy, the vilification of the Opposition and the political shenanigans arising from the health cuts but, unfortunately, we have not had the economic benefits of genuine constraint in the health services.</P>
    <P>My fourth point is our absolute lack of confidence in the present capacity of the Department of Health, to some extent by virtue of the statutes which affect them, either to shed new light on improvements in the health care generally, or indeed in the specific context of financing health, to be adequately accountable for taxpayers' money.  There is ample evidence of that.</P>
    <P>The simplistic approach that our sickness service demands more and more money, that if it does not get more money we will naturally have a decaying service is fundamentally wrong and based on a false notion of what good health is about. We have an acceptance that it is essential that everybody be bombarded with a campaign to buy more drugs, to attend hospitals more often, a whole approach which is about making profits, about generating business.  The health services as they operate now are essentially a business, not a social service.  I will quote from a book called <i>Holistic Health</i> by a writer called Lawrence LeShan who said:</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous amount of propaganda from drug companies and their advertising agencies to the effect that our bodies do not work and are constantly in danger of decomposing from one thing or another.  We must, we are warned, keep a large variety of drugs available, or we will certainly be <Col N="2803" /> overcome with everything from dandruff through haemorrhoids to athlete's foot.  Not a single system of the body (excluding those like the lymphatic that the lay public does not really believe exist) is exempted from the threat that it cannot function well by itself or recover unaided if it becomes disordered.</P>
    <P>He develops that theme that we need constant pepping up, sedating down, medical attention, trips to hospitals, and prescribing.  I doubt if there is a house in the country that has not one or two boxes of outdated unwanted drugs in a cupboard somewhere.  This is about business, not about good health.  Good health should take into account the fundamental need to have on our schools curriculum a programme for education for health which embraces the issue of diet, physical and mental exercise and a whole range of issues which have nothing to do with a drug-addicted society, a whole positive attitude towards the fact that the body is self-healing given reasonable opportunities. That is a fundamental approach to redressing what we have assumed to be the way to good health.</P>
    <P>The second thing which arises logically from that is that we have a system which is permeated by the profit motive.  That profit motive extends right down to the health boards.  It is a preposterous notion that the health boards should have on them members whose incomes depend on how they disburse public funds.  Do we really expect them to do what is necessary in the public interest?  It is asking too much to think that they will never succumb to the temptation to make a profit.  That profit motive permeates every level.</P>
    <P>There are other societies where those engaged in medicine are rewarded in direct ratio to the amount of time they are not called upon, implying that if they are doing their job well they are not active.  A system that allows people to be paid in relation to the number of calls on them is nonsense and inevitably people will be tempted to use the opportunities <Col N="2804" /> for maximising their income.  That is fundamentally wrong.  It is wrong when we see it at health board level, where the people involved are at least open to the suspicion that consciously or otherwise they are developing an environment in which they can maximise their own incomes and where if there are cutbacks they affect those at the cliff face, and that is what we are witnessing.  George Bernard Shaw summed it up relatively well when he said that any sane nation having observed that one could provide for the supply of bread by giving bakers a pecuniary interest in baking, and should then go on to give surgeons a pecuniary interest in cutting off one's leg is enough to make one despair of political humanity.  That sums it up well enough.</P>
    <P>If I were politically cute, I would keep my head down and say nothing, but the allocations this year surely do not justify the headlines we have seen saying that the health services are in chaos and the particularly emotive, offensive and exploitative programmes which have used old people for the purpose of putting pressure on this House to obtain more scare resources, a highly questionable procedure.  Those allocations, limited and constricted as they may be, do not justify that kind of heat and steam.  Those allocations show that in the case of every health board except one, there is this year a greater allocation than last year.  I would be the first to admit that in areas there might not be enough.  Nobody has ever had enough yet.  The reality is that we are living way beyond our means and it cannot continue.  Those who cry and bleat for more should say where it is to come from.</P>
    <P>The one health board did not get more; it got £600,000 less which I am sure is a matter of discomfort for them but it should not result in the closure of hospitals and hospital wards in sensitive areas relating, for instance, to child assault and rape, unless there is a deliberate policy for some reason.  Those who are at local and middle management level who administer these allocations in a selective way are being deliberately selective for reasons that have nothing to do <Col N="2805" /> with the wellbeing of those who attend those hospitals.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the health services have expanded dramatically. Since the mid-seventies the health service has grown tenfold, and more than double in real terms.  Staff totals in the health boards have grown from less than 24,000 in 1971 to 57,000 today and yet some people ask for more. It is not a question of more resources, it is a question of making better use of existing resources.  There are no more resources and there will not be any more resources.  The miracle is that these resources are available because most of them are borrowed.  The sad part about the use of the resources is that it is very difficult to have confidence in the way they are overseen.  The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report, Appropriation Accounts 1981 in paragraph 72 under the Health Estimates said:</P>
    <P>The accounts of certain Voluntary Hospitals are audited by Local Government Auditors whose reports are made available to me.  One such report examined by my officers in the year under review related to the audit of the 1979 accounts of a Voluntary Hospital which in that year had 94 per cent of its running costs financed by grants from this subhead.  In 1981 grants paid to this Hospital amounted to £7 million approximately.</P>
    <P>And he goes on:</P>
    <P>In his report dated 28 July 1981 the Local Government Auditor referred to a number of deficiencies in internal control and accounting procedures. These included erroneous and inconclusive bank reconciliations....</P>
    <P>The position was the same in 1982.  In regard to that year he said:</P>
    <P>The Accounts of the Health Boards are audited by Local Government Auditors whose reports are made available to me.  In his report dated 16 August 1982 on the audit of the accounts of the Eastern Health Board for the years 1979 and 1980 the Local <Col N="2806" /> Government Auditor drew attention to a number of accounting and control deficiencies as a result of which he was unable to satisfy himself as to the accuracy, reliability and completeness of the Board's accounts and records and was unable to form an opinion as to the fairness of the results and financial position as presented....</P>
    <P>In 1983 referring to the expenditure of the North Eastern Health Board he said:</P>
    <P>The Board's expenditure in the three years totalled approximately £71 million ... As control deficiencies such as those referred to by the Local Government Auditor can lead to an increase in the Board's grant requirements I asked the Accounting Officer what action was being taken by the Department of Health to ensure that such deficiencies are rectified.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies he was referring to were his inability to obtain &ldquo;satisfactory audit evidence of the proper receipt, issue and custody of stocks of such goods including medical supplies and equipment&rdquo;. He said that the value of such items purchased in 1979 was £3.3 million.</P>
    <P>The position was the same in 1984 when he stated that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>A concerted attempt had been made to charge expenditure incurred in 1982 to the 1981 accounts and that the measures employed to achieve this included, inter alia, the alteration of the dates on suppliers' invoices....</P>
    <P>To my way of thinking that would be a criminal activity.  He went on to develop the same theme in 1985. Those reports are available annually to the Government. What has been done about those systematic deficiencies and distortions? The former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, said he had told the health boards they could not spend what they had not been allocated but they did so while he was Minister and continued to do so.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues one could raise in the context of these anomalies but this boils down to our inability to have confidence in that accounting procedure. <Col N="2807" /> For example, we have not heard a word from any side of the House about the fact that on average it costs more than twice as much to provide a hospital meal for staff in hospitals than the charge made for it and that the menu is different from that for the patients.  What about that subsidy?  We have not heard any suggestion about the fact that it costs four times as much to issue a birth or death certificate than the charge made for them. Could that be corrected?  We have not heard any suggestion about the failure of the Department of Health to deal with their statutory obligations in a number of areas relating to the provision of services or in regard to a list of matters some of which I referred to in a written question today.  What about the significantly higher level of doctor visitation and prescribing to GMS patients over private patients?  That cannot be explained away by the supposed inferior health status of medical card holders.  We have not heard anything about the virtual non-existence of a dental service for medical card holders although that is a statutory entitlement.</P>
    <P>The confusion, costs and duplication in the system of inspection of food and food premises by the Departments of Health and Agriculture has not been referred to. The Minister has failed to insist on up to date audited accounts.  It is preposterous that every year we allocate to these health boards moneys where they have not shown &mdash; in some cases they have shown with certain unhappy overtones &mdash; that they have used wisely or well previous allocations.  I suggest that we should insist on an annual report and accounts for the previous full year prepared to an acceptable standard and laid before the Dáil at least 90 days before any budget which includes an additional provision for them is considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I asked the Department of Health a long time ago to answer questions about Jervis Street Hospital but the hospital refused to give that information.  I am not saying that the Department of Health get sufficient money or that discomfort and <Col N="2808" /> distress is not being caused but some attempt to redress the imbalance is appropriate.  A lot of the over-reaction engendered this week is unjustified.  In all fairness the general thrust of the Government's policy should be supported although I wish they scrutinised general guidelines on how the cuts are to be adopted.</P>
    <P>If they remove the profit motive from the prescribing of medicines and so on we might get better value for our money and better health which is what this is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Mac Giolla, and those anxious to contribute, get an opportunity to do so.  I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to a debate which has been conducted in a calm way, particularly in the aftermath of what has been a stressful time for those in the health services and, in particular, the Minister and his officials.  The approach which the Government have taken to the funding of the health services in 1987 must be seen in the context of the economic situation in which we find ourselves. The very survival of the country as an independent society requires that firm action be taken to rectify the imbalance in the public finances.  It is almost universally acknowledged that this crisis can realistically be tackled only through a reduction in levels of public expenditure. The level of expenditure in recent years has reflected an unrealistically high rate of activity in the public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a basic principle for the effective development of health services, and one which is maintained by the World Health Organisation, that services should be <Col N="2809" /> effective and delivered at a cost that can be sustained.  It is not a realistic option for a community to plan for a level of public services, including health services, which ultimately undermine the very productive base which enables such services to be afforded.  This strikes me in my Department.  There is a natural aspiration by people towards a greater delivery of services as they expand but sometimes people lose sight of the fact that the only way they can be expanded is through a productive base in the country. If that gets out of hand a halt has to called.  The Government are trying to maintain a balance in public expenditure to allow for a modest growth and the maintaining of essential services in all Departments.</P>
    <P>The Government are pleased that this prudent approach to public expenditure is already beginning to show results in generating an environment which shows growth and investment.  The recent fall in interest rates is merely the first indication of the new situation.  In association with prudent economic management the Government have embarked on a comprehensive programme of development to ensure that the productive sector develops in such a way as to improve living standards and the viable public services which are essential for a humane society.  We are involved in a complex balancing act between how far we can go in the containment of public expenditure while at the same time running in tandem with that trying to achieve growth in areas that will allow an upturn in economic activity.</P>
    <P>In tackling the level of public expenditure the Government are determined to ensure that an adequate level of health care will be provided for the public.  They are satisfied that this can be done within the level of resources provided for the health services in 1987 &mdash; a sum of £1,300 million which shows an increase on that provided in 1986.  The Government would, of course, wish to be in a position to provide a higher level of funding but this simply is not possible.  I believe that the majority of Members share this view. What is important now is that the <Col N="2810" /> resources available are managed in the best possible way to ensure an effective and efficient health service for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Hanlon took office two months ago he advised the various health agencies of their allocations for 1987, allocations which should have been issued by the former Minister.  The fact that he did not do so meant that health agencies had less time than they would otherwise have had to make the economies necessary this year.  Their task has therefore been made more difficult.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that guidelines were not issued to health agencies by the Minister for Health on how they should frame their budgets must be refuted.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Specific guidelines were issued and elaborated upon at meetings held by the Minister for Health with the chairman and chief executives of all health boards and voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Tribute should be paid to the very open manner in which the Minister met immediately with all the agencies involved.  There was no skulking in his office.  He met them openly and discussed their problems and is doing so even at this moment.  He has shown remarkable courage in the way he has faced up to the difficulties he has had to encounter.  I take grave exception to the way in which the Minister has been depicted in the newspapers, both pictorially and verbally. The newspapers are not to blame because they only report what they see and what is put in front of them.  Panic has been engendered among the public at large and this is not a reflection of a caring attitude towards the sick and those who are in need of services.  The fact that one person has been singled out for public odium is reprehensible because the decisions for which he is blamed were taken by the Cabinet as a whole.  All 15 Cabinet members played their part.  It is crude and clumsy to blame one person who happens to hold the portfolio at a particular Department.  This is a point of view I always held during my four years in Opposition.  The matter on hand should never be personalised.  One may attack <Col N="2811" /> Government policy but never a particular Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I never engaged in a debate in this House with Deputy Barry Desmond.  The Minister made it quite clear to the health boards that community care services were to be protected as far as possible, including services for the old and house-bound, services for the mentally handicapped and child care services. He asked the agencies to secure the necessary economies as far as possible in the institutional area and in particular in the acute hospital sector where we have higher bed capacity than we require.</P>
      <P>I would also make some observations on the personnel issues surrounding the implementation of Government policy within the health service.  Because of the particular manpower structure required within the health services, the instructions issued by the Minister allow a significant degree of flexibility to local management.  While individual health agencies are required to reduce numbers employed by a given quantum, there is discretion to provide that key posts becoming vacant may be filled so as to maintain essential service levels.  In addition, and where possible, local management will be given a high degree of autonomy in arriving at the appropriate staff mix within their areas of responsibility.</P>

    <P>I now refer to the blatant attacks which have been made on those health service staff who work within the clerical and administrative stream.  The unwarranted attacks on people in that sector bear no relation to the amount of work these people put into the system.  They are being used as a convenient scapegoat by groups who say on the one hand that they support the prudent management of health resources but want on the other <Col N="2812" /> hand to make a public show of apportioning blame.  Today they blame the Minister, tomorrow they blame the Department and the following day they blame the administrative staff.  They want to be seen by the public at large to be financially prudent and aware of fiscal rectitude because they know it is the <i>plat du jour</i>, but they need to find a scapegoat whom they can blame in their constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>But may I continue? The Chair is referring to the other ladies. The hype created by the PDs and certain other people in relation to these staff is at best misinformed and at worst malicious. To someone not directly involved with the health services, it smacks of taking an easy and simplistic option.  The delivery of health care is a complex task requiring a full range of expertise incorporated in a single team.  The clerical person who makes the appointment, collects the charges, pays the allowances and assesses eligibility services, the doctor who provides the treatment, the nurse <Col N="2813" /> who provides the care and the domestic and maintenance staff all have a vital role to play in the efficient and effective delivery of the services.  It is quite odious to &ldquo;ghettoise&rdquo; a particular group and say that if they were wiped out overnight there would be no trouble in the health service.</P>
      <P>Clerical and administrative personnel account for only some 10 per cent of all health service staff and some four-fifths of those who are engaged in the direct delivery of services to the public.  They are the people who make the appointments, operate medical record systems, provide reception facilities and act as secretaries to medical consultants, as well as providing the other administrative support services, including the collection of charges, payment of allowances, etc.  The remaining very small portion of clerical and administrative personnel function in the headquarters of health boards and other health agencies.</P>
      <P>Since the issuing of the allocations, officials from the Department of Health have met the management of each health board and voluntary hospital and they are currently engaged in the co-ordination of the plans of the various agencies to ensure the coherence of the service being provided across the country.  The Minister stated earlier that the hospital services division of his Department, with the assistance of Comhairle na nOspidéal, will start further consultations in each health board area next week and that the results are to be considered globally in the Department to ensure that adequate services are provided regionally and nationally.  It is difficult to see what more can be done by the Minister to ensure that the actions taken by the various agencies are fully integrated.</P>
      <P>Let none of us be so naive as to expect that the measures necessary to control public expenditure will not impact on services.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that. The impact on services should have been <Col N="2814" /> obvious for some time, and it was emphasised by the previous Government in their January Book of Estimates which the lady Deputies opposite wish to forget. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, that Government failed in their duty to take the necessary remedial action both in relation to this year and in relation to the control of expenditure for their previous four years in office.  This has placed the present Government in an intolerable position.  It is perfectly obvious that the Deputies opposite were part of a Government who wished to impose upon medical card holders a prescription charge.</P>

      <P>While the Government have mitigated much of the hardship which would have resulted from certain of the measures proposed by the previous Government, they were never going to be in a position to satisfy all of the demands on the health services.  I am under no illusion about the difficulties which face providers of health services in the current year, difficulties which have been caused largely by the mismanagement of previous years.  The very tough measures which are required will require tough action by health boards and hospitals but I am satisfied that, despite the economy measures necessary, the level of funding provided is sufficient to ensure an effective health service can be provided and I am heartened by the constructive approach adopted by my own board area who have always managed their own affairs in a very good way.</P>

      <P>Everybody is in favour of rationalisation in principle. However, it is clear from some of the contributions made in this House in recent days that many members of the Opposition can cope with rationalisation only in the abstract.  Everybody is in favour of having dump sites but not in their neighbourhood.  Everybody is in favour of rationalisation but please, Sir, not in their health board area.  Once flesh <Col N="2815" /> is put on a proposal they are unwilling to accept the consequences.  Was this the reason the Fine Gael Government when they were at that long, secret meeting for six or seven weeks failed to issue the allocations to the health boards?  They wanted to run away from what they had to do.</P>
      <P>Great credit is due to all concerned for the early publication of the new provision in the VHI scheme.  I think it will be taken up by a great many people and will continue to be utilised.  In all large organisations potential cost savings can be found through increased efficiency, as Deputy Keating mentioned.  The organisations within each structure may need assistance in identifying and implementing these.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to say a few words in this debate.  I regret the time has to be so short because one could say so much about this important subject.  We have been talking here for the past three days about the reduction in the health budget.  I have just listened to the Minister speaking and I am shocked at her final comments pointing out an increase in the health budget this year over last year.  Of course there was an increase, but we are talking about 3.5 per cent inflation and we need an increase of 3.5 per cent to keep on par.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in my health board, for example, are £200,000 in a budget of £107 million.  I heard the Minister say that her health board had come to grips with the difficult situation they face.  Let me point out that hers was one of the health boards that got the lion's share of that increase in that they got the second largest increase in the country.  That is what has other health boards in a very difficult situation including the Western Health Board of which I am a member.  The Western Health Board are faced with the prospect of cutting 470 jobs just now and with depriving vast numbers of people of a medical service in the next few years.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to ensure that health boards get an increase in allocation.  It is impossible for the health board of which I am a member to survive.  We are faced with massive closures in Castlebar, in the Regional Hospital, Galway, in Merlin Park, Galway and the total elimination of services at Roscommon County Hospital.  In Roscommon 130 beds are being closed down, 130 nurses and medical staff are <Col N="2818" /> being let go, surgical services are being transferred to Castlebar, medical services are being transferred to Galway Regional Hospital and the surgical hospital is being closed down.  Neither I nor other members of the Western Health Board can tolerate this because 55,000 of the population served by the Western Health Board will be left without service.  Unfortunately no individual in that catchment area of the health board lives nearer than 50 miles of the Regional Hospital in Galway; some would live up to 100 miles. The Minister has allowed a disgraceful position to obtain within the Western Health Board.  I note that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Treacy, is present to seek an additional allocation for the Western Health Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the disastrous effect the closure of Roscommon County Hospital will have on the whole of the Roscommon region, I should appeal to the Minister of State to use his influence with the Minister for Health, between now and tomorrow, to ensure that we are given an additional allocation.  Our allocation has been reduced so drastically it will be impossible for us to maintain any level of service within the Western Health Board area. The structure of the services will be totally dismantled.  If we do not receive this additional allocation I am afraid that people in Roscommon will die through lack of services because beds will not be available in other institutions in Mayo <Col N="2819" /> and Galway to cater for the population of Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to ensure we are given this additional allocation.  He is from the west himself and knows the devastating effect lack of funds will have on the health services there.  I know also that the Minister of State, Deputy N. Treacy, is a man of the people.  I appeal to him to do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I spoke in this House on the budget and complimented the Minister on being open about his proposals. However, in my contacts since with the local health board I had considerable difficulty in ascertaining what alternatives there were to the Minister's proposals, whether there were any choices available, or how such decisions had been arrived at.  I am utterly disappointed that the decision of the chief executive officer of our health board is to close four hospitals in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in Government I listened intently on two or three occasions to the present Minister for Health talk about the problems being encountered in Ennis County Hospital. Indeed I was harassed on numerous occasions when I spoke of my support for that hospital.  The Mid-Western Health Board now propose to reduce the number of beds in this hospital from 130 to 80. Only last year there was a major investment in this hospital.  In addition there was a mammography unit, an ultra-sound machine and other equipment installed in that hospital.  There is grave disquiet generally in County Clare about the way these proposals are being handled.  Anybody who has seen correspondence about proposals to the Minister will readily appreciate that alternatives or choices have not been considered.  In the case of the closure of psychiatric beds in County Clare, had the Minister or the health board offered the relevant institutions to <Col N="2820" /> the private sector to continue the services, then there would be some type of alternative available to the people of County Clare who are appalled at the ham-fisted manner in which these matters are being conducted.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, who is a member of the medical profession, to take some note of his fellow practitioners who sent me a petition on behalf of the Irish College of General Practitioners. They expressed their shock and disbelief at the proposed cuts in the health services in the Clare area, contending that they are haphazard, unplanned with little consideration having been given to their consequences.  That document was signed by the chairman of the Clare branch, Dr. Feore, by its treasurer, Dr. Michael Harty and its secretary, Dr. Michael Kelleher, who incidentally is a member of the Minister's party.  He was brave enough last Sunday to hold a collection for Fianna Fáil in Lahinch.  At the same time he has appeared on protest platforms all over County Clare indicating his opposition to the closure of Ennistymon Hospital.</P>
    <P>The proposals of the Department of Health to contain expenditure in the Clare area has not been thought through. There should be full exposure of the relevant plan and any alternatives so that the public might at least get to grips with some of the difficulties confronting them. For example, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if four hospitals were to be closed in your constituency what would be the reaction of the local population?  One can readily appreciate the feelings in County Clare with the proposed closure of the St. John of God's maternity unit.  As Deputy Ahern said earlier today, the provision of this maternity service in Ennis has been on the cards since 1968.  At present some people have to travel 70 miles to Ennis; they will now have to travel 90 miles.  The reason for the proposed closure of this unit is beyond me.  There are contractual obligations between the Mid-Western Health Board and the Sisters in St. John of God's unit in Ennis which oblige them to provide that service for <Col N="2821" /> ten years with a three-year option of closure. In a submission of the Mid-Western Health Board to the Minister as recently as yesterday they say they will terminate this gynaecology service in Ennis and transfer it to Limerick.  There has been no estimation of the cost or any consideration of the obligations involved. The Sisters tell me they will take every penny they can, contending that the Department of Health and the Mid-Western Health Board put them in their present position of being severely in debt. I would appeal to the Minister to have his officials examine the matter of the St. John of God Hospital in Ennis before the Mid-Western Health Board tear it asunder.</P>

      <P>I did indicate to Deputy Mac Giolla earlier that I thought he would have five minutes.  The Order of the House requires me to call the Minister at 4.40 p.m.  Perhaps the Minister would agree to cede two minutes of his time so that I could call on Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party have always held &mdash; this was contained in a document seven or eight years ago&mdash; that the medical services were wasteful in expenditure, that we could have a free, comprehensive health service for the percentage of gross national product we spend on our health services at present. Even if the powerful and wealthy interests entrenched in the system were taken on politicially, if patients were put first, we could have a free, comprehensive service for 7.5 per cent of gross national product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the real purpose of the £10 charge is to dismantle the general hospital scheme, replacing it with an insurance-based hospital service for 60 per cent of the population.  The Tussing report did propose such a £10 charge for hospital services.  At the same time they recommended that there should be a free-for-all general practitioner service introduced.  That would encourage <Col N="2822" /> people to go to their general practitioner rather than availing of the provisions of the expensive hospitals scheme.  The people who must now pay this £10 charge are those just above the poverty level, beyond eligibility for a medical card, but in receipt of an income of less than £15,000.  These are the same people who pay the health contribution of 1.25 per cent of their salaries.  Those in receipt of incomes above £15,000 do not pay it.  This means that those who pay this 1.25 per cent contribution get less service and now will have to pay the £10 charge as well. People with incomes in excess of £15,000, contributors to the VHI scheme, will have that charge paid for them by the VHI without any increase in premium.</P>
    <P>It should be rememberd that health contributions are not collected from the farmers and the self-employed.  There are millions outstanding in that respect, with no interest having to be paid on such outstanding amounts whereas interest must be paid on arrears of income tax. We maintain that the 1.25 per cent contribution should be payable on all income.  Furthermore, we contend that interest should be paid on outstanding health contributions with a more vigorous pursuit of defaulters.  We point out also that there is £33 million tax relief on premiums payable to the VHI, £1.5 million of that relief now being devoted to the care of the élite in the Blackrock and Mater Private Hospitals being borne by the taxpayer.  This relief on VHI should be abolished and at the same time eligibility to consultants' services should be extended to all.  The £35 million which would be saved by the abolition of tax relief on VHI would be more than enough to pay the consultants for any extra work involved.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the fee per item system which we have constantly harped on during the years.  It is a blank cheque for doctors and medical practitioners. Doctors themselves have said so.  It encourages over-prescribing and should be replaced by a capitation or salaried system along the lines suggested in the report of the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2823" /> In regard to drugs we have called for a national drugs formulary.  This would be an agreed list of generic drugs &mdash; there are about ten brands or more of every drug &mdash; prescribed within the health service in order to keep prices down.  In regard to the drugs refund scheme, at present in the GMS the State will pay the pharmacist the wholesale price of the drug plus a prescription charge for each item.  Under the drugs refund scheme after the initial £28 per month is paid by the patient the State pays not only the wholesale price and the prescription charge to the chemist but also the 50 per cent mark-up price.  Therefore, in some instances the State pays the pharmacist more under the drugs refund scheme than it would pay both the pharmacist and the doctor if the patient had a medical card and was entitled to all free services.  That is a total waste of money.  Before closing hospital wards or axing jobs the Minister should deal with this scandal in the GMS and with the drugs refund scheme because it is in that area that the real savings can be made.</P>
    <P>The percentage of GNP on health should be frozen at its present level.  The general medical service and the drugs refund scheme should be reformed. Health contributions should be extended to all income levels.  There should be a vigorous pursuit of defaulters with regard to health contributions and interest should be made payable on all health contributions.  Tax relief on VHI premiums should be abolished immediately for the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Hospital and eventually, with proper planning, it should be abolished for all hospitals.  Rational planning and democratic control of the health services is essential.  All these much needed reforms can take place within the present budgetary position.  All we require is for the rich to pay their fair share of taxes and health contributions and for the Government to reform the structures of out health services so that they begin to serve the community rather than the private powerful interest groups embedded within the present structure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2824" /> I wish to refer to a document I received by post this morning.  It is an extraordinary document, a photocopy of a letter to a Minister &mdash; I do not know which Minister &mdash; from the Taoiseach outlining the need for further significant cuts in expenditure on the basis that the public sector debt continues to be a burden on the economy.  It asks the Minister to identify specific programmes where further expenditures and cuts can be made immediately, as early as this summer.  I do not know if that letter was addressed to the Minister for Health but it is calling for further cuts in expenditure in that area.  If the Minister for Health has been asked to make further cuts on top of the ones already being made we would like to know what they are.</P>

      <P>First I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate today. There is general agreement that we cannot go outside our allocation for this year.  That was also highlighted in the debate of the past two nights when both the Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael Party included in their proposal and amendment that we would not exceed our allocation for the current year.  Any disagreement that exists is basically on how the allocations have been made to the health boards and to the voluntary hospitals and the manner in which any savings are being made.  It is important that I say again at his stage, because there seems to be some doubt about it, that we gave very strict guidelines to the agencies as to how we expected savings to be made.  It is also important to point out that the reason they have a difficulty is because of the £55 million over-expenditure in the past two years.  It is accepted by everybody in the House that there was an over expenditure of £55 million; £36 million over-expenditure in 1986 and £19 million over-expenditure in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes laid the blame on the health boards which, he said are dominated by Fianna Fáil members.  I lay the blame fairly and squarely on the Coalition Government, because section 31 of the Health Act is available to the Minister <Col N="2825" /> to ensure that there is no over-expenditure by the health boards.  On the one hand, Deputy Dukes lauded that section and pointed out that the Minister had the power to control spending.  I would like to ask why section 31 was not implemented when he was in Government.  He maintained that the overruns were due to Fianna Fáil dominated health boards and at the same time he recognised that the Government of the day had the power to control the spending of health boards. he was Minister for Finance for part of that Government's period in office but section 31 was not implemented and therefore we have this overrun of £55 million.  That is the basic problem.  People come into this House complaining about various cuts in the number of hospital beds or in staffing arrangements but the responsibility lies fairly and squarely on the Government who allowed the over-expenditure of £55 million.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Carey speaking about County Clare.  In that county no agreement has been reached to date on how savings are to be effected because the health board have not yet finally decided their budget.  I met a deputation from the Mid-Western Health Board yesterday and I hope that at their next meeting they will agree on a budget.  No decision has been made on what hospitals should be closed in County Clare and therefore we are speaking in a vacuum in regard to what might happen following the meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>

We were anxious to protect the frontline staff and to make sure that savings would not be made in that area only.</P>
      <P>A suggestion has been made that no savings are being effected in regard to administrative staff.  From the information I have with regard to the health boards the effects of the allocations and savings are being applied fairly in each area.  It is important to point out in regard to the administrative staff that many of them, although not directly in contact with the patient, provide an absolutely essential service.  The community welfare officers who are administrative staff are in direct contact with the patients.</P>

We are monitoring what is happening in the various health board areas but on the information I have at present, I am satisfied they are effecting savings across the board and that each discipline will be treated in the same manner.

If I were to go over the heads of the South-Eastern Health Board &mdash; which I would not have the right to do because they have statutory responsibility in this area &mdash; and made that decision, I would be told I was being dictatorial and that I was not taking account of the needs of the local people.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a team of senior officials from my Department went to every health board and all 52 voluntary hospitals to discuss how they intended to effect the savings which were necessary this year.  They brought all that information back to the Department and have prepared a report which I am studying at the moment.  I have to ensure that we have an adequate and proper health service in place and that there are no gaps because of the way the voluntary hospitals decided to effect the savings.</P>
      <P>For example, if all the voluntary hospitals in Dublin decided to close the ear, nose and throat departments we would not have an ear, nose and throat service and this would be entirely unacceptable. We are examining how each agency and health board intend to effect their savings and if there are gaps we will look at them to ensure that a proper medical service will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are waiting for the Western and Mid-Western Health Boards to finalise their budget arrangements.  When that is done I will send a group of senior officials to those areas to bring together in a consultative process the health boards and the voluntary hospitals and create an opportunity for the voluntary organisations and the staff interests to make their input into how they see the money should be spent in that area.  We want particularly to bring together the health boards and voluntary hospitals to ensure that there is some rationalisation in the <Col N="2829" /> services they administer.  I am sure everyone will agree that it is essential that we get value for money, and that process will be starting almost immediately, probably next week.</P>
    <P>Following that we will have a national conference on the health services.  We know exactly what has to be done.  I have already announced that we are setting up a review body to look at the funding of the health services.  Everybody must agree that the Exchequer is not in a position to provide the necessary funding to ensure that all the services people wish for will be in place.  I will be announcing the names on that committee within the next ten days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">

The primary health care services, health promotion and preventive services and the managerial arrangements at all levels in the system need to be improved.  All this appeared in our programme for national recovery.  There is nothing new there.  Anyone who read our document before we went to the electorate will have read all about this.  I listened to Deputy Dukes this morning and he said I had not said anything about looking at the structures of the health board and how the services were managed.

      <P>This morning Deputy Dukes suggested we should reduce the number of health boards.  Yet when Deputy Desmond, in Government, brought forward a plan to reduce the number of health boards, he got no support from Fine Gael.  I believe it is appropriate to ask why they have changed their mind now.</P>
      <P>I believe we need a devolved administration in the health boards and I am prepared to look at the structures within the health boards to see how management can be improved.  I have always had a reservation about whether there should be strict demarcation between the programme for community care and hospital care.  I believe if you are serious about shifting resources from hospital to community, there should be an integrated programme rather than two separate compartments.  These are the types of areas we will be looking at.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy raised the question of consultants and the common contract.  I have already spoken to the IMO and intimated our desire to see the review of a common contract commence.  Deputy Desmond suggested their might be a select committee of the House on the health services and I will consider that suggestion.  Whether in Government or in Opposition we all try to ensure that we deliver the highest level of health care for the people we represent.  The Government are providing £13,014 million this year for our public health services.  With the numbers of people working in the health service &mdash; up to 60,000 &mdash; we will provide a proper and adequate service. The people have no need to fear.  In spite of the hype which has been causing anxiety to patients and their relatives, I am satisfied we will provide a proper level of health care this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to allow me to raise this important matter.  It is not the only hospital threatened with closure and, therefore, I am not saying that special consideration should be given to it. However, I want to highlight its specific problems, which can be averted if the Government exercise sensible, sane and rational decision-making, in marked contrast to the panic and chaos they have introduced to the operation of our health services since coming into office so recently.</P>
      <P>The hospital was founded in 1832, it is 155 years old.  It has 193 beds and approximately 350 staff.  Last year it catered for 6,252 patients, with an average stay in hospital of 7.8 days.  Between all the other services and procedures, including out-patients, casualty visits, X-ray examinations and physiotherapy attendance, approximately 90,000 transactions of one kind or another &mdash; 89,646 to be precise &mdash; took place in this hospital.</P>
      <P>It is one of the seven federated voluntary hospitals which, under the FitzGerald plan and the revised plan of the Department of Health, was to be finally located with the current hospital services it provides in St. James's.  That proposal was meant to come into operation in 1989 and it is now unclear if it will because of the effective 18 per cent reduction in this year's allocation.  No one knows what the impact will be on the hospital as a result and what will be its future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose in my raising this on the Adjournment &mdash; I hope the the Minister of State will respond in a like spirit &mdash; is to see, in the panic and chaos surrounding the health services, if some secure rational programme for the future of the hospital can be negotiated directly <Col N="2832" /> between the people involved in the RCDH, the Minister and the Department of Health.  It is important to stress this fact as these negotiations are on a one-to-one level between the hospital and the Department of Health precisely because it is a voluntary hospital.  Any suggestions that this is a matter for the Eastern Health Board or members of the health board to try to take hard and difficult decisions do not apply in this instance.  Neither can the Minister close the hospital as it is a voluntary one.  It is the function and responsibility of the trustees to make that decision.  They do not wish to close the hospital and it is not their intention to do so but, without an adequate level of funding &mdash; I am realistic about the funding they are seeking &mdash; they will have no option but to close it. The Department cannot legally force its closure but it can be starved into submission.</P>
    <P>The closure of the hospital would be a mistake.  The 1989 plan was part of an overall package that presumed in the first instance that St. James's Hospital would be in a position to accommodate and provide all the services currently provided by Sir Patrick Duns, Mercers and Baggot Street.  That is not now the case. The timetable in St. James's is out of line and it will not be in a position to meet the projected delivery of services in 1989. From the very outset, the plan for 1989 is redundant or off course.</P>
    <P>The trustees of the hospital, the board, the staff directly involved and the broader community which saw the closure of Mercers and Sir Patrick Duns and who were partly reassured that on the closure of Sir Patrick Duns many of the facilities for the community would henceforth be carried out by the Royal Hospital, Baggot Street, are now extremely worried about the imminent possibility of closure because of the substantial reduction in the money allocation from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The provision of hospital services &mdash; as I am standing beside Deputy Barry Desmond and facing the Minister of State at the Department of Health I will not attempt to offer expert advice although <Col N="2833" /> much has been written in relation to them &mdash; the cost of primary hospitals with acute beds and the back-up of expensive personnel and equipment must be used in the most efficient way possible.</P>
    <P>There is a clear role for a secondary hospital, like the hospital in Baggot Street, to provide back-up facilities and to take patients out of the acute expensive beds who did not need to be there in the first place and who are preventing acutely ill patients from getting the kind of medical treatment they require.  The area desperately needs the retention of this kind of local community hospital.  It covers Dublin 2, 4 and 6 and, because of the writings of a journalist who hails from the west but has chosen to live in Dublin, the connotation Dublin 4 has a very salubrious image which suggests considerable affluence.  The reality is that many of the population in the catchment area of this hospital are not affluent.  The area stretches all the way from the Iveagh Hostel to Ailesbury Road and there are large sections of inner city communities on very low incomes, with low skills and of an age that is twice the average of the old age level of Dublin city and county. The average percentage population across the city and county of people over 65 years of age and, therefore, more prone to need the services of a hospital and to be hospitalised is approximately 8.5 per cent.  The percentage of the population in the area which I described, out of a total of 200,000 approximately, is 16.9 per cent, double the county average for the city and more than the overall city average itself.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a population who use the hospital on a local basis, who need its services and who are statistically more likely to need them than other sections of the community.  In addition &mdash; our statistics in this country are not as developed as they could and should be &mdash; it is clear that lower income groups have a higher incidence of certain kinds of illnesses and that lower income inner city groups have a particular combination of illnesses, many of them of a respiratory nature, because of pollution.  Any TD who conducts a clinic for that kind of <Col N="2834" /> population will confirm that this is so and I am sure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will agree.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a community that needs a hospital as an absolute necessity and not as a luxury.  Having seen the way that Sir Patrick Duns Hospital was closed with a promise that the services would ultimately be in St. James's and on an interim basis in the Royal Hospital in Baggot Street, people are now looking at the reality of the commitment to provide services which was properly and responsibly given by the former Minister for Health.  It is not now capable of being honoured because the Department of Health have chosen to effectively reduce, in real terms, the allocation for 1987 by 25 per cent as against that for 1986.</P>
    <P>I sought to raise this matter by way of an Adjournment debate because I want to do something constructive in regard to this hospital and because I want to suggest a constructive course of action to the Minister of State at the Department of Health.  He does not need to get any more barraging than he is already getting and I do not believe in indulging in the negative opportunistic politics of the kind Fianna Fáil indulged in when in Opposition. Regrettably for themselves but much more unfortunately for the community at large, they are reaping a very bitter harvest now that they have assumed Government &mdash; perhaps, under false promises.</P>
    <P>Something can be done about this hospital but it can only be done by the Minister.  This is the awesome responsibility of the power which the Government sought so hungrily in January and February of this year.  Assuming that the Minister has the will to act I suggest that the way to proceed has been outlined in a most informative and detailed document which is both properly referenced and researched and prepared by the board of the Royal Hospital.  The title of that document is &ldquo;A New Future&rdquo; and I understand it has been made available to the Department of Health and that a preliminary meeting has already taken place between both sides.  I have been <Col N="2835" /> informed that a further meeting is due to take place.</P>
    <P>Since I sought to raise this matter by way of an Adjournment debate I presume the Minister of State has been briefed by his officials.  If the Minister of State is not in a position today to do so, perhaps he could come back at a more convenient time to give me an assurance on behalf of my constituents who depend on this facility, who through no fault of their own happen to have low incomes, and live in a polluted part of the city and who consequently happen to be more unhealthy than someone who is better fed and better housed.  The people I am concerned with this evening need the continued existence of this hospital.  I am asking that the new programme for survival and for the casting of future for the Royal Hospital be met sympathetically by the Minister and his Department officials.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Royal Hospital is 155 years old.  It has seen many changes and many medical systems.  It has come through economic recessions and depressions.  Its staff have provided an excellent health service and have an extremely good internal and industrial relations record.  They have the will and the commitment to provide a service which, when we look at the comparative figures for other hospitals within the broad framework of the health services, is more economical and efficient and which therefore delivers the better value for money service to which the Minister for Health referred in his speech before I rose to speak on this debate.  The hospital is good value for money for the Department of Health and the taxpayer and is an essential lifeline for the community of the area.  If the Minister responds to my request, it will mean also that the 350 staff will get an indication and some assurance of what the level of their job security is.</P>
    <P>It is because the Government have created an air of panic, crisis and chaos that perhaps more fears and anxiety than was necessary have been aroused.  Therefore, by giving a confirmation of allocation the <Col N="2836" /> Minister of State can make a positive contribution to allaying the fears of not only those involved in the delivery of the health services in the hospital but also to the many general practitioners who use this hospital to service the needs of their patients.  I have already given the facts and figures.</P>
    <P>There is another and most important dimension to this argument.  It is one which the Minister of State himself will share with me because I think I know something about his attitude to social politics in this country.  There is some class of obscenity stalking this land in 1987 when we can have the opening of super de luxe hospitals for the rich in places like the Blackrock Clinic and the new Mater Clinic which from the day they were conceived in the minds of the hungry and greedy consultants who financed them were never once thought or envisaged to be open to the sick and the poor.  They never featured in that kind of consideration.  We are living in a time when those hospitals are seen to thrive at the expense of voluntary hospitals such as this one.  These voluntary hospitals have built up a record and a reputation of dedication and service to the poorest sections of our community.</P>
    <P>Is this really <i>The Better Way</i> we saw on every boarding and every poster from here to Roscommon?  If this is the better way, is it the kind of society we are trying to create in the last 13 years of the 20th century?  I do not for one moment think the Minister of State feels that this is a better way &mdash; I know he does not.  I would put it to him that the board of the Royal Hospital, a hospital that has through 155 years been responsible for the delivery of medical services, have found a better way, have documented a better way, have costed a better way and are now seeking to have the Minister of State and the Department of Health implement it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is the unique responsibility of the Department of Health because of the legal structure of this hospital and its one-to-one relationship as a voluntary hospital with the Department of Health.  If the Minister wants to, he can do it.  The figures set out in the <Col N="2837" /> tables that have been presented to the Department of Health fall within the realm of the reality which confronts him and his colleagues in Government.  What is needed now is a rapid response so as to reassure those who work in the hospital, those patients and the population who depend on the hospital, that this hospital can survive in the new future which has been put forward by the trustees for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Quinn has raised this matter as there appears to be some misunderstanding concerning the overall plan for the development of general hospital services in Dublin.  The hospital rationalisation plan was drawn up as a response to the growing concern that the haphazard development of the hospital system could no longer continue and that an overall planning framework should be devised to ensure the delivery of an efficient and effective service at the most modern standards available.  Many of the existing hospitals, because of their age and condition and because of thier location, will not be in a position to respond to the needs of the total population for modern acute hospital facilities.  The underlying rationale behind the programme is that a lesser number of larger sized well equipped modern hospitals located in the major population centres is preferable, more efficient and better able to respond to the needs of all the population than a proliferation of small hospitals.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the general hospital rationalisation plan for south Dublin provides for the development of three major acute hospitals, i.e. St. Vincent's, St. James's and Tallaght hospitals. The State is investing considerable resources in this development programme and I am satisfied that this network of major acute hospitals will be more than adequate to meet the needs of the total population of Dublin both in the inner city and suburban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the particular hospital referred to by Deputy Quinn, a major capital development is currently being <Col N="2838" /> carried out in St. James's Hospital which is intended to cater for a population of approximately 200,000 from the south central areas of Dublin city and county along with the northern portion of County Kildare.  Services at present provided by Baggot Street and Dr. Steeven's Hospitals, other than orthopaedics, will be incorporated into St. James's Hospital.  To date the development of St. James's has cost £31.8 million.  The major phase of this project will be completed in 1989 when the hospital will have over 800 acute beds.  The developed St. James's Hospital will have approximately 1,200 beds and the projected cost is put at £100 million.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Baggot Street Hospital submitted proposals to my predecessor on continuing as a community hospital after cardiology etc. have transferred to St. James's Hospital.  Some discussions took place between my Department and the hospital on this proposal and the original proposals have been elaborated on. These talks will be resumed in the context of the review already announced by the Minister.  However, I feel I should remind Deputies that the intention of the rationalisation plan for acute services in Dublin was, and is, to provide effective services in an efficient and rational fashion.  More than ever we must be aware of the cost implications of the decisions which we make on services.  The service and financial strategy underpinning the development of St. James's Hospital has had as a basic assumption the eventual closure of Baggot Street Hospital and Dr. Steeven's Hospital.  The retention of Baggot Street Hospital in any role changes these assumptions and additional resources would have to be found to fund it.</P>
    <P>Obviously the nature and extent of hospital services in south Dublin will be examined as a matter of urgency as the Minister announced on Tuesday evening and the future of Baggot Street Hospital will be examined in that context.  I would like to say to the House that I do not intend to discuss the roles of individual acute hospitals until such time as the review has been completed.  This whole <Col N="2839" /> process should be completed by the end of July.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware, as a member of the previous Government, of the position regarding this hospital.  I presume he supported the policy pursued by his ministerial and party colleague, Deputy Desmond.  We shall be looking at Baggot Street Hospital with St. James's Hospital and Dr. Steeven's Hospital. This will have a very high priority in our consultations.  Every effort will be made to ensure that all those involved, including the staff, will have a very clear picture as soon as possible of what is going to <Col N="2840" /> happen in the short and long term.  The proposals which have been put before the Department by the board of Baggot Street Hospital are being very thoroughly considered.  They do, however, raise major issues about the future shape of hospital services on the south side of Dublin.  At this stage I should like to await the result of the consideration of the review before any further statement can be made.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 27 May 1987.</P>

      <Col N="2751" /> I intend to keep in existence the management committee on industrial policy, which consists of the chief executives of the prinicpal industrial development agencies, and a representative of the Department of Finance, under the chairmanship of my Department.  The committee's brief is to ensure the prompt implementation of Government policy on industrial development and the co-ordination of the activities of the industrial agencies and does not relate to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I would not propose to comment on the number of times the committee met prior to my taking up office but I would point out that they met as recently as 18 May 1987, to discuss the <i>Review of Industrial Performance 1986</i> issued by my Department earlier this year.  I would envisage that the Committee will continue to meet as and when matters relevant to their brief require action or discussion.</P>
    <P>As to my plan for the effective management of industrial policy, I have already endorsed the recommendation in the <i>Review of Industrial Performance 1986</i> that, with a view to facilitating a smoother and more integrated implementation of industrial policy and ensuring that the best and most cost-effective services are provided to industry, there should be a study (i) as to the extent to which the services at present provided by State agencies could be significantly rationalised and (ii) how rationalisation could most effectively be implemented.</P>

      <P>I am aware of difficulties which have arisen in some of these areas because of public liability insurance costs.</P>
      <P>This is not a problem which is directly amenable to legislation.  It is unfortuataely the case that equestrian events and community festivals and shows do give rise to a particular risk of injury to and claims by members of the public.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurance if an adequate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved. In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are available, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £36 million on their general liability business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem has to be tackled by promoting greater safety measures and doing everything possible to avoid accidents <Col N="2754" /> and hence claims.  Speculative claims and unnecessary litigation and legal expenses have to be discouraged.</P>
    <P>An arrangement exists with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist in cases where difficulties are experienced in obtaining liability insurance.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Office of Trade and Marketing was established by the Taoiseach, a major priority has been to urgently reorientate and focus our export effort. World trading conditions are now very difficult, competition is becoming tougher, markets everywhere have increasingly sophisticated needs and the urgency of achieving sustained growth in exports of indigenous firms is now greater than ever.  Therefore, and as identified in various reports and studies, our export drive needs a fresh impetus.  Accordingly I am putting to Government my plans to introduce legislation shortly which would specify revised policy guidelines for CTT <Col N="2755" /> requiring it to concentrate on strategic marketing by indigenous exporting firms. This would be the first major legislative initiative impacting directly on CTT's export strategy in 30 years.  The Government have also announced the setting up of licenced trading houses and are considering other initatives and proposals from my Office of Trade and Marketing to boost exports.</P>

      <P>The lack of marketing orientation in Irish industry has been agreed in several official studies, reports and reviews.  With the matter thus documented there is no need, in my view, for a Green or White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to marketing is evident in its decision to appoint a Minister, and to establish an Office of Trade and Marketing.  My <Col N="2758" /> immediate task is to seek new ways of developing marketing knowledge, skills and attitudes in Irish firms.</P>
    <P>I consider that if the increased exports so crucial to economic recovery are to be achieved there must be a change from the approach whereby goods are manufactured in the general expectation of exports.  This must be replaced by a market-led strategy in which the needs of the market place determine the kinds of goods and services to be produced.  I propose to introduce legislation to give CTT specific policy guidelines to foster the new strategy especially in indigenous exporting firms.</P>
    <P>CTT's allocation has been increased significantly from £17.75 million in 1984 to £24.272 million in 1987 to enable it to improve marketing awareness.

The CSO in conjunction with the Department of Labour and other bodies publishes information at sectoral level in relation to industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from these activities in the rescue area, the causes or groups of causes to which factory closure may be attributed are known to be many and varied and include such factors as excessive debt, weak management, market disruption, etc.  However, great difficulty arises in attempting to identify with any degree of certainty the extent to which any one particular factor resulted in the closure of factories.  The NESC report entitled &ldquo;An Analysis of Job Losses in Irish Manufacturing Industry&rdquo; (Report No. 67, page 43) states that &ldquo;Because of the difficulty of discriminating between the possible causes of job losses, the variable time lags between changes in the causes of job losses and the job losses, and the complex inter-relationships between the various explanatory factors, <Col N="2760" /> the problems in assigning causes to job losses are enormous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For the above reasons I do not propose to direct my Department to construct a system such as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The basic thrust of the Government's policy to accelerate industrial growth is to boost confidence and investment through addressing the critical imbalance in the public finances.  This is at the root of existing problems such as high interest rates, penal levels of taxation and ultimately unacceptable levels of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In our Programme for National Recovery, we set out a range of policy initiatives and indicated that priority would be given to achieving a reduction in interest rates. The fruits of our strategy are already clearly visible in the significant decline in interest rates to business which has taken place since the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the view &mdash; as expressed by previous Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; that the central plank of our industrial policy must be to develop strong internationally competitive companies firmly rooted in the economy and making a contribution to employment growth and higher living standards.  Evidence of our determination in this area is evidenced by recent developmental announcements in the natural resources <Col N="2761" /> area.  I am also extending great priority to a programme of import substitution measures.  In this latter regard, and, indeed, generally, there is a need for an increased emphasis on product, market and management development but the initiative primarily needs to come from industry itself.  I believe that there has been an over-emphasis in our industrial policy to date on interventionist apsects such as State agencies, grants and tax breaks.  Greater attention needs to be given to the wider macro-economic policies which influence industrial growth and profitability.</P>
    <P>The policies and priorities of the Industrial Development Authority fall within the Government's overall strategy for Industrial development.  I am at present determining what changes, if any, would be appropriate in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many factors contributing to the disparity in profits between Irish manufacturing companies <Col N="2763" /> and overseas companies operating within Ireland.  This disparity reflects a number of variables, including management capability, the type and quality of the products made and processes used, the capital intensity of the operation etc.</P>
      <P>Irish industry is concentrated in sectors with traditional low average profit margins with many firms producing undifferentiated price sensitive products.  This contrasts with the position of overseas companies which are heavily concentrated in high profit sectors, like pharmaceuticals, office equipment and data processing, and produce goods which can command a price premium, due to their superior quality, technology and marketing. Similarly with processes, the level of technology employed is generally much higher in overseas firms than in their Irish counterparts.  The use of efficient up-to-date production processes helps to reduce costs and so increase profits. The other major factor influencing profitability is productivity where output per head in overseas companies averages IR£81,000 as compared with IR£64,000 per head in Irish companies.</P>
      <P>I do not see the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, as affecting the profitability of one class of company as opposed to another.  The aim of the Bill is rather to create a climate of confidence for business activity in which genuine commercial endeavour will prosper.  By giving greater protection to investors and creditors all companies can benefit and economic development generally can be enhanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways in which the cost of creating manufacturing employment can be measured but a detailed measure of the cost per job created and sustained has been agreed by the management committee on industrial policy.  It relates the total cost of all grants paid to a project over a certain period with the number of first time jobs created and still in existence at the end of the period.  For the period 1980 to 1986 the total grant cost per sustained job (in 1986 prices) in overseas industry was £22,550. This does not include IDA promotional costs nor the cost of tax concessions which cannot be directly correlated to jobs actually created.  The estimated annual cost through tax foregone from foreign firms is around £400 million. <Col N="2765" /> However, most foreign firms would probably not locate in Ireland in the absence of a favourable tax regime.</P>

With regard to the latter, I understand the SFADCo are refurbishing three vacant advance factories in Newcastle West, in order to make them more attractive to overseas and indigenous industry.  These are being promoted by the IDA for suitable large industry projects.  Shannon Development who are intensifying their small indigenous industry programme throughout County Limerick have two enterprise centres in Newcastle West.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the report commissioned by the Department of Labour entitled <i>Employers' Perceptions of the Effect of Labour Legislation</i> was to assess the extent to which employers believed that employment protection legislation deters them from increasing their workforce and to determine the relative importance of such legislation in the broader spectrum of problems encountered by Irish business today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of the survey suggested that, as far as taking on extra employees was concerned, the dampening effects of labour legislation was quite small and <Col N="2768" /> that firms were much more concerned about overall issues such as uncertainty of demand and the need to see reductions in income tax and social security contributions.</P>
    <P>These conclusions are generally supported by a survey of business attitudes undertaken for the Review of Industrial Performance 1986, published recently by my Department, which concluded that the most important contribution which Government can make to industry was to impove the tax environment and control the cost of public utilities.</P>
    <P>The Government's basic strategy towards industry is to boost investment and confidence through addressing the critical imbalance in the public finances which is at the root of such problems as unemployment, high interest rates and high levels of taxation.

    <P>Nitrigin Eireann Teoranta (NÉT) is a designated body under this Act and under the Act there are four directors on its board out of a total of twelve members.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare in view of the evidence to the former Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure, where Department officials made reference to a computer link up between a health board and his Department and a pilot scheme involving the South-Eastern Health Board and the Department of Social Welfare, if he will outline the results which have emerged to date; and if it is intended that the link-ups will be extended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare by community welfare officers, who are employees of the health boards. Computer links, where they have been established, are used to facilitate community welfare officers who need to verify the situation where an applicant may also be a claimant for other social welfare payments.  This information is sometimes necessary to enable a decision to be made on entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.  Access to the information in this way, enables decisions on payments to be made much more quickly than heretofore and the results to date show a considerable improvement in the quality of service to the public.  In effect it replaces and speeds up the inquiries which normally have to be made by writing or on the telephone.</P>
      <P>The computer links were first provided to the South-Eastern Health Board in 1986 and have now been extended to four additional health boards.  It is envisaged that some community welfare officers in each of the remaining health boards will have this facility by the end of this year but this will depend to some extent on the rate of progress on computerisation and telecommunciations networks both within the Department and the health boards.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has now been transferred to the system whereby future disability benefit will be issued at weekly intervals on receipt of monthly medical certificates while he remains unfit for work.  To do this a cheque amounting to £89.05 for the period 16 May 1987 to 30 May 1987 was issued to the person concerned on 19 May 1987 bringing the payment of his disability benefit into line with the payments of recipients on the automatic payment system.  His next payment of disability benefit will be £41.10. This cheque will be issued on 25 May 1987 and will cover payment for the period 1 June 1987 to 6 June 1987.</P>

    <P>The person concerned had in fact been examined in connection with his disability benefit claim on 11 December 1986 by a medical referee who reported that he did <Col N="2774" /> not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in nine months.  On the basis of this examination it was decided that he was not entitled to invalidity pension and he was notified to that effect.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, all health insurance schemes offered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are subject to my consent as regards the scope and extent of benefits.  The board are required to so fix subscriptions that, having made due allowance for reserves income shall be only sufficient to meet outgoings.  The board's accounts are maintained in a form approved by me and are subject to audit by a duly qualified auditor whose appointment is also subject to my consent. These provisions give me and my Department adequate means to supervise the board's insurance activities.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 increases in premium levels are subject to the sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, however, liaises closely with me when considering any applications by the board for authority to increase premiums.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board differ from other insurance companies in that they were set up by an Act of the Oireachtas to fulfil a particular role.  This role is interwoven with the structure for the delivery of health care in this country and the Minister for Health has, therefore, been regarded by the Oireachtas as the Minister appropriate to monitor their operations.  Furthermore, they differ from other companies by virtue of the fact that they are a non-profit making organisation.  Naturally, I liaise closely with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in any sphere which affects the insurance activities of the board.</P>

      <P>The sources of other income of health agencies which yielded an estimated £43.5 million in 1986 are mainly: (1) Superannuation deductions for the Voluntary Hospitals Superannuation Scheme; (2) Emoluments; (3) Canteen charges; (4) Other sales, e.g. farm produce; (5) Services provided to other agencies; e.g. food hygiene and water quality inspections.</P>
      <P>In 1987 it is estimated that £60.1 million will be raised from the above sources and from the new charges for out-patient attendance, public ward levy and from charging consultants for the use of public facilities.</P>
