      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you do so, Sir, I have given you notice of my intention to request leave to adjourn the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a specific matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration. It concerns an allegation in a television programme broadcast last night that there was an attempt to involve the Industrial Credit Corporation and perhaps also the Department of Agriculture in some rather questionable practices in relation to the purchase of a firm. I would ask you, Sir, if you would give me leave to move the Adjournment for the purpose of discussing that matter.</P>

      <P>I have considered the Deputy's request and I do not consider the motion to be one contemplated by Standing Order 30. Therefore, I regret I cannot grant leave to move the motion.  I am sorry to disappoint you, Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept your ruling, of course, but I would make the point that this matter is one of some considerable concern.  The House will not now have an opportunity of discussing it before 27 January 1988.  It is a matter where a semiState company and, apparently, a Department of State have been involved, or an attempt has been made to involve them, in some questionable business practices.  I think that is a matter with which this House should properly be concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  No. 10 should be debated.  It is a matter that has <Col N="2675" /> given rise to many difficulties.  Certainly, I have no wish to see it going through without any debate.  The priority questions matter has proved very unsatisfactory. That is generally agreed on all sides of the House.  The Private Members' time allocation is also extremely unsatisfactory, to say the least, in the way in which the last change has been made in it, which it is now proposed to maintain.  My party would find it very difficult to agree to the retention of a system that appears in practice to allow Private Members' time on only definitely two, but possibly three, occasions in an entire year.</P>

      <P>This motion has been in operation since the summer recess but it has worked very unsatisfactorily for a number of reasons, not least of which is the limited amount of time which the parties have at their disposal.  I would like to seek your clarification, a Cheann Comhairle, on a matter.  There were two weeks in this session when Private Members' time was given up.  On one occasion, this week, it was given up by the Fine Gael Party and on the other occasion the Government took an important matter in Private Members' time</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, paragraph (e), line 31, after `licence&rdquo;', to insert &ldquo;, salmon rod (annual) ordinary licences&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that we are now deleting the definitions for the five classes of salmon licences that exist at the moment and substituting as per the Bill two classes of salmon licences only, one a 21 day licence for £21, the other an annual licence for £25, on two points I am moving the amendment.  First, an increase as is the case from £8 to £25 I consider far too high &mdash; it is over 300 per cent &mdash; for an annual salmon licence.  Many holders of such licences, district licences and the like now have their licences for £8.  I accept that £8 is perhaps too small, even derisory, but I think an over 300 per cent increase in one step is taking the other extreme.  Secondly, as there is so little in the difference between the £21 and £25, administratively the extra work is unnecessary for the sake of £4 in a licence.  For both those reasons I ask the Minister to accept just one ordinary salmon licence, be it for the weekend, a fortnight's fishing or for the year, and have that pitched at the rate of £21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>While there would appear to be some merit in what the Deputy says, I cannot accept <Col N="2688" /> the amendment.  Deputy Doyle refers to £8 to £25, £8 taken from one extreme in some districts, to £25, but countrywide it works out at about £17.  Even if this Bill were not to be introduced there would have to be some increase.  That £17 is there for some three or four years, so I contend it is a very nominal increase.</P>
      <P>On the question of £21 to £25, again on the surface it appears there is no great difference.  However, £21 for a 21 day licence is designed to cater for salmon anglers.  The extra £4 gives our own people a full year's licence.  I contend that that is very reasonable, particularly when one takes into account that they can fish in any part of the country.  The current fee for countrywide salmon fishing for the whole season is £17 and, as I have said, it is there for almost three years.  The sum of £25 is not excessive in any circumstances.</P>
      <P>To put this amount in contrast I would consider fees charged for other types of recreation and entertainment.  For example, green fees in golf go from £10 to £18 and higher in places for just one day's golf.  Green fees for two weeks on my own Portnoo golf course are some £36.  The entrance fee to football matches is from £3 to £5 for an hour and a half of entertainment.  Look at the theatre and what it costs there.  What better source of entertainment for anyone than three weeks' &mdash; 21 days' &mdash; angling for £21 and for an additional £4 a full years' fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The comparisons with golf courses and football matches are not really valid in view of the capital that has to be expended to provide the entertainment in those cases compared with angling.  We are talking about rational exploitation of a natural resource of our environment.  Perhaps for some time we have not managed that resource as we should and have not developed it, but certainly there are not the same overheads in the accepted sense as there would be in keeping the greens on a golf course, a golf club, a football stadium, teams or whatever other aspect one likes to consider.  I accept what the Minister says.  I am quite sure that those who are <Col N="2689" /> very keen to go salmon angling for the year will pay £25 as easily as they pay £21 but it is a huge hike.  The increase from £17 to £21 is a little under 20 per cent, still well over the inflation rate of the last three years during which time there has been no increase in licence fees.  There is very little difference between £21 and £25 for the licence fees and I believe it would make things much easier administratively if we had only the one licence fee.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to press this amendment because there are more important issues. I have made my point.  I just thought it would make the system better and would be more equitable for those interested in this aspect of angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the fee suggested is unreasonable given that the present average fee is £17, but it seems pointless to have a distinction between a full annual licence and a 21 day licence.  This has all the hallmarks of bureaucracy.  This fishing licence system is appallingly and unnecessarily complicated and this is only prolonging and intensifying the complication.  Would the Minister of State not consider withdrawing column 4 in the Schedule and allowing column 3 to stand with the £25 licence, rather than have two different types of licences with a £4 difference? The only justification is that presumably this difference was there in the past and, therefore, should be there in the future. The difference between the two licence fees is miniscule.  Presumably the 21 day licence is taken out by tourists only and I do not believe that is an unreasonable imposition on them because by European standards they are getting cheap salmon fishing here, assuming there are any salmon left to catch.  It would make it simpler if there was just the one licence. There is enough difficulty in enforcing this because of the cuts which have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Doyle suggested there was no comparison between salmon fishing and the other services I mentioned earlier.  There is a comparison <Col N="2690" /> because over the last five years an average of £3 million each year has been spent on inland fisheries.  I feel, as do many anglers, that £21 for a licence is very cheap.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, this licence will be taken out mostly by tourists.  I do not see any administrative difficulties in selling licences at £21 for 21 days and £25 for a licence for a full year, which will be used mostly by people living in Ireland.  Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendment or the withdrawal of the section which Deputy O'Malley suggested.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 44, after &ldquo;birthday&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or who is attending an institution of third level education or training&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the very welcome provision to allow our young people free angling.  I welcome the provision that the under 18 year olds and those over 66 years of age should have free angling.  Many young people are still in full-time training or education beyond their eighteenth birthday. I would like bona fide students or members of third level institutions, to have the same provisions as the under 18 year olds.  In my time as a student &mdash; I think the same practice still holds &mdash; each student was issued with an identity card with their photograph on it.  This system would be easily controlled because it would be easy to identify the bona fide carrier of the student card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other groups, who have also expressed their views, who should be exempted from paying a licence fee for angling but I am not sure how wide we can consider it under this section. For example, the view has been <Col N="2691" /> expressed very strongly that the unemployed should be considered, and if it is not possible to give them free angling, they should be granted some concessions in relation to the fee.  I would like the Minister's view on that and I want to know if he gave the matter any consideration. Is there any concession he would consider might be appropriate?</P>
    <P>We spoke on Second Stage of increased leisure time, some by choice but others, regrettably, have it forced on them.  One of the more constructive ways of spending leisure time must be on the banks of rivers or lakes.  We have many examples of destruction carried out during so called leisure time.  I would hate to put in place a system that might dissuade those who have time on their hands from putting that time to constructive and enjoyable use.</P>
    <P>We also spoke yesterday of this concept of fishing being handed down through families.  This is part of our tradition not only in rural areas but also in our cities.  I can see a simple way of extending the provision granted to under 18 year olds to students and people in third level institutions, but I am not sure how we could extend it to other groups. I would like to hear the Minister's views on whether these groups have been considered and if provision has been made for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Doyle. She made a very valid point when she said that this provision should be extended to the unemployed and to students.  It is very refreshing that in some schools, teachers are taking their pupils to the river banks to teach them how to fish.  If we are to encourage this practice, we will have to take another look at the £10 fee if these students are over 18 years of age.  The Minister might see his way towards granting this concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This system will be very difficult to sell to the traditional fishermen whose grandfather and father fished in certain rivers and encouraged the children to do likewise.  If these people are unemployed where will they get £10?  It is only right <Col N="2692" /> that we should motivate people to take advantage of the many facilities which are available around the country.  Fishing is one such facility, particularly in rural areas.  There is no point mentioning specific geographic locations because there are thousands of such places around the country where free fishing has been available for generations.</P>
    <P>The Minister might see some way to help people who are unemployed, in receipt of disability benefit or unemployment benefit.  I have met angling groups over the last few days and they told me that at least one-third of their members are unemployed and have no hope of getting employment.  The only way these people can keep their sanity is to go fishing from morning until the evening instead of loitering around the town, probably getting into mischief.  The Minister is taking a fundamental right away from people who traditionally held it.  If the Minister casts his mind back a few years, he will remember that we had fish-ins which were very successfully orgnaised by pressure groups on different rivers.  Thousands of people turned up for the day and fished at will and they were not taken to court because the court would have been choc-a-bloc as so many were involved.  The Minister might, unintentionally, be opening a can of worms. He should look at this matter very carefully to see if he could give a concession to the long term unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given a great deal of thought to the amendment tabled by Deputy Doyle but, unfortunately, I cannot accede to her request.  This is a very clear cut case in that we can define those under 18 and over 66 years of age. In addition to students I have no doubt that other categories are equally deserving of exemption.  I looked at this matter very closely when the legislation was being drafted but I cannot do anything in that regard.  Indeed, this is the first time that exemptions have been provided in fishing licence fees.  Deputy Begley referred to students going with their teachers to fish but they would all be under 18 years of age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Most of them would be.  If we exempted students in this country we would also have to make it available for young people in the Community. Anyone who wishes to obtain a licence for coarse fishing must pay a fee of £10 and £15 for trout fishing.  If we open up the category beyond which it can be totally and absolutely defined &mdash; under 18 and over 66 years of age &mdash; we would have to open it up to so many other categories that it would be better not to introduce a licence.  The money from fees will generate an income of £500,000 which will go back to the various boards through the central board.  This money is necessary for the development of inland fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's attitude because he must know that this charge is full of pitfalls.  For example, a farmer may have a river running through his land and his family for generations have fished there for brown trout.  He has also allowed others to fish in that river but there is nothing to stop him now from putting up a sign saying that trespassers will be prosecuted.  The Inland Fisheries Board do not even know that some of those rivers exist, they never went to the trouble of surveying or restocking them and now they expect to collect £10 from an individual who fishes there.  The Minister must know that, administratively, this will not work.  If the farmer will not allow people to fish on the river on his land the whole thing will backfire.  Commonsense should come to the rescue now.  If there is a fishing club in the district, perhaps they should have the discretionary power to grant the concession to which I referred to the unemployed and disabled who want to fish.  I know that the Minister thinks that many other categories would have to be included &mdash; that is a fair point &mdash; but we have the goodwill of the landowners at <Col N="2694" /> the moment, it has been there for generations, they never interfere and the people who use the rivers respect the owners' rights.  They do not trespass on crops, they are very careful.  Perhaps the Minister will look at this again on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. We have introduced an exemption for the first time which has been welcomed by the House.  There would be difficulties in granting any more exemptions and we gave very serious consideration to this matter when the Bill was being drafted and when we received amendments from Deputy Doyle and Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I am of the firm belief that it would be unenforceable if we were to extend it to people other than those under 18 and over 66 years of age.  While times are difficult and many people are unemployed, a charge of £10 for the season is not excessive.  Indeed, a catch of one salmon could recoup the licence fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about salmon, I referred to brown trout.  The Minister is missing the point because I am speaking about a family who never fish for salmon.  The amount of fish those people catch would be no more than seven or eight fish.  Indeed, the largest fish would probably weigh no more than nine ounces.  The Minister is now telling a family who have a river running through their land that they must pay a licence fee of £10 from now on.  The Minister might as well face up to the fact that there will be a revolution in rural areas as far as that is concerned.  It will not be accepted, particularly by people who fish where their fathers and grandfathers have fished before them.  It is stitched into their title in the Land Commission that they have these rights.  The Minister had better cop himself on.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said earlier that angling clubs should have the discretion to grant licences.  That would not work because you cannot pass on statutory functions to the various angling clubs.  I am as aware as the Deputy of the difficulties it could create but we must realise that, if we take something from the rivers, we must give something back. The introduction of this measure will mean a sum of £500,000 will be available to the boards to assist in a restocking programme.  It should also be remembered that the sum of £10 covers a year and is not excessive.  Fisheries must be protected for future generations and this money will help in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister should be frank about this most important aspect of the Bill.  He just stated that the sum of £500,000 from these licences will go back into restocking the rivers.  If I thought for one moment that all the £500,000 was available for restocking the rivers I would not delay the House much longer.  I accept from what the Minister said on Second Stage yesterday that the money will be retained by whatever structures are there when he makes his announcement in relation to An Bord Iascaigh Intíre.  The Minister and I know, as the officials in the Department must know, that he will not get anywhere near the sum of £500,000, particularly in 1988.  He will have some chance of getting a little in 1989 but it is going to take some years to have a built-in acceptance of the charges we are discussing for the different licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will stick to the amendment. I am disappointed that the Minister cannot include in section 4 (2), to which this amendment refers, other categories apart from the under 18 year olds and <Col N="2696" /> those over 66 years, which we do commend with the increase of sixth year at second level eduation.  My two oldest children will be almost 19 years of age before they leave school in the June of their sixth year and that will be the case increasingly as the years go by.  We should encourage as many people as possible, including, as Deputy Begley said, teachers pass on to young people the tradition of fishing, angling and making the best use of our environment and unspoiled countryside while we have it.  There will be a logistical problem, if nothing more, in relation to confining the exemption purely to under 18 year olds unless we include bona fide students and, one would hope, also non-income earners who are in some sort of training or educational establishment for the few years after they leave secondary school.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to also consider the disabled.  Deputy Begley mentioned this, too.  There are many associations who look after the needs of the disabled and I do not think there would be much abuse in this area if disabled people were accredited by the organisation to which they belong and allowed free access to what is a traditional right in our country.  Disabled people have limitations enough in relation to the types of sports they can partake in and angling is one of the sports from which many of them have derived enormous pleasure.  Tragically in many cases the disabled have far more leisure time than many other people, time they could put to great use if they had access to the angling of their choice in their districts.</P>
      <P>The case of the unemployed has also been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(3) The provisions of subsection (1) (c) of this section shall not apply in respect of the fishing for or taking or killing, by a person who is for the time being a visitor to the State, of any coarse fish with one or two rods and lines.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intervene in this debate because I represent the constituency of Cavan and Monaghan which is largely comprised of small farmers, many of whom find it very difficult to make a decent living from agriculture alone.  It is good to be able to say that my constituents have looked around and exploited every other possible way of adding to their basic incomes. This constituency is one of the most intensive food producing and processing constituencies in the country.  As well as that, we have the benefit of having many rivers and lakes which abound in coarse fish and game fish and it is to the coarse fishing <Col N="2700" /> industry that I want to address my contribution and to which my amendment is also addressed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, during the years people in a geographical position to do so have reconstructed their houses and have built new houses to cater for the tourist industry, particularly the coarse fishermen from Britain and other European countries. They have done so with considerable success and it is refreshing to note that, notwithstanding the troubles with which this island has been afflicted in the last 20 years &mdash; I speak of the troubles so near to my constituency in Northern Ireland &mdash; the coarse fishermen continue to come here in large numbers from Great Britain, Germany, France, Holland and other countries.  They are regarded as big spenders who come here having saved an amount of money during the year and they spend it locally in the guesthouses and in the public houses at night while discussing &ldquo;the ones that got away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the big attractions and great selling points of this industry has always been that we have free fishing; that the people are friendly; you will not be obstructed or questioned and your activities will not be made more difficult.  For the first time this Bill proposes to subject the coarse fishing industry to the licensing system.  I have put down this one amendment only but there are other provisions in the Bill which subject the coarse fishermen to regulations, licensing, inspections and so on and that will be a big change.  It will discourage this type of visitor and this type of tourist activity. I have discussed this proposal with the guesthouse owners' association and particularly with those who have made a success of the provision of farmhouse and guesthouse accommodation for these visitors and the first thing I am told is that it will be a complete innovation and a complete surprise to foreign visitors when they find that they must get a licence.  I would like to emphasise that it will not be the amount of the licence that the people will object to but rather to being dragged into the bureaucratic system.  It is not necessary in order to attain the <Col N="2701" /> objective which the Minister has in view. He can rely on the complete co-operation of the guesthouse owners and so on.</P>
    <P>I am told that when the representatives of the guesthouse owners' association and the tourist board visit Britain, Holland, Germany and other countries selling this holiday, one of the big selling points is that we have free fishing.  That is simple sales talk.  It is a message that is easily got across and it is something that is very welcome.  I am satisfied that nobody better than the Minister, Deputy Pat Cope Gallagher, will realise the efficacy of the short punchlike selling line.  He will clearly remember the 1977 election when all one had to say was that there would be no rates on houses and no tax on cars and the job was done.  It was irresistible. People realised that it would mean a big saving for them if they voted in favour of those things and they did not see how they could do anything else.  So strong was that line of sales talk that it confounded four political commentators who forecast one result on the Sunday before the election.  The sort of sales talk I am talking about could change the whole atmosphere and the result was totally different.  The Government were defeated and the Minister's party were back in power, much to everybody's surprise, including their own.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but I am speaking in a political assembly and I cannot think of any better way of getting my point across than the line of argument I have just been making.  There may be simplified ways proposed for claiming this licence but, if so, they are not mentioned in the Bill.  It is feared that people will have to spend a half day looking for a licence when they come to this country and that will be a great inconvenience. The amount of revenue that will be brought in by this proposal is negligible and it will be eaten up by the cost of collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point has been made to me, <Col N="2702" /> a very significant point which may not have been made before, and that is, that the success or failure of the type of tourist industry I am talking about depends on the goodwill of the farmers.  For the last number of years, due to pollution and so on, farmers have had a chip on their shoulders.  They are not as totally cooperative as they had been previously because they find that they are being prosecuted heavily for pollution.  These farmers will now see that the State is collecting revenue for permitting tourists to fish in their waters and to use their lands and fields to pass through, sometimes with inconvenience to them.  Farmers who would not let a neighbour's dog onto their land have no objection to fishermen coming onto their lands to fish.  If that is interfered with in any way it will not be good enough.  I do not want to carry on for too long.  I put down an amendment because otherwise I might not get to talk at all.</P>

      <P>There is already provision for excluding the under 18s and over 66s.  The keenest fishermen might very well fall into those two categories which have been excluded.  If it is possible to exclude those it is possible to exclude visiting fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister's argument is that he wants to save the lakes and rivers from being raped and overexploited. I honestly believe that if guesthouses distributed literature to visiting fishermen to the effect that the catch would be restricted to so many fish a day, by and large it would be observed.  It could be made an offence to be found with a greater number of fish than that allowed. We would not need then to get a licence or to have people subject to inspection and all the rest of it.  If the Minister's provisions are to be operated by lay inspectors, we all know they can be quite officious and might do more harm than <Col N="2703" /> good.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and I would be happy if the Minister wants to take it away and put it into the best of Civil Service understandable wording.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will not take the liberty of making a Second Reading speech.  The amendment, while wellintentioned, seeks to select a breed of fishermen for special treatment.  I do not like that so I urge the House to reject the amendment in the name of Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I dislike the idea of fishermen, particularly trout fishermen, being asked to pay an additional fee on top of the moneys we spend, for example when we go fishing on Lough Mask, Lough Corrib or on Lough Sheelin which was a great lake.  Unfortunately Lough Sheelin has become a victim of modern farming methods.  I am not being critical of the farmers.  They have to earn a living but they should have been given sustained Government help particularly along the banks of Lough Sheelin where the water was deoxygenated to the point where the sub-growth took the oxygen out of the water and killed the fish.  The growth was so prolific as a result of pig slurry getting into the lake that the necessary biological element ceased to be there and the fish died.  Lough Sheelin was regenerated for a short time but it is gone again now.  It is unfortunate that this should happen in this year of the environment.  I remember fishing there with my father and uncle 25 years ago and catching eight, nine and ten fish, magnificent three pound and four pound trout.  What has happened to Lough Sheelin is a tragedy which I hope will not happen to other lakes.  The lakes are part of our heritage which we must transfer to the next generation.  Our generation has not really discharged their functions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2704" /> To return to the amendment, it is extraordinary that the drafters of this legislation should ask for more money in the context of a rod licence.  One cannot quantify what it costs to kill one fish, particularly if one travels from Dublin to Lough Mask.  One would spend a couple boatman and spend money in Mrs. Murphy's in Ballintrallagh House, a magnificent guesthouse on Lough Mask.</P>

I strongly urge the House to reject this imposition.  It seeks to discriminate against one section of the fresh water fishing community.  That is inacceptable. The Bill itself is unbearable but having <Col N="2705" /> listened to the Minister, Deputy Daly, who has a great grasp of this subject saying that the licence fees would be put back into work on the waterways and the local fisheries boards, I am reassured. Places like Lough Mask, Lough Sheelin and Lough Corrib should be sustained with the moneys collected, but I have grave doubts about how the money will be collected.  I object to the passing of Deputy Fitzpatrick's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I have observed the example of Deputy Andrews and I will try not to follow it.  I join with Deputy Andrews in suggesting that Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment should not get the support of the House as the sum being charged for foreign visitors is nominal. Local coarse anglers are increasingly setting up very worthy angling clubs throughout the country and they would be hurt if visiting anglers were to get free angling.  The visiting coarse angler will appreciate facilities more if he or she is asked to pay a nominal sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Fitzpatrick in his assertion that the money collected will be nominal and not sufficient to outweigh the collection costs.  A total of 5,000 visting anglers would yield £250,000 and the number of anglers will far outnumber 5,000 in the next few years.  The money will go a long way towards ensuring that the type of facilities needed for the coarse <Col N="2706" /> angling market are delivered and maintained. We undoubtedly have excellent facilities for coarse fishing but at the moment these facilities are often inaccessible. I know the British angler likes to drive his car close by the area where he is fishing and to be able to walk on level ground to a fishing stand reasonably well prepared.</P>
    <P>I have particular personal experience arising from the organisation of the freshwater youth world championship on the River Inny which, despite the deprivation of Lough Sheelin, is watered by enough fresh Westmeath water to be a very good haven for enormous numbers of coarse fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the pollution comes from the Deputy's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite that, Westmeath County Council, the organising committee, the Central Fisheries Bord and Bord Fáilte had to spend a very significant sum in preparation of the bank to enable the fishery to be prepared as a world standard match stretch.  That match stretch is now recognised as having a good world track record and we are pressing to have it designated as a European fishery with special rights for each European state in relation to the requirements of their angling enthusiasts.  All these things cost money and it is not fair for the angling interests or the tourist interests to demand of the State endless subventions without themselves making some input.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Andrews' interest in trout angling, I would point out that there are lakes in Ireland other than Lough Corrib, Lough Mask and Lough Sheelin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not even cost the Deputy £10 for bed and breakfast.  Banter apart, the curing of Lough Ennel of very serious pollution and eutrophication cost the State and Westmeath County Council a figure approaching £1 million but the treatment has been a success.  It is an example of what can be done with the co-operation of angling, local authority and State interests to restore a marvellous heritage and facility.  The only thing required is money and the only way money can be raised in these times of shortage is by looking to the angler to pay some part.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews is not totally correct when he says that Lough Sheelin is dead. The fish are still there.  They had a very close shave last summer but a shower of rain or a storm just about saved them. The fish are ready to be saved if something can be done even at this late stage to alleviate the pollution.  Experience has shown that pollution in Lough Sheelin can be eliminated with reasonably modest expenditure to encourage the farming population to have a more progressive slurry disposal policy.</P>

      <P>I have to support Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  The Minister must be aware that hoteliers and hotel managers are already touring Europe telling the tourist market that free fishing is available in Ireland.  They have offered package holidays which include free fishing. Commitments have already been entered into by some managements.  If free fishing is stated as part of the package, the hoteliers cannot be expected to subsidise each anglier by paying the licence fee.  I am a trout fisherman and my remarks are related specifically to trout fishing.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider this aspect.  The brochures have been printed by Bord Fáilte and I am reliably informed that they were not consulted when the Bill was drafted.  If they had been asked for their views they would have stated very positively that commitments have been entered into for 1988.  The Minister might find some way to resolve this dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has made an impassioned plea for the visiting coarse angler in County Cavan and his point of view deserves full consideration by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the difficulties which local anglers would experience in having to pay a licence fee of £5 for 21 days.  Many of these people could be unemployed. Anyone who fishes locally would be advised to opt for the yearly licence.  The amendment does not refer to these people but only to visitors.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about comparisons with other fees.  The green fee for one round of golf in some parts of Ireland is between £10 and £18.  In some of the more exclusive clubs the green fees are much higher. I do not play golf but the only ones I am familiar with are places like Cruit Island, Portnoo and Gweedore where green fees for two weeks amount to about £36.  Relatively speaking, the fees we are proposing are very cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the <Col N="2709" /> availability of these licences and the difficulties which could be created if they were available only at the head offices of regional boards.  He said that people in Cavan would have to travel to Ballyshannon to obtain a licence.  We want to make the process as easy as possible and I would refer the Deputy to the Minister's speech on Second Stage when he stated that licences would be sold by the fisheries boards through their offices and by some field staff, as well as through outlets countrywide such as shops, hotels and offices of regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they open over the weekends?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be available in shops and in the hotels where anglers will be staying.  If the outlets have to be extended in any way, it will be done.  I fully appreciate the importance of coarse fishing to the country as a whole but particularly in Deputy Fitzpatrick's constituency.  I am very familiar with one area where one hears more German being spoken than any other language.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the punchlines in a particular manifesto. What better punchline could we have than &ldquo;Fish in Ireland for 10p per day&rdquo;? That will be its cost.  I want to reassure the House that the moneys raised on foot of licence fees will be given back to the various regional fisheries boards.  It amounts to 10 pence per day or, over a full year, to something like three pence per day.  One could not get greater pleasure at a more competitive cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that very few visiting anglers would object to paying £5 for a 21-day coarse fishing licence or £10 for a 21-day trout fishing licence.  It is pointless referring to the difficulties it could create for locals.  The amendment deals strictly with visitors.  Of course, there is also the difficulty of how one defines &ldquo;visitor&rdquo;.  It is not as simple as the amendment would suggest.  In principle it is my belief that a contribution has to be made in this respect, that it is a national asset or resource we are making available.  Its <Col N="2710" /> contribution to the various regions must be appreciated.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment.  We cannot go beyond what we have already done &mdash; granting a licence free of charge to those under 18 and over 66 years of age.  Many of the people Deputy T. Fitzpatrick would have in mind may well fall into that category. It would be unfair to suggest to Deputy Fitzpatrick that I could reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage because we have given it much thought. Prior to his tabling his amendment and the drafting of the Bill we examined the interests of various groups around the country.  If we went further we would be creating difficulties for ourselves in enforcing the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the section itself &mdash; and I may be reading it altogether wrongly &mdash; is it the intention that a person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500, or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £2,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is extremely punitive?  If trout anglers and fresh water fishermen are to be punished by the imposition of this £40 composite licence, surely then it is unreasonable &mdash; if one were to be prosecuted for not holding a licence &mdash; and of course one could argue that out of court with one's solicitor or whoever &mdash; that at the end of the day, one is to be indicted and failing to prove innocence to the satisfaction of the learned justices or judges, one might end up with a fine of £2,000 and two years in jail, for failing to have a trout licence. I may be quite wrong but I find that extraordinary.  Perhaps the Minister of State could reassure me but, if that is the intention of the section, it is extremely punitive, unreasonable and unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to assure us that there will be no difficulty in obtaining licences.  I have in mind a fisherman finding that, over a weekend, the man who issues licences is away and will not return until Monday &mdash; as one famous judge advised somebody in regard to another matter.  However, that does not arise here.  Many people are concerned about a prospective difficulty in obtaining licences.  I should like the Minister to tell us also whether the money accruing from such licences will be spent on the fishing industry, how it will be used; or will it follow some of the National Lottery proceeds to places it should not be going.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the provisions of this Bill will entail a lot more work for the regional fisheries boards.  Will the Minister say whether they will be given additional allocations for enforcement? There is a rumour that the boards will disappear altogether in January next.  If that is correct, then who will enforce the powers contained in the Bill?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, it is not.  It would make common sense that the greater should contain the lesser but it does not.  There is a ridiculous position created here with very severe penalties being imposed, as Deputy Andrews said; one might almost say ridiculously severe penalties.  As has often happened to me, somebody fishing for trout could catch a perch.</P>

I am speaking at 12.27 p.m. which demonstrates how unwise it is to rush these things through on guillotines.  This problem has come to light.  Perhaps there are many similar ones in this Bill.  It is a ridiculous position and it simply should not be allowed to pass.  The Minister of State should now withdraw this section because it is ridiculous.</P>

At present the procedures work very well in relation to salmon.  We will ensure there are as many outlets as possible so that these licences will be freely available seven days a week.  Another point Deputy Fitzpatrick raised was in relation to the usage of the money.  I can tell him it will go back to the regional fisheries boards.  I have no intention of <Col N="2713" /> coming between the legal eagles on both sides of me as far as this is concerned.  I might add that the fines of £500, £2,000 are maximum fines.  Their imposition will be at the discretion of the courts.  I do not know how many perch are caught by trout anglers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>2. &mdash;(1) Section 5 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the substitution for subsection (1) (b) of the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) advance moneys to a housing authority to enable the authority&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) to make loans for the purpose of acquiring constructing, or carrying out improvement works to, houses, and</P>
      <P>(ii) to pay grants under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979.',</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b) the substitution for subsection (2) of the following subsection&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(2) Where moneys are <Col N="2716" /> advanced to a housing authority under subsection (1) of this section for the making of loans, the authority shall use such moneys to make loans &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) under section 39 of the Housing Act, 1966, or</P>
    <P>(b) in accordance with such terms and conditions relating to the acquisition and construction of houses as have, from time to time, been approved of for the purposes of this section by the Minister and by the Minister for Finance, or</P>
    <P>(c) under section 8 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(2) This section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1987.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the power of the Housing Finance Agency to advance money to local authorities.  As the position stands at present, the agency may advance funds to local authorities to enable the making of loans solely for the purpose of the acquisition of houses.  It is proposed under the amendment to allow the funds to be made available by the agency to local authorities for the making of improvement loans and for the payment of essential repairs and disabled persons' grants by the authority.</P>
    <P>At present the funds to provide for the payment of these grants may be advanced from the Local Loans Fund.  It is entirely in keeping with the wider role of the Housing Finance Agency that it should now become the source of the funds needed by local authorities for the purposes that I have mentioned.  As far as local authorities are concerned, the funds will be provided to them by the agency on the same terms as they would obtain from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the reason for this late amendment to the Bill and, in particular, <Col N="2717" /> the provision whereby the Housing Finance Agency are now to take over, or will be empowered to take over, the arrangements which local authorities previously had with the Local Loans Fund in relation to subsection (1) (a) (ii)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 provides for an increase from £500 million to £1,000 million in the statutory limit on the agency's borrowing.  The present limit of £500 million will be reached in 1988.  The agency has now taken over from the Local Loans Fund as the main source of funds for loans advanced by local authorities. In this context, it is necessary to increase the borrowing limit to ensure that the agency are in a position to continue funding these loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister.  He is giving an explanation as to the effect of section 2.  I asked a question in relation to the amendment which we are now discussing with regard to the new subsection (1) of section 5 of the Principal Act, subsection (1)(a)(ii). What powers will the agency be taking over which were previously the responsibility of the Local Loans Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extension of their role to pay grants and make loans available for house improvements.  Their role is being extended to make loans available for the repair of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and agree with the intention that the agency should be empowered to advance moneys for the purpose of allowing local authorities to make loans available for the improvement of houses.  This is a logical extension of the role of the agency to provide funding for the purchase of houses.  Under the new section 5 (1) (a) (ii) the agency will be empowered to pay moneys to the local authorities so that they can make grants available.  Can the Minister explain that provision to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the local authorities borrow money from the Local <Col N="2718" /> Loans Fund.  This section will give them the power to do so and to pay grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If moneys are advanced to a housing authority to pay for grants from the HFA, on what basis will these advances be repaid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same basis as they are repayable to the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, is the Minister of State saying that the advancing of money to the local authorities so that they can make loans available and make grants available for the improvement of houses as provided for under section 5 (1) (a) (ii) will be by way of traditional type borrowing and will be repayable to the agency on the same basis as if they had borrowed from the Local Loans Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, this will be a new type of borrowing which the local authorities will engage in with the Housing Finance Agency.  In the space of their short existence the Housing Finance Agency have advanced moneys to the local authorities so that they could make available house purchase loans and these moneys were repayable under the interest-related system.  Will this amount to a different type of borrowing from the more traditional type of borrowing on which the local authorities borrowed from the Local Loans Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that it will be along the traditional lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour this point but what I would like to know is in what manner will the local authorities borrow money under this provision and how will they repay these moneys?  What type of borrowing will it be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be on the same basis as they borrowed money from the Local Loans Fund.  They will now be taking on this new type of loan.  The <Col N="2719" /> Housing Finance Agency are now going to undertake this type of arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention when the Housing Finance Agency was set up was that it would progressively take over the funding of local authority borrowing for housing purposes of one sort or another. What I am not clear about in regard to this new type of borrowing is the manner in which the local authorities will make the repayments.  The local authorities have, until very recently, traditionally borrowed from the Local Loans Fund, very often to fund activities which in part were subsidisable by the State.  A very cumbersome process ensued whereby the Department of the Environment paid a grant to the local authority which was equivalent to the State subsidy which was allowed on the loan.  The local authority then had to repay the full amount of the loan instalment due to the Local Loans Fund.  That has now been changed as a result of the recent enactment of the legislation on the Local Loans Fund.  I seek clarification as to whether there is any element of State subsidy involved in this new type of borrowing.  If that is the case, how is it going to be dealt with? Will this new type of borrowing be on the basis of normal annuity-type borrowing by the local authorities from the Housing Finance Agency?  In what manner will the borrowing be repaid and will it be borrowed at a fixed interest rate or at a variable interest rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys will be borrowed at a variable interest rate.  No subsidy will be involved.  This is a new arrangement which should be introduced. At present some loans are being repaid at a rate of 12½ per cent.  That is the standard rate for a 25-year loan.  These moneys will be borrowed at a variable interest rate and they will be borrowed on the same basis as previously from the Housing Finance Agency.  The same terms will apply and no subsidy will be involved.  With interest rates coming down, it is to be welcomed that the moneys will be borrowed at a variable <Col N="2720" /> interest rate.  I hope the interest rate on this type of loan will come down in line with the building society rate.  That is our aim.</P>

In aon acht leis sin tá Meitheal Iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath le h-athbhunú.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation to Deputies Deasy and Quinn for the approaches they made and clarification they sought in advance of our discussion here today.  I appreciate the interest they have taken in the Bill and in other personal matters.</P>
    <P>The main purposes of the Bill are:</P>
    <P>To provide for the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority; to re-assign most of the Authority's functions to other bodies; to repeal the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986, which is the legislative basis for the Authority; and to extend the scope of some of the provisions, which had been confined to the DTA functional area, to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The measure is necessary as a consequence of the Government decision that no funds would be available for the Authority from next year.  The decision to dissolve the Authority was not taken lightly. As Members of the House are aware, after the Government took office it was appparent that taxation levels and Exchequer borrowings were excessive and that a reduction in State expenditure was urgently required, if the overall situation were not to disimprove further. Examination of expenditure was undertaken in all Departments.  Every single area of spending was scrutinised.  It is fair to say that we would be facing a long term serious crisis in the public finances, if we had not tackled these problems right across the board.  In this process, we had to recognise that many services, which has been taken for granted by the public, were no longer affordable.  It is regretted <Col N="2722" /> that the DTA had to be chosen for dissolution, but this was unavoidable.</P>
    <P>In implementing the Government decision, through the Bill before the House, we have succeeded in preserving most of the DTA functions through transferring them to other authorities.  In addition, the Government decided that some of the functions could be extended with advantage beyond Dublin to the whole country and this we are providing for in the Bill.  Traffic management functions of the Authority, which are so vital for traffic flows in the Dublin area, are being transferred to a re-constituted Dublin Transportation Task Force.  With these changes it is possible to continue to pursue most of the important tasks set for the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>Some have argued that the amount of money involved in keeping the DTA in place was so small that the decision to dissolve it could have been avoided.  For 1987 the Authority's funding comprised two State grants-in-aid, one for current expenditure totalling £300,000 and £365,000 for capital works for traffic management measures.</P>
    <P>Savings from the abolition of the Authority cannot be judged on the basis of the 1987 allocations but on the likely expenditure of a fully staffed Authority.  It was envisaged that in time the staff would need to increase to at least 20 people.  On this basis the savings on the Authority's operating costs would be of the order of £500,000 per annum and could be expected to increase with the passage of years.</P>
    <P>Again, some have said that it is a pity to sacrifice the Authority for the sake of half a million pounds a year.  I acknowledge that the amount involved is not huge but the decision reflects the depth and extent of the financial problems.  It is all the savings, including the small ones, which collectively will make the Exchequer savings worthwhile.  If we were to follow the advice of our critics in all of the areas where cuts are being implemented, we would be failing to meet our overall responsibilities to the people of Ireland.  I wish to emphasise <Col N="2723" /> that, while the Authority are being dissolved, most of the functions of the Authority will be carried out by other agencies. There will not be a vacuum.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority in no sense calls into question the quality and value of the work undertaken by the Chairman and members of the Authority and their chief executive and staff.  The volume of work handled and carried out by the Authority demonstrates the dedication and commitment to the very onerous tasks which made up their mandate.  In the traffic management area they actively tackled such matters as disruptive roadworks by intervention at administrative level, parking and other traffic measures, including the funding of capital projects and the preparation of by-laws in relation to tow-away services.  The Authority's by-laws in relation to parking controls came into force on 11 December last and they bring the &ldquo;business hours&rdquo; for Dún Laoghaire into line with the rest of the Dublin area.  The Authority made submissions to the planning authorities on the Dublin City Development Plan, the Custom House Docks Development Authority plans and other major planning applications.  The Authority also submitted to me their recommendations on the Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann applications for increases in fares.</P>
    <P>This is not an exhaustive list but gives a general view of the work carried out by the Authority during their short life.  I wish to record my appreciation of the Authority's efforts in the past year and the efficient and effective way in which they began to come to grips with the tasks they faced.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986 provided an extensive mandate for the DTA.  The Act provided for the activation of the various functions by Ministerial Order.  It was decided that at the outset the Authority could not be expected to undertake all the functions in the legislation straight away.  As a result, functions in relation to the responsibility for the traffic warden service, licensing <Col N="2724" /> of passenger road services, regulation of public service vehicles and licensing of public car parks were not activated.</P>
    <P>I circulated an Explanatory Memorandum with the Bill but, nonetheless, there is a need to give the House some explanations and additional information. A simple revocation of the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 1986 is not involved. There is a need to provide for continuity of most of the functions contained in that Act and these are being transferred to the Garda Síochána and the local authorities. Indeed, in most cases the Bill restores functions which had been transferred from them to the DTA.  As the DTA mandate covered the Dublin area only, the transfer of functions is limited accordingly.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions in the 1986 Act, for example, those in relation to the control of roadworks, the immobilisation of vehicles parked illegally through wheelclamps and the like, the control of vehicles by bollards and ramps and the control of access to and egress from construction sites, were new and the opportunity is being taken in the Bill, in section 9 to be precise, to provide for the application of the provisions to the country as a whole.  In relation to the co-ordination of roadworks, for instance, the Bill in fact is more comprehensive than in the existing legislation.  A definition for emergency roadworks is now included in addition to an enabling provision for a local authority to issue directions even in such emergency cases, in order to ensure speedy completion of works.  These provisions will form part of the road traffic legislative code and the Minister for the Environment will be generally responsible for their administration and for the making of relevant regulations.  These provisions represent additional functions for the local authorities and should be valuable in improving traffic flows in many areas.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to individual road ramps and bollards and the control of roadworks will be the responsibility of the local authorities, who will also make the by-laws in relation to control and access to and from construction sites. <Col N="2725" /> Regulations for giving full effect to the provisions in relation to immobilisation devices will be settled between the Ministers for the Environment and Justice. The extension of these functions to local authorities is a worthwhile development because traffic and transport problems are not peculiar to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 6 of the Bill provide for the dissolution of the Authority, the transfer of assets and liabilities from them to the Minister, the continuation of the Authority's staff pension scheme, the method of dealing with legal proceedings to which they are a party and the exemption of the Minister from stamp duy on property or rights transferred from the Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill re-enacts the provisions for dealing with persons who fail to or refuse to pay fares on public service vehicles.  This provision, which represents an improvement on the existing provision in 82 (9) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, will apply, in accordance with the section, to the country as a whole.  It is hoped that these provisions will improve the general environment for public passenger vehicle drivers as regards the collection of fares.</P>
    <P>Section 8 transfers back to the commissioner of the Garda Síochána the functions of the Authority in relation to such matters as taxi stands, omnibus stopping places and stands, control of traffic and pedestrians, the parking of vehicles and control of traffic signs.</P>
    <P>Section 10 continues in force the onthe-spot fines system and penalites in relation to false declarations in connection with applications for the granting of licences, plates and certificates of vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 11 re-enacts section 27 of the 1986 Act, with minor amendments in the interest of clarification, in relation to the provision and maintenance of busways. These could become very important means of improving traffic flows in congested areas.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the extension of the functions of traffic wardens and increases from £20 to £150 the maximum <Col N="2726" /> penalty for certain offences such as the destruction or removal of notices attached to vehicles by traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the question of the DTA functions which are not being continued. They relate principally to advisory type powers in a transport planning context.  The need for such powers has been reduced by the fact that a major priority function assigned to the Authority, that is to advise on the public transport needs of the areas to the west of the city, has been overtaken by the Government decision that no further consideration should be given to the possible extension of the electrified rail system to these areas.  This decision was taken because the substantial cost involved &mdash; running to many hundreds of millions of pounds &mdash; could not be contemplated having regard to the state of the public finances for the foreseeable future.  As Members of the House are aware, CIE have been requested to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area, involving only bus-based options or diesel rail services on existing lines.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Task Force are being reconstituted, on a non-statutory basis as before, to take up the DTA role in general transport and traffic matters. Thus the valuable work of the DTA in this area need not be lost and can indeed be built upon.  The new task force will include representatives of the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of the Environment, the local authorities, the Garda and CIE.</P>
    <P>The original task force, who preceded the DTA, were responsible for the introduction of bus lanes and stricter parking controls and the funding of specialised traffic signalling and bus priority schemes.  They also sponsored the development of the Dublin traffic management model, a computer-based traffic simulation package used to assess the effects of new traffic management projects. This work has been developed further by the DTA.  The reconstituted task force will assume the functions of the Authority in these matters.</P>
    <P>The task force will be responsible for devising traffic management schemes, <Col N="2727" /> setting on an annual basis the priority traffic management activities for implementation and for allocating funds for the traffic management schemes to supplement the investments of the local authorities in this field.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Estimates for my Department provide for an allocation of £165,000 for traffic management purposes by the task force.  There will be scope for the task force to comment on development plans prepared by the Dublin local authorities in so far as the plans have a bearing on traffic management.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the Authority is a disappointment to many but the situation would be considerably worse if the activities undertaken by the Authority were also to be terminated.  That is not happening and careful attention has been given to preserving, in so far as is possible within existing resources, the continuation of the work in hand.  I wish to conclude by renewing my expression of appreciation for the work of the Chairman and members of the Authority and their staff.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most unnecessary legislation that ever came before this House.  That goes without saying, and it is apparent that the Minister is not even apologetic about introducing it.  For the first time ever since the foundation of this State we had a body who could co-ordinate the management of traffic and the control of roadwork plans in and around the city of Dublin.  Now all that good work is to be put aside.  Under the 1986 Dublin Transport Authority Act we had set up an authority who had statutory powers and who could regulate the traffic in the city.  They could bring in regulations to control that traffic and do the work that was necessary to co-ordinate it.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this Bill is necessary.  The Minister tells us in his address that it will save £0.5 million per annum.  I totally disagree with that statement.  The Dublin Transport Authority could be at least self-sufficient <Col N="2728" /> if they were allowed to function, therefore it is not a money saving exercise.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with this Government in their attempt to get rid of what is known nowadays as quangos.  I agree with the Government in their policy of getting rid of a number of bodies which are superfluous, particularly in times of financial difficulty.  This is not a Quango in the sense of all those other bodies which are being abolished or amalgamated. It was a totally necessary and desirable Authority and did not cost the State, the taxpayer, or anybody else a penny.</P>
      <P>I will give the House an indication of the type of money that is involved.  In 1984 a survey was carried out of 4,000 parking meter spaces in Dublin.  This survey showed an average of 8,518 parking offenders per day.  Only 6.2 per cent of these offenders received tickets.  If that same low level of enforcement had been clamping operations, then the contribution over and above expenses would be £1,320,000.  Imagine that.  With a very small detection rate of 6.2 per cent, if those offenders had to pay the fines, the income would be £1.32 million, and we are here today talking about an expenditure of £500,000.  That is being given as the reason for the abolition of this Authority.</P>
      <P>That does not make sense.  It is totally ridiculous to abolish this Authority.  Let us make another simple calculation.  If we were to talk about a 100 per cent detection rate &mdash; and this we would never have &mdash; we would be talking about an income of £20 million.  If we had a 15 per cent detection rate, that would yield an income of £10 million.  If we had a 20 per cent detection rate, a very reasonable figure, that would yield an income of £4 million.  Yet, we are abolishing a body which could generate money of that order for the sake of £500,000.  The reason being given for the abolition of this Authority is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the week I put in a question which was ruled out of order asking if the Minister would reconsider the decision to dissolve this body.  I was told that because of impending legislation the question <Col N="2729" /> would not be taken.  Is it too late for the Minister to reconsider because he cannot stand up in this House and justify what he proposes to do.</P>

      <P>I would ask that common sense prevail.  One of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Reynolds, on 14 April 1980, advocated the setting up of a statutory body to oversee the control of traffic in Dublin.  He said this was vitally necessary. Our Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, set about doing that and ultimately set up this Authority.  Now we find that this Minister is reversing the policy of both previous Ministers who agreed this was a necessary way forward so far as Dublin traffic problems were concerned.  I could quote at some length from what Deputy Reynolds said at that time but I have summarised his comments. He advocated the setting up of this statutory body, he set the wheels in motion to set up this body and now this Minister advocates its abolition.</P>
      <P>I am aware that it is the Minister's intention to replace the Authority by allocating some of their powers to various statutory bodies &mdash; the Department of the Environment and the Garda Síochána &mdash;and that he is reconstituting the Dublin transportation task force.  That may seem all right but the task force is non-statutory and will never have the teeth of the Authority and will never be able to achieve the aims of the 1986 legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority were set up because of the report of the Transport Consultative Commission which reported to the Minister in March 1980.  We had Deputy Reynolds speech in 1980 which agreed with the recommendations of the commission that we should have a statutory body to control traffic and parking in Dublin.  It is a pity that the good work of that commission has gone to waste, and by one stroke of the pen today, that is unfortunately what will happen.  That commission was one of a number which reported in the late sixties right through the seventies on the traffic problems in Dublin.  There was general agreement <Col N="2730" /> that it was a very fine report and that its findings should be implemented.  Hence the setting up of the Authority and what I can only call the stupidity of getting rid of that Authority as is proposed here today.</P>
    <P>I want to make specific comments on the proposed legislation.  The rights of the chief executive, the only staff member of the Authority, do not seem to be properly looked after in this Bill.  He came to the Dublin Authority from a local authority on the understanding that he had a job for as long as he was doing it properly &mdash; and we have no reason to believe he was doing it in any other but a first class manner.  Now, after a very short stay he is being thrown on the scrap heap.  I would like a guarantee from the Minister that the chief executive will not lose out because of this unnecessary legislation.  It is a frightful thing for a person, who gave up a very good job in a local authority to serve the country in this capacity, to find that the rug has been pulled from under his feet.  I would like a guarantee that this man will be able to find employment elsewhere in the public sector without losing any of his rights.  That is very important.  As far as I know, all the other staff were seconded from various Departments in the public sector and they have returned there.  Their position is unchanged.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister referred to a figure of £165,000.  I understand that this money is made available within the Department of Tourism and Transport Estimate for traffic management by Dublin Corporation. It seems a little odd that that money could not have been diverted on a temporary basis to the Dublin Transport Authority.  The chief executive's salary was about £28,000 and, even if you reach a higher figure taking office expenses and ancillary matters into account, the overall cost of the chief executive operation would hardly be in excess of £40,000 or £50,000.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £165,000 for traffic management.  So, if there is a case for saving £500,000 the work should be done within that allocation. The dissolution of the Authority is totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2731" /> I should like the Minister to make a comparison between the task force as he intends to reconstitute it and the task force as it existed prior to the setting up of the Authority.  Are the same Departments represented on the new task force? Are other statutory bodies included on it which were not previously part of the task force?  According to the Minister's statement, the local authority, the Garda and CIE are all to be part of the Dublin transport task force.  I am not quite sure of the constitution of the original task force and I would appreciate if the Minister will draw a comparison between the two.</P>
    <P>The management of bus lanes in Dublin city is imperative for proper traffic control in the capital.  The Authority did excellent work in that regard. The slap-happy manner we adopt towards bus lanes is just not good enough.  We had a debate in the House the other day on the Transport Bill and a number of questions were asked about Bus Éireann, particularly the bus system in Dublin city.  If you do not have proper traffic management and bus lanes which work properly there will be traffic and financial problems for Dublin transport because nobody wants to use a system which is constantly clogged.  If there is a drop in passenger use of Dublin buses, the primary reason is that people are not satisfied they are taking them from one point to another in the best possible time. We need not just good traffic management but bus lanes which are free of unnecessary traffic.  I will table an amendment on Committee Stage asking that bus lanes should also be used by cyclists because the legislation before us today seems to indicate that cyclists are to be hunted out of bus lanes.  If that is the case where, in God's name, will they go?  Will they go up on the footpaths or into the centre of the road to be mauled, battered and eventually run down by the traffic? Cyclists always had the facility to use bus lanes and it would be extraordinary if they were now denied that freedom.  It is totally unnecessary to exclude them.</P>
    <P>Bus lanes are not properly managed at <Col N="2732" /> present.  I ask the Minister to ensure that more gardaí are allocated to keeping bus lanes free because it must be most annoying for drivers and staff generally of CIE to find that a special system which was set up to facilitate the passage of buses and the free movement of public transport is being abused.  Every day of the week we can see that there is not sufficient supervision of bus lanes to allow public transport to move freely.  I would have thought it would be a self-financing exercise to keep the bus lanes free because of the fines which would accrue from prosecuting the thousands of drivers who abuse the bus lanes every day of the week.  We have part of a system in place which should be working satisfactorily but is not because it is not policed properly. There are not sufficient people monitoring what is going on and that is why there is abuse of a good system.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was considering transferring functions to other statutory authorities it might have been a good idea to mention transferring functions to the new local authority bodies which are mooted for the greater Dublin area.  At present the two local authorities are the corporation and the county council but, under proposals brought forward by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Boland, there were to be a whole series of new local authorities within the greater Dublin area.  Perhaps the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, will examine the possibility of setting up these new bodies and the handing over of the functions of the Dublin Transport Authority to the new local authority system.</P>
    <P>This legislation is totally unnecessary and it would have been better for everybody using Dublin buses if it was withdrawn. We need co-ordination of traffic control and we do not want the chaos that exists in Grafton Street and College Green where the traffic is virtually at a standstill because of roadworks.  We do not want to see somebody coming along in a month's time digging up the same roadway.  One need only walk around the streets of the city to see the chaotic system whereby 20 different bodies seem <Col N="2733" /> to have power to come along and dig up the streets with no reference whatsoever to a central body.  They are all little empires within themselves and even if the street had been dug up last week for one purpose seemingly it can be dug up the following week for another purpose. It is madness to allow that system to continue.  You cannot do anything about it unless there is a statutory body to control that type of activity.  Taxpayers should not be put in a position where they are being milked because of the lack of organisation of traffic in the capital city. It is disgraceful.  Let commonsense prevail and withdraw this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy that the proposal to abolish the Dublin Transport Authority gives rise for concern, as they were intended to be the body which would make a major impact on the appalling traffic problems that exist in Dublin and its environs.</P>
      <P>Their functions are now to be transferred back to the agencies that previously held responsibility in this area and of course there is no guarantee at all that this change in structure will effect any real improvement in the traffic situation.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transport Authority which was established in November 1986, was set up after numerous reports and studies had confirmed that there was an urgent need for an independent statutory body to co-ordinate transport investment, traffic management and public transport services in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Authority is now being strangled at birth and its functions are being transferred back to the various agencies from whence they came, such as the local authorities, CIE, the Garda authorities and various Government Departments.  This move seems to make a complete nonsense out of the very arguments that were put forward in this House only a short time ago by both the major parties for the establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the overlapping of responsibility between these various agencies that the need for a single statutory body with responsibility and the <Col N="2734" /> necessary powers was self-evident and the DTA was established to co-ordinate all traffic management functions, to rid Dublin of its appalling traffic jams and to give it a reliable and cheap transport system.</P>
    <P>The problem for the DTA during their short period of existence was that they did not have sufficient resources available to them and they could not be effective because they had limited powers; they were mainly advisory powers.  After all the reports and recommendations about the necessity for a single authority, it now seems illogical to dismantle this integrated structure and hand back, on a piecemeal basis, the responsibility to those uncoordinated agencies who were unable to solve the transport problems of the capital city in the past and who, it must be said, were largely responsible for the creation of the traffic chaos in the first place because they operated independently of each other.</P>
    <P>The Transport Consultative Commission which Deputy Deasy referred to reported to the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in 1980. Their main recommendation was the establishment of a statutory Dublin authority who would be given powers to ensure that their decisions would be implemented.  During the long delay between the commission's report and the establishment of the DTA in 1986, there was a non-statutory Dublin task force in operation who comprised of representatives of Government Departments and various other agencies such as CIE, the local authorities and the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The task force achieved limited success in the encouragement of commuters to switch from private cars to public transport through a combination of improvements to the bus services and the introduction of a parking policy which discouraged all-day parking in the city centre.  However, it was accepted that if there was to be a worthwhile effort made at solving Dublin's traffic problems it would be necessary to establish a statutory authority with real powers.  At the time the DTA Bill was debated in this <Col N="2735" /> House, the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, said in relation to the task force that notwithstanding the improvements they had achieved, the traffic congestion continued to persist and was a major problem.  He pointed out that the continuing lack of a single authority with responsibility and the necessary powers for traffic management in the Dublin area meant that the problem could not be tackled effectively.  He further pointed out that the task force who are dependent on the combined efforts of their member agencies, each of whom have their own priorities and concerns, lacked the cohesion necessary to ensure that the problem could be tackled properly.  If that was the case then, surely it equally applies now?  Is there any point reaching back into the past to find a solution that we know from experience has not worked before?  What faith can we have in the measures that are proposed in this Bill?</P>
    <P>The question of a statutory authority with effective powers has been discussed, debated and reported on <i>ad finitum</i> but it has been established beyond doubt that we do need an authority who have powers not just to make decisions but to ensure that the decisions are implemented. However, we have never established such a body.  As I said before the problem with the DTA was that the 1986 Act which set them up was too weak in its provisions and the authority were little more than a statutory version of the task force who proceeded them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the decision to abolish the DTA was motivated by the desire to reduce public expenditure and that a saving to the Exchequer of approximately £500,000 based on a fully staffed operational authority, would be made on the winding up of the Authority.  I am all in favour of savings in public expenditure but there must be a rational approach to what services should be cut.  It should be based on a cost-benefit analysis of any particular service.</P>
    <P>Obviously the economy would benefit greatly by having an efficient traffic system in operation in the Dublin area. The £500,000 which the DTA would cost <Col N="2736" /> is very small if the DTA had the capacity to ensure that there would be a major reduction in the chaotic traffic jams that exist on the streets of Dublin.  The problem seems to be that they do not have that capacity.  In any event the £500,000 saving is hypothetical as the Authority have one employee only, the chief executive and the remaining staff as Deputy Deasy said are seconded from the Civil Service and no saving can be made in respect of their salaries through the abolition of the Authority.</P>
    <P>What is really needed of course is an Authority who have a mandate similar to that of the DTA but who would have the required powers to ensure that their recommendations and directives would be implemented.  The DTA had some very important functions assigned to them.  They were to be the road traffic authority, with responsibility for all traffic management schemes; they were to have responsibility for the taxi service; for the routing, pricing and licensing of all bus services; and they were to have control over the provision of car parking in the Dublin area and over the timing and co-ordination of roadworks.  These are all highly important functions.  They are even more important now in the light of the Government's confirmation that there will be no underground system for Dublin and the fact that there is a growing and increasing volume of road traffic coming into the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The question of roadworks has become a national joke.  Time after time, Members of this House and the public generally have condemned the ludicrous situation where the ESB, Telecom Éireann, the corporation utilities and so on, re-open roads one after another to instal or repair services.  The lack of control in the area of roadworks is one of the major causes for the huge traffic jams that develop in and around Dublin.  It is a disgrace that this is allowed to continue. The DTA would have been the ideal body to clear and sanction road-opening licences but they were not given the power to ensure that all of these companies would first get the approval of the <Col N="2737" /> DTA before they opened up the roads. Control of that nature is vital.</P>
    <P>If a street is being paved or if one utility company are installing services, then all other utility companies should be notified that they have a specific time within which to instal, repair or maintain their services in that particular street.  That kind of co-ordination would go a long way towards relieving traffic jams.  I accept that some road openings will have to be made on an emergency basis but they account for a very small proportion of all road openings.  Another disturbing feature in this area is the fact that the corporation, Dublin Gas and the other utilities are not even sure where their underground pipes or conduits are.  In many instances many roads are opened just to discover where pipes are.  What assurances can the Minister give us that this saga is now going to be brought to an end under the proposals he has brought before the House today?</P>
    <P>The regulation of the taxi service is a very important matter.  This service was to be under the control of the DTA.  A good, well run, efficient and clean taxi service is something which is found in all other cities and this makes a major impression on visitors and for many of them it is the first impression they get of the city.  The regulation of taxi services is now being transferred back to the Department of the Environment.  Again, are we just transferring responsibility around with no real increased powers to ensure that the taxi service is brought up to a better standard?</P>
    <P>It is clear we have identified what needs to be done in many of these areas and that we have established structures in the past to undertake these functions but these structures were not adequate.  In any event we are now dismantling them again.  What we must really ask in relation to all of this is whether we can rely on the various agencies to get their act together once and for all and sort out these very pressing problems?  I have grave reservations that handing the authority back to the agencies will achieve what we all hope it will achieve.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the position of <Col N="2738" /> the chief executive of the Dublin Transport authority, Mr. Murray.  Deputy Deasy also referred to him.  Mr. Murray has been an employee of the local authority for about 19 years and I understand he is a very competent and capable public servant.  He was attracted to apply for the position of chief executive of the Dublin Transport Authority because he saw it as a challenging position and he had the capacity to fulfil it.  He has been appointed for about a year and I understand he has now been offered a voluntary redundancy package but that he is not going to accept it.  I further understand he has been offered a position with Dublin Bus on a one year basis subject to an option to renew it for a further year and that he may be redeployed in the public service after that period expires but there is no guarantee, of course, that he will be so redeployed.  The conditions and the terms of the offer by Dublin Bus are considered less attractive than those in his capacity as chief executive of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I would like to say to the Minister, and this is touching on the point raised by Deputy Deasy, that Mr. Murray should be given a guarantee that the position he holds as chief executive of the Dublin Transport Authority would not be in any way lessened by virtue of the fact that the authority is now being abolished.</P>
    <P>My interpretation is that Mr. Murray's contract with the Dublin Transport Authority under the terms of the Bill appears to be null and void.  The Minister can disclaim responsibility for him and does not have to honour any of the terms of his employment contract.  If that is the case it seems to be very unfair and seems to be an unique situation as I am not aware that it applies to any other public servant who finds himself in a similar position to Mr. Murray where the body he works for is being abolished.</P>
    <P>In the time allowed to us today I do not know if we will have an opportunity to have a full Committee Stage debate on this matter but I ask the Minister to accept an amendment at this stage to section 4(1) and 4(3).  I would like to ask the Minister to delete the words in <Col N="2739" /> brackets, &ldquo;(other than a member of the staff of the Authority)&rdquo; in section 4(1).</P>

      <P>The subsections that I referred to mean that Mr. Murray's contract does not have to be honoured but contracts made between the Dublin Transport Authority and any other body or person will remain in force.  Does the Minister agree that if that is the position then it must be considered as very unfair. I ask him in his reply to give me assurances that Mr. Murray's position will not be totally undermined in the way I have outlined.</P>
      <P>It looks as if Mr. Murray's superannuation entitlements will be under threat also.  I understand that in order for the superannuation scheme to become effective an instrument would have to be laid before the House 21 days prior to the enactment of this legislation.  Clearly that is not the position in his case.  Does that mean that his superannuation scheme has been scrapped and, if so, is it so that he would be forced to opt for a voluntary redundancy package?  I ask the Minister to address those points.</P>

      <P>We are engaged today in a very sordid business.  I want to extend &mdash; and I genuinely mean this &mdash; a sense of personal sympathy to the Minister who has been sent in here to deliver his part of the Cabinet deal.  From my own experience and knowing some of the documents that emanate from the Department of Finance, each Department was probably asked to provide a sacrificial victim in order to demonstrate to the public that this Government are about their business of quango hunting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy might recall some of the targets that had labels attached to them <Col N="2740" /> on an earlier occasion.  For the purposes of recollection I suggest that there is a connection between the massacre of the Dublin Transport Authority from the Department of Tourism and Transport, upon which we are asked to give our consent, the abolition of the National Social Service Board from the Department of Health and the abolition of An Foras Forbartha from the Department of the Environment.  I will put it to the Minister that during the summer of this year Cabinet Ministers were instructed or requested by the Department of Finance to come forward with victims that could safely demonstrate this Government's intent of some degree of fiscal rectitude.  The Civil Service did not produce victims from within its own ranks but effectively nominated the in-laws, in this case bodies that has been established by them following exhaustive reports.  If, in the season of Christmas, we are to make biblical references, this is the massacre of one of Herod's or perhaps Haughey's innocents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the origin of this entire distasteful and sordid exercise to which this House is being asked to give its consent.  The Labour Party are fundamentally opposed to this Bill in principle and we will be dealing with amendments to it in due course when they are circulated.  That is the real origin of this illogical, nonsensical legislation that has been hurried to this House in advance of the end of this calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister because his speech which carries his own personal imprint is one of regret and he pleads economies and savings.  I believe he thinks there are economies and savings. The secretary of another Cabinet in a jurisdiction not too far away from this island, an island of a larger size and population in which the Minister lived for many years and indeed on occasions was, I believe, a member of the British Labour Party, in a court case in Australia argued that he was being economical with the truth with respect to arguments being put <Col N="2741" /> forward in defence of Mrs. Thatcher's attempts to stifle the publication of the book, <i>Spy Catcher</i>.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister and to his officials that they are being economical with the figures in respect of the savings they are suggesting will be effected in relation to what can be achieved by the massacre and dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I will deal with that matter later.</P>
    <P>My argument is that, from the very basis of that minimalist argument that the Minister has put forward, one of regrettable necessity to cut costs, he has not proved or demonstrated to a satisfactory degree that he is really saving costs in the order of £500,000 which he suggests, by leaving them hang in his speech, would be the cost of the Dublin Transport Authority. The only cost that the Minister's officials have had the courage to cut with alacrity has been the working and legal entitlements of the chief executive, to the extent that in section 4, whereby this Government and this House are being asked to honour every other contract with every other body, there is inserted in brackets a provision whereby we are being asked to exclude from that the one employee of the Dublin Transport Authority. If ever the European Court of Human Rights had a case test made for it within the commission of the communities of European nations to which we belong this seems, on a <i>prima facie</i> basis, to be a classical case.  One could ask how could it be just for the Dáil to agree to honour every contract, none of which has been specified in the Minister's speech?  We do not know what contracts there might be, for example, in relation to outstanding fees to consultants who were a legacy of the Dublin transportation task force.  Their contract for fees is automatically presumed to be valid.  The Minister cannot justify this even with the economy of argument and reason which has been put in the Minster's speech.  I do not believe that it is based on grounds of economy and that substantial savings are to be made.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority has had a chequered history.  It has spanned <Col N="2742" /> different Administrations and it is probably true to say that there is all-party agreement on the need for co-ordination in this area.  The first resolution I ever moved as a public representative was as a member of Dublin City Council in September 1974 to establish a Dublin transport authority and this motion was greeted with support from all quarters.  In latter days, Fianna Fáil with Deputy Faulkner as Minister, in 1978, established the commission and the report came two years later recommending the establishment of a Dublin transport authority.  I will quote the arguments made by the current Minister for Industry and Commerce, then Minister for Transport in favour of accepting the recommendations of that report.  The press release issued on 14 April 1980 said:</P>
    <P>My Department has prepared a summary of the Commission's report and copies are available here today.  The main findings include the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;traffic congestion in Dublin is extremely bad and could get worse;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in general, the major infrastructural improvements which are planned will take many years to complete, so short-term measures assume a greater significance;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the enforcement of road traffic regulations is inadequate;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the lack of effective action to date is to a large extent a consequence of the varying statutory functions and responsibilities of the three bodies most directly concerned (CIE, the local authorities and the Garda Síochána), who report to three different Ministers (the Ministers for Transport, the Environment and Justice), and also of the lack of co-ordinated assessment, planning and implementation of measures to improve transportation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Commission has made a number of important recommendations designed to bring about an improvement in the present very unsatisfactory transport and traffic situation in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2743" /> I will not go on to read the rest of this to the House but it refers basically to the establishment of the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far back as 1980, these were the arguments to justify the establishment of this authority.  There is clearly an intellectual argument which has support on all sides for the retention of the integration of these functions.  This Bill is proposing to undo the work of at least 10 years.  Where is the economy and the savings in undoing the business of ten years in an area where there is broad all-party support?  There is no economy there.  The Minister knows that.  The attempt by the Bill to scatter the responsibility over three separate Departments is tragic.  The core criticism of the report in 1980, to which the Minister gave consent, in terms of the arguments he put forward, of the dispersal of ultimate responsibility over three Government Departments is now being formally proposed again in this Bill albeit in a slightly improved way.  We are undoing the construction work which has engaged time, energy and taxpayers' money over a period of ten years.  This measure being advocated in the interests of economy is simply crazy.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinary need in relation to the problems of random conduit exploration that statutory bodies embark on at different times, to find out if there is a pipe under a certain street.  A statutory body usually waits until another statutory authority has provided an especially laid coat of asphalt or as we saw in the case of Grafton Street, an especially laid set of cobble-rock bricks, to make it slightly more difficult and perhaps more adventurous to find out if there is a conduit under the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This city desperately needs an integrated transport authority which would provide an integrated transport plan.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle as a member of one of the three planning authorities for Dublin city will know that we never got our act together in terms of planning to <Col N="2744" /> provide a proper integrated planning service so that the corporation tenants who were housed from the inner city to suburban corporation estates in Tallaght, Blanchardstown or Clondalkin would have the guarantee of an adequate transport service in and out of town so that they could visit their parents and in-laws. The Dublin Transport Authority was beginning to make slow progress in that area.  Because they were a statutory body the manager of Dublin city and of Dún Laoghaire and Dublin County had to listen to their recommendations.  They will no longer have to listen to the recommendations of the reconstituted Dublin Transportation Task Force.  This is nonsense. We are talking about a city and suburbs which extend as far as Celbridge, to parts of Meath and into the northern parts of County Wicklow.  This decision flies in the face of reason.  The arguments for the need for a co-ordinated transport plan for Dublin city are self-evident.</P>
    <P>Last night the Lord Mayor of Dublin complimented the Taoiseach and the Government on supporting and co-operating with the Millenium Board in their plans and proposals for the Millenium which will be inaugurated on Christmas Eve.  In a few years time, or in 200 years time, when people wish to see the legacy of the Department of Transport to Dublin city they will see although it took eight to ten years to get our act together in terms of a Dublin Transport Authority, that within hours of the announcement of the Millenium, on 1 January, the Department of Transport and the Minister of the day will have succeeded in cutting the legs from under it and scattering responsibility to three different Departments.  This is some present; and this is being done in the interests of costsaving.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Deasy made a point in relation to staff.  Do the Department and the Minister believe that a contract made with an individual in respect of his personal income and pension rights is as valid and as important as a contract made with consultants to provide a report, or a contract made with a manufacturer for building materials and <Col N="2745" /> labour?  If they do, why have they put in that exempting clause?  Were the Department of Labour consulted about this legislation in the normal way?  Did the Department of Labour, with their responsibility for the protection in legislative terms of the rights of anybody working for a living, raise a question mark in relation to this clause in section 4?  If so, was it accepted or rejected?  Did it slip through while nobody was noticing or did the Department of Labour spotlight this point as they should have done? Did the Department of Finance say that notwithstanding the objections of the Department of Labour they were going ahead?</P>
    <P>The Minister has broad educational and transportational experience and has been a member of a number of Administration. Does he believe that any of the officials in his Department or in the Departments in which he has served would themselves accept reduction in salary, the removal of some of the fringe benefits which they enjoy as part of their remuneration and a reduction in the duration of employment from the normal retirement age to a guarantee of at least one year?  Would any official who had anything to do with this document accept those terms?  If not for them, why for Mr. Murray?</P>
    <P>My fourth question relates to whether the Minister has consulted with CIE management who told union representatives last Tuesday that over 800 people will have to go?  Did they also say at that meeting that they were getting somebody for a year from the Dublin Transport Authority?  Was that fact put on the table in the course of the discussions?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think again. I must accept, although I do not like it, that there is a reduction in money.  This whole Bill could be put into cold storage. The functions currently carried out by the Dublin Transport Authority could be assigned to different groups without undoing the legislation.  There are many administrative ways in which some of the activities and functions could be carried out by the Minister's Department and others.  The Minister recognises this point <Col N="2746" /> because he has made approximately £165,000 available for traffic management schemes.  That is a recognition in part of the need for some continuity. The Minister's heart is not in this Bill. He knows this is a bad day's work.  We are not trying to undermine the Minister's position or that of the Government.  The Minister has been obliged to come into this House with this legislation and the Labour Party are opposed to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister shares that disappointment, although he is very well able to speak for himself and I will not presume to speak on his behalf.  He expressed the view during his speech on Second Stage that many people find the dissolution of the authority unfortunate. The Minister nevertheless intends to reconstitute the Dublin Transportation Task Force.  I suspect we are not altogether abandoning the Dublin Transport Authority's role in general transport and traffic matters.  We should be grateful for small mercies.  It is fundamental to the future traffic management of this city and county that we have some group or organisation presiding over the chaos which is traffic in Dublin today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to localise my contribution to Blackrock, Monkstown, Dún Laoghaire, the Merrion Road to Merrion Gates and the traffic flows from Donnybrook, stillorgan, Foxrock, Leopardstown and Shankill.  I refer particularly to the imward traffic flow every morning from Monday to Friday inclusive between the hours of 8.15 a.m. and 9.45 a.m. and the outward flow in the evening from 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  During these hours the traffic is bumper to bumper.  It never ceases to amaze me that some organisation does not examine the principle of contra-flow traffic.  In the morning there are empty lanes leading out from the city in the direction of Blackrock and <Col N="2747" /> Stillorgan.  One of these lanes should be utilised by incoming traffic in the interests of speedy traffic management.  In the evening there is traffic chaos from the Merrion Gates to Blackrock and Monkstown. It is truly disgraceful in terms of lost time and energy and the stress which afflicts modern man and woman.  We subject ourselves to such stress daily merely to get from Monkstown to the city centre.  I am thinking here of the outskirts, places such as Baggot Street, Leeson Street and so on.  We spend an hour each morning in our cars on the inward journey to the city centre.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of national sanity, of proper traffic control, of all those individuals, including myself, who have to withstand this stress commuting to and from their workplace every day of their lives, that a contra-flow traffic lane be opened urgently on these routes, on these dual carriageways, which indeed are a disgrace to their name, but particularly the route from Monkstown to Merrion Gates.  Once one reaches Merrion Gates the backlog seems to disperse and one begins to move but, to get from Dún Laoghaire, Monkstown, Blackrock to Merrion Gates is an expedition.  There is a sense of relief, of attainment when one finally reaches the end of this appalling traffic jungle every morning and evening.</P>
    <P>I cannot express sufficiently strongly the insanity of the situation.  Why, in the name of goodness, cannot the flow of this commuter traffic be loosened up by proper traffic management controls?  It is not a bad little country basically; there are so many positive things going for it. I can never understand why we do not avail of the opportunities available to us, and that remedy would constitute one of them.  Not only should the principle of contra-flow traffic be applied on those routes but also in other parts of Dublin city and county and other cities and towns nationwide.  I am not competent to speak about other areas but I am very capable of representing those motorists who commute daily from south county Dublin who are subjected to those traffic conditions. <Col N="2748" /> It is utterly disgraceful.  Why could we not, by way of tribute to the millennium, ensure a sane traffic flow by way of proper traffic management in these and other areas?  I represent the Dún Laoghaire area and I make that appeal on behalf of my constituents who suffer the indignity of sitting for hours in their cars each morning and evening in those appalling traffic conditions.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is an alternative, a first class DART service, but that tends to be over-crowded.  I do not want to decry that service in any way, it constitutes a competent alternative to people commuting along the line.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to examine the principle of contra-flow traffic for the areas I have mentioned and, if necessary, others.  There has been a first-class by-pass built and completed in Blackrock.  There are teething difficulties being encountered there at present. There is a necklace of traffic lights, for want of a better description, within the space of a couple of hundred yards.  It is totally unacceptable that this series of traffic lights is not properly co-ordinated. This is another matter this reconstituted authority might examine, again for the sake of sane traffic management, for the sake of those people who have to stop at every traffic light along the way, sometimes caught in the maw of the series of six.  In principle the by-pass is a very good one and has done much, not alone for the entire Blackrock region but for the township itself.  Although there are teething problems I believe the traffic there will sort itself out in time.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty of finding parking spaces in the town of Blackrock itself which is a matter of concern to local traders.  Now that there is a first-class shopping centre in Blackrock, the traders who have been loyal to Blackrock over the years should be given a fair deal.  I do not want to take up the entire time of the traffic task force with the constituency of Dún Laoghaire but there are a number of matters there warranting examination which would be to everybody's benefit.</P>
    <P>The other matter of concern to me is roads signposting.  It is very easy to get <Col N="2749" /> lost in the city and county of Dublin, particularly when tourists and our country cousins travel on these roads, because the signposting is deplorable; either it is non-existent or, where it exists, is totally inadequate.  I would ask the Minister to initiate a comprehensive, easily understood, signposting programme so that natives and tourists alike could negotiate our highways and byways efficiently and speedily.</P>
    <P>The other matter I would request the Minister to bring to the attention of local authorities, particularly in growth areas such as surburban south county Dublin, is the control of traffic within housing estates where such traffic can be a real danger to young children.  There should be a slowing-down of traffic in these estates.  I would suggest that the Minister recommend to builders of such housing estates the introduction of a system of rumble strips.  These are small, raised barriers on the roadways which cause car drivers to slow down or cause damage to their vehicles.  That would be in the interests of children and young people generally.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the cost of road traffic accidents.  In this respect there are interesting statistics contained in a 1984 Report of An Foras Forbartha, entitled &ldquo;Road Accident Facts&rdquo;.  The report is based on road traffic accident information recorded by the Garda Síochána. Under the heading of &ldquo;Cost of Road Accidents&rdquo; on page 2 of this publication there appears the following:</P>
    <P>The yearly cost to the community of road traffic accidents continues to remain at a very high level.  Using the method based on lost output to estimate costs, a method which is in some ways inadequate for that purpose, a fatal accident is currently estimated at £230,000 when medical care and police costs are taken into account, as well as a notional sum to compensate for grief and loss.</P>
    <P>&mdash;which at present, under the amended Civil Liability Act, is in the region of £7,500.  The report then continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2750" /> The cost of injury accidents can vary widely, but on average a serious injury accident is estimated to cost £12,000 and a minor injury accident some £1,800.  The total cost to the community is of the order of £220 million a year.</P>
    <P>Those are unbelievable statistics, at which I gasped when I read them.  When historians come to write the history of our nation and look at the carnage on our country's roads since the foundation of the State, or the inception of the motorpropelled vehicle, and the number of people killed annually, no doubt they will see it as one of the great social evils of modern living, particularly in modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude, leaving the way clear for others who may wish to speak on this subject after Question Time.</P>

      <P>I would like to take up the whole question of the DTA itself. While obviously the points made by Deputy Andrews were on very important issues, the decision to abolish the DTA is, I believe, very shortsighted and a retrograde step and, according to the records of the House, goes contrary to the views expressed by the present Minister when he was in Opposition here only last year.  For that reason The Workers' Party will be opposing this Bill on the conclusion of Second Stage and, indeed, on the conclusion of the Bill today at 5 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 7 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the three schemes in question, i.e. free electricity, free telephone rental and free television licence, is closely linked because they apply to persons with an underlying entitlement to one of a range of payments common to all three.</P>
      <P>In fact, receipt of free electricity allowance acts as a passport to receipt of a free TV licence.  Although there are some differences in the conditions of entitlement between the free telephone rental scheme and the other two schemes, in practice a single review process is usually sufficient to determine whether a claimant is qualified in each case and separate reviews for each scheme are not therefore necessary.</P>
      <P>In the period in question some 40,000 entitlements under the free schemes were reviewed in one way or another.  The majority of the reviews, some 28,000, arose by reason of changes to the person's underlying pension entitlement or to changes in the person's family circumstances. About half of these lead to termination of entitlement to the free schemes.  The remainder arose as part of the Department's ongoing control and review procedures and about 10 per cent of these reviews resulted in entitlement to the free scheme being withdrawn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of reviews of recipients of unemployment assistance undertaken by his Department for the period 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All recipients under the various schemes administered by my Department are subject to continuous review to ensure that the claimants continue to satisfy the appropriate conditions under which payments are authorised. Although statistics are maintained in some cases, figures covering all reviews carried out in the period mentioned are not available.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for unemployment assistance a claimant is required to be unemployed, capable of work, available for work and genuinely seeking work. The claimant must also satisfy a means test.  Therefore, a review of unemployment assistance recipients can take the form of either a review of means or a review of whether the claimant continues to satisfy the other conditions for entitlement to payment.</P>
      <P>During the period 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1987 some 63,000 reviews of means in unemployment cases were carried out by officials of my Department.  Reviews may be carried out at the initiative of the Department or at the request of claimants where they consider that their financial circumstances have changed since the initial investigation of means. This could arise, for example, where the spouse of a claimant had originally been employed and is now no longer employed or, in the case of a self-employed person, where the income may have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to satisfying the other conditions, there is an ongoing process of review of claimants.  For instance deciding officers at local offices of my Department must satisfy themselves that each claimant is available for, and genuinely seeking work.  In reviewing claims in this context the deciding officer must be satisfied that the claimant is unemployed, is in a position to take up full-time work and is in fact willing to do so.  Statistics of the number of claims reviewed at local <Col N="2753" /> offices under this heading are not maintained.</P>
    <P>An external control unit was established last year and the work of this section involves the continuous review of claimants.  Control officers operate at the Department's local offices for the sole purpose of reviewing both unemployment assistance and benefit claims. Over 8,000 claimants have been called for interview by this unit.</P>
    <P>Officers of my Department's special investigation unit investigate possible concurrent working and claiming by unemployment assistance as well as unemployment benefit claimants.  Apart from the investigation of reports received of abuses, officers of the unit also attend at signing centres throughout the country and interview claimants.  In the 12 month period in question some 4,500 unemployment recipients were reviewed by this unit.</P>
    <P>To date this year some 130,000 unemployment benefit and assistance recipients have been interviewed by the National Manpower Service under the Jobsearch programme.  Claimants who do not accept an invitation to participate in this programme have also had their cases reviewed, resulting in 1,785 disallowances so far this year.  In addition, almost 11,500 left the live register voluntarily either before or after being interviewed by the National Manpower Service under the programme.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on all claimants to bring any change in their circumstances to the attention of the Department. Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the circumstances of a claimant might have altered, the case is referred for immediate review.</P>
    <P>The reviews I have outlined are the main ones.  Their main purpose is to ensure that the scheme of unemployment assistance is as secure as possible against abuse while at the same time providing a good and efficient service giving their full entitlements to the vast majority of recipients who have genuine entitlements to payment.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister <Col N="2754" /> any proposals to change the procedure whereby assessment of means is based on the means of a claimant on a particular day?  I am thinking in particular of young people whose father or mother may be working and, on the day an inspector calls, the income for that particular week may be higher relative to the overall income of the household.  Has the Minister any plans to change that and take a more general approach to income into the household?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be reviewing the whole operation of that system for a variety of reasons, not just the one the Deputy mentioned.  I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of people wanting to avail themselves of casual work and being able to be away for very short periods.  There are arrangements which facilitate this, but they may not be flexible enough to deal with the circumstances that arise.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is the difficulty in doing all these calculations repeatedly and changing them and so on.  We have now just completed computerising the unemployment assistance in Dublin and are starting in Cork.  That will offer new opportunities for flexibility which were not available hitherto.  That is something that can be looked at.  The increased cost would obviously be a factor to be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's indication that a wider review is taking place, I suggested previously that a self-assessment system could be introduced in relation to unemployment assistance, just as there is in relation to the self-employed in the tax area, where there would be a requirement to provide documentation, thus reducing the delays that are involved at present in making assessments.  Has the Minister any intention of considering that aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons that approach has not gained any favour in the past is the lack of control and flexibility in the whole system.  Certainly, I shall <Col N="2755" /> consider the possibility of its becoming more flexible in a variety of ways.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give details of the leases of employment offices and the particular conditions regarding the forms of payment to branch managers at the unemployment exchanges in County Galway; if there are any <i>per capita</i> payments to those from whom premises are rented; and if he has satisfied himself regarding conditions at such exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question refers to the branch employment offices operated for my Department in County Galway.  There are five such offices, located in Ballinasloe, Gort, Loughrea, Oughterard and Tuam.</P>
      <P>Each office is operated by a branch manager who is appointed under a contract for service.  The function of the branch manager is to act as an agent for the Department; to accept claims and issue payments in respect of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Under the terms of the contract the manager is obliged to provide suitable office accommodation in respect of which the Department pay an allowance towards the costs involved.</P>
      <P>The Department are not party to any lease or other arrangements entered into by branch managers in connection with the provision of premises.  This is an entirely private matter between branch managers and the owners of the properties concerned.</P>
      <P>The rate of the accommodation allowance referred to is determined by the number of unemployed persons registered at each office.  Apart from that allowance, branch managers are paid a basic salary of £10,575 per annum plus additional remuneration based on the number of registrants in excess of the first 100 on their register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Branch managers are also paid additional amounts for certain specific <Col N="2756" /> items of work such as pay related benefit payments, butter vouchers issued under the EC butter scheme; cases dealt with under the Government's Jobsearch programme and for completed registration forms furnished to the National Manpower Service in connection with the Youth Employment Agency scheme.  An annual leave allowance is also payable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of accommodation, there has been considerable pressure in recent years on all of the Department's offices and branch offices due to the high levels of unemployment. The situation in each office is kept under review and arrangements are made where possible, to reduce waiting times and the need for queuing.  It is considered that the premises currently in use as branch employment offices in County Galway are adequate for present needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice the interesting form of payments to which the Minister referred, which is a basic salary plus a headage allowance, if you like.  He refers to the suitability of accommodation.  Can it be presumed that suitability will include the provision of privacy?  Secondly, does it include adequate opening hours?  For example, in regard to the Loughrea exchange there are 700 people unemployed who have to appear there twice a week, once to sign and the second time to get their money.  Why have those people to come twice?  Thirdly, in relation to conditions generally, is the Minister happy with the siting of these offices in County Galway which he mentions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy probably is aware, I should personally like to see a much higher standard in the offices throughout the country as a whole; that would be our objective.  Particularly, we are interested in the one stop shop concept which ties in with that, that there would be better facilities wherever possible and that they would be on a coordinated basis.  We are building privacy into the offices that we are developing now.  We are providing separate cubicles or sections which give a good degree of privacy.  If the Deputy feels that this is <Col N="2757" /> not feasible in the present circumstances in some of these branches, I shall have a look at that matter.  It may not be feasible short term, but I appreciate the need for privacy and would be anxious to do anything that could be done about it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's assurance.  It has been indicated to his Department that no arrangements for privacy are available in three of the five exchanges referred to and I appreciate the Minister's commitment in that regard.  I also asked why people had to appear twice at the exchanges, particularly in circumstances where facilities are limited, but also in so far as the times that are advertised for attendance are concerned.  Is it reasonable to open an office for one hour and expect 700 people to attend within that hour?  This is the condition which prevails at one of the exchanges mentioned in the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the objectives of the voluntary work scheme for the unemployed; the performance of that scheme to date based on the objective; if he has <Col N="2758" /> any plans to make changes in this programme to improve its performance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary work scheme for the unemployed was introduced in response to representations that unemployed people were unwilling to engage in voluntary work because if they did so their availability for paid employment, and in consequence their entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance, might be called into question.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the scheme are two fold; to make opportunities available to the unemployed for taking up voluntary work and to encourage voluntary organisations to involve the unemployed as much as possible in their activities.</P>
      <P>The performance of the scheme to date has undoubtedly been disappointing and a relatively small number of persons only have taken up the facility.  I cannot say why the scheme is not used to a greater extent, but it may be that unemployed people, being aware of the existence of the scheme, in many cases engage in voluntary work without going through the formal procedures involved.</P>
      <P>The future role of the voluntary work scheme and other schemes for the benefit of the unemployed are being examined in my Department and all possibilities which might provide further encouragement and opportunities for unemployed people will be explored in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to comment on the following, first that the failure to make provision for out-of-pocket expenses for those who might want to participate in the voluntary scheme is a major disincentive to participation? This view has been made known.  Secondly, is the grants scheme for voluntary organisations not more capital intensive than labour intensive? Would he consider changes in his scheme to bring it into line with the British scheme which enables grants to be made which are specifically labour orientated rather than capital orientated?  This <Col N="2759" /> would improve the numbers participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary grants scheme is, as the Deputy says, mainly for capital items because they are once off items, although not necessarily capital items.  We provide funds for courses run by, for instance, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, such as special home management courses on a once off basis.  A good deal of this work is capital, such as buses for the handicapped and for social service delivery.  The health board have the function of dealing with the current requirement.  I appreciate that our two activities in that respect overlap to some extent.  That is an area that needs further clarification, to say the least.  Certainly, I shall look into the matter but the scheme as it stands at the moment is, of course, specifically for these once off grants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the question of out-of-pocket expenses.  The position is that the organisation concerned may find it possible to pay out of pocket expenses and the Department of Social Welfare have no objection to this; full unemployment benefits may be paid.  It may be going too far to provide additional moneys.  On the other hand, it is true to say that not many people have taken up the scheme as yet.  I will be giving attention to this scheme very early in the New Year with a view to beefing it up and improving it.  I want to make people aware of the scheme.  There are many voluntary organisations who would like to avail of the services of those who would like to be doing something useful rather than just staying at home.  I will be prepared to look at anything which will bring this about.</P>

      <P>By way of being helpful to the Minister let me put another suggestion to him.  Would the Minister consider reviewing the information which is available at the different employment exchanges, many of which do not seem to be aware of the availability of this scheme?  In his review of the scheme <Col N="2760" /> would he consider voluntary organisations making as a component of their application out of pocket expenses as this would increase the number of unemployed people involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting and very helpful suggestion and I will consider it.  As one who has done a lot of voluntary work I cannot understand why this scheme is not being taken up.  I have been kept nailed down here so much that I have not been able to give it attention. At the beginning of the New Year I will try to reorganise the scheme and to advertise it, not only to the public but also to the staff of the employment exchanges. Oddly enough, this scheme has been in place for quite some time.  As Deputies are aware voluntary work has to be recognised as such.  I have no difficulty in that regard but I am surprised that in some case locally it has not been recognised as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, in his review of the scheme, consider the definition of a voluntary organisation as there seem to be some inconsistent and arbitrary decisions in some parts of the country as to what is and is not a voluntary organisation?  For example, I am aware that a group of people who provide a creche for an association of the unemployed have been told that this does not amount to voluntary activity.  I ask the Minister to look at the variable definitions and, following his review, issue guidelines as to what is and is not a voluntary organisation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate how long the scheme has been in existence and the number of voluntary organisations and unemployed people who have availed of it?  In his review of the scheme, would the Minister recognise the fear which may exist among the unemployed that, notifying an exchange that they are engaged in this kind of activity, may affect their entitlement to benefit, however unreal that fear <Col N="2761" /> is?  Would the Minister make it specifically clear that entitlement to benefit or assistance, which, as the Minister is aware, depends on the availability for work, will not be affected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is where clarification is required.  If a person is available for work and is genuinely seeking full time work there will be no problem. One has to understand that the requirement that one should be available for work remains.  The only condition is that voluntary work cannot be considered as an alternative.  I agree with the Deputies that there is a need to clarify the position, to try to improve the scheme and, in particular, to publicise it.  We must try to improve the understanding of it at both public and official level.  If there are cases similar to the one the Deputy spoke about in regard to the group of people who wanted to provide a creche, I will deal with them.  It is a question of clarifying the guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 11, 12, 23, 62, 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The £10 and £20 alleviating payments were introduced by the previous Government in November 1986 to assist families who suffered reductions in income arising from the full implementation of equal treatment for men and women under the social welfare system.  The payments were to compensate claimants who lost the adult dependant increases in their payment either because their spouse was working or was in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The payments are to last for a maximum period of one year and were to cease entirely in the week commencing 17 November 1987.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the hardship which would be caused to families by the abrupt cessation of these payments, the present Government have decided that they are to be continued at their present rates until the end of March 1988, The question of phasing out the payments from April 1988 onwards will be considered by the Government in the context of the budget.</P>
      <P>The cost of continuing these payments at their present levels for a further year is estimated to be close to £20 million.  At present about 10,000 persons are receiving the £10 payment and about 11,000 persons are receiving the £20 payment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate how many dependants are involved in the figures of 11,008 and 12,000.  Will the Minister say why the <Col N="2764" /> scheme, which was to have been introduced with this cushion payment enabling people who were in difficulty and were not covered by this scheme to go to community welfare officers, was not introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 10,000 people in receipt of the £10 payment and half the child dependant allowances each week. There are 11,000 in receipt of the £20 payment.  Is the Deputy aware that there is a scheme for essential household goods, rental and mortgage?  I understand that 2,850 people received that additional benefit which amounts to an average weekly payment of £7.20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in assuming that about 3,000 people have been taken off that list since the beginning of the year?  I recall that on the last occasion I questioned the Minister about this scheme he informed me that 13,000 were in receipt of that benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>People are being taken off the list all the time.  People do a lot of things, some die, some get work and some get better.  The circumstances of people change and automatically the number on the list decreases.  We are talking about two categories, the elderly and the long term ill, and the long term unemployed.  If such people obtain employment or their circumstances change substantially they are removed from the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably about right because the numbers are declining all the time.  The number of people on that list at present is 21,000 and quite recently it stood at 21,500.  That factor is taken into consideration when calculating the cost of the scheme in the context of the budget.  More information will become available in the next few months on the real cost for next year.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that because of the implementation of equality legislation a wife is now no longer automatically regarded as a dependant of the husband.  At that time a husband could never be regarded as a dependant of his wife but now the husband can be regarded as a dependant and can be means tested out of receiving any unemployment assistance.  I have come across difficult cases where there is estrangement between husband and wife and where the husband is now totally dependent on the wife's income from her work.  Does the Minister intend to deal with such cases in his review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the implementation of the equal treatment measures caused a great deal of difficulty and it was because it caused hardship for certain people that alleviating measures were introduced for a period.  Wives got an increased payment, as the Deputy will be aware.  In the course of the preparation of any budget a Minister for Social Welfare must consider any hardship cases that have arisen.  The most obvious ones are those who are on the alleviating payments and they will be a priority from my point of view in the coming year.  The circumstances referred to by the Deputy, which are a direct result of equal treatment, can cause problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Invalidity pensions may be withdrawn from recipients for a variety of reasons most of which are voluntary on the claimants' part. 3,344 pensions were withdrawn in 1986 and 2,837 in the first ten months of this year.  The vast majority of these arose on transfer to old age pension where the rates are higher or on the death of the pensioner.  In 15 cases in 1986 and 38 this year entitlements were withdrawn because the claimant was <Col N="2766" /> found to be capable of work, to be working or to have ceased to claim pension.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this benefit is paid under the social insurance fund and, consequently, is covered under the contribution conditions relating to the fund.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures decided on by the Combat Poverty Agency in contracting out research are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioned research involving <Col N="2768" /> expenditure greater than £10,000 is publicly advertised.  Research projects which are longer than three months duration and involve expenditure of £10,000 or less are awarded to one of a panel of research assistants set up by the agency earlier this year.  These temporary posts had been circularised to the universities, the Institute of Public Administration, the National Institute for Higher Education, the Agricultural Institute and the Sociological Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Commissioned research of three months duration or less is awarded by the agency to researchers with relevant expertise.</P>
    <P>While I accept the desirability of research contracts being advertised as widely as possible, the extent to which this can be done is obviously limited by the size of the contract and the need to ensure that cost effective procedures are adopted.  I am satisfied that the procedures followed by the Combat Poverty Agency, as outlined in my reply, meet these criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the information.  There are, however, some complaints about this matter.  Would the Minister not see fit perhaps to review these procedures from time to time and encourage the Combat Poverty Agency at least to circulate information about their forthcoming research projects on a wider basis than they are doing at the moment and, therefore, avoid complaints among people involved in economic research as well as social research who feel they are being unfairly discriminated against by the agency?</P>

I ask the Minister to consider this matter to see if some person in an organisation such as the organisation for the physically handicapped and so on could be nominated to travel with such people. I know too well of a large number of people entitled to this service who cannot use it.  They never get outside their door. God knows, some arrangement should <Col N="2770" /> be made.

      <P>I do not have that information. The costs are done on the usage, the number of people who use the scheme.  Surveys are done on the usage, so we pay CIE on the basis of usage.  The estimated cost for 1987 is £25.96 million, just £26 million.  I am afraid the pressure at the moment would be to keep that cost from rising further particularly because, as the Deputy will be aware, it is very much availed of especially by elderly people.  The possibility of extending it further at this stage because of the cost is not great.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 44 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on Social Welfare contains a comprehensive analysis of the social welfare system and highlights many defects and deficiencies in the system.  It is a very important and useful document from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contains a wide variety of recommendations relating to all areas of the system and the commission themselves acknowledged that many of those recommendations could only be implemented over a period of time.  At the same time I feel that the commission <Col N="2773" /> did not give adequate attention to the financial implications of the recommendations which they made.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is to devote whatever resources can be made available to maintaining and improving the social welfare system.  The extent to which additional resources can be made available for this purpose will, to a large degree, be determined by the success of the Government's policies in achieving growth in the economy.  However, I am determined that whatever progress can be made in reforming and developing the social welfare system within the financial constraints which exist, will be made.  The Government are committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits, and within the resources available, will consider special provisions for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>I have announced a number of major policy developments in recent months which are in line with the recommendations made by the commission. These include the decision to extend compulsory social insurance cover for pensions to the self-employed and the transfer of responsibility for sick pay for an initial period of 13 weeks to employers.  I am also rationalising a number of my Department's schemes to ensure that they are directed principally to those in greatest need.  In addition, I am taking measures to streamline in a major way over the coming years the administration of the social welfare system to make it fairer, more efficient and more effective for users.  I will also be bringing my proposals for improvements in the social welfare appeals system to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The process of review of the social welfare system will be an ongoing one and in formulating further proposals for reform and development of the system, I will be taking fully into account the recommendations of the commission and the views that were expressed therein. My Department have also received the views of many interested organisations and individuals on the commission's <Col N="2774" /> report in general and on specific recommendations made in the report and these are also being fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Bell's question. I would like to state that the commission made no recommendation specifically in relation to the basic level of pensions for widows.  Their recommendations in this regard applied to social welfare payments generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may recall a discussion on social welfare in this House before the summer recess.  I asked if he would be prepared to set up an all-party committee to examine the recommendations of the commission's report. At that time, he promised he would discuss the matter with the Whips.  Has he had any discussion with the Whips with a view to setting up an all-party committee to explore the possibility of introducing some of the recommendations of this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter at that time but I have had no results from the Whips.  I will certainly raise this matter with them again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Any objective analysis would show that what the Minister is saying is to forget about the social welfare report because they will not implement it.  Would he tell the House any one step he has taken to improve the lot of the least well off categories in the social welfare system as highlighted in the social welfare report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity to do that comes at budget time.  The last Budget was formed following the collapse of the previous Government and there was not much time to do more than advance the <Col N="2775" /> payment for everybody from November to July at a cost of an additional £19 million.  I have said repeatedly that I recognise the need to look particularly at the position of people on the lowest income, a point made by the commission, and I will continue to do that.  The report of the commission is used by me and my Department as a general framework and we refer to it all the time.  I mentioned some major schemes that we are undertaking which are directly related to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there was ample opportunity during the year to do something for the least well off in the social welfare code?  He could have continued the decision of the preivious Government to pay a special increase of £3.50 to those living alone on unemployment assistance. He could have used the social welfare Bill enacted yesterday to make provision out of the £36 million savings from the Jobsearch scheme and other schemes in the hunt against fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of those savings were provided for in the budget initially.  They were part of the revised Estimates for the year.  Some of the savings were used to offset the costs in the system.  As regards the special living alone allowance, this was decided by the House earlier in the year and that arrangement did not receive the support of the House at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the fundamental arrangements of the report of the Social Welfare Commission was the provision of a basic income to people on social welfare.  They reckoned that in order to live a decent and dignified life, the basic income, could be anything between £50 and £60 per week.  Would the Minister indicate what steps he has taken to raise the social welfare payments to those levels, and if he intends to use the income from the extension of the PRSI system <Col N="2776" /> to do that, as was recommended in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had various suggestions calculated and updated.  It was suggested that the basic payment should be raised to £45.  The 1987 equivalent of that is £48.30 a week &mdash; without getting into the £50 to £60 a week level &mdash; and the cost of that for a year to the Department of Sociial Welfare would be £167 million. To raise the assistance level from £50 to £53.70 and benefit from £55 to £59 &mdash; to raise it to the 1987 level &mdash; would cost £443 million.  The Deputy will realise that the kind of adjustments and savings that would be required to meet that additional cost would be very substantial.</P>

The Government have already decided to do that but I am asking if the increased revenue from extending PRSI will be used to raise the levels of social welfare benefits and assistance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Title>Ceisteanna &mdash; Questions.   Oral Answers. - Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</Title>
    <P>47.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will reverse the recent change he has made in the eligibility conditions for entitlement to rent and mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, as these changes will leave people in receipt of such supplements with a disposable income of £3 below the subsistence level, and for single people on unemployment assistance will involve a reduction in disposable income of 4.6 per cent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a person can receive supplementary payments to assist with rent or mortgage commitments. Under these arrangements a payment towards rent or mortgage interest can be granted where the rent or the mortgage interest exceeds a certain amount.  This amount has been increased from £1.50 to £3 per week with effect from 2 November 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the figure of £1.50 was introduced in 1977 it was intended to represent the amount included in the basic supplementary welfare allowance payment in respect of rent.  The amount has remained unchanged since 1977 despite the substantial increases in social welfare <Col N="2778" /> payments in the meantime.  In this context. I regard the increase to £3 as reasonable in present circumstances. Furthermore, the increase only applies to new applicants for rent or mortgage supplements and there is no reduction in payments to existing recipients of rent supplements.  There are no proposals to amend the provision on the lines outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is incredibly unfair to reduce the disposable income of the very categories about whom we have just been talking &mdash; the unemployed living alone on £35 per week &mdash; by £1.50 per week in respect of the rent subsidy?  In the week before Christmas, will he accept a plea not to do this in relation to those on unemployment assistance, living alone, or to those receiving a single person's allowance and living alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1987 published estimate of expenditure under the scheme is £37.62 million.  Expenditure is running slightly above the published estimate and the total cost is likely to be about £38.5 million.  Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that there is considerable pressure in this area for funds overall which is being met, in so far as it can, in the present circumstances.  The change made is a review of the base which, if it were to have been increased along the lines of social welfare increases in the interim, would have been £5.20.  An increase from £1.50 to £3 is very reasonable in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister has not disputed the fact that we are talking about a 4.6 per cent reduction in disposable income of those already living on £35 to £37 per week who happen to be living in private rented accommodation and who, therefore, do not have the benefit of a differential rent.  Does the Minister realise that they are the poorest of the poor?  While he is giving Christmas bonuses across the board to those with two and three pensions he is taking from the very lowest category of social welfare <Col N="2779" /> beneficiaries.  Will he please reverse his decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest, under the rent allowance scheme in operation for decontrolled rent cases, clients are expected to bear £4.10 per week which is higher than the level proposed here.  I did not argue with the Deputy about his calculations but if he looks at them again he will find he is slightly out in his costs because he must take a percentage as a percentage of what it was and what it has been reduced to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk here about selecting the poorest categories of social welfare beneficiaries for special favourable attention.  Will the Minister not admit that the result of his first nine months in office is precisely the reverse?  Not only did he cancel the £3.50 special increase proposed by the previous Government, he is now taking a further £1.50 from the poorest of the poor.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  The Minister has done very well since the economists would tell him very clearly and quickly that he should be increasing the amount to £5.20.  The Minister has succeeded in keeping the amount down to £3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has any plans to eliminate the tax on employment effect of employers' pay related social insurance contribution; and, if so, if he will outline the details of his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>While employers' PRSI contributions are generally classed in economic terms as a disincentive affecting labour, there is in fact no agreement among economists as to how the direct effect of PRSI changes on employment <Col N="2780" /> should be measured.  Pay related social insurance contributions were introduced in this country in 1979.  This resulted in significant reductions in the level of contributions paid by employers in respect of workers in low paid employment as compared with the flat rate system before that in force.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare examined the effects of these reductions and stated in their report that there was no conclusive evidence that they led to an increase in employment.  The report further stated that the more limited argument in favour of a reduction in pay related social insurance in labour intensive industries is questionable in that there is little proof that this would actually have direct effects on employment.</P>
      <P>This specific issue was also examined by NESC in early 1986.  The council were particularly struck by the absence of conclusive evidence on the likely employment impact of reducing employers' PRSI contributions and this was an overriding factor in determining attitudes towards the proposal.  The general feeling was that if the proposal were to be justified on employment creation grounds, there would need to be a greater degree of certainty about its likely employment effects.</P>
      <P>An 1983 EC study entitled &ldquo;Social Security Financing and Effects on Employment&rdquo; concluded that the room for manoeuvre within which changes in the structure of social security finance might play a role, as far as employment is concerned, is very narrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was also discussed in an OECD report of December 1985 on labour market flexibility which concluded that cutting payroll contributions is unlikely to increase employment when other taxes have to be raised to offset the revenue loss but that changes in overall tax structures do, however, have a potential for shifting labour demands between different groups of workers in ways that might possibly add to employment and output.  Under our system eliminating pay related social insurance contributions would involve an estimated loss of £670 <Col N="2781" /> million in 1987 which would have to be made good otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As there are over 250,000 unemployed we need to look at everything that inhibits legitimate, legal employment &mdash; I use those words advisedly.  The Minister spoke about eliminating the cost of pay-related social insurance contributions for employers but that is not the subject of the question.</P>
      <P>I am asking whether the Minister has considered eliminating the effect of it as a tax on employment and if he would consider substituting for a payroll-based contribution a company turnover-based contribution with some sort of rebate per person employed so as to reverse the present fashion among management in private and public sector alike of disposing of manpower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  He asked whether I had any plans to eliminate the tax on employment effect and that is why I mentioned the cost of eliminating that as the estimated loss.  The question in relation to other forms of taxation or collection of PRSI is, of course, a matter for consideration in the budget context generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may agree with me that the unemployment crisis is equal in importance to the financial crisis facing us and that in view of that, all possible impediments to employment should be looked at urgently. Charging an employer 12.3 per cent tax for every person he employs seems crazy in our circumstances.  Would the Minister not impart some sense of urgency to this with a view to helping the unemployment situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very pleased to support any methods which would help the unemployment problem but evidence from studies carried out does not suggest <Col N="2782" /> that the approach suggested by the Deputy would lead to greater employment no matter how well intentioned it might be, and which I accept it is.  The other approaches are worthy of consideration and I will give any consideration I can early in the New Year to any other approach which might increase employment, in particular for those who are the long term unemployed on the live register.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the plans if any, he has to reduce the old age pension age from 66 to 65 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare retirement pension is payable at age 65 and old age pension, contributory and non-contributory is payable at age 66.  The reduction generally of pension age from 66 to 65 was one of the issues examined by the Commission on Social Welfare in their report.  The commission did not consider that the reduction in the qualifying age for old age pension was warranted at present in view of the associated cost.</P>
      <P>The net cost of a reduction in pension age to 65 is estimated to be of the order of £34 million in a full year at 1987 rates of payment.  This estimate takes account of additional expenditure on old age pensions and on fringe benefits-in-kind &mdash; free travel etc., loss of PRSI contribution revenue and consequential savings on short term social welfare payments.  The question of a general reduction in pension age to 65 years is being addressed by the National Pensions Board who will be reporting to me on the question of a national pension system in due course.</P>

      <P>The main areas in which fraud occurs relate to the schemes of unemployment benefit and assistance, <Col N="2783" /> disability benefit and the PRSI contribution system.  In the ten year period from 1977 to 1986 charges were brought against 1,360 persons.  Of these, 934 were fined, 16 were jailed and in 298 other cases lesser penalties were imposed, such as suspended sentences, performing community service and being bound over.</P>

In the light of experience during the past nine months where substantial savings have accrued because of a more robust effort to prevent fraud, and in the light of the legislation enacted yesterday, would the Minister assure the House that there will be a more determined effort to get more prosecutions for those who wilfully defraud the State through the social welfare system?</P>

    <Title>Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment for Question Time I had just begun my contribution.  I had pointed out that I regard the abolition of the Dublin Transport Authority as both a <Col N="2838" /> shortsighted and retrograde step which we will oppose at the end of the Second Stage and also again if it goes to Committee Stage.  We have already tabled a number of amendments.  The Bill makes no sense on either financial or traffic control grounds.  The only saving is likely to be a minor one, that with the exception of the chief executive, all other staff would be transferred back to the Government Department from which they were seconded originally.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Minister's speech today in which he sought to justify this on the basis that there will be a future cost of something like £500,000.  He backed that up by claiming that the expenditure for 1987 comprises of two State grants-in-aid &mdash; one for current expenditure and one for capital works. Regardless of whether the Dublin Transport Authority exist next year, that kind of expenditure would still be required. There is no clear indication from the Minister of precisely how much is going to be saved as a result of the abolition of this body.  The argument still stands that it has not been done on the basis of cost savings, that it has been done for some other reasons.  Deputy Quinn suggested that it has been done by way of a sacrificial lamb in the Minister's Department which was demanded by the Department of Finance, I do not know if that is true but I am sure Deputy Quinn has more insight and knowledge of how these things operate at that level.  It seems to me that unless it fits in with the overall thrust and policy of Government it would not be agreed to, even as a sacrificial lamb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to abolish the Authority cannot be understood adequately in isolation from other decisions made by the Government in the transport area in recent times.  There has been a decision to increase CIE bus and rail fares and the decision by Dublin Bus to shed 800 jobs. In addition there has been a decision not to extend the DART services in the Dublin area.  Of course, there are the ongoing pressures and demands to build massive roadways through Dublin city. <Col N="2839" /> The Fianna Fáil group on Dublin Corporation went to great lengths to try to force through the inner tangent route development in the Dublin area.  The Clanbrassil Street end of the route is the part that is most in the news these days. If the reconstruction of that roadway goes ahead, whether it be a 70 foot or a 78 foot roadway, there will be a continuation of that kind of development right through the centre of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The decisions that are being taken will mean that fewer people will be able to afford public transport, and the quality and level of public transport available will disimprove.  One of the objectives of the Dublin Transport Authority, which was included as a result of an amendment which I put down on behalf of The Workers' Party, was to promote the greater use of public transport within the Dublin area, and now there will be no body or organisation with this overall responsibility.  Dublin Bus will, of course, do their best to promote their services as will Iarnród Éireann, but there will be no overall development of transport, public and private, in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion that can be drawn from these decisions is that the Fianna Fáil Government have made a deliberate decision to run down public transport in the city.  This will have the effect of forcing more and more people to use cars or to take their places in longer queues at bus stops.  There will be a consequent worsening of the city's already drastic traffic problems.  The long term thinking may also be that if the level of public transport is allowed to deteriorate sufficiently it will result in a clamour for the introduction of privately run bus routes and thus open up the way for a greater privatisation of bus services in the area.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Dublin Transport Authority was to co-ordinate the input from various Departments, bodies and local authorities so that there would not be a fragmented approach to the development of a transport strategy for the capital city.  The traffic problems in Dublin are now so critical that the need for this transport authority is more <Col N="2840" /> important than ever.  The Minister, Deputy Wilson, criticised the Dublin Transport Authority Bill when it was going through the Dáil last year as being weak and wan.  In many respects the authority was inadequate but if it is abolished we will be back to the original situation with various Government Departments, Tourism and Transport and Environment, the corporation, the county council, the Garda, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, all involved in the traffic system without any real co-ordination of effort and with no overall responsibility in the area.</P>
    <P>The success of the DART shows just what can be acheived when imagination and money is spent on public transport. The experience with DART shows that people are prepared to use public transport if there is a decent system available. Recent statistics show that 64 per cent of commuters travel to work by car compared to 32 per cent by bus and 4 per cent by train.  If the quality of life in the city is not to deteriorate further the aim must be to shift the balance dramatically away from private cars and in favour of public transport.  We do not need the sort of senseless, community-destroying road plans that Fianna Fáil have been trying to foist on us through Dublin Corporation over many years.  What we do need is proper, co-ordinated traffic planning and the widest possible promotion of public transport.  The opening of the DART system in 1984 was one of the most significant traffic developments in the city for many years.  Unfortunately, the scope of the existing DART system is limited by its location along the coast, which was of course determined by the original coastal railway, as this means that it is serving only half of what would be its normal catchment area if it ran inland.</P>
    <P>Communities in areas like Bally-fermot, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Finglas and Ballymun should not be denied the benefits of a DART system which are now available only to the generally more prosperous coastal areas.  The decision of the Government not to go ahead with the proposals from CIE to extend the DART <Col N="2841" /> system to Tallaght and other areas on the grounds of cost is a short-sighted one.  It ignores the fact that much of the land needed for the project has already been purchased by CIE; it ignores the general stimulating effect that the project would have on the areas through jobs created, and it ignores the money that could be saved in road construction and in generally speeding up traffic in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority, in their short life, did not have much of a chance to prove themselves but there were indications that the small and dedicated staff were beginning to come to terms with the traffic problems of the city.  They worked quietly and without fuss or self-promotion, and perhaps this was one of their mistakes.  If they had gone for a high profile and publicity stunts the Minister might have found it more difficult to get away with this Bill in the Dáil.  Since it was set up the Authority has taken a number of initiatives including the provision of new bus lanes, the introduction of selective bus detection systems to give buses priority at key junctions, the adoption of by-laws to control roadworks and so on.  It was, I understand, preparing to introduce regulations for the wheel clamping of illegally parked vehicles and it was estimated that the revenue from this alone would have more than met the annual budget requirement of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have done a U-turn on this issue and we are more and more beginning to expect that approach from the Fianna Fáil Government.  What is surprising is the position of the Fine Gael Party.  Despite a strong speech from their spokesman this morning there is still no clear indication from that party whether they are going to vote for this Bill, abstain on it or vote against it.  I understand the Progressive Democrats intend to abstain on it and that is unfortunate because this House has the power to stop the Bill. Those of us who have already said we regard it as important to maintain this Authority and that we do not accept the Minister's argument in relation to costs will have the power to stop this Bill from <Col N="2842" /> being passed if an honourable and principled position is taken on it at the end of Second Stage today.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a point which relates to the position of the chief executive of the Dublin Transport Authority, Mr. Phil Murray.  A number of other Deputies have already referred to the position he will find himself in as a result of the proposed passing of this Bill.  I understand that all other staff of the Authority were on secondment from various Government Departments and will be able to transfer back to their original positions.  However, Mr. Murray, who had worked for 19 years in Dublin County Council, had to give up his position in the county council to take on the Dublin Transport Authority job.  What is to become of Mr. Murray now?  Section 4 of the Bill compels the Minister to honour any contract entered into by the Authority with any person, other than a member of the staff of the Authority.  That is an extraordinary situation and I have not seen it apply in any other Bill in this House.  Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;Every bond, guarantee or other security of a continuing nature made or given by or on behalf of the Authority to any person or given by any person to and accepted by or on behalf of the Authority and every contract or agreement in writing made between the Authority and any other person (other than a member of the staff of the Authority) and in force but not fully executed and completed immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force on and after such commencement and shall be construed and have effect as if the name of the Minister were substituted therein for that of the Authority and shall be enforceable by or against the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is a guarantee for all agreements entered into by the Authority except the agreement and the arrangement made with the chief executive of the company who effectively is the only person employed by the Authority because, as I have said, all the other people have the right to return to their original jobs in the <Col N="2843" /> public service.  Why is there this exclusion?  There is, at the very least, a moral obligation on the Minister to honour commitments given to Mr. Murray.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point. In that regard there is a particular problem about the superannuation scheme and the superannuation entitlements of the chief executive.  He worked for 19 years on Dublin County Council and understood that in the normal way he could transfer his pension entitlements for his later years to the DTA.  I understand there was a considerable delay in agreeing on the superannuation scheme because of differences of opinion between the Minister and the board of the DTA.  A scheme was eventually agreed and in accordance with the provisions of the 1986 Act was laid before the House.  However, under the 1986 Act the scheme will not come into operation because the Act provides that a motion can be passed annulling it within 21 sitting days, and those 21 sitting days have not yet passed.  This will mean that there will not be a superannuation scheme in operation when the Authority is abolished assuming that this Bill will pass today.  Legal opinion suggests that once the Authority is abolished a superannuation scheme for employees cannot be implemented because they are no longer employed by the Authority because the Authority no longer exists. This is despicable treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  The Minister and the Government have acted sensibly in the severe financial constraints of today.  It is important to have the cutbacks in that area now before the Authority had time to grow into a large bureaucratic body that eventually would have employed about 20 people as suggested by the Minister and would have duplicated the work that can be done by the Dublin transport task force.</P>
      <P>It is clear that in Dublin city and county there is utter traffic chaos.  The Garda Síochána should have the statutory right to make decisions in relation to traffic. I am glad that these powers are being returned to the Garda Síochána and to local authorities.  It is appropriate that additional functions such as the regulations of access and egress from construction sites be left with the local authorities.  I hope the Dublin transport task force will set to work immediately to alleviate the traffic chaos in County Dublin and will do something about traffic signals which are not linked, especially on major roadways such as the Stillorgan Road and the Lucan Road where there is absolute chaos.  I am glad that the Garda authorities will have a bigger say as they were not happy with the way things were going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago a refuge was put at Cromwellsfort Road.  Following numerous representations to the county council by public representatives and the Garda authorities, it was only after a Garda inspector piled his car up on it that it was removed.  This refuge was used to stop <Col N="2845" /> the traffic coming out of a side road. This sort of thing was being done and representatives were being ignored.  In traffic management there should be a facility to allow an input from elected representatives.  On some bodies there are persons who have nothing but contempt for representations made by public representatives and they ignore them but traffic management must always allow for representations by public representatives as they do a huge amount of mileage around the city and are well aware of all the hazards and possible improvements. On Dublin Corporation I worked with a traffic study group as well as a subcommittee on traffic and from that work I know that there is a great coming together of public representatives from all parties in solving traffic problems.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are sometimes frustrated in trying to build roads.  As in the saga of Clanbrassil Street an exaggerated local interest can deter a local authority from taking the appropriate decision so it is important that central Government have an input having examined all the arguments.  Sometimes the pressure on local representatives is such that they cannot see the city as an overall picture.  As far as the inner tangent and getting Dublin out of chaos are concerned, I hope that transferring authority back to the Dublin transport task force will mean something will be done about the state of our roads.  A member of The Workers' Party could not be expected to support anything Fianna Fáil would do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than voting with us, it was against somebody else.  It is important that decisions are made in the interests of all of Dublin.  At the moment there are insufficient penalties for people who park their cars regardless of other people's needs.  They make roads almost inaccessible to other traffic.  Suffolk Street is an example.  I notice that coming up to Christmas, parking times have been changed by the Dublin Transport Authority. My philosophy has always been that if we had larger parking fines in the five-week period leading up to Christmas it might prevent the enormous problems caused by people coming into the city and parking illegally.  We have not enough tow-away vehicles &mdash; only one or two for the whole city.  These are needed to deal with problems such as double parking at traffic lights, forcing the traffic to use one lane and congestion caused by a driver attempting to turn right.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any Member of this House who is not an authority on traffic because of his experience.  We have all suffered as a result of inadequate laws and deterrents.  Everyone will take the risk of incurring a fine of £10 or so. Many companies are prepared to pay these fines on behalf of their executives. People would think twice if we had penalties of £25 or £40 for certain types of very selfish parking.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that it is correct to give many of the powers back to the Garda as the statutory authority.  It is also important that local authorities should have an input into traffic management.  However, there are other areas where certain functions need to be taken over at central Government level because of the lack of will, sometimes, at local level to implement important decisions on traffic flows.</P>
      <P>There is need to encourage people to use more buses at peak times.  My answer is that people would use buses more frequently if the fare structures were lower. I think Deputy De Rossa said that 62 per cent of people use private cars.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are as follows: 4 per cent use trains, 32 per cent use buses and 64 per cent travel by car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that if the incentive could be given to people to travel by bus by lowering fares more people would leave their cars at home. At present there is no incentive due to the high cost of fares.  People can save by driving their own cars.  I have long argued for a pilot scheme in an area such as Tallaght or Darndale where people could be encouraged to use buses by the offer of a 25p fare.  People will leave their cars at home if there is an economic bus service.  We must have the dearest bus service in the world when it is related to the average income of our people.  One of the reasons fare structures are so high is our small population.  A bus will make the same journey and use the same amount of fuel when it carries very few passengers.  It makes economic sense to reduce the fares and fill the seats.  It is somewhat like filling the seats on the flights to London.  I know instinctively that the same thing will work if we can bring our bus service down to an economic level.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the opportunity has been taken to revise the provisions so as to make the arrangements more effective in the implementation of road works of an emergency nature.  The task force will have extra powers and the local authorities will be able to issue directions in the case of such works in the interest of their speedy completion.  I understand that the work undertaken by the DTA over the past year will be a valuable input to the activities of the task force.  I give credit to them for the work they have done on the plus side.  However, I should like to see some sort of public representation on the task force.</P>

      <P>It depends who is choosing. If Fine Gael want to propose her from their group in the corporation we will not refuse her nomination.  It is <Col N="2848" /> important to have one or two people to represent those who are elected by the public.  Public representatives very often know as much about traffic problems as any engineer sitting in his office designing schemes to improve traffic flows. Recently I have undertaken to write a letter to Dublin County Council in relation to Rathcoole where there have been a number of accidents.  The scheme they have devised has actually added fuel to that fire and the situation there will be much more dangerous.  Very often there is not enough consultation with people who use the roads frequently.  The input public representatives can make should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have had an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Nobody likes to see any authority being dissolved and people discommoded but unfortunately this will have to happen for a while until we get our finances straightened out.  I hope the year ahead will see an improvement in traffic flows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the introduction of this Bill.  It is not of course a transport decision but a financial decision and, as I hope to demonstrate, a very poor financial decision indeed.  I know after five years experience in Government how these things happen. Lists of all sorts of outrageous cuts are put up to Cabinet at each reading of the Estimates until the ultimate figure is reached.  There is an item called &ldquo;Save the <i>Asgard</i>&rdquo; and this is included on the list this year.  The Minister has allowed this awful decision to be taken.  The total saving in a year on the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority will be £600,000 but much of that money will be included in the Estimate for the Department for traffic management schemes and so on.  Therefore, we will be saving less than half that amount.  Of course it should be remembered we are not really saving because the absence of the Dublin Transport Authority will cost us a great deal and lead to extreme difficulties as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the provisions of this Bill included <Col N="2849" /> some stipulation that the roads and ancillary functions of the Department of the Environment were to be transfered to the Department of Tourism and Transport they might be tolerable and make some sense.  We should remember that ours is the only country in the EC without a co-ordinated transport policy.  Every other European Minister for Transport is responsible for all transport in his country. Here there is the extraordinary position in which the roads and ancillary functions &mdash; including DOE testing of vehicles, the equivalent of the MOT test in England &mdash; anything to do with taxis and so on are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  It is he who takes decisions in relation to priorities on roads expenditure, who takes decisions about the licensing and the regime under which taxis operate and so on.  Yet, completely divorced from that, we have the Minister for Tourism and Transport deciding on investment in railroads, rolling stock, buses, bus routes, bus fares but who has no responsibility in the matter of roads.  Because of the total lack of traffic co-ordination in the city of Dublin there are all sorts of decisions being taken with no due weight or consideration being given to their transport implications.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa expressed his regret at the Government decision not to proceed with the extension of the DART to the western parts of this city.  In so saying he was echoing the views of a great number of people, not just in that part of the city, but throughout the city.  Planning policy in this city has evolved over the years without any regard to or consideration of transport objectives.  For instance, in the city of Dublin there is a housing policy of a maximum of 30 houses to the acre and in the county &mdash; what was considered to be a very liberal policy &mdash; of ten houses to the acre which may have sounded all right at the time but which carries enormous transport implications. It means we have a very low-rise, low density, spread-out city which is very fine in theory; lots of open spaces for people to dump their rubbish on; large gardens people are not used to dealing with; <Col N="2850" /> people living long distances from the city centre, frequently isolated in outposts in the far reaches of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>For a long time there has been an urgent need for overall co-ordination of all elements of transport in the city and county of Dublin.  There has been an urgent need for one body to examine all plans and decisions &mdash; whether they be simple planning permissions, road plans, major housing programmes, or plans for large industrial estates &mdash; so that transport objectives would be borne reasonably in mind.  That was thought to be one of the principal objectives of the Dublin Transport Authority on their establishment. All of that is now lost even though in his introductory remarks the Minister made much of the fact that he has retained much of the powers and roles of the DTA by giving them to one body or another.  The fact of the matter is that the Minister cannot delegate to anybody the central statutory role of the DTA, that of being the statutory authority who would have a legal right to consultation on development plans, planning permissions and so on.  The Dublin Transport Authority had a legal right to advise local authorities and, if necessary, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Tourism and Transport on these matters.  We are back to the old higgledy-piggledy, unco-ordinated position.</P>
    <P>Some of the greatest vandals in this city and county are the local authorities themselves.  Much of the blight in this city, especially around the city centre, is a direct result of the actions and inaction of our local authorities.  Most of our derelict sites are in the ownership of local authorities.  Our car parks, surrounded by broken railings, overgrown with weeds and old fences which are extremely ugly are mainly in the ownership of local authorities. Yet, the Minister is giving back to those same local authorities so many of the powers and functions of the Dublin Transport Authority which was set up in an effort to overcome all of those problems. They would have been a powerful lever on local authorities to properly regulate city car parks, to get rid of the <Col N="2851" /> urban blight caused as a result of protracted decisions on roads and so on.</P>
    <P>What is more, what goes out with the enactment of this Bill is the possibility of an independent licenser of bus routes and services whether those services are provided by Dublin Bus or others.  There is no power that I can see transferred to anybody in relation to the provision of services on routes, the line of those routes or who should serve them.  That constitutes another retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The effect of the dissolution of the Dublin Transport Authority and of the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission &mdash; both of which were established by the previous Government &mdash; is to stop the clock, if not to turn it back, on all hope of action to visually improve the core of this city.  There will still be the broken down old quays, the ugly Clanbrassil Street, King Street, Queen Street and Benburb Street.  There will be nobody with any authority, with a specific mandate in relation to Dublin, to pressurise local authorities or shake them out of their state of apathy and indifference to tackle these problems.  As a Dubliner I know how deeply irritated are the people of Dublin at the appearance of so many areas of their city.  Indeed there is an acknowledgement that most of this ugliness emanates from lack of care, of thought, lack of advanced planning in relation to transport plans and so on.</P>
    <P>I said that frequently the local authorities themselves were the greatest vandals. That is not confined to car parks or to the urban blight occasioned by protracted decisions on roads and so on.  I will give an example of that.  I was in Cork Street recently to meet a group of nuns working with the poor of the city. The gate of the convent was right beside a public house over which my own grandfather was born.  The public house protrudes on to the street.  As I was going in the gate I said to an 86 year old nun that I met that the public house was to be knocked down.  She said &ldquo;God love you, Mr. Mitchell, I was told that when I came here in 1927&rdquo;.  The buses have stopped travelling in Cork Street because it is so <Col N="2852" /> awful.  One side of Cork Street is almost totally reserved for widening.  It is as well that the buses have stopped travelling along Cork Street because it is a depressing sight for anybody who has to travel on that route every day by bus or by car. It is not the only depressing street.</P>
    <P>These are the problems that the Dublin Transport Authority was set up to deal with.  But local authorities like the Gas Company, Telecom Éireann and so on have dug up trenches any old way across roads and footpaths.  They then do what are called temporary repairs which are usually there for years.  We have a &ldquo;bockety&rdquo; surface which has such an adverse visual impact on the city, inviting litter and encouraging filth and dirt.  They do not seem to have any regard for straight lines.  Even kerbs are broken by some of these road works.  Then these hideous &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; repairs are left for months if not years.  The same road may have only been resurfaced in the previous few months.  The great bulk of the vandalism is done amost exclusively by the public authorities or companies owned by the public.  Cablelink is 80 per cent owned by RTE: Telecom Éireann is 100 per cent State-owned; Dublin Gas is 100 per cent State-owned and there is Dublin Corporation itself.  They are the people who are doing this vandalism and it is to Dublin Corporation that we are handing back the responsibility now for solving the problem.  They are not going to solve the problem; they are creating it.</P>
    <P>I am deeply ashamed of the appearance of this city, whether it is from awful, ugly &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; repairs which are left for months and months and sometimes years, or from the urban blight.  Any one who has been Lord Mayor of this city or has the honour to serve on Dublin City Council must be deeply ashamed of the way the city looks and must accept that Dublin Corporation itself, together with certain other State agencies, are wholly responsible for the awful appearance of the city.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one other aspect, the transfer back to the Garda Commissioner of powers which had been previously transferred from him, together with some <Col N="2853" /> other powers.  I do not believe the Garda Commissioner should be the traffic authority for Dublin city and county.  The Garda Commissioner has too many other responsibilities.  Nobody should be surprised to learn that in the pantheon of things up in the Garda Depot in the Phoenix Park for which he is responsible, traffic matters rate a very low priority. This is understandable when the commissioner is engaged in the fight against crime and subversion on a grand scale. Does anyone realistically think that he will have the time to give the sort of attention needed to traffic matters.  It is a backward step indeed to expect the Garda Síochana to be responsible for the traffic in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the Act that was passed by this House, the original Act sought to be repealed here today, we gave the Dublin Transport Authority the role of the traffic authority.  We have massive unemployment, but we could do with many more traffic wardens.  We could easily use 100 or 200 more traffic wardens, and they would pay for themselves.  It is one of the absurdities of the way we do things that for &ldquo;financial&rdquo; reasons we do not employ them; the policy is to get numbers down. It is that sort of absurd decision in relation to traffic wardens that has prevented them being employed; it is the same sort of rationale of the Department of Finance that disposes today of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I resent the fact that this Bill is going through this House in a few hours.  I know it has been agreed between the Whips, but I condemn the fact that such an important Bill is being rushed through the House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2854" /> We have already heard much about the position of the chief executive.  I would like to echo what has been said by the other speakers and say that for the Minister to insert the phrase &ldquo;other than a member of the staff of the authority&rdquo; on page 4 lines 30 and 31 is really mean, because there is only one member of staff of the authority.  I would hope that the amendment put down will be accepted and that the amendments put down by Deputy Deasy will also be accepted.  I know that Deputy Deasy has been more active on this issue in the past fortnight, and I hope the Minister can assure the House about the position of the chief executive who took on this job in good faith in the last year.</P>
    <P>I would like to have spoken for longer, but I am conscious that there are others who want to speak before 5 p.m.  I feel that this is a very sad day's work by this Dáil.  It is a major step in the wrong direction.  It is a financial decision, a decision which will not save the £400,000 or so it purports to save.  It will cost us dearly, and it is this sort of decision that has the country in the financial mess in which it is.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan, will you resume your seat and I will say something to the House.  When Deputy McCartan is here as long as his colleague, Deputy De Rossa, he will have learned that there is a strict sequence here in which speakers are called, that after a debate that moves from the initial <Col N="2855" /> position of spokespersons, it then moves from one side of the House to the other. That is the fact as it is and we cannot change that here and now.  There is a procedure by which it might be changed. I was going to indicate to Deputy Flood who has offered that there are 20 minutes remaining.  His colleague, Deputy Taylor, who has priority to be called from the Opposition benches will have heard Deputy McCartan indicating that he wishes to speak and having reminded Deputy Flood of that position, the Chair now calls on Deputy Flood to make his contribution.</P>

I greatly regret that so little time has been provided to the Deputies of this House, particularly those from the Dublin area, who are concerned about the future of transport in the city.  This Bill is being presented to us in a way which gives a shortened opportunity for discussion on the merits and demerits of a proposal which will have a profound effect on the future of transportation in this city.</P>

All these things took up much time on the part of the Authority.  Unfortunately, I was not able to participate for very long as a member of that body.

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the role of the Authority. To put it very simply, as a member of Dublin County Council, if on behalf of constituents we decided that the local authority should consider putting down double yellow lines in some area, we found that the management of the council began to say, once the Authority had been set up, that they could not do that themselves but would have to refer it to the Authority.  Many members of the council at the time rightly queried whether this was not some element of new bureaucracy entering into the role and functions of the local authority. There was a great deal of confusion in the minds of public representatives on the matter.  The residents of various areas who would be affected by such decisions or who received notification of decisions from the council in such matters could not understand why such requests would have to be forwarded to the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, as I understand it, one staff member at the moment, the chief executive officer.  He is a person in whom I would have a great deal of interest and it is right that the Minister should examine his position very clearly and rationally. As the Authority has been established for only such a short time, it should be seen to that no injustice be done to that <Col N="2859" /> officer, who has given great service to Dublin County Council in the role of principal officer in the engineering department.  I am satisfied from what the Minister has said to me that no injustice will be done to this individual and I welcome that assurance.  The chief executive officer has contributed a great deal to the organisation.  I do not think that any of us who is familiar with its operation would deny that.  He has been able to draw largely from his own experience of his work with Dublin County Council in the roads section.  That was one of the main reasons for his being employed.</P>
    <P>I understand that the pension schemes embrace not only his chief executive service with the Dublin Transport Authority but also all his previous local authority service, which in the main was with Dublin County Council.  The Minister will confirm that arrangements have also been finalised this week to allow all his previous service to be transferred into other areas of the public service and to be reckoned along with such further pensionable service as may accrue to the chief executive officer if he accepts redeployment into another area of the public service.  The Minister is to be complimented for taking a personal interest in this individual who has given sterling service to Dublin county through his work with the county council.</P>
    <P>There are great problems with regard to traffic management in the city and county of Dublin.  These must be addressed, but I question whether an authority such as the Dublin Transport Authority are in a position to deal globally with the situation.  I am old-fashioned enough in my views to consider that communities are best placed to advise local authorities, or councillors such as myself, in relation to difficulties in terms of traffic and traffic management which arise from time to time.  We have had, on many occasions, to bring before the local authority, as the main authority responsible for traffic management over the years, relevant issues regarding improvements in an effort to ensure that, for example, proper safety measures were brought into force. <Col N="2860" /> This has been of tremendous benefit to local authorities.  The easiest way in which we can accommodate the needs of residents, their associations, local councils and so on must surely be by operating through the local authorities rather than having to bring the matter to another level in an effort to deal with some of the very simple matters to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In terms of road safety there were some crucial decisions to be taken dealing with traffic management, the removal of traffic hazards and so on.  This topic has been touched on by other Deputies this evening.  It seems to be a case of going back to the local authority to a substantial extent and giving back to them some of their powers which were taken away and given to the Dublin Transport Authority. These powers are being given back to the elected representatives on the local authority and to the community.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the Tallaght Community Council became very concerned when they discovered that many of the powers which are normally vested in the local authority were being whittled away following the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority.  On several occasions they complained about the inaccessibility of the Dublin Transport Authority when organisations such as theirs wished to make representations regarding transport, transport management and road safety.  I have to admit that it was for this reason that I became increasingly disillusioned with the Dublin Transport Authority.  It was proving increasingly difficult to get a response from them in regard to the complaints and queries which had been raised by the community associations and community councils I represent.  It became increasingly obvious that it was a mistake to take powers away from the local authority and vest them in the Dublin Transport Authority. To create additional layers of bureaucracy is not the way in which to proceed.  It was for that reason that many of the individuals and associations I represent had cause for complaint.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few other points that I wish to raise.  It was a retrograde step to take away some of the major powers of the local authority in regard to traffic management.  That is a point which has been repeated on several occasions.  The staff of the local authority are quite capable of making the necessary decisions, in consultation with the elected members, on matters pertaining to road safety and transport management. Because of their experience, local knowledge and technical know-how they know how best to plan traffic management and road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tied into this question is the question of funding.  There is no point in having grandiose plans put forward by an authority which is once removed from the local authority if no account is going to be taken of the availability of funds from one year to the next.  At least the local authorities knew what was happening. The planners, engineers and road safety officers knew what was happening in their areas and knew in respect of the development plan what was likely to happen in the years ahead.  An authority such as the Dublin Transport Authority may not fully appreciate or understand issues such as these.  It is for that reason that those of us who have studied very carefully the role and operation of the Dublin Transport Authority began to have serious doubts about their effectiveness.  We felt that the good management we have become used to, at local authority level, particularly in Dublin, was slipping away. As I have said, instead of decisions for <Col N="2862" /> instance in regard to road safety being taken at county council level the matter had to be referred to the Dublin Transport Authority.  That was a retrograde step and it led to many complaints.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I have seen the chief executive officer at work in both Dublin County Council and in the Dublin Transport Authority.  The Minister is of the opinion that there seems to be some confusion in this House about what has been offered to the chief executive officer.  I have a personal interest in this matter because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret I have not more time at my disposal as I have plenty of material in front of me.  In regard to the offer of employment, I will read quickly into the record of the House part of a letter which I sent to the chief executive officer.  It said:</P>
      <P>...the proposal offers you the prospect of immediate employment, coupled with written assurances that:</P>
      <P>(a)  acceptance of the assignment in question would not prejudice your redeployment at the end of the assignment to an appropriate permanent post in the public sector;</P>
      <P>(b)  it would be open to you at the end of the assignment to avail of the early retirement terms should you so wish; and</P>
      <P>(c)  you would suffer no loss of pensionable service in respect of the period of the assignment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other major point made was about the pension.  It was argued that the pension schemes could not have full efficacy until there was ministerial approval and until 21 full sitting days had elapsed from <Col N="2864" /> their being brought into effect.  The schemes for the chief executive of the DTA had been approved by both the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister for Finance and were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on Wednesday, 16 December 1987.  The Attorney General's office has advised&mdash; I am anxious to emphasise this &mdash; that the pension schemes are in force immediately from the date of ministerial approval. The question in relation to the 21 sitting days is irrevelant.  It is only relevant if a motion is brought before the House to annul the schemes and it is important that the House should know that.</P>
    <P>The pension rights of the chief executive are, therefore, already fully protected and will be further protected by section 4 (3) of the Bill which provides specifically for the continuance in force of the pension arrangements following repeal of the 1986 Act and for the substitution of the Minister in place of the Authority in relation to the administration of the schemes after the Authority is dissolved.  All the chief executive's service with Dublin County Council is also reckoned in terms of the pension scheme.</P>

      <P>The question of rationalisation of the fuel schemes has been mooted for a number of years past and this year I decided to proceed with rationalisation on a phased basis.  For the first time also 30,000 persons on long-term unemployment assistance living alone or with dependants are being included.  As a result the number benefiting is increasing from some 188,000 to 218,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funds were not available to finance this change so the increased number of beneficiaries have been accommodated by reducing the period for which fuel allowances will be granted in 1987-88 from 30 weeks to 26 weeks.  In adopting this approach I was conscious of the need to provide this form of additional assistance to the long term <Col N="2785" /> unemployed.  I also had regard to the fact that between 1942 and 1968 the fuel schemes then applying operated for a much shorter period, namely, from November to March each year.  The present arrangements operate from 19 October 1987 to 15 April 1988 and data supplied by the Meteorological Office indicates that over a period average mean temperatures outside that period are significantly higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Special arrangements were made by the Minister for Labour whereby AnCO pay a compensatory sum to certain people on mainline AnCO courses to offset the loss to them of the Christmas bonus and fuel allowance.  This arrangement applied to persons who started their course on or after 17 August 1987 and who were on long-term unemployment assistance the day before they started.  It was considered appropriate to make a concession to this group because the AnCO training allowance was linked to the unemployment assistance rate with effect from that date.  Persons who started on an AnCO course before 17 August 1987 had a training allowance <Col N="2786" /> calculated by reference to the unemployment benefit rate which is considerably higher.</P>
      <P>It is not feasible to estimate how many people might have progressed to the long term unemployment assistance rate but for the fact that they transferred on to a mainline AnCO course.</P>
      <P>Persons on the Jobsearch course itself are not affected as they remain in receipt of social welfare and, therefore, preserve whatever other welfare entitlements they might have.</P>
      <P>Persons going on various Manpower schemes forego the Christmas bonus because they cease to be in receipt of social welfare payments.  This has always been the position and there is nothing new about it happening this year.  Persons on Manpower schemes are in an employment situation and the schemes allow participants to augment their income by part time work etc.</P>
      <P>The group most likely to be affected in the manner envisaged in the question are long term unemployment assistance people who take up places on social employment schemes.  So far 8,770 have been placed on social employment schemes under the programme.  The Department of Labour estimate that generally speaking 70 per cent of participants on SES are single.  Accordingly, this group would not be affected as they receive £65 a week as against £34 unemployment assistance or £42.30 unemployment benefit.  Of the 30 per cent of married participants only those with an adult dependant and three dependent children could show a loss by reference to their position if they had remained on welfare.  It is thought that there is about 6 per cent of these in the group of 8,700 as a whole, that is approximately 500600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there is one other group who could show a notional entitlement to the Christmas bonus.  These are people who, because of a period on a course or scheme, interrupt their progress towards becoming entitled to the long term unemployment assistance rate.  During the period a person is on a scheme or course their progress towards completing the 15 <Col N="2787" /> months required for long term unemployment assistance is suspended for the duration of the course or scheme. However, that has been a feature of the social welfare code since 1985-86 when changes were introduced to eliminate other difficulties that had existed up to then.</P>
    <P>These changes provided that a social welfare recipient could spend up to 12 months on an AnCO course or Manpower scheme without forfeiting the progress he had made towards qualifying for the long term unemployment assistance rate.  That had not been the case up to then.  Accordingly, the fact that time spent on an AnCO course or Manpower scheme is not reckoned for the 15 months required for payment of long term unemployment assistance predates Jobsearch and has not been affected by it.  This consideration meant that persons on unemployment benefit and short term unemployment assistance could not be included in the arrangements decided on for those who were actually on long term unemployment assistance when they started on their mainline AnCO course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is payable with unemployment benefit, disability benefit, the maternity allowance scheme and injury benefit.  The rate of pay-related benefit is 12 per cent of reckonable <Col N="2788" /> weekly earnings between a weekly earnings floor of £62 and a ceiling of £220. Pay-related benefit is payable for a maximum of 375 days after a three week waiting period.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Estimate for my Department provides £37.86 million for pay-related benefit payments in respect of the three schemes mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No.2) Bill, 1987, which was passed by the Dáil yesterday, provides for the abolition from 4 April 1988 of entitlement to pay-related benefit in the case of all new claims for the original (old) general maternity allowance scheme.  This will not affect the level of benefit payable under the new maternity allowance scheme which will continue to be related to earnings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 20 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>There are two schemes of maternity allowance.  The old maternity allowance scheme which was introduced under the National Insurance Act, 1911 provided for a payment to insured women for a period of 12 weeks subject to certain contribution conditions being met.  The second scheme, the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment, was introduced by me as Minister for Social Welfare in April 1981.  This scheme which provides for a period of 14 weeks payment is available to women who are on maternity leave from work under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, and who are entitled to resume work with the same employer at the end of the period of maternity leave.</P>
      <P>The improved scheme for women in employment will continue and women will continue to get 14 weeks payment at 70 per cent of weekly earnings up to the earnings limit prescribed for pay-related benefit purposes, currently £11,000 per annum.  The number of women in this scheme is about 11,500 each year.</P>
      <P>The changed conditions affect only the old maternity scheme which existed prior to the new one being introduced.  The need for the old scheme has to a large extent been superseded by the introduction of the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment.</P>
      <P>The changes apply to new claimants only after 4 January.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the requirement under the old general maternity scheme that 13 of the 39 contributions in the governing contribution year must be paid contributions will affect some 3,300 claims and result in savings in 1988 of £2.5 million.  The abolition of the payment of pay related benefit under the old maternity scheme with this allowance from April 1988 will affect 3,600 claimants and give rise to savings of £0.3 million in 1988 and £0.4 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of claimants under the old maternity allowance scheme have been signing the live register for credits <Col N="2790" /> only and claim on the basis of these credits and they have no real attachment to the workforce.  The new requirement of 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution year is considered to be a reasonable condition for obtaining this benefit from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>The introduction of three waiting days before payment of disability benefit for women who have been receiving a maternity allowance will affect approximately 8,300 women and realise savings of up to £0.5 million in 1988.  These waiting days already apply to claimants for disability benefit and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>These changes are designed to ensure a better targeting of resources and, in particular, to ensure that only women with a recent attachment to the labour force will qualify for a maternity allowance.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefits scheme was extended to the dependent spouses of qualified insured persons from 19 October 1987.  Those newly qualified under the extension include dependent spouses of PAYE workers and dependent spouses of insured unemployed, of disability benefit recipients and invalidity, retirement and old age contributory pensioners. The extension is targeted at providing the benefits of the scheme to some 330,000 dependent spouses, primarily wives working in the home.</P>
      <P>The extension of optical benefit has been very successful, with all opticians on the panel participating.</P>
      <P>Seven thousand dependent spouses have already benefited under the extension of optical benefit and I am very satisfied with its operation and the cooperation which I received from the opticians and their professional association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the Government's overall review of public expenditure certain adjustments were made to the optical benefit scheme with effect from 1 October 1987.  The fees paid to opticians were increased by approximately 3 per cent from that date.  In addition, the qualifying contribution conditions for eligibility were brought into line with changes made earlier this year in the disability and <Col N="2792" /> unemployment benefit schemes.  The contribution conditions, which vary according to age, require applicants to have a minimum number of contributions paid since entering insurable employment.</P>
    <P>From 1 October 1987 the minimum number of contributions paid changed from 26 to 39 for persons under 23 years of age and from 156 to 208 for persons aged over 23 years.  Claimants aged over 21 years are also required to have a minimum number of contributions paid and credited in the contribution year which governs the claim.  This was changed from 26 to 39 paid or credited contributions.</P>
    <P>The revised contribution conditions do not apply to insured persons who had reached pension age (66 years) before 1 October 1987 or to their dependent spouses.</P>
    <P>There was also a change in the level of subvention payable by the Department for optical items in certain circumstances. The modifications affect only claimants who opt for the non-scheduled more expensive type of glasses.  Eye examinations and glasses with frames of a prescribed type continue to be provided free to the claimant.  However, in relation to glasses of the more expensive type in respect of which the Department pay a fixed amount and the claimant pays the balance, the amounts payable by the Department in the case of the main items involved have been reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The following are the changes requested.  The weekly personal and dependant rates of social insurance and social assistance were increased by 3 per cent from mid-July 1987.  The previous Government had provided for a similar increase but only from mid-November.</P>
      <P>The rate of supplement payable under the family income supplement scheme was increased from one third to one half of the difference between gross family income and the prescribed upper limit with effect from July 1987.  There were also changes in the income limits and in the maximum amounts payable under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Eligibility under the dental, optical and aural benefits scheme was extended with effect from 19 October to the dependent spouses of insured workers.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of October changes were made in the payment arrangement for individual items under the treatment benefits scheme.  While there will continue to be no charge to claimants for basic services and treatment, claimants are required to make an increased contribution towards the costs of the more expensive forms of treatment.</P>
      <P>From 6 April 1987 the earnings disregard or &ldquo;floor&rdquo; used for calculating the amount of pay related benefit was increased from £58 to £62 for all new claimants and the 25 per cent and 20 per cent rates of pay related benefit applicable until then were replaced by a single rate of 12 per cent.  This was in line with the proposals of the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of paid contributions required for entitlement to disability benefit after 52 weeks and invalidity pension was increased from 156 to 208 from April 1987.  The previous Government proposed an increase to 260.  A similar change was made in respect of treatment benefits from October 1987.  The number <Col N="2794" /> of paid or credited contributions required in the relevant contribution year for entitlement to disability benefit, unemployment benefit and maternity allowance was increased from 26 to 39 with effect from 6 April 1987.  A similar change was made in respect of entitlement to treatment benefits for persons over 23 years of age from October 1987.</P>
    <P>Eligibility under the national fuel scheme was extended this year to include those on long term unemployment assistance. The heating season was reduced from 30 to 26 weeks to allow for the extension on a neutral cost basis.</P>
    <P>The footwear scheme for children which operates under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was rationalised to ensure that those on lowest incomes received the highest net benefit and that a similar scheme operates in each health board area.  The general conditions regarding eligibility remain the same.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the threshold figure for the payment of a rent supplement was increased from £1.50 to £3 per week from 2 November 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1987 reviews of some 2,500 deserted wife's allowance and benefit claims were carried out.  These reviews resulted in the termination of 302 deserted wife's allowance claims and 264 deserted wife's benefit claims, respectively.  In addition, decisions to revise up or down the value of the awards were made in 598 deserted wife's allowance claims and 646 deserted <Col N="2795" /> wife's benefit claims.  These revisions arose from situations where there were changes in family circumstances.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment assistance payable to a person is the appropriate maximum rate less the weekly means assessed.  In assessing the means of a person living with his or her spouse, the income of the spouse is taken into account.  In the case of single persons living at home, the value to them of board and lodgings is assessed.  I do not consider these provisions to be unreasonable.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the means assessment is to achieve a degree of equity between those living in relatively better off circumstances and those living in poorer circumstances.  To provide a minimum guaranteed level of unemployment assistance irrespective of means would have major financial implications and would not be justified in present financial circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>These officers investigate the means and circumstances of persons applying for, or in receipt of, payments under the various means tested schemes administered by my Department.  For this purpose they receive training in all aspects of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A formal qualification in agriculture is not a condition for appointment as a social welfare officer but, since the investigation and assessment of means from farming forms an important part of the work of social welfare officers, they are acquainted with the various farm activities and operations through the training which they receive and by being kept abreast, on an ongoing basis, of all factors which have a bearing on the agricultural economy which affect their work.  This training is provided by social welfare supervisors and other social welfare <Col N="2797" /> officers who, because of the nature of work in rural areas, are widely experienced in farm investigative work and possess a good knowledge of agri-business in general and of the difficulties and problems associated with that business.</P>
    <P>Each social welfare officer, in a rural area, is trained to have a sound knowledge of the agricultural economy of that area particularly as regards marketing conditions and trends as to inputs, outputs, prices and costs.  In evaluation the stock, crop and farming data, gathered in the course of investigations of individual cases, officers have regard to these local conditions and trends as well as to data published by expert bodies in the field of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The training received by social welfare officers, the expertise which they develop and the knowledge of practical farming which they acquire in the course of their work enables them to submit reports on which fair assessments of means, from farming, for social welfare purposes can be made.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers work under the control and direction of social welfare supervisors who, in addition to exercising general control, check in detail a percentage of the work of their officers.</P>
    <P>When a social welfare officer has completed his investigation he submits a report to a deciding officer for decision. The deciding officer has experience of dealing with claims from all areas of the country and in cases of doubt or apparent inconsistency, on any matter in relation to a claim, he would refer the report back to the social welfare officer, or to his supervisor, for clarification, elaboration or further investigation as necessary.</P>
    <P>A claimant who is a landowner receives, in addition to the formal notification of the decision, a copy of the form containing the details on which the social welfare officer based his estimate of the net yearly value of the farm together with particulars of any other means assessed.  In this way claimants are made aware of the basis on which the means assessed are calculated.</P>
    <P>Finally, if a claimant is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against <Col N="2798" /> him it is open to him to appeal against the decision and to have his case determined by a statutorily appointed appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme applies to persons, living alone or only with certain excepted persons, who are in receipt of long term social welfare or health board payments and are unable to provide for their own heating needs. Under the urban scheme, also operating in the Cork city area, a fuel allowance is automatically payable to persons residing in the urban area who are in receipt of either an old age non-contributory or blind pension or a widow's pension.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a fuel allowance is determined by reference to the conditions associated with either the national or the urban fuel schemes and payment of an allowance must be refused where these conditions are not satisfied in any particular case.  This year, for the first time, the long term unemployed are entitled to fuel allowances under the national fuel scheme.  The addition of some 30,000 beneficiaries as a result of this improvement means that the numbers qualifying this year are greater than ever.</P>

Of these, some 500 resulted in the allowance being terminated, most of which were as a result of the claimants transferring to old age pensions. The remaining 240 reviews arose following a change in the claimants' circumstances and resulted in changes in the level of weekly payment depending on whether the person's means had improved or disimproved.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate to consider extending the free electricity and free telephone rental schemes to retired primary teachers without at the same time considering the position of other categories of retired persons also receiving occupational pensions.

      <P>The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long term social welfare or health board payments who either live alone or with certain other excepted categories of persons only.  This year for the first time as part of a rationalisation of the urban and national fuel schemes, the national scheme has been extended to some 30,000 recipients of unemployment assistance who either live entirely alone or who live only with dependants.</P>
      <P>The current financial situation limited the additional numbers who could be accommodated within the rationalisation proposals and within the financial constraints it was necessary to target the extension of the scheme at those categories who are in greatest need.

In this regard the majority of reviews are carried out consequential on the receipt of information from the claimant indicating a change in her circumstances.  In some cases these reviews result in an increase being payable; an example would be a claim in respect of an extra child.  In other instances payment of the allowance may be discontinued, because the claimant would no longer fulfil the conditions for receipt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2803" /> In addition to this type of review the Department carries out general control reviews from time to time.  These reviews are aimed at ascertaining the claimant's present circumstances and to make adjustments, where necessary, in respect of changes in circumstances.  A purpose of these control reviews is to ensure that people are not receiving allowances to which they are not entitled.</P>

      <P>Over the last four years, the number of claims and awards for invalidity pension, were as follows: 1983, 2,825 claimed benefit, 2,701 qualified; 1984, 3,093 claimed benefit, 3,011 qualified; 1985, 4,475 claimed benefit, 4,066 qualified; 1986, 4,605 claimed benefit, 4,458 qualified.  The new contribution conditions set out in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1987, relate to both disability benefit and invalidity pension.  The provision is to increase the number of paid contributions required to remain entitled to disability benefit after 12 months from 208 to 260.  A similar provision increases the number of paid contributions for entitlement to invalidity pension for new claims from 208 to 260.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 2,000 people in total will be affected by these changes in 1988 yielding a saving of £4.4 million. The changes are designed to ensure that entitlement to these long term payments is limited to those who have had a reasonable history of attachment to the workforce.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say how many of those affected would have been invalidity pensioners.</P>

      <P>An appeals officer decided on 10 February 1987 that the person concerned is not entitled to a non-contributory old age pension on the grounds that his means, consisting of the weekly value of land and capital, exceed the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that, if it appears that a person has directly or indirectly deprived himself of any income or property in order to qualify for a pension, the yearly value of that income or property shall be taken to be part of his means.  The transfer of a substantial sum of capital to the applicant's nephew and members of his family was deemed to have been done in order to qualify the applicant for a pension and the amount involved was accordingly included in his means for the purpose of the application.</P>

Special road grant funding is being provided for the improvement of the canal bridge at Sallins. Work is in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of February next.

The development of proposals for any substantial improvements considered necessary to the bridge is a matter in the first instance for Iarnród Éireann and Kildare County Council.  Detailed proposals for the improvement of the bridge have not been received in my Department.  While the road grants already notified for 1988 absorb all the funds available to me for this purpose, I would be prepared to give favourable consideration to a request from the local authority for a transfer of moneys from within the allocations already notified to meet an appropriate share of any costs arising in relation to that bridge next year.</P>

      <P>The fact that savings are projected does not necessarily imply a lower starting-point for pay needs in 1988.  This depends on such factors as the amount actually realised, the extent to which they were anticipated in preparing the allocation for 1988 contained in the Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version) published on 13 October 1987, whether they have a run-on effect on 1988 costs and whether they are within the normal degree of estimating variation.</P>

      <P>The question of payment of grants is a matter for local authorities who are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme.  However, it is understood from Kildare County Council, the body administering the scheme in this student's area, that the maintenance element of the grant was paid recently and that the fee portion will be paid directly to the college concerned in the near future.</P>

    <P>(1)  problems will be examined on a school by school and class by class basis;</P>
    <P>(2)  the average class size will be in the low thirties.  The maximum size of any class will not exceed forty.  Where, because of exceptional circumstances, it is impossible to adhere to this limit, the permission of the Review Committee and the Minister would be required;</P>

    <P>(4)  special consideration will be given to schools in disadvantaged areas;</P>
    <P>
