      <P>On the Order of Business, and concerning directly the Order of the House, I wish in the light of our discussion yesterday which became rather acerbic at one or two moments to make a proposal to the Chair through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges aimed at ensuring that the Opposition parties will have the opportunity of raising with the Taoiseach, whom I know is quite prepared to deal with matters in this way, at relatively short notice matters that appear to be urgent to the Opposition so that it can be done in a way that will have the agreement of the House and that will not put any strain on the tolerance of the Chair.  I will be making those proposals to the Chair very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I pointed out that Fine Gael accepted the general thrust of the budget in so far as the targets were concerned.  It is, however, already clear that Fianna Fáil will have major problems in implementing the budget.  That relates to a number of factors.  First, there was the total irresponsibility of Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  For four years any proposal which involved savings to the Exchequer was stridently rejected and virtually any proposal involving extravagant expenditure was roundly applauded and fully supported.  Secondly, during the course of the election campaign Fianna Fáil consistently refused to provide any detail of expenditure cuts and the consequence now is that Fianna Fáil have gone into Government without any popular mandate for such cuts.  Thirdly, because Fianna Fáil in Government have made cuts and produced figures for cuts in excess of £100 million, cuts which are unspecified to the extent that there are now already major doubts as to whether they are reliable, the budget arithmetic is in doubt.  Fourthly, I will refer to the introduction of some measures done in a particularly insensitive and ill-conceived <Col N="1724" /> fashion.  I will single out two of those for special mention.</P>
      <P>If a deliberate effort was made to make a complete botch of the termination of the housing grants a greater mess could not have been achieved than that created last week.  In spite of the changes made for anomalies and so on among applicants, some of whom will now qualify while others will not as a result of the U-turn euphemistically referred to as the clarification of last Friday, I am sure the former friends of Fianna Fáil in the building industry have strong views on the decision to terminate those grants.  When one is considering the termination of grant schemes, surely the only fair way to do that is to make an announcement to the effect that all applicants after the date of the announcement will be excluded and that those who have applied on the basis of existing schemes will not be excluded.</P>
      <P>The other major area which stands out is the proposal to impose a charge of £10 per day for patients in public wards.  It must be remembered that there was also a proposal to increase the health levy. While the increase in the levy will not be greeted with loud hurrahs, at least it imposes additional burdens on those who are healthy and at work.  However, the proposal to impose a charge on those who are ill and, consequently, not at work does not have that merit.  This must be considered in the broader context of a decision to reject a small prescription charge under the GMS which would have raised about three times the amount of money involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As spokesman on Agriculture, I want to focus on those sections of the budget which impact directly on the farming sector.  The lowest priority for the axe must be schemes of a developmental nature where the consequence is a reduction in wealth creation.  I question the advisability of reductions in the farm improvement grants and the abolition of the young farmer installation aid, as well as cuts which have been made in a number of other areas.  I accept the overall needs for cuts, but in the agricultural area moneys of a capital nature which are <Col N="1725" /> helping in wealth creation must have the lowest priority from the point of view of expenditure cuts.</P>
    <P>My greatest criticism is directed towards the proposal to abolish the land tax.  I consider this to be a very unwise move indeed.  It is neither in the interests of the farmers nor of the country as a whole.  This tax was developing a broad acceptability among the farming community. Of course there were protests when it was first introduced but this was to be expected.  The same would apply if one were introducing a new tax in any area.  Over the centuries Governments have introduced new taxes on windows, hearths, soap, salt and even on wigs.  The introduction of each of these taxes brought protests, since nobody relishes paying tax of any kind.  The issue in this case is not whether farmers like land tax but whether it is more acceptable than a full accounts system.  In a perfect society where all farmers have perfect book accounts, a strong case could be made for a full accounts system, but when we look at the farm structure we find a multiplicity of small holders, most of whom are not very adjusted to book-keeping.  Because of that, I felt the farm tax was the answer.</P>
    <P>It gave, in addition, an incentive to greater productivity and essentially allowed the farmer to concentrate on the plough rather than the pen.  The interim accelerated valuation arrangements proposed in the January budget would have enabled all farmers up to 80 adjusted acres to pay farm tax and be exempt from income tax in 1987.  When it comes to a choice between a land tax and a full accounts system, I believe more than three out of four farmers would opt for the farm tax.  Of course there are some very substantial farmers in the category above 80 adjusted acres but they represent a small proportion of the total number of farmers.  While one will never make people happy about paying tax, the question of broad acceptability is of some importance.  On those grounds the farm tax scores over the full accounts system.</P>
    <P>A second point is that in a time of scarce resources it must be lunacy to introduce such a measure at a cost of £9 <Col N="1726" /> million to the Exchequer.  It is not as if the farmers will be saved this money. They will pay it and more to the accountants under the full accounts system.  The most recent estimates suggest that the total revenue from farm tax could have developed up to £65 million in a few years' time, whereas farmers last year paid £37 million in income tax.  The Minister for Finance expects a modest £1 million extra from the increased use of profile forms in the current year.  It is not as if the additional sum that would accure to the Exchequer would be an extra imposition on the farmers.</P>
    <P>The most recent estimates from the ICMSA suggest that the cost of accountancy services to farmers runs at about £40 million per year.  If we retained the land tax most of the need for that kind of expenditure would be eliminated.  Then we would have a considerably larger return to the Exchequer at virtually no net extra cost to the farmer.  Essentially Fianna Fáil propose to abolish the system which suits the vast majority of farmers and they are looking a farm gift horse in the mouth.  On the score of return to the Exchequer it was a mistake to abolish this tax.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury, Fianna Fáil now propose that the smallest farmers should contribute to the revenue shortfall resulting from abolition.  This is as a result of the proposal to reduce the flat rate VAT addition to farm prices from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent from 1 May.  This change, according to the Budget Statement, will yield £9 million in the current year, the same sum as we are told will be lost to the Exchequer as a result of the abolition of the farm tax.  It is important to note that the reduction from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent comes into effect only from 1 May.  If that will yield £9 million in the current year, am I right in thinking that in a full year the total imposition on the farmers as a result of that change will be 50 per cent higher?  If £9 million is raised over two-thirds of the year, the yield for the total year will come to £13.5 million.  This amount is effectively being taken away from the farmers by reducing their entitlement to VAT credit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> I consider this to be an outrageous proposal.  If we look at the VAT credit system we find it does not apply to registered farmers.  Obviously the registered farmers are entitled to obtain credit for their VAT inputs by filling up the forms and dealing with the matter in the normal way but who are the registered farmers? The registered farmers are the bigger farmers.  I do not know of any small farmer who is registered.  This system was developed to allow the unregistered farmer to obtain credit for the VAT inputs into his agricultural undertaking. It applies to all small farmers, virtually none of whom are registered.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that many of these farmers would not be liable for either farm tax or income tax.  The proposed change takes no cognisance of their profit, borrowings or family commitments. Effectively it amounts to an arbitrary tax on production as it withholds the VAT credits to which they are entitled.  As I understand it, the flat rate VAT addition was introduced to take cognisance of VAT payments on agricultural inputs such as sprays, machinery parts and repairs, leasing contracts, packaging materials and silage covers &mdash; areas where there are VAT payments to be made by farmers and where they would be entitled to a VAT credit.  This system was introduced to cater for the smaller unregistered farmer.  It was designed to give him, on a carefully calculated basis, credit to which he is entitled on VAT paid on inputs.  I think this point should be made clear, it is not a question of handouts to the farmers.  It merely gives back to him his entitlement under the VAT system.  Here we have a confusion between a tax system and the VAT credit system whereby the Government have in an arbitrary fashion abolished the farm tax.  What, they are saying is, the abolition of the farm tax will cost £9 million in the current year so for the rest of this year we will take £9 million from the smaller unregistered farmers and they will be entitled by way of VAT credits to reclaim a similar amount.  That seems to me a totally unfair way to do business. <Col N="1728" /> Nine million pounds will be taken in the current year but this will amount to £13.5 million in a full year.  I feel very strongly about this.  The House will understand my outrage at what seems to be a reverse Robin Hood proposal.  I think we all agree that in our approach to managing the financial affairs of the State we should lean less heavily on the smaller people rather than the big people.  It seems outrageous that those in the smaller farm categories should be leaned on in order to make up what has not been collected from the more substantial farmers.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the proposed abolition of the farm tax needs to be highlighted. The effect of this proposal will mean the closing down of the farm classification office.  This will mean that the excellent work being done by this office will be set at nought.  I know it was fashionable for Fianna Fáil to deride this excellent work.  The last comprehensive survey, Griffith's Valuation, is almost 150 years old.  It is now totally out of date being helped along by the Supreme Court decision in relation to the whole valuation system.  Apart altogether from the question of tax it is very much in our own interest that we do have a comprehensive survey of all the land holdings in Ireland. This work which was being completed as a by-product of the introduction of the farm tax will be of immense value in the years ahead.  Apart from the tax system it will be of immense value in the context of agricultural planning and of deciding future priorities.  This work is absolutely necessary on its own merit irrespective of the tax system.</P>
    <P>A fair amount of progress has been made to date.  I understand that all holdings over 80 adjusted acres would have been reviewed and classified by September of this year.  Because of the detailed nature of the work I accept that it would require at least another couple of years to complete the job fully.  In the January budget we had provided for a provisional tax assessment system.  This does not deny the fact that this work stands very much on its own merits and if we were not introducing a farm tax system but had sufficient funding, priority <Col N="1729" /> should be given to work in this area.  In a time of tight financial conditions I accept that it would not immediately attract funding, but it is a job that needs to be done.  It was a very useful by-product of the introduction of farm tax.</P>
    <P>What is to become of the work that has been done so far, the very many excellent reports that have been compiled, the maps that have been prepared and the efforts at computerisation?  Will all this be just thrown aside?  Will this major work be left to rot?  What will become of the highly motivated, highly qualified and well trained staff?  The people involved in the farm classification office were doing a very good job.  Serious questions have to be raised about their future.  Other opportunities may not present themselves so easily.  This factor should be borne in mind in considering this decision.  I do not think it can be denied that the comprehensive survey in itself would have uses of all kinds in the years to come.</P>
    <P>We had a marvellous corps of highly qualified graduates doing an excellent job.  I have not heard a single word of criticism of them.  Are these people to be thrown on the scrap heap following this foolish decision?  On the grounds of reason and logic, in the interests of the farmer, for the benefit of the Exchequer and the national interest generally, I am adopting what is probably a unique position for an Opposition spokesman.  I am proposing that the farm tax be retained and that this proposal to turn farmers into book-keepers for the benefit of accountants and nobody else be shelved. I make that proposal in all seriousness.  I believe genuinely that this is the right thing for farmers and for the country.</P>
    <P>I accept entirely that there are Members in my party who do not totally share my enthusiasm, but everybody is entitled to a point of view.  This issue should not be considered totally in the political context.  I believe a strong body of opinion in the Government party strongly favours farm tax as opposed to full accounts.  I accept that some farmers, particularly the bigger ones, would prefer <Col N="1730" /> the approach now proposed by Fianna Fáil, but I believe that the vast majority would opt for farm tax rather than full accounts.  Therefore, in this, as it were, non-political way I am putting forward seriously the proposal that the Government reconsider what they are doing in this area.  At the very minimum the proposal to abolish farm tax requires to be examined further, to be looked at in all its implications.  I have pointed out some reasons which obviously suggest a strong case for the retention of farm tax.  I am asking the Government to consider these points seriously, to look again at the decision to abolish farm tax and to institute in its place full accounts for all farmers.  Essentially, if that decision is followed through the only people who will gain in the end will be the accountants and surely that is not in the interest of the farmers, the country or the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a couple of other items in the few minutes that remain to me.  I am glad of the emphasis which the Government are placing on the development of the food industry and the horticultural industry.  I have already congratulated my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, on his appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the food industry.  I wish him every success in that job.  While I am at it I suppose I should congratulate the Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture as well.  Even though he is some distance away from me, certainly I wish him well.  I suppose it is fair to say that already there are some question marks about these appointments but not, of course, from the point of view of the calibre of the people appointed.  How strong is the commitment of this Government to the development of these areas? I know their importance.  I was involved as chairman of the ministerial group who examined the food industry a couple of year ago and I was the person who recommended the appointment of a Minister of State for Food.  That proposal was adopted by the previous Government and Deputy Paddy Hegarty was appointed as Minister of State attached to both agriculture and industry.  I have strong reasons for suggesting that as the best <Col N="1731" /> approach because agriculture is the area where the strong interest is on the part of the producer, where many of the problems are at the processing and marketing end and where industry perhaps has a greater input.  However, I will not go into that at this stage.  We might go into that issue in more detail at some other time.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that even when money is tight if the Government were seriously interested in developing the food and horticultural industries, surely that interest should have been evidenced by an allocation of resources, done possibly by way of reallocation from other areas.  However, I have examined the documents and I have seen no resources allocated to these areas.  At this stage that raises questions in my mind as to the Government's commitment to achieve the grand aims which they set out in their document <i>A Programme for National Recovery</i>.  I will confine myself to those remarks at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be watching carefully from this side of the House how things develop in that area and in particular whether the efforts of the two Ministers of State appointed will be supported by the Government to the extent of the allocation of resources to enable them to attain their objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just time to touch briefly one other area, namely, forestry.  At this stage, while agricultural land is for dairying or beef production, interest has to be on efficiency and quality and we must consider alternative land use because of quota restrictions.  I see forestry, and to a degree tourism, as of importance in this area.  Looking at the forestry scene, we find that the percentage of land under timber in this country is only about a quarter of that which obtains in continental Europe.  We find also in the EC only 50 per cent self-sufficiency in timber products.  Therefore, it is clear there is a market there and we must orient our <Col N="1732" /> minds towards bigger efforts in the forestry area.  Progress was made towards that over the past few years and I would like to see that stimulated further.  It should be done both at State level and the private side.  I do not think there is any conflict between the two.  I am in favour of an effort to continue the development of State forestry.  Indeed, I see nothing wrong with the disposal of some forests if that money is reinvested in the establishment of others.  In relation to private forestry, here perhaps there is even greater scope and I am delighted that some of the pension funds are now allocating a portion of their portfolios for forestry development.  I hope that will continue and that we will see in the coming years a major explosion in private forestry.</P>
    <P>I have two questions that I hope will be clarified.  If the Government share my enthusiasm in the forestry area, why then was there a reduction in the sum voted for private forestry grants?  If the Government feel there should be an expansion of private forestry, why the reduction of £200,000 for private forestry grants? There is a second point I would like to have clarified.  In the development measures proposed in the January budget included were a number of items which involved the provision of grants, in two instances with recoupment from the EC, for forestry development.  These involved grants of £550 per hectare being made available under an EC regulation for farmers outside the western package area and grants of £500 per hectare for afforestation by non-farmers outside the western package area.  There is also the question of continuing headage payments on afforested land.  I am inquiring as to whether those development measures proposed in the January budget will be taken on board by the new administration. I encourage them so to do.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have time to go into any other areas.  Let me say in conclusion that again, perhaps unusually for an Opposition Deputy, I wish the Government every success in coping with the financial problems of this country.  At the same time, I believe it is the duty and <Col N="1733" /> responsibility of an Opposition spokesman to point out where there appear to be problems and to make criticisms where they are considered necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this budget is to initiate economic recovery. Our programme of economic recovery requires that we first of all secure the base of the economy by getting order and balance into the public finances.  Government expenditure and the amount the Government borrow must be reduced as a condition to stimulating growth, investment and employment.  Firm action in controlling Government expenditure and borrowing are vitally necessary if we are to create a general climate of initiative, enterprise and if we are to inspire confidence in our ability to overcome our economic difficulties.</P>
      <P>Our policy, of course, will not be confined to corrective action in regard to the public finances.  We will also undertake a programme of measures designed to stimulate investment, growth and employment.  We have identified specific sectors of the economy as having potential for development.  The development of these sectors will be actively pursued. It is our intention also to use the semiState companies as major instruments of economic development policy where this is possible.  I am glad to avail of this debate to rebut a great deal of misleading comment to the effect that Fianna Fáil have engaged in a major reversal of policy by introducing this budget.</P>
      <P>Let me remind these commentators that as far back as 1982 the basic strategy we proposed in <i>The Way Forward</i> was to take firm action by reductions in public expenditure to eliminate the deficit combined with developmental measures. That is still our basic philosophy.  The last Government in our view relied almost exclusively on massive increases in taxation and did not succeed in tackling the budget deficit which reached unprecedented levels in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the general election campaign we imposed upon ourselves a firm discipline in regard to the public finances. We made no expenditure promises or <Col N="1734" /> commitments in the campaign which would inhibit us in Government from taking the action needed to restore the public finances.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which will form the basis of our economic policies in Government stated:</P>
    <P>We see the excessive size of the current budget deficit as the primary cause of unsustainable levels of borrowing and high interest rates.  The current budget deficit will therefore be progressively reduced from the all-time high in 1986 ...</P>
    <P>At the press conference when launching that programme, I warned that we would be faced with a very difficult budget situation and stated that the estimates for every area of public expenditure would be examined rigorously and in detail &ldquo;and reduced to the irreducible minimum&rdquo;. We have carried out that work and the level of Government expenditure, which was 56.2 per cent of GNP last year, will now be reduced to 55 per cent of GNP in 1987 as a result of the budget, the start of a process we are determined to continue.</P>
    <P>Nobody either in this House or outside it, can with any credibility deny the absolute necessity for the kind of budget we have introduced.  That is not to say there will not be aspects of the budget about which it is valid to take a different view. But the main purpose of the budget cannot be rejected.  The reduction in Government borrowing which we plan to achieve is essential.  It was not something that could be postponed until next year or the year after.  We had to face the stark reality that the rate of Exchequer borrowing could not be sustained.  We cannot ignore the fact that the national debt had doubled in the past four years. It now stands at £25.4 billion and if things were allowed to continue as they have been, by 1990 the national debt would be £35 billion and at that level it would be beyond the country's capacity to service. As it is, the present cost of servicing the national debt takes up nearly one-third of the total tax revenues of the State.  It has grown by an average of 20 per cent every year since 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> In our election manifesto we made it clear that we intended to deal decisively with the deteriorating state of the country's finances by at least stabilising the level of Exchequer expenditure in terms of gross national product.  The firm action we have taken in this budget is completely in line with that undertaking.  It is also in line with the policy decisions we took when we were last in Government in 1982.  In the middle of that year we were compelled by deteriorating circumstances in the public finances to take drastic action to cut back expenditure because we saw clearly the urgent need for such action.</P>
    <P>This budget is the first decisive step towards restoring order and balance in the public finances.  Because effective action was not taken during the past four years, the situation continued to deteriorate. Investment confidence evaporated and capital flowed out of the country.  In 1986 alone £1.5 billion was taken out of this economy with devastating results on investment and interest rates.  Unless there is investment confidence and unless we can retain the nation's savings in the economy, we cannot succeed in generating economic recovery and providing employment.  It is not possible to achieve economic growth in an economy where the Exchequer finances are moving steadily into greater deficit.  Nor is it possible to secure investment when excessive Exchequer borrowing drives up interest rates.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government have given the clearest and most determined signal possible that the deterioration in the Exchequer finances will be halted and that balance will be steadily restored.  We expect that, as a result of the action taken in this budget, interest rates should fall, and fall significantly.  With reasonable interest rates we will have a solid foundation for new economic growth.</P>
    <P>A cornerstone of our national economic strategy is the maintenance of the value of the Irish pound on foreign exchanges.  The benefits from successfully doing this are considerable.  We give a firm basis for commercial planning <Col N="1736" /> to our own manufacturers.  We avoid the dangers of imported inflation and the artificial inflation of our foreign debt.  We provide a clear exchange rate climate for those in the financial sector in Ireland, to foreign investors and we discourage speculative outflows.  We provide the basis whereby interest rates in Ireland can remain at the same level as in the countries we trade with.  In order to secure all these benefits the Government are determined to maintain the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS.  This budget contains a number of specific proposals which indicate our determination to tackle outstanding problems in the economy.</P>
    <P>The situation that had been allowed to develop with regard to cross-Border and cross-channel shopping expeditions had become intolerable.  They were giving rise to an estimated loss of £300 million a year to this economy and maybe more. The economic life of the counties along this side of the Border, in particular, was being devastated by this traffic and its effects were steadily spreading to the entire country.  We believe that the European Community concession for travellers is intended only for genuine travellers and that we are fully justified in introducing the concept of 48 hours absence as a test of the genuine traveller.  It is early days yet but the indications are that the change made is succeeding and I want to give the House an assurance that the Government are determined that this new regulation will be enforced.</P>
    <P>For many years, the large amount of unpaid taxes has been a cause of grave inequity in the taxation system and has been resented, in particular, by PAYE taxpayers.  We are determined to remedy this inequity as part of our programme of tax reform.  A major effort is now being made to collect the taxes which are outstanding. The merging of the Department of the Public Service with the Department of Finance has given us the opportunity to redeploy a high quality cadre of 25 civil servants as a task force to assist the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners in collecting these taxes.  We have only taken credit in the budget for <Col N="1737" /> an extra £10 million to be collected as a result of this initiative.  I would personally be hopeful of a greater return.  Certainly in future years, the work of this task force allied to the continuing efforts of the Revenue Commissioners staff should be effective in clearing up this unacceptable situation to the benefit of all taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always maintained that there is only one fair way to tax farmers and that is in the same manner as every other section of the community. That is, in fact, what NESC have recommended. The farm tax, or as it was more popularly called, the land tax, introduced by the previous Government, was unfair to farmers as well as to the rest of the taxpaying community.  In so far as farmers were concerned, it did not take any account of their personal or family circumstances, or make any allowance for losses which might be incurred.  So far as the rest of the taxpaying community were concerned, on the other hand, they had no assurance that farmers would pay their fair share having regard to their actual income.  May I remind Deputy O'Keeffe who spoke about this matter that NESC which is the economic forum on which all sections of the community give expression to their views on policy, strongly recommended that taxing farmers should be on the same income basis as everybody else and that they actually condemned the land tax as inequitable?</P>

      <P>In practice, the farm tax proved to be very unsuccessful as a source of revenue.  In 1986, the previous Government calculated a gross yield of over £5 million from this tax, but succeeded in collecting only £400,000. Despite this meagre return, a large, cumbersome, separate administrative system was being established in connection with the tax.  It was clearly for some time to come going to cost more than the amount of tax actually collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As another part of our programme of tax reform, this Government rightly decided that from here on all farmers will pay on the same basis as everybody else. <Col N="1738" /> All farmers likely to have taxable incomes will be assessed for income tax as soon as possible.  For this purpose, we are extending the use of profile forms for small farmers, which is an effective and efficient way of identifying farmers for income tax assessment.</P>
    <P>We have ensured that, despite the abolition of the farm tax or land tax, there will be no loss to the Exchequer this year because the reduction of £9 million in the amount of tax which would have been received from farmers will be offset by a reduction in the VAT rate provided.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, farm tax due for 1986 amounting to about £5 million will be collected by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is our view that this issue of farmer taxation has now been settled, once and for all.  I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish farmers wish to pay their fair share of taxation, that they would wish to do this on the same basis as everyone else.  This issue has dragged on for far too long.  It has been a constant source of irritation and confrontation.  It was time to solve the problem in the only way it could be solved and that is what we have done.</P>
    <P>This Government accept the principle enunciated by NESC that a necessary element in a strategy for economic development must be that the tax system be reformed and made more efficient and equitable.  In the short time at our disposal we have made a start in introducing greater taxation equity.  In addition to the measures I have mentioned, the withholding tax on professional fees paid by public bodies brings the taxation of that sector more in line with the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>We will continue to work towards greater equity and efficiency and, as the state of the public finances improves, to put into practice our principal aim in regard to personal taxation, which is a reduction of income tax to the standard rate for at least two-thirds of income taxpayers.</P>
    <P>While decisive action on the Exchequer finances is essential for economic confidence and investment, corrective fiscal policies must be parallelled <Col N="1739" /> by development policies designed to lift the rate of economic growth.  The more economic growth we have the more beneficial will be the results for the public finances.</P>
    <P>The budget targets we have set of 6.9 per cent and 10.7 per cent respectively of GNP for the current deficit and Exchequer borrowing are based on the official Department of Finance assumptions of only 1 per cent growth in GNP in 1987.  That was the prudent course to take, particularly as we had only three weeks in which to prepare and present this budget.  We could not, and did not, calculate on the basis of an increase in the rate of growth even through we are determined to secure it.</P>
    <P>Any increase over 1 per cent growth will bring down the relative size of the current budget deficit and the borrowing requirement and will generally benefit the Exchequer finances.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that a higher growth rate than 1 per cent can be achieved on the basis of the economic confidence and stability this budget will generate and the implementation of our new development proposals.  I would be disappointed if the fiscal measures taken in the budget and the development measures we are taking independently do not result in a growth rate of more than 1 per cent.  One leading professional commentator has already estimated growth, post budget, at 1.75 per cent.  Our objective, of course, is to bring growth as rapidly as possible to 2.5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>To reach the objective of a 2.5 per cent growth rate we need to secure an additional output of goods and services of £250 million net of imports in our economy.  The elimination of the total £300 million that we are now losing in shopping expeditions cross-Border and cross-channel would by itself alone, after deduction of the normal leakage of imports, bring us up to our target of 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Economic recovery will be pursued through a series of practical actions which generate new growth and employment in the sectors of the economy which we <Col N="1740" /> have identified as having the necessary potential.</P>
    <P>We will welcome support for these development measures from all concerned. We are also open to suggestions from all quarters for other development measures to complement or supplement our proposals.  In particular, we will be asking the social partners for their suggestions and for their co-operation and assistance in our endeavours and we intend to commence a programme of consultations with those involved immediately. In this connection, of course, I will gladly listen in the course of this debate to any Deputy who may wish to put forward any suggestions for development.  The Finance Bill will offer us the opportunity to give effect to any suitable measures we may decide to adopt.</P>
    <P>The international financial services industry is one of the fastest growing areas of the world economy.  Already, financial transactions far exceed in value the total of world trade in goods.  They are a major source of new employment. The Government have set up an International Financial Services Centre Committee with a mandate to establish as quickly as possible a new centre in the Dublin Custom House Docks site for international financial services.  This committee is representative of the financial, banking, Government and semi-State interests and agencies concerned. It will advise on and, where appropriate, make arrangements for the development of an international financial services industry.  We came into office, convinced that there is great potential for the development of international financial services in Ireland based on the availability of people with the necessary skills, the necessary professional structures, our geographic location and our highly advanced telecommunications system. We intend to put in place the other elements, including taxation incentives and data protection regulations, which are required for the rapid development of an active international centre.  Our objective is to ensure that Ireland shares in this expanding service industry and the first class employment it provides and I <Col N="1741" /> am reasonably confident that this project will be a success.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the flight of capital out of the economy.  The astonishing fact about that outflow of funds is that there has been no precise information about its composition or cause.  On taking up office, we instigated an investigation of the nature and cause of the leakage which is, of course, a new phenomenon in our economy.  When we get the information we require later this month about the nature of the outflow, we will then consider what action can be taken to encourage these funds to return or remain in our economy.  The return of these funds would bring significant benefits and would of course, have a major impact on interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme is another development measure which we have rapidly put into effect.  Such programmes are a feature of the employment situation in Britain, France and the United States. They have been successful in lifting long term unemployed people out of the depressing unemployment ethos by actually finding them jobs they did not know about, by retraining them, or by offering them community and other work.  This is an attempt worth making to provide a more dignified and helpful service to the unemployed, instead of leaving them neglected and unaided in the dole queues.</P>
    <P>In this case, also, we have sought to accomplish this new project by re-deployment. In all, over 300 staff have been redeployed within the public service to undertake this new programme which is a fairly significant and commendable administrative achievement.</P>
    <P>We propose to continue the reform of the public service.  We have merged the Departments of Finance and the Public Service as proposed by our predecessors. This has already begun to yield dividends in increased efficiency and more rational use of staff.  We intend to continue along this road and to ensure the rational use of staff in the Civil Service and the public service generally.  We are fortunate in this country in having a highly skilled and fully dedicated Civil Service and public <Col N="1742" /> service.  We owe it to them to ensure that their skill and dedication are used as much as possible.  We must ensure there are no areas of the public service where people are engaged in tasks which are unnecessary or of marginal importance in a sensible scale of economic and social priorities or can be discharged more efficiently and with more job satisfaction than at present.  Given the cost of the public service in our small relatively underdeveloped country and the heavy burden borne by our taxpayers we must ensure that every penny is profitably spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>The merger of the two Departments, Public Service and Finance, does not mean that personnel function will be submerged. An active, enlightened personnel policy is an essential part of a modern administraction.  A personnel management policy will, therefore, be an essential function of the merged Department. The former Secretary of the Department of the Public Service will become Secretary for Public Service Management and Development, responsible to the Secretary of the Department. His task will be to spearhead a major programme designed to ensure the maximum possible level of efficiency in the deployment of the personnel of the public service.</P>
    <P>Given the enormous size of the national debt, its efficient management is of the greatest importance.  It is generally accepted that the Department of Finance have been particularly successful in raising loans on very keen terms and in handling the management of the debt in a skilful and professional way.  National debt service is a first charge on the Government's finances and the division of the Department which deals with this area of work has now been strengthened by the appointment of a specially experienced Secretary for National Debt Management who will be responsible to the Secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in recent years there has been a tendency for Governments to look to the line Departments for advice in developing the economy and to the Department of Finance merely <Col N="1743" /> for cutting public expenditure and the borrowing requirement.  This is an undesirable and unnecessary division of labour.  In the past the Department of Finance had an important developmental function, which they exercised without impairing their control function.  In their enlarged form I look to it to be a powerful instrument in achieving the Government's developmental objectives.</P>
    <P>All who depend directly on the Exchequer for their pay and conditions must now accept the realities of the state of the public finances.  Jobs can no longer be regarded as secure unless the Exchequer finances are put in order.  Pay constitutes one-third of all Exchequer current expenditure.  Everyone &mdash; both those who are paid from the Exchequer and those who pay the taxes which fund the Exchequer &mdash; must now accept that pay restraint must contribute to arresting the existing trend in the Exchequer finances.  We are asking all those concerned to recognise that the Exchequer finances are in crisis and to co-operate with us in our efforts to avert this crisis in the interest of the nation and its future. The choice is stark and clear.  Pay restraint must contribute to the solution of the Exchequer deficit.  The alternative to realistic pay restraint is major layoffs of staff.  These are the realities that must be faced.  Attitudes and stances that were justifiable perhaps in better times are no longer relevant because the grounds on which they were based no longer exist.</P>
    <P>Government Departments have been carefully restructured to respond better to the development potential we see in our economy.  We have created a Department of the Marine in which we have now centred all Government functions which relate to the sea.  This is because we consider that, as an island people, we have not yet realised a fraction of the potential of the seas around us.  This potential exists in fishing, fish farming and mariculture, fish processing and marketing, shipbuilding, ship-repairing and marine servicing; and offshore mineral exploration and development.</P>
    <P>We have also created a Department of Tourism and Transport.  World tourism <Col N="1744" /> is growing by between 3 to 4 per cent and could be the world's largest industry by the year 2000.  Ireland has virtually stood still in recent years in the midst of this growth in world tourism.  Yet, we have one of the best tourist products in the world in our scenery, the warm welcome our people offer, our cultural and artistic life, our developed tourist infrastructure and our wide range of recreational facilities. The scope for development is evident in the fact that only 0.5 per cent of the Germans who take holidays abroad come here, from Britain under 4 per cent and from France only 1 per cent.  In the years 1980 to 1985, inclusive, the number of cross-channel visitors travelling by air to Ireland fell by about 9 per cent while in the same period air passenger traffic from the UK to the EEC, excluding Ireland, grew by over 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>Transatlantic visitors to Ireland in the same period rose by nearly 9 per cent as compared with an average increase of over 31 per cent to the other European countries.  It has been calculated that if we had kept pace with the traffic to other countries our tourist income could have been nearly £250 million higher in 1985. Again, let me remind the House that £250 million in products and services is the difference between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent growth.</P>
    <P>The new Department of Tourism and Transport will now urgently prepare their proposals for increasing tourist revenue. Cheap, efficient and convenient access transport and ancillary services are the greatest requirement of the tourist industry. The new Department will now be responsible for ensuring that this comes about as rapidly as possible.  Tourism currently generates some 80,000 jobs.  The Government's aim is to increase that by 40,000 by doubling our tourist revenue. In the light of international trends, that objective is clearly realistic.  We are making provision in the Finance Bill to extend the tax incentives of the business expansion scheme to investments in export tourism activities.</P>
    <P>The development of the food industry is another area of development where the potential is obvious.  The Department of Agriculture have now been made responsible <Col N="1745" /> for the food industry and the Department have been renamed the Department of Agriculture and Food to emphasise this new responsibility.  An office for the food industry with a Minister of State in charge has been established within that Department.  The growth in output of the food processing industry has been very small in recent years.  We compare badly with other comparable countries like Denmark in the proportion of value added in the meat and dairy industries.  We must develop our natural advantages in food production by developing our food processing. We have the advantage of being able to present to the world a brand image of food from a clean and unpolluted environment.  Already, discussions have started with meat processing interests for a major expansion of our meat processing capacity and its export potential.</P>
    <P>We intend to develop the horticulture industry where again the potential has been neglected, so much so that we import £37 million of vegetables and fruit annually which we can produce ourselves. The opportunity that import substitution presents can be guaged from the fact that the total value of the output of Irish horticulture is £125 million.  We have set up an Office of Horticulture with a Minister of State in charge and his main objective will be rapidly to establish An Bord Glás to promote and develop the horticulture industry and its import substitution and employment potential.</P>
    <P>We are taking a similar commercial approach to the potential of our forests. We have established an Office for Forestry with a Minister of State in charge to promote and develop this sector. Again, the vast natural potential we have in a Europe which is short of timber will be realised with a further significant contribution to growth and employment.</P>
    <P>Our Irish workforce has already shown the capacity to man the new high technological and science-based industries. Progressively we are beginning to develop our own scientific industries as well as benefiting from the operations of the many overseas firms in that field.  Our science policy, however, has not been <Col N="1746" /> clearly formulated or directed toward the development needs of industry and agriculture. Our research and development efforts have been fragmented.  The Office of Science and Technology with a Minster of State in charge will have a new responsibility to spearhead the national effort to administer a realistic policy of science and research and develop a strong indigenous science-based industrial sector as well as continuing to attract technologically advanced firms from overseas.</P>
    <P>We are probably the highest earners <i>per capita</i> in the developed world from exports.  This has, however, been mainly due to the marketing efforts and arrangements of overseas firms established here. In fact, exports by the indigenous industrial sector have declined in recent years and there has been a very strong import penetration in domestic markets.  We intend to tackle the situation with a view to turning it round.  By comparison with other small European countries our export drive has lacked purpose and direction.  The new Office of Trade and Marketing under a Minister of State will develop a new national programme for trade and export promotion.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always recognised the importance of the construction industry as a major source of employment and the contribution it can make to the national economy.  Our commitment to it has in no way been reduced.  A detailed policy statement on the construction industry was set out in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, which we intend to implement.  The disappointment of builders and private individuals at the termination of a number of housing grant schemes is very understandable but these schemes could not be carried any longer by the Exchequer.  I would like to point out, however, that even after the budget the provision in the capital programme for housing under all the different heads is £386 million compared with £382 million in 1986.  This ensures that in 1987 at least State investment in housing is being broadly maintained.</P>
    <P>In their pre-budget submission last October the Construction Industry Federation stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The single most important factor underlying the continuing slide in construction activity is a lack of confidence in the future prospects of the economy. The key to triggering a recovery in construction is to stimulate confidence. ...  The current budget deficit which has now reached 8.5 per cent of GNP must also be singled out as a fundamental factor causing the current loss of confidence in the economy and outflow of money.</P>
    <P>The construction industry will be the first to benefit from a restoration and confidence and a resumption of investment.</P>
    <P>The house building sector could not be looked to for the revival of the building and construction industry.  That was widely accepted.  The operation of the home improvement grants scheme was leading to financial disaster.  The incoming Government were faced with a huge unpaid bill of nearly £200 million and this was escalating.  It was this bill that compelled us to terminate the three grant schemes.  The previous Government, if they had been re-elected, I believe, fully intended to terminate the house improvement grants scheme, of which the 25 per cent cut in January was a first instalment.  It is in the nature of things that budgetary decisions of any kind that for practical reasons have an immediate date of implementation can create difficult circumstances for particular individuals who have been planning on the basis that particular schemes would remain in effect.  But the levels of expenditure in this area had escalated so fast, that the Government, if they wanted to get a grip on the public finances, had no option but to take the decision they have taken.  If the budget succeeds in reducing interest rates, this will have a beneficial effect on mortgage interest and help support demand for houses.  We have left in place the £2,000 for first-time purchasers.</P>
    <P>We intend to recommence our decentralisation programme.  The development of the Custom House Dock site will be pressed ahead with the object of creating <Col N="1748" /> several thousand jobs in construction. We also intend to maintain the road building programme at a high level.  We plan to establish a national roads authority to co-ordinate roads policy on a national basis.  The Government will be having ongoing talks with the industry to identify and bring forward projects which will help maintain employment until full economic recovery is underway.</P>
    <P>The years since 1970 have seen a major expansion and modernisation of our health services.  The scope of provision, the quality of medical care, the standard of facilities, especially the new general hospitals and the new specialist units, have improved enormously.  This major investment has led to a significant escalation in the cost of health care to the community, and in recent years major financial difficulties have threatened to undo much of what has been achieved. Allowing the health agencies to run up huge overdrafts, now standing at more than £50 million, was simply piling up problems that will have to be tackled in the future.  I would like to point out that in all the measures we have announced those on the general medical service scheme have been exempt.  Prescription charges have not been introduced and the rural dispensing scheme has been restored.</P>
    <P>The basic task facing this Government is to restore confidence in our economy. Without that, we can achieve none of our objectives, be they in relation to jobs, investment or interest rates.  The recession in Ireland, extremely severe at the outset here as elsewhere, has been unnaturally prolonged because of the failure to take the necessary action over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The reason we have in the limited time available to us concentrated on making a substantial reduction in the current budget deficit by over 1.5 per cent and in the borrowing level by nearly 2.5 per cent is because we have to break decisively out of the stagnation of rising debt and falling employment.  We had to take control of the situation before it finally takes control of us.  The cost of servicing the national debt in 1985 was 7 per cent more <Col N="1749" /> than the entire income tax take from PAYE.  If the situation were allowed to continue with stagnant growth and with no significant policy changes, by 1990 we would have a national debt in excess of £35 billion, and a GNP debt ratio close to 180 per cent.  These figures are based on the NESC study.  Taking action now should encourage a reduction in interest rates, increased investment including a flow of funds into the economy, and an improved financial balance which will allow some alleviation of the tax burden.</P>
    <P>In the time available to us it was not possible to give the full and careful consideration to every aspect of public expenditure that we would have liked. Arbitrary decisions had to be made. However, we intend to start work now on the Estimates for 1988.  Every aspect of Government expenditure, its purpose, the need for it, its effectiveness, will be carefully and scrupulously assessed.  This work will continue for the remainder of the year so that we will be in a position to present a Book of Estimates for 1988 that will meet the needs of our present circumstances as accurately as possible and comply with the necessity to apply public expenditure in the most efficient and economical way possible.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for many years that it would not be possible to solve the imbalances in our economy without substantial cuts in Government expenditure.  That necessity was clearly accepted by all principal groups in society with the publication of the NESC report last autumn. We have sought to make the cuts necessary without impairing the efficiency of the economy and without reneging on our basic social commitment.</P>
    <P>It is possible, as we have shown, to adopt an approach that is both fair and tough.  It is not acceptable, when sacrifices are called for, to put most of the burden on the least well off.  On the contrary, for expenditure cuts to be acceptable they must, taken together, be socially equitable.  In this budget we have removed the most harsh cuts proposed in the health and social welfare areas.</P>
    <P>What we have done in this budget, <Col N="1750" /> taken together with our developmental proposals in the programme for national recovery, are, in effect, what every serious commentator on our economic situation has demanded for years.  We have acted with courage and determination. I have pointed out that the target of 2.5 per cent annual growth is practicable and realisable.  We have the measures ready to achieve that growth. We ask now that all political, economic and social interests join with us in the programme for national recovery.  We will welcome any proposals or suggestions which can supplement, strengthen or support that programme.  On the essential foundation of strong and stable public finances, we can build an economy of growing confidence, enterprise and innovation which can at last realise the ambition we all share in this House &mdash; to shorten the unemployment queues and end the debilitating flow of emigration. Because they are introduced for that purpose, the sacrifices that are now called for will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>This year's budget was severe because it had to be.  We had to start getting the public finances under control or they would have got completely out of hand and in a few short years we would simply not be able to borrow what would be needed to keep going.  We had to reduce the gap between the Government's income and expenditure so that Government borrowing could be reduced.  This is the first essential step towards economic recovery.</P>
    <P>Even though the budget is tough we have placed great emphasis on equity and fair play and spreading the load.  We have tried to shield the poorest and weakest sections of the community to the greatest possible extent and to spread the cutbacks and the restrictions right across the board and ensure that those who could best afford to do so would carry most of the burden.</P>
    <P>The public have accepted this kind of budget because they are genuinely concerned about the future and they want the country's finances put on a proper secure basis.  Whatever their own particular preferences might have been, they <Col N="1751" /> recognise that the approach we have taken is the only possible way to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks and restrictions had to be made in order to make a fresh start. We have the resources and the skills to overcome the dangers and difficulties we face if we organise ourselves properly to do so.  But we could not begin to get the economy growing again unless we put the public finances in order.  Because we have taken these difficult decisions the investment needed for growth is now possible.</P>
    <P>We have taken the first difficult steps toward economic recovery.  I am now asking everyone concerned, trade unionists, employers, the public and private sectors, representative organisations, to rally to the aid of the country at this critical time.  This budget must and will be rigidly adhered to.  The decisions are final.  There can be no giving in to sectional pressure or to special pleading no matter how persuasive.  No one has a moral right to hold the country up to ransom in the extreme circumstances that exist today.  We must all put the country first.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see strident newspaper headlines about &ldquo;War&rdquo;, &ldquo;Opening Shots&rdquo;, &ldquo;Threats&rdquo;, &ldquo;Boycotts&rdquo; and so on.  We must ask on whom is it proposed to wage war?  The answer is, of course, the Irish people.  It is their future that we are determined to protect.  In their interest this budget must be accepted and supported. The alternative is too disastrous for anyone even to contemplate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would feel very happy if I could feel confident that the Taoiseach meant everything he said.  I quote from the penultimate paragraph of his speech where he said:</P>
      <P>This budget must and will be rigidly adhered to.  The decisions are final. There can be no giving in to sectional pressure or to special pleading no matter how persuasive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we heard the budget speech last Tuesday afternoon it struck me that there were at least three things in it which were <Col N="1752" /> wrong, whatever the good intentions underlying them or whatever the overall intention, and which were likely to have to be changed from the manner in which they were announced.  The first was the hospital charge of £10 a day; the second was the retrospective abolition of three sets of housing grants, and the way in which it was done; and the third was the imposition of a withholding tax of 35 per cent on gross professional fees paid to certain professional firms.</P>
    <P>In respect of the first, within 24 hours we had what has now become known as clarification of the hospital charges.  I understand that last night we had further clarification.  The statement made by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech is not now being adhered to.  There are enormous limitations on this £10 a day charge to seek to make it more equitable, and I welcome that fact but having heard these &ldquo;clarifications&rdquo; we are now in a very different position from the position enunicated last Tuesday.</P>
    <P>On the question of the housing grants, we know what transpired.  We know what the &ldquo;clarifications&rdquo; are.  If I were to say one thing on Tuesday, amend it enormously by the following Friday evening and then were to say I have not changed it at all, I might well be accused of telling lies.  However, that does not arise in this instance.  The advertisements in last Sunday's newspapers setting out the position in regard to housing grants and the conditions for eligibility as enunciated in last Tuesday's budget statement, were entirely inconsistent with the changes made on Friday evening.  Presumably there was nothing the Department or the newspapers could do to change the advertisement, but this is described as clarification, not modification.</P>
    <P>A change has not yet taken place in regard to the withholding tax of 35 per cent on gross fees, partly because not all the firms concerned yet realise its significance. But you can take it, Sir, that a change will have to be made there, unless the Government are determined to put many of those firms out of business.  If they are determined to do that, fair enough, they will not make any change, <Col N="1753" /> but if they want to retain in employment many thousands who are employed by these architectural, engineering, surveying, accounting firms, then those changes will have to be made.</P>
    <P>In the discussion which took place last Tuesday night on the Financial Resolution relating to the imposition of that tax, the Taoiseach sought to equate the payment of gross fees to such a firm with the payment of wages to somebody who was subject to PAYE.  Any such equation or comparison is invalid and erroneous and the Taoiseach must know that as well as anybody else.  It is a device which is used to try to give the impression that these fees are profits which go into somebody's pocket when, in fact, they are the gross earnings of a firm out of which wages and other overheads have to be paid and where the actual earnings may vary between zero per cent and 10 per cent of gross fees.  It would be outrageous if any Government were to propose the imposition of a 35 per cent withholding tax on the turnover of a commercial or industrial firm.  Essentially there is no difference between a commercial and industrial firm and a firm which trades in professional services of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The regrettable aspect of these three matters which I felt would have to be changed &mdash; and two of which have been changed up to now &mdash; is that they display a lack of confidence which undermines the credibility of the very programme which the Government are setting out to establish, the need to cut public expenditure, to reduce the public deficits and reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirements. These foolish errors which arise from incompetence give ammunition to those &mdash; and there are many both inside and outside this House &mdash; who would argue against this exercise being undertaken. Their case is strengthened by the silly errors which were made which are, in part, corrected but which are corrected with a lack of grace and a blatant attempt to deny what is absolutely plain and to suggest black is white or white is black, and think people are not sufficiently intelligent to realise that.  It is regrettable that <Col N="1754" /> the type of programme and the type of task undertaken by the Government in this budget which in general terms I agree is a movement in the right direction, should have its credibility undermined by these stupid mistakes which display such a lack of basic competence and which should never occur in any budget even one which as the Government complain, they had only three or four weeks to prepare.  Five minutes examination of some of those proposals would have indicated how foolish and unsustainable they were.  The way they have been so rapidly, fundamentally and radically changed since underlines that fact.</P>
    <P>This budget is a move in the right direction in one area at least but two areas which should be utilised in conjunction with the efforts to reduce borrowing and deficits are entirely neglected.  I refer to the lack of any movement towards the reduction of taxation or towards the privatisation of State assets of any description. Without those two tasks being undertaken at the same time the budget must be defective because it accentuates rather than improves many of the difficulties that exist in the real economy as opposed to the Exchequer balance sheet.</P>
    <P>It is very disturbing to see the position in regard to taxation.  Up to now we had the highest percentage of taxpayers in the world paying tax at rates above the standard rate.  In 1986, 43 per cent of our taxpayers paid above the standard rate. As a result of this budget, from Monday of this week, 6 April, 47 per cent of our taxpayers will pay tax above the standard rate.  In Sweden and Denmark, which are regarded as high tax countries by those who are not aware of the position in Ireland, the corresponding percentages are 12 per cent and 4 per cent paying above the standard rate.  The overall increase in income tax for 1987 is 14 per cent.  We in the Progressive Democrats find it impossible to accept the validity of an approach like that, an approach that not alone makes no effort to reduce the levels of tax in a regime which is almost without parallel in the world, but goes out of its way to make it worse.  The bulk <Col N="1755" /> of that 14 per cent increase in income tax this year will come from PAYE taxpayers, who, without exception, will pay significantly more in tax than they did last year as a result of the non-indexation of tax bands.</P>
    <P>In October last and again in February at the time of the election the Progressive Democrats set out various proposals for cuts in public expenditure and for charges in certain cases where they were not made already.  When we did that originally last year we were looked on as mad by much of the political establishment. We were told we were crazy and that no proper, sensible political party would face an election with that kind of approach.  I am glad to see today, as a result of this budget, the kind of transformation that what we and we alone said 12 months ago was needed.  This is coming to pass with a strange sort of consensus created in this House but the consensus has to stop short at a particular point because those cuts in public expenditure &mdash; the necessity to reduce borrowing which we identified last year, the necessity to reduce the deficits and so on &mdash; were proposed by us, and they were very severe, in the context of reduced liability for tax, of bringing back, at the beginning at least, some movement towards normal taxation rates as judged by anywhere else in the world.  It is difficult for this kind of consensus to survive a situation in which all tax is increased significantly while at the same time these kinds of cuts are made.  I and many other people, too, think now it would be possible to approach these problems in parallel and that it is unwise not to do so.</P>
    <P>To drive our tax rates up further, as many commentators pointed out during the past week, is compounding and increasing the disincentive that exists and making it more difficult for the real economy to make any progress whatever.  In the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 5 April 1987, Mr. Paul Tansey pointed out &mdash; and I would agree with him &mdash; that the error in this budget was not the failure to reduce expenditure but rather to seek to reduce <Col N="1756" /> deficits by increasing taxation and by cutting capital expenditure as opposed to current expenditure.  He said:</P>
    <P>Outside the capital budget, too little of the adjustment has taken place through actual reductions in expenditure. This may seem a harsh judgment given the limited time at the new Minister's disposal.  It is important, however, that while reduced borrowing is a necessary condition for growth, it is not, of itself, a sufficient condition for economic expansion. Growth occurs when new businesses are encouraged to do new things.  They will not be so encouraged at existing tax rates.</P>
    <P>In many respects that is the kernel of the problem we face.  This has been accentuated by what happened.  Much hardship is created without anything positive happening. It is difficult to be enthusiastic about any such proposal.</P>
    <P>A week has passed since the budget.  It is very disturbing to find that the influence on interest rates which is supposed to be the real target has been minimum and negligible.  There has been a very minor decrease in the gilt yield of about 0.1 per cent and about 0.25 per cent on the one month and three month rates in the money market which is of no real value. That is very disappointing.  While one welcomes the significant decrease in the target for public sector and Exchequer borowing this year, it will not have a worthwhile influence on interest rates unless the Minister is prepared to announce now &mdash; he should do so in his reply to the budget debate &mdash; the Government's target for the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the public sector borrowing requirement for 1988 as well as for 1987.  He should also express the Government's determination to stick to that figure as well as, hopefully, sticking to the figure for 1987.  That would have a significant influence because, without those cuts in interest rates, very little will be achieved by the exercise which has been engaged in this year.</P>
    <P>Dr. Brendan Walsh in his assessment of the budget in <i>The Irish Times</i> last <Col N="1757" /> week, in talking about the additional reduction of £170 million in the Exchequer borrowing requirement, said that that was made up by increases in taxation of £50 million, reductions in current spending of £40 million and of £77 million in capital spending.  He said that the current spending cut was too low and that that is where the saving should have come from rather than from the two areas in which it was predominantly achieved. He feels that the ability of the Government to cut current spending is critical to achieving an interest rate reduction.  This is possibly why that has not been achieved. He pointed out that tax moieties and capital cuts have been the approach of the recent Coalition Government over a period of more than four years, which were not the answer then and are not likely to be the answer now.</P>
    <P>As far as the growth rate of 2.5 per cent is concerned, which we were told was the target which would be achieved by a Fianna Fáil Government, I remember remarking during the course of the general election campaign that they might as well have talked about a growth rate of 5 per cent or even 7 per cent because it bore no relation to reality.  It is not realised that there has been no growth here since 1981; our GNP in real terms in 1987 is the same as it was in 1981.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see the comment of another economist, Dr. Honohan, on the budget that if its targets are achieved, a decline is as likely as growth in GNP this year.  He went on to develop a point that the last budget in which there was a significant reduction in borrowing targets in 1983 led to a significant decline in GNP in real terms in that year.  My recollection is that the decline in that year was 3.5 per cent.  I fervently hope we will not face something like that now although it is on the cards, as Dr. Honohan pointed out, that we will have a decline in GNP this year instead of growth.  These targets plucked out of the air are meaningless because nothing has been done in regard to taxation and, therefore, nothing will happen regarding employment.  The <Col N="1758" /> movement on interest rates will be too slow and too low.</P>
    <P>The Government made great play of their effort to cut cross-Border trade as if it were some kind of improper anomaly in our economy.  They regard it as a problem and a distortion.  However, we should look at the underlying reasons for this. Our indirect taxes amount to 17 per cent of GNP but in Europe as a whole indirect taxes &mdash; which are high in many countries &mdash; amount to 11 per cent of GNP.  Britain is one of the average countries in Europe in this regard.  That is the distortion, not just duty free shopping.  Our taxes and prices are so high that people inevitably, as citizens of the European Community, are exercising their right to move around within the Community and also to move goods from one State to another.  Indeed, it is the Government's objective to make this right total, without any restrictions, by 1992.  The measure which they have introduced runs contrary to that as these are not duty free goods which are being brought in at a ridiculously low price. Everything bought in Northern Ireland is bought with duty paid to the British Exchequer.  The trade concerned is not a distortion; it is a perfectly normal internal Community set of transactions.  The tax concerned is the anomaly and the distortion and, not alone has nothing been done to relieve that anomaly or distortion, it has been increased this year.</P>
    <P>There must be a beginning in any situation and we must accept that &mdash; I have spent some time commenting on some of the anomalous details which frequently arise due to sheer bad judgement and lack of competence &mdash; this budget may well have begun the long road, not towards fiscal rectitude because it does no do that, but at least to the first steps away from financial lunacy in which we have lived for some time.  For that, at least, we should be grateful.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been labelled as monetarist, a party of the right, with a narrow objective and, allegedly, without a sense of social justice. However, we have never been referred to as a party whose publicly advocated policies are wrong for the economy or <Col N="1759" /> the people.  We said at our inaugural meetings of the party in the early part of last year that we were setting out to break the vice that has paralysed the effectiveness of Government over recent years.  If anyone could have foreseen a year ago what has happened in this House over the last few weeks they would have to agree that we have not now been unsuccessful.  If we cast our minds back to the atmosphere of a year ago, it would have seemed impossible that the attitudes now taken by the three major parties could have been achieved because it was a very long way from what was happening in Government and in Opposition.</P>
    <P>We set before the electorate what we diagnosed as the major causes of the national problem and illustrated in detail what should and could be done to begin the road to recovery.  Well over 200,000 of the electorate supported our views. Last autumn we targeted public sector borrowing and taxation as the two fields for urgent action.  At that time the Fine Gael end of what was then the Coalition camel said, &ldquo;No, they are our policies; we have not been able to do anything about them for four years but they are still our policies&rdquo;.  The Labour Party end of the Coalition camel said, &ldquo;No, you cannot reduce taxation.  You must not reduce the waste that causes the spending to grow and grow like weeds strangling the worth-while crop: you must let us go on and on putting more fertiliser on the weeds so that we can strangle any useful growth that may occur&rdquo;.  The Labour Party subsequently disengaged themselves from that situation and the Fine Gael Party announced later that they would have wished to have done things differently during the past four years and perhaps if they got some opportunity in the future they might do so.</P>

      <P>When the Progressive Democrats set out their policies for reduction in public sector borrowing we knew this would be an essential step in <Col N="1760" /> achieving a lower level of interest rates. Such a reduction, as well as saving the taxpayers' money &mdash; the State being the largest borrower &mdash; would begin to create the environment necessary for new investment with its potential for job creation. It would also help to reduce the cost of capital and borrowing for already established businesses.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland cannot begin a realistic recovery if we do not see the contradiction in Government policies which, on the one hand, spends many hundreds of millions of pounds annually in giving incentives for the establishment of new industry while, on the other hand, those policies through waste and mismanagement financed by high taxation and borrowing create the very ingredients which affect the competitiveness and profitability of businesses already established. The policies of successive Governments have created an environment which has closed down existing industry at a faster rate measured in job terms than new industries have been able to absorb the displaced workers, should it have been found possible for such workers to be retrained.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, I see this budget slowing down the pace towards financial lunacy.  I would like to draw the Government's attention to a few other contradictions which exist in the system, the correction of which might aid competitiveness and re-establish confidence. The Taoiseach this morning called for such suggestions.  I have two that I think are of some importance which I put forward in the expectation that they will be fully examined and the necessary action taken in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the contradiction which exists in the key markets which influence rates for money which are controlled by and answerable to the Minister for Finance. The Government broker has been selling Government stocks on a reducing yield basis to a level which is now about 11 per cent.  The resulting proceeds of these sales have been recirculated into the short term money market at rates that are now close to 14 per cent.  The Minister for <Col N="1761" /> Finance should be aware that for most commercial borrowers the average of the Dublin interbank rates over a period of time is the yardstick by which commercial borrowing rates are calculated.  The quicker these two rates for money on the one hand and for gilt edged stocks on the other hand are pushed more closely together the better it will be for all other borrowers.  There is no point in creating conditions, as exist at present, which artificially reduce the yield on Government medium and long term debt by moppingup funds in the money market, pushing up the indicators which set the rates for a substantial amount of private sector borrowing.  There is only so much money in the market at any given time, and the State with its facilities for short term external borrowing must ensure that its loan management policies assist liquidity rather than hinder it and lower current interest rates for everyone, particularly for the employment-creating borrowers.</P>
    <P>We read and hear much about the environment for investment growth and the importance of confidence and certainty as an aid to the creation of a suitable environment.  We are bound to ask what sort of image do we project abroad when we allow national and international commentators to joke about a so-called £1,500 million &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; that has mysteriously appeared in our statistics.  It is no help to our international image to have this matter buried in a mist of conjecture and mystery.  It fosters suspicion and creates discord internally.  Many people in Ireland believe that some favoured and exclusive group of individuals have somehow or other pushed £1,500 million out of the country which, of course, is not the case.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government of the day to provide an answer to this so-called mystery.  There are accurate figures &mdash; I presume they are accurate &mdash; on exports and imports.  We have a regime of strict exchange controls over the movement of funds out of the country. Even the stories about cases of Irish notes going over the Border must be quantifiable because any Irish currency notes are unlikely to be circulating in any <Col N="1762" /> other country for any length of time and must find their way, through traceable banking channels, back into the country. I urge that the necessary clarifications be made so that this blot on our national credibility is removed as quickly as possible. A significant part of this anomaly will be found to be attributable to trade-related payments, as well as to the repatriation of profits, apparently or allegedly generated by the Irish-based subsidiaries of foreign owned companies. I use the phrase &ldquo;apparently or allegedly&rdquo; because much of these profits tend to arise as a result of inter-company or internal group transfer pricing.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the subject of what is called leading and lagging and its effects on the competitiveness and profitability of Irish industry and, in particular, the aspects that are bound up with banking practice in Ireland.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that in addition to interest charges and facility charges, practically every section of banking activity is now being used to levy charges on borrowers.  Even the legal costs incurred by the banks in formalising their own conditions for lending in many cases are passed directly on to the borrower.  The security demands being made by the banks in respect of their customers' requirements for foreign exchange cover is acting as a very serious deterrent to manufacturers and traders taking advantage of the forward foreign exchange markets.</P>
    <P>For years I have been advocating the need for our financial institutions to adapt to the needs of Ireland as a trader.  One of the predominant reasons why Ireland is not a major or significant international trader is that it does not have the underlying banking facilities to enable it or its people to carry out that function.  I introduced legislation in 1978 to permit bankers to provide their Irish customers with the type of guarantees that foreign exports and contractors could easily obtain which fulfil the requirements of overseas customers for tender bonds and performance bonds.  I have been advocating the need for exporters to use the foreign exchange markets so as to ensure <Col N="1763" /> that the value of exports and the costs of imports were fixed in Irish pound terms, thus eliminating completely any risks associated with trade in foreign currencies for those who wanted to concentrate on their basic business of trade in goods which they understood and could control and who did not wish to concentrate on gambling in currencies.</P>
    <P>The Irish exchange control authority, which is the Central Bank, has very strict requirements regarding authorisations for such forward dealings.  There must be documentary evidence to support the forward exchange cover being requested. The commercial banks who are authorised to provide this facility to their customers have, however, taken it on themselves in many instances, notwithstanding these exchange control requirements and the necessity to see that they are complied with, to delcare that that is not sufficient.  They choose to determine or to assume that an exchange risk applies and they quantify that as a 10 per cent charge for cover against this assumed risk in connection with transactions with EMS countries and a 20 per cent risk on transactions with countries outside the EMS.  I do not think it is widely realised that both of these percentages are applied to the full value of sales or purchases.</P>
    <P>These banking impositions are a major deterrent on the willingness or ability of enterprising traders covering exchange risks and have to be provided for the normal working capital that is required for everyday purposes at a very substantial cost to the companies concerned. The Minister for Finance should investigate this matter urgently because the amount of uncovered foreign currency exposure which exists in the ordinary trading activities of many worthwhile and enterprising businesses creates an inbuilt inclination for leading and lagging caused in some cases by potential losses and in other cases by traders taking advantage of favourable trends in foreign receivables which have arisen usually by accident rather than by design.  In either event the result is an unexplained <Col N="1764" /> element in our national financial statistics and goes a long way towards explaining the extraordinary anomaly that our official figures are not able to take account of.  If the certainty of the trade is strong enough to conform with exchange control requirements, why should the commercial banks view it as a matter of such uncertainty as to require cover of 10 per cent or 20 per cent of turnover as is the case at present?  Why is it that Irish banks should require this sort of cover when banks in other countries seem to have much less expensive requirements in this regard giving enormous advantage to the competitors of many of our firms?</P>
    <P>The ability of the banking system in any given country at any given time to respond to the needs of manufacturers and traders in that country is essential to their overall success and to the welfare of the country as a whole.  Let us take, for example, the Scottish engineering industry in the 19th century.  They became world famous and world leaders but they would never have done so simply as engineers.  Parallel with their development at that time the banking system in Scotland developed to cover their activities in a precise way which reflected their needs.  As opposed to the Scots, the English became great traders in the Far East, the West Indies and elsewhere because the city of London and the banking institutions in London, Bristol, Liverpool and elsewhere in the 18th and 19th centuries were able to adapt to the needs of those who were engaged in that trade at that time.  Without the assistance of the banks at that time, that could not have happened and the growth that one saw over a long period in the British economy would not have happened and the empire building which went on would not have happened.</P>
    <P>Let us compare that with the lack of compatibility that exists in this country today between our banking system and our manufacturers and traders or, more accurately, our would be traders because we have so few traders in an international sense.  If the controls of low interest foreign currency soft loans, which have been provided from the EC through the ACC <Col N="1765" /> in one instance at one time and in part through the ICC at another time but now administered through the commercial banks, were channelled through some of the State banks or through the Central Bank it might avoid many of the difficulties that the commercial banks in their activities are creating for traders at present.  That may seem a drastic thing to say but if we are left with no option and if many of those who are struggling very much against the odds in our economy today are left with no option, that is something which will have to be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>If our economic recovery is to be based on our success in exporting to other markets, we must ensure that our financial institutions have the will and the flexibility to facilitate such trade.  If they are unwilling or unable to do so, it should be the responsibility of the Government to see that they respond properly or the Government should provide other channels which can provide the service.  This morning the Taoiseach asked for specific suggestions on how our situation can be improved rather than making facile passing political comments of the day.  I have made some serious and constructive suggestions.  Only the Government can implement them and only the Government can give them the necessary examination. I hope they are not going to be cast aside simply because they are different or new because the extraordinary conservatism which exists in this country will strangle us in these areas as it has in so many others if we are not prepared to shake it off and not prepared to say we do not accept that simply because something has been happening this way for 50 years or 60 years it must continue to happen and we have to live with it.</P>
    <P>Our banks should be there and should see themselves as being there to serve those who are engaged in economic activity and not to strangle those who are engaged in such activity.  This is not an area where legislation is needed.  Some hard talking is all that is needed.  It is necessary to recognise the realities and to talk to the banks in a no nonsense <Col N="1766" /> manner about how they approach them. The other matter is equally important.  It is an extraordinary distortion that the liquidity of the interbank money markets should be so much higher than the yield on gilts today.  It is seriously damaging economic activity within the country.  The Government have a duty to increase the liquidity of those markets and to bring them down towards the gilt yield level. If they do so and show that they are determined to do so &mdash; one of the ways they can show they are determined to do it is by announcing now the proposed deficit for 1988 &mdash; they will have an impact on interest rates.</P>
    <P>One of the great disappointments of this budget, apart from its failure to deal with the real economy as opposed to the Exchequer and apart from its failure to deal with taxation levels and with the change of unnecessary ownership from the State to other investors of many assets and companies of the State, has been its lack of influence on interest rates. That is crucial and the ideas I have put forward today can be very helpful if they are properly assessed and if the necessary steps are taken to implement them. Legislation is not required; all that is required is determination.</P>
    <P>We have seen flashes of determination during the past week or so and we have seen flashes also of the very opposite to determination.  We have got to wait and see and I hope these changes of mind which were imposed on the Government by their own misjudgments and foolish mistakes in drawing up the budget are not going to be a feature of the scene during the next year.  The first faltering steps in the right direction have been taken.  If they are continued they will have every encouragement from this party and this party, apart from their electoral achievements, have the satisfaction of knowing that without talking as we did a year ago we would not have heard the kind of things we have heard in this House during the past week.</P>
    <P>We welcome the much greater realism which now exists and we want to encourage it.  We want to maintain it and, where appropriate, we want to intensify it.  We <Col N="1767" /> want to expand it and, in particular we want to see it expanded away from a concentration on the Exchequer into the kind of areas I have been talking about laterally today which will have a profound affect on the real economy, on employment and investment.  In the last resort, these are the things that matter.  The Government are there only to facilitate within reason those who would take those steps.  Unhappily, those who would take those steps do not get encouragement from this budget.  If some of the different approaches that were made were undertaken they would get such encouragement and I ask the Minister, and his Department, to give full consideration to what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley seems to have a somewhat coloured view of the course of economic debate here over the past four years and of the influences there have been on that debate.  He reminds me of nothing more than a man who was accustomed to playing gaelic football with a particular team for a period of years, has a falling out with the captain, goes to join another club but rushes back to the clubhouse after a match clutching an oval ball and saying, &ldquo;look, I will change the whole nature of this game&rdquo;. That seems to be a part of a claim Deputy O'Malley is making today.  I do not wish that to refer to the substance of what is in the ball he is carrying.  That, of course, is a different matter.</P>
      <P>We had this morning a very zealous sermon delivered by the Taoiseach with all the zeal of the newly converted but, of course, it is not the first time we have heard that doctrine expounded.  There was another occasion when the Taoiseach made points very much in a similar vein and I should like to recall some of the words he used on that occasion.  For example, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a community we are living away beyond our means.  I do not mean that everyone in the community is living too well.  Clearly many are not and have barely enough to get by.  But taking us <Col N="1768" /> all together, we have been living at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We will have to cut down on Government spending.  The Government are taking far too much by way of taxes from individual members of the community. But even this amount is not enough to meet its commitments.  We will just have to re-organise Government spending so that we only undertake the things which we can afford.</P>
    <P>He said more in that vein and added:</P>
    <P>In our present economic situation, it is madness to think that we can keep on looking for money for less work or to think that if we have sufficient economic muscle, there is no limit to what we can extract from the community. I want everyone to know and understand this simple fact and with that understanding to form his or her own personal attitude as to what he or she should be entitled to.</P>
    <P>It was not today nor even last week that the Taoiseach made those statements.  I was quoting from a little booklet which gave us the text of a broadcast by the Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, TD, on Radio Telefís Éireann on 9 January 1980.  They were the words of a newly elected party leader, a new Taoiseach, who appeared to be determined then to seize the economy by what he has recently termed, the scruff of the neck and to rectify the excesses of the previous two and a half years.  The promise was great but, the delivery, I have to say, was pitiful.</P>
    <P>Despite what was generally regarded as a perceptive and accurate analysis of the situation facing the country, the then Fianna Fáil Government failed between January 1980 and June 1981 to address the problem properly.  Their failure to do so at that time was all the more blameworthy because they had then a 20 seat majority in this House.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government of 1981-82 <Col N="1769" /> began to tackle the problem vigorously, and, in fact, initiated many of the measures which proved their effectiveness from December 1982 up to last March, and on which indeed the present Government are still relying, to stop the runaway gallop of public expenditure and give some hope of a stabilisation, if not a reduction, of the tax burden.  The measures taken by the 1981-82 Coalition Government were strenuously opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition. When they came back into Government in March 1982, the Fianna Fáil Party paid lip service to the need to redress the financial position and substituted for the coalition budget proposals of that year a device which appeared in the short term to solve the problem but which has created even greater problems in the longer term.  I refer, of course, to the imposition of VAT at the point of entry.  That device allowed the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 to avoid necessary reductions in expenditure by means of a strategem, the effects of which ironically were not felt until that Government were about to go out of office in November 1982.  Let us remember that it was not until the first payment day after the September-October VAT period in 1982 that employers, manufacturers and those involved in the service industry began to realise just what VAT at the point of entry meant to them. At that moment the Government who had sought to save themselves by that strategem were on their way out.</P>
    <P>During the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 the financial situation, which the previous Coalition had begun to rectify, quickly got out of control again.  There is no point in the Taoiseach now claiming that public expenditure was kept under control during that period of office.  That claim simply ignores the fact that the revenue forecast on which the projected level of expenditure was founded quickly revealed itself to be excessively optimistic and the Government found themselves in mid-summer, just three months after the budget, having to attempt major reductions in expenditure.  When we look at it in that perspective it gives a different <Col N="1770" /> picture from the one the Taoiseach attempted to convey during the course of his remarks this morning.  That Government in relation to public finances were an abject failure and the only good thing about them was the brevity of their lifespan.</P>
    <P>From December 1982 up to March 1987 Fianna Fáil in Opposition opposed every step the Government took to redirect and to control both current and capital expenditure.  They opposed every measure designed to get better value for the expenditure of both the taxpayers' money and borrowed money.  They opposed every step to redirect expenditure so that the cause of equity and justice would be better served in the deployment of public resources.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell at any length on the rhetoric of those years, littered as they were with terms like, book-keeping, monetarist, Thatcherite, uncaring, insensitive and so many more.  Measures taken during that period of office now being rightly promoted by the Government, were described as mean, petty, harsh or savage, depending on the particular spokesman in question.  Opposition spokesmen of the day &mdash; I remember in particular the Opposition spokesman on Finance &mdash; waxed eloquently about what they saw as the lack of signposts, indicators, signals and so on.  What they were saying was that they did not like the kind of measures we were putting forward and that they opposed them.</P>
    <P>The Government during that period did not allow themselves to be deflected from the economic and budgetary measures they believed were necessary.  They certainly would not allow themselves to be deflected by empty rhetoric.  That Government kept to the course they had mapped out and brought about substantial improvements not only in relation to the level of spending but also in relation to the manner in which expenditure programmes, both capital and current, are planned and carried out.  Many improvements were made in the structure of administration over that period and if the present Government have the wit to do so, which I sincerely hope they have, <Col N="1771" /> they can benefit substantially from these improvements.</P>
    <P>But there has been a massive waste in the years since January 1980.  Over those seven years there has been a massive and unforgiveable waste of time and energy in the process of really bringing home to the people the nature and extent of our problems.  There has been a scandalous waste of energy on the part of those on the opposite side of the House who, over that period, have obstructed or slowed down the emergence of the real consensus on the course we must take, both in relation to the definition of our problems and in the specification of the steps that must be taken in order to effect a remedy.</P>
    <P>Every Government must operate in the climate of the day.  To be succesful a Government must bring the people with them.  From December 1982 to March 1987, the Government found there were limits to how far they could bring the people, limits which resulted in very large part from the fact that the then Opposition were, wittingly or unwittingly, peddling a sham message of false hope by pretending that there was another and magic way when such a way did not exist. I say wittingly or unwittingly because I am convinced that a great many of those on the back benches of Fianna Fáil simply did not understand the nature of the problem.  They were the unwitting ones. I am equally convinced that during those years there must have been some on the front benchers of Fianna Fáil who at least had the beginnings of an understanding of the problem but who nevertheless persisted in playing the short-term political game of opposition.</P>
    <P>The tragic result of all this has been that the adjustment of our economy has been unnecessarily and unjustifiably delayed.  As a result, many people who had jobs are now unemployed.  Many people who sought jobs have been unable to get them.  In a very real sense the prevarication led by the Opposition over that period has given rise to unemployment, social degradation and unnecessary suffering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> In the first paragraph of the financial statement last week the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>There have been too many failures, too many missed opportunities and a prevailing lack of confidence in our ability to achieve progress.</P>
    <P>In a later part of this speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>There is an air of despondency that is unwarranted.  We have problems but it is well within our ability to correct them.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the fact that so many people have suffered from the delay in economic adjustment occasioned by the ambivalent attitude of Fianna Fáil in Opposition, we might perhaps savour the fine irony of a Fianna Fáil Minister making statements of that kind.  Which, of all the parties in this House, have spent the past four and a half years emphasising the black side of the picture?  Which, of all the parties in this House, have spent the last four years not just resisting the action needed to correct our problems but also attempting to peddle illusory formulae which did nothing more than divert attention from the real solutions?  Which party used up lengthy hours of debate in this House proposing self-financing tax cuts and characterising any attempt to get value for public money as parsimony or lack of imagination?  Which party now are clinging properly but desperately to those very concepts they rejected over four years in order to be able to steer a course along the path on which there is an emerging consensus?</P>
    <P>It now appears that just over seven years after the present Taoiseach's first exposition of the problem as Taoiseach and just over five and a half years after the first Coalition measures of July 1981, the parties constituting almost 90 per cent of the membership of this House have reached a broad consensus on what the main thrust of economic and budgetary policy should be.  Looking at the record of those years there can be no doubt in anybody's mind as to who has been to <Col N="1773" /> the forefront in bringing about that consensus. It has been brought about by determined application by the Fine Gael Party both in Government and in Opposition. We should look at that consensus and ask what it really means.  It is a matter of immense importance to us at this stage to examine that consensus, to examine its content and its limits, if there are limits to it, in terms of the fundamental principles stated by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement as follows:</P>
    <P>Public finance targets must be consistent with good management of the economy,</P>
    <P>there must be a special focus on productive economic activity and employment, and ...</P>
    <P>borrowing and the cost of servicing the national debt must be progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>This year the Government aim to keep the current deficit to 6.9 per cent of GNP and the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 10.7 per cent of GNP.  On the basis of those principles and those targets, Fine Gael do not oppose this budget.  Public finance targets must be consistent with good management of the economy.  We can all agree on that. Between 1977 and 1981 we saw very clearly how laxity in relation to public finance targets gives rise to extremely bad management of the economy.  In particular, a cavalier approach to financial targets leads inexorably to a situation in which the income of future years is progressively mortgaged more and more heavily.  It is because of this mortgaging of income we find today that the resources we produce, while sufficient in themselves to support levels of activity and service that we would find acceptable, are not all available for these purposes. Interest and repayments take a huge bite out of our current resources and seriously curtail our ability to deal constructively with today's problems and to plan for the future.  It is only by reducing that lien on our current resources that we can regain the ability to use those resources to maximise employment and <Col N="1774" /> welfare and to use our credit standing constructively to provide for the future.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's concern, and I hope it is shared in the House, about the current deficit and borrowing levels springs directly from our desire to see more investment, more job creation and more freedom for the citizen to use his or her income in the way that best matches his or her requirement.  The refusal by the Fianna Fáil Party over many years to take these concerns seriously comes directly from the arrogant and patronising belief that they know better than the people. There are other elements in this consensus also, one of which concerns taxation. In making his Financial Statement, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>Personal taxation is at an all time high and is a serious deterrent to our development.  There must be reform in order to remove barriers to economic activity and to make the system demonstrably fairer.  There must also be radical improvements in tax collection.</P>
    <P>I agree with all of those sentiments and I welcome the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government now espouse them. We would all have been greatly assisted if the Fianna Fáil Party had shown the same zeal about the improvement of tax collection when we were debating the 1983 Finance Bill in this House and other Finance Bills which have come before us in the meantime.  In 1983, improvements in tax collection procedures were regarded by the then Opposition as being repressive.  It is interesting to note that there is not one single reference in this year's Financial Statement to the series of useful reforms in both direct and indirect taxation carried out in the years between 1981 and 1986.  I wonder whether this Government have either the enthusiasm or the imagination to tackle these matters, but having said that, I must say also that perhaps we are fortunate that the Government have not allowed their imagination to run too far away with them in relation to tax policy this year. Some of the more imaginative measures <Col N="1775" /> seem to have set a course for disaster. There can be no doubt that the imaginative imposition of a 35 per cent withholding tax on professional fees will have more of fantasy about it than reality. The treatment of mortgage interest relief shows the same dull lack of sensitivity that has, through successive Fianna Fáil Governments, given us inequities in both taxation and expenditure.  There is no evidence here of the careful targeting which should be the hallmark of fiscal measures which have a social dimension.</P>
    <P>References in this year's Financial Statement to tax reform are perfunctory and have every appearance of being there just to take the bare look away from things.  There is no evidence, either, in relation to direct or indirect taxation, of any continuation of the close review of the system which led the last Government, over four years, to bring about a number of useful improvements in the structures of direct and indirect taxation here.</P>
    <P>Let the Government not plead that it produced this budget after only three weeks in office.  This is not an obstacle, since I know perfectly well that a whole series of small but useful improvements which are all well documented can be produced at the drop of a hat by the Department of Finance.  They have all been well analysed.  All they need is a decision, a choice.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already the one overt reference to tax reform in this year's Financial Statement.  What else has been said on this matter?  The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement said:</P>
    <P>In the short term, it is not possible to reduce taxes.  The Government will, however, give early consideration to major changes, as soon as the budgetary position allows.</P>
    <P>He continues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>First of all I have to say that, because of the difficult budget situation, it is not possible on this occasion to provide for reductions in income tax.  A choice has had to be made between reducing <Col N="1776" /> borrowing and reducing income tax and the more responsible course for all concerned at this time is to lower the borrowing figure.</P>
    <P>That last reference is the only place in the Budget Statement where we find even a suggestion of the inevitable and unbreakable link between expenditure and taxation.  I believe that we should spend a great deal of time examining that link.  We do not have a taxation problem so much as an expenditure problem.  If expenditure here were at a level which allowed all of our income tax rates to be five points lower and all our personal allowances to be 50 per cent higher, there would be fewer arguments about alleged anomalies or disincentives in our tax system and I am convinced there would be a much more ready acceptance of the basic principle of equity that is involved in a progressive income tax structure.  I think we should attempt, and the Government should try, to direct more and more public attention to the link between expenditure and taxation.  It is there that we really have the debate about where equity lies both in expenditure and in taxation.  It is there that we can focus public attention on the part that each one of us, whatever our income levels, must play as members of the community to protect the weak and foster development for the future.  If we discuss taxation policy without referring to that whole area, we are simply deluding ourselves. This all points to doing away with the basic cause of high taxation, namely, high expenditure.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody in the House, &mdash; and there are none of the four here at present &mdash; be tempted to claim that there is another way of finding the resources to reduce taxation by collecting the allegedly outstanding sums due, usually claimed to be in the region of £600 million but varying depending on the speaker and the audience, notwithstanding the careful and comprehensive explanations furnished down the years in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners and by Ministers for Finance in this House, let me say immediately that that <Col N="1777" /> approach is both a snare and a delusion. I have frequently pointed out both inside and outside the House that those amounts are very largely estimated amounts.  There is a constant inflow of amounts which are finally due and payable and a constant addition of new estimates being made.  It is of course the case that if we found suddenly the magic key and all taxes were instantly collected when due, we would not have a figure for outstanding estimates and assessments. Equally, the extra amounts that would be collected would not be anything like the order of £600 million.  This argument and this figure are just two more reasons which are seized upon by those who do not like to face the expenditure problem for avoiding the issue.  I would ask those people if they really believe that if we had the magic key and we could unlock that box we could actually go out and collect £600 million at one fell swoop with complete justification and without causing also major disruption and unemployment in our economy.  The answer is clearly no.  Those who affect not to know that or who choose to ignore it are simple misleading the people.  I think the simple message is that the expectation from the development of tax collection procedures, which I support, has been grossly overstated.  Let me say also that I have more than a question-mark in my mind as to the reality of the £10 million which the Taoiseach expects 25 former Department of the Public Service officials to lead, stimulate and encourage the staff of the Revenue Commissioners to collect. I think the Minister for Finance might have been as well off not to make any allowance for such a figure in his budget.  While £10 million at the end of a long session of budget discussions can resolve a few difficulties.  I think it is there more to show the good intention rather than an expectation of an inflow of revenue.</P>
    <P>The central plank of the Government's economic strategy in so far as it can be divined from this year's Budget Statement, is to act in a way that brings down interest rates.  We have seen that message delivered publicly and with some energy <Col N="1778" /> and gusto over the past few days by members of the Government.  It was very curious and even a little painful to watch the Minister for Energy last Sunday night repeating again and again: &ldquo;We want to get down interest rates.&rdquo;  He had almost got to the point where if somebody said &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to him he would say; &ldquo;We have to bring down interest rates.&rdquo;  That appeared to be the central plank of economic policy, and it is an objective which is without any doubt totally deserving of our support.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we will support any measures the Government take that will have the effect of bringing down interest rates.  Expenditure and borrowing are the key factors in this connection. I support the Government in their intentions and efforts but I must point out that, in order to be credible in this connection, budgetary, fiscal and economic policy must be firm and consistent. We cannot afford ill-considered actions which turn out to be mistaken and have to be changed.  Neither can we afford ill-considered measures which turn out not to have the intended effect.  In that connection measures taken by the Government in relation to housing grants where we had a subsequent change, in relation to inpatient hospital charges where there must be a change, and in relation to the withholding tax on professional fees where I am convinced the Government will find quickly that the objective will not be reached, are not at all helpful in creating or maintaining the climate needed to bring down interest rates.</P>
    <P>A great many areas in the budget deserve comment but I want to make one final remark about the Government's reliance on reducing interest rates.  As I have said, I support fully the intention of the Government in that regard and I will support fully any action the Government take to bring it about, but I am not at all sure that it is wise of the Government to put all their eggs &mdash; God knows they are few enough &mdash; into this basket, which is a fairly flimsy basket, at the moment. However, having said that, I want to make it clear once again that we will <Col N="1779" /> support the Government in the kind of action they will take.</P>
    <P>I turn to the remarks made this morning by the Taoiseach.  For his benefit let me repeat what I said before he came in, that we had had a sermon from him this morning which was delivered with exemplary zeal, the zeal of the recent convert.  We have heard it before, and I almost put the Dublin end on that one too.  We heard it before in 1980 and the intervening period did not seem to show results.  We had statements from the Taoiseach in his address this morning of the following kind:</P>
    <P>We made no expenditure promises or commitments in the campaign which would inhibit us in Government from taking the action needed to restore the public finances.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is true in the strict sense of the word, but I do not think it was quite the intention.  What we can say is that during the last election campaign the Taoiseach and his colleagues made no commitment whatever to bring about reductions in expenditure.  The Taoiseach went on to say in relation to expenditure:</P>
    <P>I ... stated that the estimates for every area of public expenditure would be examined rigorously and in detail &ldquo;and reduced to the irreducible minimum.&rdquo; We have carried out that work, and the level of Government expenditure, which was 56.2 per cent of GNP last year, will now be reduced to 55 per cent of GNP in 1987 as a result of the budget, the start of a process we are determined to continue.</P>
    <P>I remind the Taoiseach and the House &mdash; I hope in a way which will simply underline the benign revolution that has taken place on the benches opposite &mdash; that the Taoiseach also spoke first during that campaign about keeping expenditure at its real 1986 levels.  When he did not like that he said: &ldquo;No, we meant keeping it at its real 1986 levels in relation to GNP.&rdquo;  Today I am glad to say the Taoiseach is saying that, quite apart from keeping expenditure anywhere near real <Col N="1780" /> 1986 levels, he has reduced it from 56.2 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 55 per cent of GNP in 1987.  We should consider that matter for the record in the light of what was said some time ago.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said later in his speech:</P>
    <P>In 1986 alone £1.5 billion was taken out of this economy with devastating results on investment and interest rates.</P>
    <P>Further on again he said:</P>
    <P>The astonishing fact about that outflow of funds is that there has been no precise information about its composition or cause.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a similar comment during his Budget Statement. That contrasts remarkably with the kind of statement the Taoiseach and his colleagues were making up to a couple of weeks ago.  At one stage they seemed to ascribe all of that to deposit interest retention tax.  At another stage Deputy O'Kennedy, Minister for Agriculture, ascribed it to the fact that we had not enough signposts or signals.  At other stages they ascribed it to the fact that there was not great confidence in investment in this country.  Now in Government they find that there is no precise information about its composition or cause.  The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>On taking up office, we instigated an investigation of the nature and cause of the leakage which is, of course, a new phenomenon in our economy.</P>
    <P>I wonder what Deputies opposite must feel when they listen to that.  Of course, what the Taoiseach says here is quite right, but it is not the first time it has been said.  It has been said repeatedly over the past two years but, of course, there is nothing like having your nose right against the grindstone for concentrating the mind.  Perhaps now we will have a clearer vision of the forces that are at work in our economy.  I suspect when the report of this investigation into this new phenomenon becomes available, the Taoiseach and his Ministers will conclude that some of us on this side of the <Col N="1781" /> House were quite right to point out to them that outflows of that kind are an inevitable, essential part of the deals which the Irish Government make with multinational firms who come to set up here, who want profit centres here to contribute to their overall operations, multinationals, indeed, the Taoiseach and his colleagues take great credit for having attracted in here in the first place. All credit to them if that is what they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should try to distance himself from it.  We have seen another area where the Taoiseach has come round to reality, and I welcome that awakening.  Maybe spring coming on has brought a new budding of spirits that we can only welcome.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the situation following the proposed abolition of the farm tax.  He said the Government had ensured that there would be no loss to the Exchequer this year because the reduction of £9 million in the amount of tax which would have been received from farmers will be offset by a reduction in the VAT rate provided.  As I said on the night of the Budget Statement, I consider that a most ill-considered measure.  The whole logic of the tax is that no part of it should fall on production.  There is absolutely no reason for the Government, because they had a brainstorm about farm tax and moved away from that current basis of taxation, to interfere with the structure of value added tax in this stupid, mischievous and totally unnecessary way.  The Taoiseach made a few other claims in relation to growth.  I am glad for the Taoiseach's sake that he has found a professional commentator who is forecasting a 1.75 per cent growth this year. I hope he is right but one learns to have a certain degree of scepticism about some of the commentators.  In his speech the Taoiseach said and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reach the objective of a 2.5 per <Col N="1782" /> cent growth rate we need to secure an additional output of goods and services of £250 million net of imports in our economy.  The elimination of the total £300 million we are now losing in shopping expeditions cross-Border and cross-channel would by itself alone, after deduction of the normal leakage in imports bring us up to our target.</P>
    <P>I do not know who produced that particular gem for the Taoiseach.  I recommend strongly that the Taoiseach go back to whoever produced that and get him to rethink it.  What is the basis of the figure of £300 million that we are allegedly losing?  That figure, on a quick reckoning, is equal to 1.8 per cent of GNP.  Are we now in a position where we can pin that down and say, with certainty, that 1.8 per cent of GNP is spent on shopping expeditions cross-border and cross-channel. I should like to know the basis for that assumption and indeed I would like to see the evidence for it.  The extraordinary part of it is that the figure, on the basis of the figures worked out here, of £250 million is equal to the difference between 1 per cent growth rate in GNP and a 2½ per cent growth rate.  I note that the Taoiseach is not building in the extra bonus of 0.75 per cent which he has got from some unidentified commentator.  To treat the dynamics of economic growth in this manner and to put forward this simple arithmetic as an illustration of what would actually happen throughout the economy from the change he is talking about here, displays to me a very worrying credulity, a credulity which I hope will not be carried through, during the lifetime and activities of this Government.</P>
    <P>In his speech, too, the Taoiseach referred to the importance Fianna Fáil have always attached to the construction industry.  I did not hear any cheers or applause from the Government benches when the Taoiseach made that announcement and expressed all the concern he has, not just for the construction industry but for the people who have been affected by the measures the Government have <Col N="1783" /> taken.  I should like to say to the Taoiseach, and I hope he will not mind my giving him some advice &mdash; I have been on the other end of that stick also &mdash; that he will have a great deal of difficulty arising from the fact that in the past four years he has been one of those, and he has many compadres, on the benches over there who have done the same thing, who have deliberately encouraged the myth that if you want to expand the Irish economy you pump money into the building industry.  He is now finding that he has to implement policies which are based on reality.  As the economy expands demand for the products of the construction sector expands also.  You must have growth before you can develop stimulated secondary growth in a sector that is there to provide the infrastructure for a continuing process of growth but which does not lead that process.  This is one area where the Taoiseach will find himself in some discomfort having cultivated and propagated that kind of myth during the past four years and there are others, too.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the last comments made by the Taoiseach when he said he was saddened to see strident newspaper headlines about the wary opening shots, threats, boycotts and so on.  He asked, &ldquo;On whom is it proposed to wage war&rdquo; and went on to say that the answer is, of course, the Irish people.  I agree with the Taoiseach on that.  There is one point we should establish clearly in this House and which all of us should adhere to and it is this: when this House, on the basis of proposals brought in here by the Government, makes decisions and even where the House divides before making decisions we must accept those decisions whether we like them or not because they are the decisions democratically arrived at by the Government and the legislature.  I will not give any encouragement to people, wherever they may be, who say: &ldquo;We will not give effect to those decisions&rdquo;.  The process of developing the consensus are far too important for any of us to play those kinds of games.  I do not intend to do that nor do I intend to provoke interest <Col N="1784" /> groups, or to steer interest groups, on a course that encourages them to refuse to accept the democratic decisions of this House.</P>
    <P>However, I will discuss with my colleagues in the House and with those outside who have a legitimate interest to put forward any issue on which we believe the Government are making unwise proposals and we will bring the wisdom we gathered from our own resources to bear on the futher development of the Government's budgetary policy as it will be manifested during the course of the Finance Bill and of other measures which come through.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I hope I have made it clear to the Taoiseach that we are not opposing the general thrust of this budget.  We believe it is on the right lines. Unfortunately it has come to the point where we have a consensus much too late for a great many Irish people.  I am glad that we in the Fine Gael Party have brought about that consensus and we will build on that now for the good of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the two previous speakers on their extraordinary creative interpretation of history. I compliment, in particular, Deputy Dukes on his closing comments.  I hope his comments have been heard and taken note of by the other members of his party. I understand the tradition in this House was that the Government side spoke after the Opposition side.  I note that there were two Opposition speakers called in your absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point worth bearing in mind when discussing this budget, or any other budget, is that what Governments give, Governments must first have taken away. When the Ministers took up office on 10 March they were, in most cases, the inheritors not just of empty cupboards and empty departments, but of large stacks of IOUs.  In the Department which was unfortunate enough to have been under the stewardship of Deputy Boland, not only was the cupboard bare but the contents of the Minister's Office and anything else in the Department that was <Col N="1785" /> movable seemed to have been pledged to the pawnbrokers.</P>
    <P>Each and every Member of the 25th Dáil is all too familiar with the perilous state of the nation's finances as passed to the incoming Government by the outgoing regime.  While this nation may now be impoverished in economic terms, from listening to other speakers it is clear that the native genius to conjure up myths is alive and well and flourishing in this House.  That genius has already been well illustrated here in responses.</P>

      <P>It would appear from the Minister's answer that he may soon have to consider making changes to the <Col N="1786" /> order.  Can he give an assurance that no change will be made to the order until such time as he has had an unequivocal response to the effect that the organisations listed under the order will renounce violence and give their committed support to the democratic process? Can he assure us that until such time as he gets that commitment from them he will make no change in the order and will not allow them access to the State broadcasting services, RTE radio or television, either live or recorded?</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility of this and any Government of the State is the security of the State and of its citizens.  It was with that in mind that the initial order was made.  This position has been confirmed as being a duty on a Government by the Supreme Court in an appeal to that court against a section 31 order a number of years back.  The case that has been made and at which I am looking before reporting to Government, both by the NUJ and the RTE authorities whom I have met, is that technology has by-passed the order in the manner in which it was originally introduced because of the large portion, up to 70 per cent, of the population who are now in a position to receive the BBC and ITV channels.  There is a further anomaly in that it is an RTE subsidiary which is, in actual fact, bringing to Irish homes these BBC and ITV programmes.  In my meeting with the RTE authorities I have told them it is not sufficient to write to me or to my predecessors to ask that section 31 be abolished.  I want to know, if section 31 were abolished or amended, what guidelines they would operate under because of their specific responsibility. They have a specific responsibility under section 18 of the enabling legislation which set them up and I would ask them to let me have a look at the guidelines under which they would operate if a change were made.  I am not saying a change will be made, but when I have a file on the up-to-date position I intend to bring it to the Government to discuss it with them, at which stage I shall make my position known to the authorities.</P>

There is a motion down from myself and other Worker's Party Deputies seeking to have the order annulled.  There has not been any debate since 1976 and we see an urgent need for such a debate. Will he also indicate in any review that he will consider the position of elected representatives and trade unionists who are excluded under this section, from television screens and from radio because of their political affiliation, even from discussing trade union and local authority matters?</P>

      <P>The question of a debate in the House is, of course, a matter for the Whips.  I shall bring to the attention of the Government Whip the request made by the Deputy.  As far as the review is concerned, anomalies such as the position of local authority members not being allowed to be interviewed even in relation to ditches, drains, lights or other issues and the situation of trade union leaders or officials also being barred are two of the points which have been brought to my attention by those who want an amendment of the present section 31.  They are matters which will be taken into account and consideration in the file which I intend to present to Government.  There is one point I want to emphasise, that in whatever decisions are arrived at the whole question of the security of the State must be the primary objective.  For example, we could not allow a situation ever to occur of interviews taking place which would permit these paramilitaries and terrorists to justify atrocities in the North at any time.</P>

It is irrelevant to argue that other stations can be received here or that people who might be trade unionists or might want to talk about the local drains should be allowed on the media. If they are members of an organisation which formally advocates murder as a policy the national airwaves should be banned to them.  Full stop.</P>

That will always be a prime responsibility with this Government.  I have indicated that to the House and to those who have come, as is their democratic right, to meet a Minister.

To say that the members of the RTE Authority &mdash; a body of people selected in the main by the administration of which the Deputy was a member &mdash; would in any way try to justify murder is really beneath &mdash; I will not go on any further.  All I can say is that this Government will be guided by the principles of the protection of the security of the State.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on <Col N="1791" /> Quota/Tender Sales Systems for disposal of State-owned Timber.  The report, which was published in 1984, was approved by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the tender and quota systems.  I have, however, already introduced further systems of sale, as recommended by the interdepartmental committee.  These include auctions, three-year contracts for sawlog and, on a pilot basis, an extension to the quota scheme to cover small sawlog as well as large sawlog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the present system does not lend itself to stability within the timber trade and warrants revision?  Would the Minister consider offering timber at a standard rate, at a fixed price, rather than on the present tender basis?  Furthermore, would he say what his Government are prepared to do to combat the very unfair advantages for Northern Ireland operators in the South bearing in mind that they are subsidised to a much greater extent than are our operators in the South?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no problem in relation to a tendering system had we sufficient supplies of sawlog.  What we are talking about here, if you like, is a ration.  I realise that it is contentious but the justification for it is that the sawmilling capacity exceeds fairly considerably the amount of sawlog available and the tendering system must obtain in that context.  With regard to the Deputy's question as to standard prices, I am sure he will accept that timber for sale has to be subjected to the normal market forces. In relation to the third part of the Deputy's question, I should say that the problems the sawmilling industry has experienced by virtue of sales to the northern part of the country have presented difficulties.  My Department have endeavoured to limit such sales to a fairly consistent percentage, ranging at present at approximately 9 per cent, but there are problems with regard to EC regulations.  The previous Government <Col N="1792" /> had this matter examined by a special committee.  It is one that is difficult to resolve.</P>

      <P>As I have already explained, if there were sufficient quantities of sawlog available throughout the country we would not run into this kind of difficulty.

Exploration here is still at a relatively early stage and the major sedimentary basins are only partially explored.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say as yet whether any or all of the discoveries made so far will ultimately lead to commercial developments.  One of the wells which will shortly be spudded is in fact an appraisal well to the 1983 discovery.  It will be of crucial significance.  If successful, this well could bring forward the day of our first oil development.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice that statements in relation to the results of wells are in all cases issued by the operator.  In accordance with specific provisions of all offshore petroleum exploration or prospective licences issued by my Department, the holders are required to furnish all information arising from their exploration activities.  This information is strictly confidential however and I do not propose to depart from normal practice by adding to any statements already made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no proposals before me at present for the development of any discovery. With regard to those wells which have produced encouraging results in the past my policy is to ensure that further exploration is stimulated and carried out with the ultimate aim of a successful discovery followed by development with the <Col N="1797" /> maximum possible speed.  However the timescale for a commercial development would in the first instance, depend on when the discoveries are made and proved up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 13, 14, 17 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I propose to increase State planting in 1987 by 1,000 hectares to 8,000 hectares. This together with the expected private sector planting of 3,000 hectares will give a national planting figure of 11,000 hectares &mdash; a target never previously achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government see forestry as an area which offers considerable scope for expansion and employment, both direct and indirect and to enable it to achieve this it is my intention to promote the <Col N="1799" /> establishment of a commercial structure outside of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I am at present examining various options in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reduction in the number of forestry workers, the running down of forest wildlife nurseries, the underutilisation of forest and wildlife machinery and the general decline in the motivation of staff at all levels, could make it impossible to meet what the Minister has set as the target of 8,000 hectares per annum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me in my Department is that this target is achievable, that the morale of the staff is not as the Deputy indicated and that far from looking on any difficulties that might arise, we will approach it in a very positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that we have the lowest area under forestry in Europe and that it is necessary to increase substantially our planting rate so that we can meet our needs in the future?  Would the Minister agree also that a couple of thousand jobs could be created in felling and land preparation tomorrow and will he state whether the policy of planting 10,000 hectares of new forests per year will be reaffirmed and implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in reaffirming that the target for this year will be the highest ever approached.  In relation to the employment question, there has been a fairly considerable increase in recent times particularly in the number of temporary workers taken on by the Department in order to enhance the possibility that that target will be reached.  In relation to the question of the overall organisation of that, we will be bringing forward proposals very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite surprised and alarmed to hear the Minister say that <Col N="1800" /> morale is high among forestry workers. Surely the Minister is aware that in certain areas a lot of valuable research which has been done to date is now going to waste because of under staffing in the numbers of foresters and forestry workers and because the financial restrictions are such that not even the travelling necessary to ensure the development of the forestry can be undertaken.  Is the Minister in a position to assure the House that the programme he has underlined today can be carried out given the number of staff, or to say if there will be a requirement for additional staff in the forestry area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that over 200 temporary workers have been taken on this year to ensure this target is met.  I am not saying there are not some difficulties in relation to manpower in certain sectors, but one of the reasons the Government decided to concur with the Coalition Government in relation to the sale of immature forests was to bring in additional finance to push ahead with these particular schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that he proposes to set up a commercial body to promote forestry such as that recommended in the review body report, but I seek his assurance that he is disposed to give whatever body, commercial agency, or commission are set up a degree of flexibility and commercial freedom to do their work properly. Taking into consideration the abysmally low acreage of 6 per cent is he prepared to put a definite timescale on this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need have no fears.  The new organisation will have flexibility and independence to function in a way which will benefit this industry for the future and he has my assurance that the Government will do what is necessary to ensure that this is so.  It will obviously take some months to tailor the legislation and bring it to both Houses, but some of the decisions may have to be <Col N="1801" /> taken in advance of that legislation to accelerate the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased the Minister accepted the necessity for our forests to be run on a commercial basis but, instead of setting up a new body, would he not consider utilising an existing semi-State structure, such as Bord na Móna who are expert in running our bogs, and our forestry industry could be run along the same lines?  Would the Minister seriously consider having the powers of Bord na Móna extended and the necessary legislation brought in to have Bord na Móna and forestry run jointly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that I am not a recent convert to the need for developing a forestry programme.  As regards the linkage with Bord na Móna, as I said in my reply, all the options are being considered.  It is interesting that Deputy Enright's colleague, Deputy Higgins, referred to an independent body and maybe when there is agreement on the opposite benches we can talk more about this.</P>

The availability of land and the fact that the Department should concentrate on land where the soil is more suitable for the production of trees rather than some of the land we have planted up to now means that from time to time the spread of work is scattered somewhat.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15, 20, 25, 37 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have considered the Cremer and Warner report and I can assure the Deputies that the most urgent and comprehensive measures are being taken in response to the recommendations contained in it.  The Government have accepted the recommendations and have taken the following measures.</P>
      <P>The Government have appointed a task force under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment.  Its report is to be completed within three months.  The members of the task force are: Mr. T. McMahon, McCarthy &amp; Partners, Consulting Engineers, who will act as chairman; Dr. T. McManus, Chief Technical Adviser, Department of Energy; Mr. E. O'Connor, Assistant Chief Engineering Adviser, Department of the Environment; Mr. B. Tuohy, Fire Adviser, Department of the Environment; Mr. S. Dunleavy, Head of Construction Services, IIRS; Mr. J.F. Guth, Chief Engineer, Sofregaz, France; Mr. J. Lang, President of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland; Mr. M. Collins, President of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Cremer and Warner have agreed to act as advisers to the task force.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference given to the task force are as recommended in the Cremer and Warner report:</P>
      <P>(a)Identifying potentially vulnerable buildings and situations.</P>
      <P>(b)Preparing guidance on priorities, having regard, to the vulnerability of the structure to an explosion, the condition of the gas services, the type and frequency of occupancy, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)Providing technical guidance on the implementation of practical <Col N="1810" /> remedial measures &mdash; in minimising the opportunities for an explosion and, therefore, reducing the chances of progressive collapse.</P>
    <P>(d)Identifying all relevant codes and standards that need to be reviewed and updated to incorporate the lessons learnt.</P>
    <P>(e)Informing all relevant parties of the findings and advice.</P>
    <P>Action is being taken to involve the local authorities and the gas utilities in identifying buildings which may be susceptible to progressive collapse.  The owners of these buildings will receive advice from the local authority on suitable remedial measures.  Local gas companies are being instructed to undertake comprehensive leak surveys and to report their findings to the task force.  The Minister for the Environment will reintroduce the Building Control Bill as a matter of urgency in order to give statutory effect to the building regulations.</P>
    <P>I am also examining as a matter of urgency the nature and composition of an agency, and the means by which it might be established, which would be responsible for the investigation of major accidents and public safety matters generally.</P>
    <P>There are 29 recommendations addressed to Dublin Gas.  These matters have been discussed with Dublin Gas company management and I have been assured that they will be implemented.  This will be carefully monitored.</P>
    <P>The report also contains recommendations in regard to the future of Dublin Gas, recommendations specific to the developer of Ballsbridge court and recommendations specific to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The obligations of the privately owned gas utilities for the safety of their installations are provided for in the Gasworks Clauses Act, 1847.  Under section 24 of the Act, gas undertakings are responsible at law for the proper maintenance of their pipework.  The Minister for Energy has no statutory responsibility in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> As recommended in the Cremer and Warner report, and as agreed by the Government, all local gas companies are to undertake comprehensive leak surveys and are to report the results to the task force within two months.</P>
    <P>There are no public agencies to which gas utilities report incidents of gas leakages. I will also be considering whether further legislative action may be required in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out, however, that substantial work has been done by the Gas Technical Standards Committee on the drafting of Irish standards and codes of practice for products and processes used in the gas industry.  A wide portfolio of standards and codes have been produced by the committee in the areas of gas transmission, distribution and installation. Outstanding draft standards and codes of practice dealing with the natural gas industry will be completed during 1987 and 1988.  The standards and codes of practice are being produced having particular regard to safety.  BGE have assured me that town gas utilities for which they are responsible will adhere to the relevant standards and codes of practice in their operations.</P>
    <P>The Cremer and Warner report points out that Dublin Gas management had accepted inferior practices over many years.  The receiver had recognised this and progress was being made on these matters prior to the Raglan House incident. Progress continues to be made but there is still room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The receiver has introduced new equipment and new work methods into the Dublin Gas company and substantial re-equipping of the repair crews has taken place.  A survey of apartment blocks and offices is substantially complete and a programme for the renewal of small bore cast iron pipes is under way.  An interim report of a study of the network is expected shortly which will lay out a programme for the systematic renewal where necessary of the mains system.</P>
    <P>Receivership in Dublin Gas is an interim position.  In order to set a firm <Col N="1812" /> course for the future, and to put stability and continuity into Dublin Gas it is my intention to bring this situation to a conclusion as soon as possible with BGE taking control.  It is my requirement that BGE give the highest priority to the safe, secure and effective operation of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the establishment of a permanent central agency which he says will be responsible for investigating major accidents is wrongly focused?  Prevention is needed rather than investigating the debris after accidents.  How can the Minister be satisfied with the situation where there are no public records of leaks occurring? It points to the need for an agency within a new legislative framework which would independently supervise the operation of these gas companies.  What system does the Minister envisage for the implementation and policing of the recommendations of the task force in regard to remedies in multi-storey buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Cremer and Warner recommended that there should be a central agency responsible for the investigation of major accidents and public safety matters generally and the Government accepted that proposal.  Experience over the years has shown that there is a need for such an agency to examine the causes of disasters.  This was the case in relation to the <i>Betelgeuse</i>, the Stardust and the explosions at Raglan House and Dolphin House.  There have been various incidents where different <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements were made for their investigation and Cremer and Warner suggested to the Government that a central agency should be in place to carry out an investigation immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, the emphasis should be on prevention and that is why the Government accepted the recommendations of Cremer and Warner in relation to matters affecting the Government, set up the task force and gave them terms of reference. In regard to public records, as distinct from Gas Company records, the legal <Col N="1813" /> position is that, under the 1847 Act, gas companies are responsible for keeping them.  I assure the Deputy that all steps will be taken to ensure that the recommendations of the task force in relation to the suitability of buildings for the use of gas will be implemented.  The owners may have to take remedial measures in the case of some buildings which are unsafe.  All these matters will be followed up in detail by the relevent Government Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the task force report?  Will no action be taken until their report is received?  I am concerned about the safety of the Dublin Gas system.  Is the Minister aware that only 26 miles out of 2,400 miles of gas piping have been replaced?  Is he also aware that there are over 1,000 holes in the streets of Dublin which have been dug by Dublin Gas?  Are these only <i>ad hoc</i> responses to leaks or have they a definite plan for replacement of the decrepit, corroded, outdated pipe system of Dublin Gas in order to make it safe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force were appointed last Friday and they will begin work immediately as their first meeting will take place next week.  They will report within three months.  The gas utilities are to report to them within two months so that the report of the task force can be fully effective.  There were 29 recommendations in relation to the Gas Company and they are being implemented at present.  Some of them were taken on board in advance of the report, including improvements in Gas Company activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the safety of Dublin Gas, Cremer and Warner examined the question of whether conversion to natural gas was the cause of the explosions in Raglan House and Dolphin House but it was made quite clear that it had no involvement in the incidents.  There have been problems in relation to safety in Dublin Gas.  They are at present in receivership and the Government at their first Cabinet meeting made the decision that it was not in the public interest for <Col N="1814" /> the receivership to continue.  They gave instructions to Bord Gáis Éireann to complete their bid for the take over of Dublin Gas because we gave it the highest priority in view of the dangers to citizens.  There is great potential for natural gas in Dublin for residential and industrial purposes.  We want to see it on a safe, sound footing and properly managed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered most of the questions I would have raised.  Do the Government intend to legalise the draft building regulations of 1976 which would have a bearing on all new buildings?  He has explained that certain measures have been taken to ensure that progressive collapse will not happen as far as existing buildings are concerned but will the design aspects of new buildings have the force of law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my original reply, the Minister for the Environment is, as a matter of priority, reintroducing the building regulations Bill which fell when the last Dáil was dissolved.  We have accepted the Cremer and Warner report in relation to this matter and it will be reintroduced as quickly as possible by the Minister for the Environment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that experience has shown that in practice the pressures of day to day management in gas companies has resulted in safety standards falling and does this not indicate a need for an agency such as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to take over the task of overseeing the safety conduct of <Col N="1815" /> the gas companies generally in regard to leaks and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards committee I referred to and who are drafting Irish standards and codes of practice are under the chairmanship of the IIRS.  It will be the responsibility of gas utilities generally to operate those standards as laid down by this committee.  My Department also have an involvement with the committee.  For this reason I do not see the need for a further plethora of agencies. Proper management of the Dublin Gas Company and of the other gas utilities would be far more desirable.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with Dublin Gas is that it was a political football for the last number of years while ideological rows took place within a previous administration as to whether it should be left within the private sector or nationalised. While these rows went on within the previous administration the management and control within the company deteriorated to such a stage that a receiver had to be appointed eventually.  This Government have come to grips with the situation and Bord Gáis have completed their bid, in accordance with our direction. We want to see the Dublin Gas Company put on a sound footing with particular emphasis on the highest priority of the safe, secure and effective operation of this company.  I am sure that this will happen when the company are put on a proper management structure as opposed to being in receivership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not admit in the course of his reply that there are no records of gas leaks which occur under the various gas companies serving the public?  Surely the standards committee cannot adequately monitor the activities of gas companies if such records are not furnished to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of safety installations, under section 24 of the Gaswork Clauses Act, 1847, gas undertakings are responsible at law for <Col N="1816" /> the safety of their installations.  The Minister for Energy has no statutory responsibility: the law simply provides for penalties for damages caused by defects in installations.  Case law indicates that gas companies are bound to keep up such reasonable inspections of their mains and pipes as would enable them to detect when there is such an escape of gas by fracture or imperfection of pipes as may lead to an explosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This law did not prevent the accident in question happening. Does the Minister not recognise the need for a body such as the IIRS to have the power to independently record progress being made by the gas companies in putting safety standards into practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate tragedy at Raglan House and the incident of Dolphin House occurred for reasons which have been spelt out in the Cremer and Warner report.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Cremer and Warner organisation for the detailed and unbiased way in which they investigated and reported on these incidents. They made specific recommendations to the Government, to the developers, to the corporation and to the gas company as to the measures which should be put in place to ensure that so far as was humanly possible such incidents would never occur in future.  The Government responded to that report more speedily than has been the case of any other report I know of to have come before Government.  We have acted on their recommendations and we will have to wait to see what happens as a result of these actions.</P>
      <P>We have taken also the initiative with regard to putting Dublin Gas on a proper management footing.  The Government acted speedily in relation to this compared with the foot dragging which was carried on by the previous administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Two electricity price reductions were implemented during 1986.  These were based on favourable fuel prices and exchange rate movements, growth in electricity demand and other savings, and on reasonable assumptions on developments in these areas in 1987.  I am, of course, anxious to continue the downward movement of Irish electricity prices, and my Department and the ESB will keep all relevant factors under review, so that any scope for further reduction can be availed of immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the collection of rates, the £16 million which the ESB owed to the previous Government and which we succeeded in securing for the taxpayers was already taken into account in the pricing submission made to the previous administration with regard to price policy.  Therefore, this £16 million will have no effect whatsoever.  It was already taken into account in the sums in calculating the price that is at present in effect for the ESB.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of comparable prices between Ireland and the EC, following the reductions over the last 15 months the average EC price for industrial consumers across the range of consumer size and power usage levels range from 89 per cent to 98 per cent of the Irish price.</P>

      <P>Is it in order that the Minister should be in a position to furnish this material to Deputy Bruton by way <Col N="1818" /> of answer to a supplementary question when I was told by the Ceann Comhairle that the Minister had advised him that such figures were not his responsibility, that he would not furnish them because they were the responsibility of the Electricity Supply Board?  In those circumstances is it in order for the Minister to embarrass the Chair, by putting as his first line of defence, that this was not his responsibility when it was within his capacity to give this information to me. On ordinary grounds of good manners and courtesy, not alone from the point of view of embarrassing the Chair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I have written to the UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Peter Walker MP. I have sought an immediate end to reprocessing and closure of the plant as soon as possible.  The Government are convinced that this approach is the only effective solution to the radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the Irish sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also drawn his attention to the resolution to close Sellafield unanimously passed by the Dáil on 3 December 1986. I have also indicated that the safety audit <Col N="1820" /> of the UK Health and Safety Executive on the Sellafield reprocessing plant is disturbing and reflects a lack of confidence in the plant even by the experts.  I said that, although British Nuclear Fuels have been given a year to put matters in order, the Irish Government felt that the activities at Sellafield could not be restored to a safe standard.</P>
    <P>I also expressed to Mr. Walker the Government's serious concern about the implications of the UK Government's decision to proceed with construction of the Sizewell B reactor as it seemed that Sir Frank Layfield's report did not fully pursue all safety aspects or take account of the Chernobyl accident.  I also expressed concern about the longer term implications of this decision as a step towards a programme involving the possible location of further nuclear power stations much closer to our territory.</P>
    <P>Finally, I expressed concern about the old magnox reactors which lack secondary containments and which might not meet the best modern safety standards. I indicated that the Government had a responsibility to the Irish people to seek to minimise the risk of their exposure to the hazards of nuclear accidents. I requested that these old magnox reactors should be phased out.</P>
    <P>I indicated that I would welcome discussions with Mr. Walker on these issues and I am awaiting a reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, can the Minister tell us what are the prospects he foresees of closure within a reasonable period and for how much longer must we endure the type of accident record we have experienced from this plant?  What steps has the Minister taken to contact the Scandinavians? In recent newspaper reports he was quoted as saying he was contacting them in order to involve them in this campaign to close Sellafield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that this menace on our doorstep should be closed as soon as possible.  I have written a letter to the Secretary of State in the strong terms I have outlined to the House and I am awaiting a reply. <Col N="1821" /> I look forward to discussing this subject with the Secretary of State at the first available opportunity.  As far as the Scandinavian involvement is concerned, I am in contact with the ambassadors of the countries involved with a view to setting up a series of meetings with the appropriate Ministers on that issue.</P>

      <P>Dr. McNamara, who was a native of Clare, was Archbishop of Dublin for over two years and had been Bishop of Kerry for the previous eight years.  As Archbishop of the largest diocese in Ireland, Dr. McNamara had a particularly onerous task which he performed with great courage and fortitude notwithstanding his ill health in recent years.</P>

    <P>He was dedicated to upholding traditional Catholic values and his sincerity of purpose won him universal respect in Ireland and abroad.  His sense of duty and dedication to his flock whether in <Col N="1883" /> Kerry or Dublin was greatly respected and appreciated.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in the name of Dáil Éireann, to convey to the Papal Nuncio, His Excellency, the Most Reverend Dr. Gaetano Alibrandi, to the Most Reverend Dr. Joseph A. Carroll, Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin, to the clergy and people of the Archdiocese and to Dr. McNamara's family, an expression of our profound sympathy in their great loss.</P>

More recently, he bore his illness with great fortitude and in a way that was an inspiration and a comfort to many people.

During the years he was in Kerry I knew Archbishop McNamara as <Col N="1884" /> a man of compassion and kindness.  His warm pastoral concern was well known and was one of the features which made him very popular with the members of his flock.  They, too, will mourn his passing. After his appointment as Archbishop of Dublin I had less occasion to have contact with him but on each occasion that I met him I was impressed by his courtesy and by the concern for ordinary people which he always displayed.  I know he worked in a quiet and self-effacing way to help individuals and families in distress.  All will agree that he displayed great fortitude during his painful and debilitating illness and I am sure the nation will mourn his departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today I was pointing out that Ministers when they took office on 10 March were the sad inheritors of empty cupboards.</P>
      <P>A visitor from a distant and remote planet would have been forgiven, having listened to the contributions from Labour and Fine Gael spokesmen, and most notably the Leader of the Opposition today, for believing that none of those spokesmen, or their parties, had anything to do with delivering the nation into the sad state in which we find ourselves.  As we all know, the parties opposite are not the blushing innocents they have attempted to portray.  They are as guilty as sin with regard to the difficulties of the nation.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite during the course of the debate chose to introduce an historical note.  Their contributions, and in particular the contributions of Deputies Noonan, Desmond and Dukes, took us on a grand and highly selective tour of the economic events of the nation over the past couple of years.  The dissertation of Deputy Dukes this morning focused on a special interpretation of the most recent economic history of the nation. Those contributions were careful to skirt around actuality.  The contributors did not see fit to advert to the economic destruction of the nation in which their parties had participated.  Contributors from the last Coalition were in their own way seeking to reiterate and re-establish myth as the basis of their economic analysis.</P>
      <P>The mythology about Ireland's public finances which they have sought to peddle here is the same mythology that the parties opposite have been peddling to the nation for some years.  Repetition has not improved the story's telling or improved its truthfulness.</P>
      <P>It is well, therefore, following the contribution by Deputy Dukes, to attempt to re-establish the truth because the basis of the measures which have of necessity been taken in the budget is to be found in the economic history of the country over the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties for which we are all now paying started as far back as 1973. <Col N="1886" /> Deficit budgeting then became the order of the day.  The Svengali who promoted the development, and later so successfully distanced himself and his party from all blame, is still with us although in a considerably less prominent position than heretofore.  Between 1973 and 1977 there was a major rise in the nation's indebtedness.  Foreign borrowing on a grand scale had got under way.  Between 1973 and the beginning of the current year Ireland entrusted its affairs for the majority of that period to Coalition Governments.  Throughout their periods of office the debt grew.  For only a relatively short period of the 14 years mentioned was office entrusted to Fianna Fáil.  During the 15 years in question the national debt grew by more than £20 billion.  More than 60 per cent of that borrowing was made by a small handful of Coalition Finance Ministers.  Deputy Dukes, who spoke so eloquently this morning, was one of those Ministers and it ill behoves him now to wave the mantle of fiscal rectitude in this direction.</P>
    <P>Through the life of the last Coalition all economic observers came to one conclusion, that we simply could not spend ourselves rich.  All agree on the damage being done by the level of our borrowing. In public the leaders of the last Government, including Deputy Dukes, illustrated an acute awareness of the nature of our problems.  In Government, however, Fine Gael and Labour failed to act.  They never succeeded in addressing the problems and by the time they left office earlier this year the national debt had effectively been doubled.  While accepting the analysis with regard to borrowing Deputies FitzGerald, Dukes and Bruton, with the compliance, the support and the encouragement of all in Fine Gael and Labour, borrowed at a reckless pace. They are the facts and there is little point in the Deputies opposite seeking to portray a different picture.  The evidence of their handiwork now faces us.  If debt is our problem, and nobody here or elsewhere doubts that debt and the attendant drain on the nation's limited resources is one of the primary difficulties we face, then we know where to lay the greater <Col N="1887" /> part of the blame.  Saying that the case is different does not make it so.</P>
    <P>Debt, of course, is not the only thing that grew during the course of the last Coalition's term of office.  So, too, did taxation.  This time one short year ago the Coalition planned for a tax increase which was three times as high as the level of economic growth.  The relatively modest proposals on the tax side in the budget now produce a great wringing of hands from the benches opposite.  When we think of the taxation crisis we now face it is worth reminding ourselves that the leader of the last Coalition entered the election campaign in 1981 with a specific promise to reduce personal taxation to a standard rate of 25 per cent.  When this policy was dusted off more recently by an emerging party of the far right that party, and their members, had visited on their heads the derision of all in Fine Gael.  We know what happened on the taxation side during the life of the previous Government.  Personal taxes were permitted to rise to the point where they have inhibited economic recovery and have punished initiative.  In Roosevelt's words, &ldquo;taxes are what we pay for the privilege of membership of an organised society&rdquo;.  Sadly, in our society one segment of the community has more than paid its dues.  Our taxation levels are rightly numbered among the nation's woes.  The Leader of Fine Gael cannot and must not be permitted to try, as he has tried today, to shirk his and his party's responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>A frightening national debt, a taxation system which has run riot and empty coffers were not the only problems which the Minister for Finance and the members of the new Government faced when they had to prepare the budget.  They had to face an even greater problem, the mass unemployment which has resulted from the specific failures of the Coalition to implement anything approaching an effective employment policy.  Historic levels of unemployment bring with them high social costs for society.  They bring also high economic costs for Government. Like the burgeoning national debt, <Col N="1888" /> an equally unproductive high unemployment level lays an excessive claim on the nation's limited resources.</P>
    <P>They are not the only calls on the nation's finances.  There is no shortage of calls on the demand side.  The shortages appear on the supply side.  When we, as a nation, turn to the sources of the nation's revenue we become too acutely aware that the well, having been drawn on so frequently and copiously, has long since run dry.  Every Deputy is familiar with the analysis.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the Government's response.  The fact that the Government have responded so rapidly to the crisis they inherited is commendable in itself.  More commendable still is the nature of the Government's response.  They have held the line. Although this is a difficult and hard budget, it has sought to give priority to the protection of the interests of those who are marginalised in our society.  It has sought to help those who must of necessity depend on the State.  It has sought to cushion the weaker members of society from the cruel blows which arise from the economic mismanagement of the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a hopeful disposition is not the sole qualification of a prophet.  However, examining the budget I am filled with signs of hope.  The budget which has been introduced is, indeed, a financially stringent one.  This is appropriate at this time.  The stringent measures which the budget takes are long overdue.  I would suggest that in this budget the Government have done in three weeks what Fine Gael failed to do in four and a half years.  Had these measures been taken in the past there would be less need for severity now.</P>
    <P>At the same time as being stringent, however, the budget is humane.  Some of the more anti-social measures proposed by the recently departed, not much lamented Government have been avoided and others have been diminished. Both for its economic rationality and its humanity the budget is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> As the main provisions of the budget have been well covered by other speakers, I will confine myself to remarks on issues which I feel are more important. The most important issue is the matter of public expenditure.  A long time ago Voltaire proposed that &ldquo;in general the art of Government consists of taking as much money as possible from one section of the citizens to give away to the others&rdquo;. Would that things were that simple now. Rightly the Minister for Finance identifies public expenditure as being the major issue for attention.  A secretary of the Department of Finance who has long since passed on once commented that, sadly, &ldquo;Ireland is a Republic with a republican purse, quite unable to afford either civil servants or politicians with imperial tastes&rdquo;.  The common sense of that civil servant is given political expression in the decisions taken in relation to public expenditure in this budget.  The Minister rightly says that we can no longer afford the existing levels of public service spending.  The money is simply not there to pay for these services.</P>
    <P>Reviewing this part of the budget, Deputy Barry Desmond, the great hand-wringer of the 25th Dáil, spoke at some length of the road to Damascus.  I am a new Deputy and I had not realised until I came into this Chamber that Deputy Desmond was a biblical scholar.  Deputies will, of course, recall that St. Paul was blinded and disoriented outside the city walls.  It would seem that outside Government Deputy Desmond is suffering from the same symptoms.  The glaring evidence of his own dismal failure in office has left him both blinded to reality and somewhat disoriented.  It has already been noted in this House that Deputy Desmond's reconversion to the path of convenient social concern came at the 11th hour and the 59th minute of the 24th Dáil.  In the preceding four years the same Deputy had, without any qualms, participated in the destruction of food subsidies, cuts in education, the devastation of remedial teaching and had dealt with alacrity in cuts in health expenditure as well as cuts, in real terms, in social welfare.  Whatever about the road <Col N="1890" /> to Damascus, the prospects of an electoral hanging clearly did great things for Deputy Desmond's long-slumbering social conscience.</P>
    <P>The Government in their work on this budget have conducted the most stringent paring of public expenditure programmes ever undertaken in this State. While all commentators agree that this is welcome, inevitably there will be some who will argue that the cuts affect too deeply their own areas of special interest. While there have been inevitable protests from special interest groups, the courage of the Government in their original approach to expenditure has been widely acknowledged.  This is rightly so, I would submit.</P>
    <P>In Government Fine Gael's commitment to those on social welfare was at best lukewarm.  Their compassion was really nowhere to be seen.  Deputy Dukes during his period as Minister for Finance said &mdash; I think it was in January 1983 &mdash; that social welfare recipients should accept that they could no longer expect as a right to be granted an annual increase in social welfare payments.  That Deputy's erstwhile partners in Government, the Labour Party, recently claimed that Fine Gael in Cabinet fought originally for a zero increase in social welfare this year. Whether we can accept what Labour said I really cannot say, but knowing the previous Minister for Social Welfare as we do in Wicklow, it is not difficult to give some credence at least in this matter to what that party have claimed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party argued that there should be an increase of 4 per cent in social welfare payments from July.  Like every Deputy in the House, I too would like to see the families and individuals who eke out their living on the margin being given an increase in benefit well beyond the level of inflation.  The problem is not any shortfall in goodwill.  Goodwill exists in great abundance.  The problem is a frustrating shortfall in means.</P>
    <P>There is a divergence in the Labour Party's expressed desire here while in Opposition and their most recent action while in Government.  When they were in power, they had power to put their <Col N="1891" /> wishes into effect and they did not do so. Last year a 4 per cent rise in welfare payments was given in July.  This level of increase coincided exactly with the 4 per cent rise in the inflation rate recorded in 1986.  The increases in social welfare which are being proposed now are, like those agreed last year, equal to the level of inflation.</P>
    <P>There are few in this House who would choose, if they had any choice in the matter, to live on social welfare payments. Those who must do so, without any choice in the matter, must have all of our sympathy.  That said, it is worth while putting on the record of this House that social welfare payments, at this time, compare favourably with those of our closest neighbours.  In January of this year, an old age contributory pensioner with a spouse was in receipt of £93 here, compared with £65 across the water.  In addition, old age pensioners here are entitled to benefits in kind, such as free travel, free fuel and free telephone rental which are not available to their counterparts elsewhere.  This is not to say that the levels of payment are satisfactory, nor is it to say that the levels of payment are at what we would have them were the funds available to be more generous.  The point I am making is simply that, when compared with that which pertains elsewhere, the benefits which exist here are reasonably high.</P>
    <P>A second positive step taken by the Government is the decision not to shorten the duration of entitlement for unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months as had been proposed.  The outgoing Government had proposed that the maximum duration for unemployment benefit should be reduced from 15 to 12 months starting next July.  In the budget the Government considered that this saving would have been achieved at the expense of the most vulnerable sections of the community and in recognition of that will not be implementing that proposal. This is welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another welcome improvement in the budget is in the family income supplement scheme.  This is an important <Col N="1892" /> scheme in that it provides a buffer for those marginal cases who are most injured by means-tested services.  The budget provides for increases from July in the family income supplement.  It also provides for an increase in the prescribed income limits for those qualifying for FIS, bringing them into line with increases in social welfare benefits generally.  This is a positive measure.  It will increase the maximum amount of earnings which a person may have while qualifying for FIS assistance.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister for Finance will thank me for this, but I would encourage the Minister for Social Welfare and his Department to ensure that the public are made better aware of the FIS scheme in the future than they were in the past.  The scheme is a good one.  People who are entitled to benefit under it should be made aware of its existence and of their rights.</P>
    <P>A most welcome welfare provision is the decision to extend from October next treatment benefits to the dependent spouses of insured workers.  This is a costly provision, but a worthwhile one. It will be of great benefit to women. Allied to the other positive welfare provisions made in the budget, it poses the question in my mind whether the spokes-person for the Council for the Status of Women, who reacted so sharply to the budget, was familiar with the actual detail of the budget's provision at the time that the council's reaction was recorded.</P>
    <P>The job search proposal which is introduced in this budget is also a worthwhile initiative.  As the Minister for Labour pointed out in his contribution, the scheme is designed to tackle the problems which keep people out of the active workforce for months rather than for weeks. Every Deputy in this House must be familiar with the plight of people who are unemployed, and who have, either because of the period of their unemployment, or because of a lack of personal skills, lost the capacity to argue their case for employment effectively. The scheme is a good one and every Deputy in this House should wish it well.</P>
    <P>I suppose I would be accused of being <Col N="1893" /> selective were I to deal with social welfare and not refer to the changes in pay-related benefit.  Under the provisions in the budget PRB is being reduced from two phases of reckonable earnings to a single rate.  This reduction will apply to new claimants only.  These are similar proposals to those made by the outgoing Government.  It is of course, regrettable that the modification of the PRB scheme should be forced upon us at this time by economic circumstances.  However, it is worth while pointing out that, in the light of rising unemployment, other countries have had to take more drastic steps. Indeed, in the UK the pay-related benefit scheme has effectively been wiped out. In other European countries there have been significant reductions in benefit.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding Deputies that the Government have not gone along with the proposal by the outgoing Government to reduce the duration of PRB by three months for persons on benefit.  On the contribution side there are changes too and again these arise from economic circumstances.  Again they are less harsh than was proposed by the previous Government.  Under the present budget proposals a person will now require four years' contributions instead of an increase up to five years.</P>
    <P>On the education side there are cuts and again it is regrettable that this should be the case.  However, in that regard there is one item of progress we should all welcome, and as a person involved in education I welcome the decision to overturn the action by the previous Government with regard to career guidance teachers.  The decision taken by Fine Gael Ministers in this regard was ludicrous. For a relatively trivial saving those socially conscious ladies and gentlemen were prepared to put in jeopardy the future of a whole generation of young people.  The Government's decision not to proceed with this is very welcome.</P>
    <P>On health, the charges introduced for outpatients have attracted a great deal of attention.  It is worth pointing out that this is not entirely new.  A £5 charge was introduced in 1982 and subsequently <Col N="1894" /> abolished.  The £10 charge being introduced is not a novel idea.  It is certainly not the swingeing measure it has been misrepresented as being in the press and the media generally and from the benches opposite.  The charge will not be a recurring one for subsequent visits related to the same illness.  In effect, this charge will discourage the abuse, particularly in the larger urban areas, of the outpatients' and emergency services provided by our hospitals.</P>
    <P>The £10 per day hospital charge has also been grossly misrepresented.  As the Minister has made clear, there is to be a very strict limitation on the operation of this scheme.  There will be a limit of £100 per year, for example.  In addition the VHI have been instructed to introduce a scheme whereby families will be covered for costs arising from the new charges. Clearly, it will be prudent for families who are outside the GMS to seek cover under this scheme when it comes into operation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the limitations mentioned, the impact of the charges will be further mitigated by the fact that the charges will not apply to GMS cases, maternity cases, infants under six months or hospitalisation arising from certain infectious diseases.  Further, as the Minister has made clear, traditionally no family in Ireland had been denied necessary medical treatment because of lack of money, and this will not be changed by these measures.</P>
    <P>However, there is some confusion within the population as to the system of charges being introduced.  This confusion has been fanned by Opposition speakers both in their contributions here and in broadcasts.  In the circumstances it would seem that it would be no bad thing if the Minister and his Department were to take advertising space to advise the public as to the very limited nature of the charges being introduced.</P>
    <P>The most stunning hypocrisy has been evident in the reaction in this House from the benches opposite to the decisions with regard to the house grants scheme. Nowhere has this hypocrisy been more evident than in the contribution on the <Col N="1895" /> first day of the budget debate from Deputy Noonan who, with all the charm of a spoiled child being parted from a loved toy, spoke of grand larceny by this side.  He seemed to lay claim to being the only one present with the welfare of this nation at heart.  Much of what he said in his speech was humbug.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's concern for the building and construction industry would ring that little bit more sincerely were it not for the fact that the Government of which he was a Minister had overseen the virtual decimation of that industry.  It is worth reminding ourselves that in the summer of 1982 close on 100,000 people were employed in that industry.  By April 1986, four short years later, employment in the building and construction industry was just 75,000 persons and, certainly it did not increase in the last year.</P>
    <P>Ministers in the last Government have extolled the success of the grants that have been terminated in this budget.  The question arises: success by what criteria? Deputy John Boland boasted from time to time during his occupancy of the seat in the Department of the Environment that the number of applications was one such indication of success.</P>
    <P>In the case of the home improvement grants there has been a phenomenal response to the grants scheme.  We are told that the Department of the Environment have in excess of 115,000 applications approved or on the point of approval at a total cost to the taxpayer of £230 million.  The question arises as to whether the taxpayers or the building and construction industry achieved anything like £230 million worth of value from the scheme.  Spending £200 million should produce very significant expansions in employment.  That in turn should relieve the burden of unemployment on the Exchequer, in turn relieving the burden on the taxpayer.  None of these benefits has come through.</P>
    <P>An equally clear fact is that the improvement grant scheme was poorly conceived.  No economy in the world could introduce and sustain an absolutely open ended, nondiscriminatory grant <Col N="1896" /> scheme, as all Members of this House know well.  Ministerial boasting that the quantity of applications denotes success of the scheme are about as sensible as a supermarket owner deciding to hand out prime beef free, gratis and for nothing and then boast about the increased throughput of his butchery department. Expenditure volume is not a measure of the success of any public programme.</P>
    <P>As for the improvement grant scheme it cannot be said either that the key surrender scheme or the £2,250 builder grant scheme was a success.  Both, and in particular the former, created a temporary and clearly finite jump in one part of the house building market.  However, as each key surrender meant a return of a housing unit to the local authority housing stock, depressing the need for new house building in that area, it is not clear whether taken overall the scheme will have been of any real benefit to the building and construction industry.  Of course, it cannot be denied that the schemes in question were popular but popularity itself is no proof that the schemes were good.</P>
    <P>Another major issue which has attracted a good deal of public comment is the budgetary provision with regard to public service pay.  The public service pay bill in 1987 is estimated as running in at £2,840 million.  The pay bill in the public sector is determined by two factors, on the one hand wage rates which are largely the subject of negotiations at national level, and on the other hand staff numbers. I am not one of those people who subscribe to the view that Ireland's public service serves only as a burden.  That is not true.  Our public servants have contributed much to the development of this nation and it is wise from time to time to record that fact.  That said, it cannot be denied that our public service and its cost have grown in recent years at an alarming rate.  Attempts to restrain that growth have not been successful.  The approach being adopted by the Government here is a tough one, but then this is the time for tough measures.  There will undoubtedly be murmurs from within the public service about the measures being taken. <Col N="1897" /> It is hoped that those flames that may exist will not be fanned by contributions from the far side of the House.  In this regard I welcome some of the comments that Deputy Dukes made today.</P>
    <P>The Government commitment in the Budget Statement and in subsequent statements to limiting the cost of Ireland's public service is a welcome one. Equally welcome are the direct efforts being made by Ministers and by the Government to create an unprecedented level of mobility within our public service. These measures are taking place in the context of a redistribution of ministerial responsibilities.  The mobility which the Government are attempting now to achieve within our public service is commonplace in European public services generally.  The public service must be seen as a bank of talent, not locked into immovable bureaucracies but a bank of talent that can be deployed or redeployed by the Government of the day to address the problems of the day as they see fit and appropriate.</P>
    <P>A second change brought into effect by the Government on the public service side was the amalgamation of the Departments of Finance and the Public Service. Members will recall that the separation of the personnel and organisation functions from the finance and economic functions of the Department of Finance was recommended as far back as 1969 in a report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group, the Devlin report.  The Devlin report considered at that time that the personnel functions were being overshadowed in the Department of Finance by the economic functions of that Department. The Devlin team provided a detailed and very subtle framework in which the economic functions of the Department of Finance and the personal functions could be carried out under the control of a single Minister, the Minister to be designated both as Minister for Finance and in law as Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government took power in 1973 they put through a Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act which created a new Department of the <Col N="1898" /> Public Service.  The Act departed fundamentally from the Devlin blueprint. While it was not observed at the time, the admonition made in the Devlin report that the critical issue of public service numbers, which is fundamentally a budgetary issue, should be left with the Department of Finance was ignored. That view was swept aside in the Amendment Act of 1973.  The legislation that was implemented introduced a Department of the Public Service that was responsible for numbers as well as for all personnel issues.</P>
    <P>The control of numbers in the public service became an issue for the Department of the Public Service from day one of its creation.  The Department of the Public Service created in 1973 became, as a result, inexorably a control agency rather than a creative agency which was what was initially intended.  The change in emphasis meant that the creative side of the Department of the Public Service was quickly buried in its identity as a control agency.  From its very inception, the Department of the Public Service was locked into a conflict relationship with the other Departments of State.  The Department of the Public Service, intended to become initially the motor of public service reform, became from the very day of its creation a major impediment to public service reform.  Try as its personnel did to achieve reform, they could not do so.  They could not do so because in spite of their best efforts they were viewed by their peers in other Departments as instruments of control rather than as the heralds of change.</P>
    <P>I welcome therefore the decision to realign the Departments of Finance and of the Public Service.  I welcome, in particular, the manner in which this realignment is taking place.  As outlined in the Taoiseach's contribution this morning, the Secretary for the Department of the Public Service will retain responsibility for the personnel and organisational issues within the Department of Finance. The other public service changes made by the Government are equally important and equally welcome.  I shall not <Col N="1899" /> attempt to deal with all of them here, but would mention a few for the record.</P>
    <P>In particular, the creation of the Department of the Marine is to be welcomed. All sides have recognised now that one of the greatest national assets which we have in this country is our offshore resources.  It is astonishing that we as an island nation have not identified this fact before.  Up to the time of the creation of the Department for the Marine, responsibility for marine affairs lay in up to a dozen different Departments and a dozen different agencies.  It is clear that, given that type of organisational framework and confusion, a marine industry could not really prosper.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the suggestions being made in this budget and in the statements issued accompanying the budget regarding tourism.  The additional emphasis on tourism at departmental level is very welcome. It is very clear that tourism is an area which can grow and prosper.  It is also very clear that this is an area where we can create very considerable employment in the years ahead.  I come from a county which is abundantly provided with natural resources and which would, obviously, be a haven for tourism, so I look forward, in particular, to the realignment and re-emphasis of tourism in this Department having an effect, not just on the economy of the country as a whole but on the economy of my constituency.</P>
    <P>Another issue which is related to the affairs of my constituency and which is welcomed is the creation of an Office for Forestry.  We as a nation yet again have overlooked the importance of this resource for far too long.  The job potential in the forestry area is phenomenal. As was said this morning, forestry and the industries related to forest products cannot but prosper.  We face in Europe a situation where there is and will be over the foreseeable future a shortfall on wood.  Clearly an office which is geared towards furthering the development of the forestry industry is very welcome. Forestry is not just an economic benefit but it can also be a benefit in the amenity sense.  I would hope that the new office <Col N="1900" /> will lay as much emphasis on the amenity aspect of forestry as the Forest and Wildlife Service have done so well over recent years.  In this regard I should like to mention something which is dear to all of us in Wicklow and that is the position in Coolattin.  We have seen, in the confusion that reigns in regard to the saving of Coolattin Woods, something of the problem of having too many ministries and too many agencies and not giving primacy in one agency to a particular task.</P>
    <P>Another welcome change in departmental structures is, the change which is coming about on the science and technology side.  In this regard I should like to mention to the House an initiative which was proposed some time ago by NBST and the IDA to the Coalition Government.  This is the bio-technology initiative.  It is very clear that bio-technology offers at this time the same prospect for growth as the micro-electronic industry offered a decade ago.  It is equally clear, when one looks around, that we have in Ireland the resources on which a bio-technology based economy can grow.  Sadly, the initiative which was proposed to the Coalition Government some years ago was let die for want of ministerial interest.  The creation by the new Government of an office with specific responsibility for science and technology is a very welcome move forward.</P>
    <P>When I talk about departmental structures I should like to refer to the emphasis in the budget on decentralisation.  I do not need to go on at length about this. The reality is that we possess one of the most extraordinary centralised administrations in the world.  It often seems that all virtue and knowledge reside in a very small area of inner Dublin and that for some reason or other we simply cannot adjust ourselves or cannot trust public servants based outside of the inner city area of Dublin to take decisions about the welfare of this State.  Huge costs arise from the degree of centralisation we have.  I would argue that the degree of administrative centralisation has not only affected the lives and well-being of each and every citizen <Col N="1901" /> but has helped to pervert political developments in this nation.  I see Deputy Michael Higgins smiling &mdash; he knows that to which I refer &mdash; there can be no doubt that the political treadmill of constituency work and the excessive degree of concentration on the settlement of constituents' small problems is contributed to in some considerable measure by our level of centralisation.</P>
    <P>Of course decentralisation is not just something of importance in administrative or political terms.  It has very considerable importance in economic terms.  The last Fianna Fáil administration had hoped to take some relatively modest steps with regard to decentralising part of the administration. Sadly the wisdom of the measures proposed by that Fianna Fáil administration was not seen by the incoming Coalition Government who terminated the decentralisation proposals that had been suggested. Therefore, I welcome the indications in the budget and in contributions by Ministers that a decentralisation policy will be reactivated. There is a modest amount laid aside for decentralisation in the budget.  Hopefully this constitutes the beginning of a major move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>That is the main thrust of what I have to say about the specific provisions of the budget.  Other issues have been well covered in the debate.  I would say this about the budget.  This is an appropriate time to think of our future, to pose the question to this House: what of the future of this nation?  This is not a time for wringing of hands.  This is not a time for proclaiming our misfortunes.  This is a time for us, as a nation, to take control of our destiny.  This is a time for leadership.</P>
    <P>More than ever before, leadership is what this nation needs in 1987.  The budget has shown, at least in my eyes, a very welcome assertion of leadership within Government.  The Government were faced with difficult decisions and, in only three and a half weeks in office, showed they had the leadership capacity so obviously lacking for the past couple of years.  I contend that the Government, <Col N="1902" /> in this budget, have shown not just great leadership but great courage.</P>
    <P>Any budget will have elements which are praiseworthy and others we can fault but, when one takes this budget as a whole, difficult and hard as it is, one must contend that it is the right budget for this time.  It gives me pleasure to commend it to the House and to congratulate the Ministers and, in particular, the Minister for Finance who introduced it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm páirt a ghlacadh san díospóireacht seo faoin cháinaisnéis.  Bhí sé thar a bheith suimiúil bheith ag éisteacht leis an Teachta atá díreach tar éis críochnú, an Teachta Roche.</P>
      <P>I should like to begin my remarks by taking up some of the points made in the panegyric we have just heard.  I might do so by immediately welcoming what I regard as fairly good news in this budget, the decision to bring back the guidance teachers.  I am glad to see the Minister for Education in the House.  I hope she will be able to exert her influence to an even greater degree in saving some of the other posts in the Education Vote proposed for cut and which we shall have an opportunity of debating.  I welcome the decision not to postpone such benefits as had been proposed for deferment until November.</P>
      <P>That having been said I want to take up immediately the challenge in the question posed by the previous speaker as to what kind of country we live in and what kinds of problems we face.  The thing that strikes me is the sheer unreality of the Budget Statement with which this debate began and of so many of the other speeches.  It would be tedious and boring were one not dealing with such an immense human tragedy as that with which we are dealing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, looking back over the Official Report of Budget Statements, one noted that, in good times, there was an element of mystique, the Minister for Finance being photographed arriving at Leinster House with a briefcase, whether or not he had anything in it.  Equally, in bad times, he would be photographed <Col N="1903" /> with a briefcase, when people would imagine there was bad news in the bag, or whatever.</P>
    <P>That very illusion, the suggestion that in a single day in a year, in a speech by a Minister, one's economic destiny is decided is part of the enormous exclusion in this country of ordinary people from any knowledge of the economy under which they are ground at present or within which they are forced to work or are taxed.  It is part of a complex illusory process.  I am as committed to Parliament as anybody else.  We know that part of the economic decisions are effected by the budget, many others are not and more and more, year after year, the economic decisions affecting Ireland are taken outside of Ireland altogether, as we know to our cost, a point to which I shall return.</P>
    <P>I said there is an air of unreality in the speeches and I feel I am under some obligation to justify what I have said. What people asked us during the election campaign which preceded this budget, at every single door, was: can you do anything about unemployment?  I have sat here throughout a great number of speeches on the budget.  One would imagine that we did not have an unemployment crisis in which one person in five available for work, registered, is at present unemployed; for those who want to be exact, 19.2 per cent &mdash; a scandalous, shameful statistic.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that emigration is recurring in ever rising numbers.  I want to raise some questions about this.  Why were people asking about unemployment? Why are they so worried about unemployment?  It is because they realise that, with unemployment, come stigma, poverty, deprivation and exclusion.  Is there anything in the budget for the unemployed?  Is there anything for those who fear unemployment or for people who are worried about their children who are likely to be unemployed? These are very reasonable questions one might ask.  With regard to what is in the budget I marked some phrases in the <Col N="1904" /> Minister's statement and in the Taoiseach's speech this morning.  The Minister's speech was very interesting.  It opened with what has been shrunk back to a single aspirational paragraph which I will quote:</P>
    <P>It is time to give a new sense of direction to the economy and to harness more effectively the resources that are available to us.  People are dispirited because the economy has been on a downward path.  There have been too many failures, too many missed opportunities and a prevailing lack of confidence in our ability to achieve progress.</P>
    <P>The first priority of this Government on coming into office has been to prepare a budget for 1987.  At the end of that second paragraph the Minister lists three main aims, the first being:</P>
    <P>public finance targets must be consistent with good management of the economy,</P>
    <P>In there, the cat is let out of the bag because all of the speeches are relying in one way or another on one of or a combination of four different documents recently published.  The first is a document from the Economic and Social Research Institute, <i>Employment and Unemployment Policy for Ireland</i>.  The second is the National Planning Board's proposal for a plan from 1984 to 1987. The third is an NESC document for 1983, <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i> published in November 1986 and the most quoted document in the debate so far.  The fourth document comprises the different election manifesto statements.</P>
    <P>People have been settling around the NESC document but there is an interesting difference between the first document mentioned and the third.  Despite all the criticisms I have made of the kind of economics that informs the Economic and Social Research Institute, they placed unemployment-employment as the principal economic aim that had to be addressed in the years ahead.  By the time one came to the ultra-conservative document of the National Planning <Col N="1905" /> Board, employment had faded down the list and the NESC document which has been most discussed so far puts employment at No. 4.  The fiscal imperatives were the ones that were given priority.  It is that document that is informing most of the Minister's speech.  That approach towards the economy is dull, unimaginative, derivative, jaded and failed. It is all of these things because it uses language in a way that is absolutely meaningless.</P>
    <P>I will give examples of what I mean. It arises in the Taoiseach's speech this morning where he says:</P>
    <P>Firm action in controlling Government expenditure and borrowing are vitally necessary if we are to create a general climate of initiative, enterprise and to inspire confidence in our ability to overcome our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Since I was a student, I have been influenced in listening to the notions of what I call the climatological school of economics. It runs like this &mdash; a climate for investment must be created.  The only thing we know about this theory is that it involves a transfer from high taxation mainly paid by the PAYE sector to an industrial policy with unknown results. Another formulation refers to creating an atmosphere for investment.  I have drawn an analogy between this and literature on the growing of mushrooms which argues that if one gets soil and darkens the light and throws the seed around, in time little white things begin to pop up. That is the kind of nonsense in all of these speeches.  Where is the evidence that if we manage to bring down interest rates, investment will take place?  If interest rates were to drop, and investment took place, are we to assume that it would lead to job creation?  What of the increasingly capital intensified nature of investment? The job, with which I began my speech and which was mentioned on the doorstep of every other house in Ireland, is about four levels of assumptions away, in these economics theories.</P>
    <P>We have had two or three stabs at economic policy in our history since we became independent.  We had a period of <Col N="1906" /> protectionism.  For a mixture of economic, social and cultural reasons people voted against that policy.  A million of them left the country and the country that proudly called itself a Republic was marked by the fact that people were flying out of it in their tens of thousands. There was a change in tack at the end of the fifties and sixties and we were to have export led job creation and export led growth.  It was called a policy even though nobody in the Department of Finance had yet discovered the courage to use the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; was regarded as too directive a word.  It smacked of State intervention and it offended the normative ethos of the State.  Therefore, people used the word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; until the end of the fifties and sixties.  Planning smacked of socialism and we would not want that.</P>
    <P>When the two oil crises came in the seventies and growth disappeared, we had our population massively expanded and no clear economic thinking.  The only thing we were sure about was that nobody was willing to allow State led investment to take place.  The argument was that the State could exist and be involved in some kind of atmospherics.  One could rather envisage the situation where the State had some kind of bag of manure around its neck into which it was throwing money right left and centre to different things through about 20 agencies in terms of everything from marketing, to training, to depreciation and so on, and to this rather dead thing called Irish private enterprise.  Private enterprise having shown no spark of life, the idea was that we must have industrialisation based or formed investment, irrespective of the from in which it came.</P>
    <P>Thus it was that no questions were asked as to whether the proposed establishments were labour-intensive or capital intensive, whether they had or had not linkages in the region, or whether the money would be retained in the country or exported.  It took the Telesis report to point out all of these things.  In 1982, the NESC responded to the Telesis report and still the old game goes on even after amending legislation in 1986. <Col N="1907" /> Plain people asked questions.  From where are the jobs to come?  Politicians like myself ask: &ldquo;Will we ever debate the adequacy of our industrial policy, an industrial policy that is patently failing?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret the tenor of the previous speeches.  Our problems in the economy are not ones of styles of management. That is the latest bogus rubbish, the idea that because there is a new team leader, the mushrooms will start popping ahead of their time, that the mere fact of new leadership will mean that people will start investing and creating jobs, and that there will be spirit, atmosphere and so on.  That has all the symptoms of some well known illness, all of them relating to different forms of delusion.  People ask simple things.  Who will invest?  In what, and what form will the investment take? They are entitled to see an investment strategy in the major speech made on the budget once a year.</P>
    <P>Is there anything in this document about banking policy, about credit policy, or about where the flow of funds is to come from?  There is not a single reference to the fact that not only is there an outflow of funds from the multi-nationals located here but that they are, in fact, borrowing 60 per cent of their requirements in many sectors within the Irish credit system, soaking up Irish credit and moving it out of the country.  I searched the Taoiseach's speech with interest to see what he had to say about that.  Early in his speech he told us that £1.5 billion left the country last year.  Later he told us he did not know where this money is going or what is happening to it.  He said:</P>
    <P>I have referred to the flight of capital out of the economy.  The astonishing fact about that outflow of funds is that there has been no precise information about its composition or cause.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows £1.5 billion went out of this country but he does not know where it went, why it is going or what is happening to it.  Is that not a wonderful piece of inspirational leadership in itself?</P>
    <P>I believe people looking at this budget <Col N="1908" /> will ask themselves a number of questions, for example, what does it do for employment-unemployment?  Will the budget make our society more equal or less equal in terms of the equality I speak of?  What will be the effects of taxation? Will taxation as restructured by these proposals make life more equal or less equal in terms of the equality I speak of? What will be the effects of taxation?  Will taxation as restructured by these proposals make life more equal or less equal, more equal in the sense of housing, more equal in access to the health services, more equal in access to education or more equal in terms of the removal of the stigma of unemployment and social welfare? I believe people can answer those questions for themselves but the answer is no, this budget will not make society less unequal.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the budget speech for that because I want to say &mdash; and I will continue to say this as long as I am a Member of this House &mdash; that there is no commitment in this country, or in any of the other three major political parties to the reduction of inequality in Irish society, an inequality which is reflected in the ownership of wealth.  Interestingly, none of the speakers from this side remarked on this point, but there is less tax on wealth in 1987 than there was in 1975. We have, as has been pointed out, the same income distribution as Bangladesh in terms of the bottom quintile of our population, in terms of proportions of real and disposable income, the top fifth and so forth, a society that is massively unequal.  The pattern of transfers of the State are regressive in many cases and grossly unequal in terms of access to health, education social provisions and so on, with one-fifth of the PAYE taxpayers paying £78 each per third level student while at the same time people in the unskilled category have one-sixteenth of the chance of attending third level education as a professional person.  You can pay democratically for third level education but you will not get access to the third level institution, a point to which I will return.</P>
    <P>On this question of equality the budget <Col N="1909" /> had to be phrased at a time when there was not only no commitment to equality, but when there has been, as has been repeated here year in and year out, no clear framework on social policy.</P>
    <P>We had the old Irish hypocritical attitude to welfare.  The idea was you had a welfare state in neighbouring Britain, sinful England.  The late Dr. Lucey once said when some measure was proposed that the State would soon be the father and mother of us all.  He was protecting us from the welfare state.  The Irish emigrants went for their glasses, dentures and medical tests to Britain and sometimes they came back, but we never had the courage to say, as brave people did in England, that we should have a general health service with basic standards which would be available to all sections of the population.</P>
    <P>I found it very hard to sit here and listen to the statement of Deputy Roche without getting upset.  He said that traditionally nobody in Ireland had ever been refused medical treatment because of lack of income.  Is he not aware of the difference between someone who has the money to pay for an orthopaedic operation and someone who has to wait four years, or somebody who is waiting for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board area?  I spent seven years looking at the distinctions between the private and public consumers of health care.  The Deputy mentioned special interest groups.  Parties like his, and other parties on this side of the House, feel it is very easy to wrestle with people who are poor, but it is not easy to wrestle with the professional groups who have looked after their medical interests.  It is a scandal that in a country like this there are two medical systems, private and public, two educational systems to some degree and two different levels of the legal profession with no commitment to the general principle that there should be a basic level of health, housing, care, welfare and education to which everybody would have access.</P>
    <P>Lest people think I am inventing all this I will give one example.  I was looking through the budget speech and trying to <Col N="1910" /> work out the new welfare provisions. Under this budget a child living with a widowed mother, in the view of the State costs £12.40 a week to keep.  A child living with a widowed father costs £8.65 a week to keep.  A child living with a deserted mother costs £12.40 a week to keep.  A child living with a deserted father costs £8.65 a week to keep.  A child living with an unmarried mother costs £11.25 a week to keep.  A child living with an unmarried father costs £8.65 a week to keep.  A child living with a mother while the father is in prison costs £11.25 a week to keep, while a child whose father and mother are in prison costs £8.65 a week to keep.  The Department's approach to social policy is incoherent and a thing of bits and pieces, because even in relation to single provisions, it is broken into many different bits that are a matter of confusion and are creating enormous hardship and bureaucratic delays.</P>
    <P>What about the treatment under taxation of people with child dependants? We get the same panoply of different structures.  What do those figures reveal? They show that there has been consistent opposition to having a basic income for people to meet their needs by replacing a panopoly of social welfare provisions, a conclusion, scarcely radical, which the Commission on Social Welfare came to. Will we acknowledge that children need a certain degree of maintenance or that people have the right to go to school?</P>
    <P>There is less taxation on wealth in 1987 than there was in 1975, as well as less capital taxation and reduced corporation profits tax.  As a result of all those hostilities in tackling the wealthy and tackling people who are being irresponsible in relation to capital, we slap charges on left, right and centre.  The notion that these charges are modest is a most horrific proposition in itself.  Each health board have received a communiqué from the Minister for Health about the new health charges.  There is one interesting health charge which is not mentioned in the Minister's speech but which is mentioned in item 5, page 3 of the communiqué. It says that a charge of £10 will be introduced from 1 May 1987 in respect <Col N="1911" /> of hospital out-patient attendances and referrals from general practitioners and that the Health Act, 1970, was being amended accordingly.  The part that was not in the budget speech mentioned referrals from general practitioners.  This particularly affects the aged and is an additional cost on many of those who live in outlying areas and have to pay for transport to get to hospitals and attend at clinics.  People in the medical profession tell me that the high cost of tax is in parts of the constituency I represent means that people are already breaking their appointments.  This additional charge is an added burden.</P>
    <P>I will not fault the existing administration for the inadequacy of these proposals.  It has been informed by a bankrupt thinking for a very long time.  When the State was founded &mdash; I will say this for the last time &mdash; it is well known that the British Treasury officials stayed on for a number of years.  When you look at the State papers in Britain you find they reported they were satisfied that nothing would change, that there was a high level of good conservative financial performance from the Irish Department of Finance.  I am not criticising just the Department of Finance.  I am simply saying that there was a stable of economic thinking from which all of this comes: the idea of the de-peopled economy.  There were people in other countries and a few brave exceptions in this country who argued that the economy was an instrument to be used to enhance people's welfare.  You used economic resources to create and enhance the right to work, to provide social services, to structure your society and to pay for it.</P>
    <P>What is the thinking in this type of budget speech?  It is that you will get whatever is left over.  We will allow people attend schools and we will give education in as much as we can afford it but after our fiscal imperatives have been met.  Meanwhile our fiscal imperatives have to be met.  They could be met by taxing wealth, capital and a whole series <Col N="1912" /> of neglected aspects of asset development. Every Deputy talks about our greatest national asset.  Depending on where or what day of the week they are speaking that may be our young people, or the sea or the land.  In relation to land, the 130 people who were involved in an evaluation that would have updated the old Griffith Valuation of 1859 are now under notice.  They were doing more than preparing the tax liability of people involved in land.  They were doing survey work which could have been used to get information about the neglected asset of land.  The farm tax was abolished.  It was defeated on the basis that its yield was not high in relation to the cost of its administration.  The most productive farmers, those not in the lowest group but with under 70 acres, welcomed the farm tax because they could see it was directly related to an incentive to productivity.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance to tackle the fact that we are not using land properly. Because the land is not being used properly, it is not developing all the job potentials we could get from it.  For example, sometimes less than 10 per cent of the agricultural produce exported from the different regions is in finished form.  In this way we are losing the value added that could create jobs.  Does anybody think that somebody will suddenly spring into existence and start providing all the jobs in the food industry?  We need State companies to do that and they should be used to do it.  Why not say you are going to expand a State company and employ people to put investment packages together to create jobs in some aspect of the food industry?  Instead we are creating an atmosphere in which investment decisions will be taken by somebody and that somebody will have the consequence in their actions of creating jobs.  The people who want employment in this economy deserve better.  That is not inspirational and it has no leadership potential or anything else.  It is evasive waffle the likes of which I have heard again and again.</P>
    <P>The question of the economic theory I mentioned that has this hostility to the <Col N="1913" /> State at its centre is very interesting.  It has some economic origins in terms of the structure of ownership in this country. It has others such as the particular kind of social philosophy which prevailed in the thirties, forties and fifties but there is now an increasing hostility to the State. People speak about rolling the State back from our lives.  The people in the new party, the Progressive Democrats, are not in favour of the demolition or the destruction of the State.  They want the State to stay in existence in its present form, gathering general taxation, £75 per PAYE tax-payer, and subsidising their children's education out of that money. That State is fine.  It will reproduce a class-divided society with all its status and privileges.</P>
    <P>Equally, in relation to the private sector of industry with its £1.3 billion every two years, with 20 agencies and with thousands of civil servants working for them, that State is fine too.  What State do we not want?  We do not want the State that is producing social goods. We would not want to hire extra nurses, doctors, teachers or anybody who provided care that could be consumed generally. The Progressive Democrats want a frozen version of the State that is taking money in tax from the public and giving it to them and their children.  We see more of these people, generation after generation, in the Irish Republic that will have exported most of its unskilled people and that will have kept this lot going again and again.  All the parties are the same and that is why they are not concerned about unemployment.  They are operating within categories that cannot bring an analysis to bear on our unemployment crisis.  Maybe I am a pessimist about all this but I want to ask these people where is the evidence? Where is the investment specified? Where are the activity and the jobs? Their idea is that the problem is simply a set of managerial defects.  Can they not steady themselves for even a minute and read the NESC report, No. 83, which states:</P>
    <P>Total employment declined by <Col N="1914" /> 82,000 between 1980 and 1985, that is at an average rate of over 16,000 per annum.  This sharp fall in employment coupled with an increase of 52,000 in the labour force meant that the number of persons unemployed, on a labour force basis, was 134,000 higher in 1985, at 225,000, than in 1980.</P>
    <P>The test of all our speeches is what effect they will have on the facts that are in that paragraph.  They will fall, far short of what we need in job creation.  Inevitably, then, there will be more emigration.  In that regard we are quite scandalous in our neglect of one of a new group of people who are at risk in our society, those between 16 and 18 years of age. They do not qualify for provision under the Irish Social Welfare Acts.  They do qualify in Britain.  I visited some of those people in London.  They are living on the edges of society.  They take the boat leaving overcrowded houses where parents are unemployed and where they are not wanted.  Some of them had to live rough after arriving in England.  We have not amended our legislation to plug that gap for the 16 to 18 year olds.  We pretend emigration does not exist.  People say there is a new atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Jobs continue to be lost in agriculture. Our population figures continue to produce numbers of people on the unemployment register every year.  Our industrial job creation has not been a fraction of what is required.  In its best year it was 30 per cent of the number of jobs created in that year.  We lost jobs in agriculture and in the traditional manufacturing area, indeed we have fewer people working in some manufacturing sectors than there were in 1926.</P>
    <P>We have lost jobs in a whole series of other areas, including the service sector and in this budget of joy an embargo has been placed on public service employment. A message was sent to the chief executive officers of health boards that as and from 1 May trainee nurses will have to pay for their training.  When I was a young person in County Clare people in one social class got their nursing training in England and people in another social <Col N="1915" /> class went to hospitals &mdash; charity prevents me from naming them &mdash; which were finishing schools, part of the marriage market.  The idea was that one met nice people while training in these hospitals and, of course, it worked for some people.  That is exactly what will happen now when nurses have to pay for their training.  Very few of the thousands of young, dedicated girls who wish to enter nursing will be taken on.  They will get an inadequate amount of money to help towards the cost of training.</P>
    <P>In Galway this week, I was told that there will be a freeze on employment of people in medical care generally.  One nurse and a first year probationer are looking after 27 patients in a female surgical ward on a 12-hour shift.  That is health care in the Republic which is in league one in the international league of development, which it needs in order to have its super, private health care to impress people.  I wish that Deputy Roche would visit some of the hospitals in my area and he might change his tune.</P>
    <P>It is an illusion that anybody who really needs care is ever denied it.  The Institute of Public Administration published a document entitled <i>Poverty and Social Policy</i> in 1982 compiled by Laraine Joyce and A.  McCashin.  It gathered all the statistics in equality in terms of the different indicators which I mentioned.  It examined Irish social policy and asked if we were creating more inequality or progressing.  It concluded that we were not reducing inequality in relation to housing policies, health and so on.</P>
    <P>The old notion from the fifties of the deserving poor and of those really looking for work is again fashionable.  The notion of the deserving poor is propped up by the idea that of course we should have compassion for them but nine out of ten people are not in this House to try to implement a radical restructuring of society.  They are there to practice compassion. The survey in the document to which I referred showed that 70 per cent are in favour of treating the poor compassionately but only about 12 per cent believe that differences in society are due <Col N="1916" /> to anything other than bad luck, drink, nature and things like that.  The national view of the Republic of the equals is interesting because people are now talking about categories that can be protected.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister's eulogy on the Jobsearch programme.  The only original thing about it is its title.  The Taoiseach gave the game away &mdash; God bless him, in many ways he has a charming directness at times &mdash; when he said that the idea had been tried in the United States and France.  It failed in the United States where it is regarded as a morale boost for the long term unemployed.  If you really want to help the long term unemployed a proportion of public service posts should be reserved for them, which would be practical news for anyone in that category. In the scheme, Workfare, people were interviewed, they worked for a while and were psychologically boosted only to find, after a while, that the job only lasted for a very short time and they were thrown back on the unemployment heap.  We intend to invest £11.5 million in this new safari for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Recently, in answer to a question on social welfare fraud, the Minister of State replied that the figure amounted to £1.4 million.  We intend to expend all this money in searching for the small number who defraud the Department of Social Welfare.  Of course, I will be told that it is not really about that, it is about running seminars, having little psychological groups, bringing people for interviews and motivation.</P>
    <P>Unemployment can cause psychological collapse and I commend anyone who brings in schemes to tackle the problem. It is equally true that among the one out of five who are unemployed, there are enormous numbers of people who are not short of motivation, they are simply short of any prospect of a job.  They are asking for job creation and investment which will give them some kind of hope in relation to employment.  In one country where these lookalike schemes have been tried it is estimated that unemployment figures have been reduced by 10 per cent. In Ireland, there will be an interesting <Col N="1917" /> result because there is no basic level, no floor below which you cannot fall in terms of need.  Many people supplement the 150 different kinds of allowances or benefits by partial involvement in the black economy.  There is a nice tradition of people writing to the Department every now and again and some of them, when called for interview, will head for England. It will be an emigration-producing measure.  Even if they earn some money in the black economy in England they will be able to return with it, tax free, as a result of the provisions in the budget. There is an inducement to do so.  I will watch this Jobsearch programme but I can only judge it by the previous incarnations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been trying to find out what the precise employment effects of the budget are.  It is suggested that this type of budget statement will create an atmosphere in which investment will take place and jobs will come from that.  In the meantime we are going to cut jobs in the public service, remove grants in the construction industry, enforce a pay freeze in the public sector and remove 130 people from the farm classification office.  The atmosphere for investment had better be good to make up for the jobs which are lost directly as a result of the budget.  How much time have I left to conclude?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the tax implications of the budget. In 1984, 36,000 farmers paid an average of £744 each in tax.  In the same year 90,000 people in that sector were not classified and did not pay any tax.  There were 138,000 workers in the PAYE sector in 1956.  By 1983 there were 792,000 in the PAYE net and in 1984 they paid an average of £1,875 each in tax.  An interesting fact to emerge from the 1986-87 figures was that some of the people paying tax in the agricultural sector were paying about a half to two thirds of the amount to their accountant to make sure they did not pay any more tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is because the Deputy insists that the books&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can draw his own conclusion.  Some people are being treated very favourably in relation to the tax burden &mdash; those who have been the beneficiaries of the decimation of wealth and capital taxation since 1975. <Col N="1919" /> There are other people who have not been classified and who have yet to come within the net.  I am not saying these people are not willing to pay.  However, one thing we are sure of is that the people who are caught within the net, the pay-as-you-earn workers, are paying an excessive amount at a high rate and they are carrying a disproportionate part of the yield.</P>
      <P>Looking at the budget, has tax equity been advanced one whit by this budget and has there been a restoration of capital and wealth taxes to any degree?  Of course, we could not have this in the present atmosphere because the suggestion of taxing wealth would change the atmosphere so much that all the latent entrepreneurs in Ireland would flock out of the country and never return.  They would lose their incentive to invest.</P>
      <P>If we are to take the Taoiseach's remarks seriously the only thing they are investing in at present is speculation.  At the start of his speech he knows that £1.5 billion is gone but later on in his speech he did not know where it was going or what was happening to it.  He seems to have felt that money was leaving the country and going into what is popularly called the black hole.  This speculative character of the economy is something that not only socialists refer to, but other orthodox economic commentators have referred to it also.  The Irish system of incentives is such as to promote as much a reward for speculation as it is for genuine investment and thus people looking for a simple return on capital are not automatically moving into the productive area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are left with, therefore, is another speech that purports to be about the economic management of this country, but it leaves the basic structural problem of unemployment practically untouched.  Why should a market lead recovery solve our problems between 1986 and 1990 when it has not done so in any other country in Europe, or has never <Col N="1920" /> done so in any period during which the population has expanded in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the power of prayer, or do we simply say that maybe it will happen here.  This is the logic used. What we are being asked to do by the people who elected us is to think again about the assumptions we make about the economy.  We now have to decide to be the Parliament of the people who stayed at home.  Like our predecessors we will represent only some of the people in our constituencies in future.  The people who have gone away have no representation here.  One might argue that the pattern of Irish politics has reflected that fact.  What needs to be specified is that jobs could be created in all of the areas which have been mentioned, the State companies who could lead that investment and that this would release the energy and the capacity which exist there among our educated workforce to make it all happen.  We have, curiously, a most profound ideological Dáil, a Dáil that continually says that we are all practical when, in fact, what we mean is that we will move Heaven and earth to make sure things remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all of the indicators there is an unequal society producing a slum set of conditions for the average citizen and which is now beginning to export its people again.  I often ask myself if there is any hope that people who claim to be radical and republican would say it is a basic right for people who do not want to emigrate to be able to find employment at home.  When emigration returns, society will become more unequal because there will be a narrower range of opportunities. Children will be paying more on the bus to get to school.  Universities will be decimated by further cuts in addition to the Fine Gael cut of £3 million.  There will be another cut of £1 million to the RTCs in addition to what was proposed in 1986 and a further additional cut of £100,000 in adult education.  The people who come out of third level institutions will be the sons and daughters of the professional <Col N="1921" /> classes who will stay at home to debate the joys of the society they live in &mdash; a conservative, economically enfeebled society.  This will happen because we have an ideological opposition to the planning process.</P>
    <P>At budget time it is reasonable to ask what principal economic problems has the budget addressed.  To its credit the ESRI report put employment first.  It remarked that an incomes policy cannot be confined to wage and salary earners. Whose income has been frozen and reduced in the speeches by the Minister and the Taoiseach &mdash; those who earn their incomes.  Those who earn their income from any other source are not touched by the budget because there is no wealth or capital taxation.  A number of evasions are still possible and a number of people are excluded altogether.</P>
    <P>The second point the report of the ESRI made was that there should be a more effective tax system for farmers and the self employed.  Can anybody say that that aim has been advanced by the budget?  The third point made was that there should be a reorganisation and a reconsideration of so-called productivity deals.  These were the special awards the report was addressing itself to at that time.</P>
    <P>The principal problem was the one of unemployment.  This has been neglected. I equally think that the analysis which has been brought to bear on our economic problems is now a kind of a technicist thing.  It has become a technical problem. Even the media have reflected this in quite interesting reproductions of an old way of dealing with the budget.  I mentioned their managed illusion about it earlier but their so-called financial discussions are interesting.  Their approach is to wheel on a so-called neutral technical expert on the economy or on fiscal matters and interview him first.  They ask him what are the real problems and he will say that the national debt servicing requirement has to be reduced as a proportion of GNP.  These people rarely mention employment and unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> Next, they turn to three or four ordinary TDs.  They will start by asking the three conservative ones what they think of that truth which has been expressed by this so-called neutral person.  Finally, they turn to a left wing person and they say to him that there are people like him in the country and ask him if he would like to tell them all his rubbish again about State investment and so forth.  The nature of this country is so ideologically diseased in relation to the thinking about human problems that people in a dreamlike trance wander through it accepting as natural that children born the same must grow into different experiences, that people with the same illnesses must be treated differently, that people of the same age must or not be allowed to go to school, and that people who have basically the same needs, housing, shelter and food, must be different.  They must never think or question that.  You just dream through society and present its perfect reproduction in an analysis as if its only problems were temporary adjustments to straying and all the time having these deep structural inequalities in it.</P>
    <P>If I might sound theological, these are appropriate reflections at this time on the budget.  I am very sorry that I have not been caught up in the general euphoria that is supposed to be sweeping the land and that we will have jobs created in my constituency before we go home.</P>

      <P>I mentioned unemployment because I feel we are now moving towards a situation where we are accepting high levels of unemployment as natural.  We are accepting it as not constituting a crisis.  I see a situation where people who have been on the long term unemployed list will be regarded as the equivalent of abandoned pieces of productive machinery.  That is what is happening.  People are saying that there is no work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need is a people-orientated version of economics.  I will say this about <Col N="1923" /> the Taoiseach; there are times in his political history when he has seemed to be in favour of such a view.  I will not stand up in this House like other Members on this side of the House and say: &ldquo;We have managed to convert the Taoiseach, are we not lucky?&rdquo; I hope this conversion is temporary.  What is very necessary at this time is that we ask ourselves deep questions between now and the remaining budgets that are to come, and they are the questions I mentioned earlier, as to what kind of society we want to live in. This is one of the rare opportunities we have of commenting like this.  As I have said, what we are witnessing is a bankrupt intellectual tradition.  Behind all of this useless thinking, as I said, is a stable of orthodox economics which disapproved of the independence of this country and which at the very beginning wanted to run this country in a grocers way in terms of counting pennies.</P>

      <P>Before I begin on my contribution on education I would like to congratulate the last speaker on his appointment to the front bench of the Labour Party and indeed any Member in this House who has been elevated to a similar position within their own respective parties.  Again, before I commence my speech I would like to say to Deputy Higgins that as his remarks, exhilarating <Col N="1924" /> as they were, are on the record of this House, it falls on me to rebut the main one.  He stated that our budget did not mention the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; and did not address itself to the issue of unemployment and that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance did not take account of it.  I want to put on the record that the thrust of our budget and all our statements and policies in that regard are geared to meet one thing, which is our recognition of the threat of unemployment and our commitment to alleviate that threat.  That is why we have taken the measures we have taken, difficult as they have been, because we have seen in the taking of those measures a drop in interest rates with a resulting economic upturn.  Like Deputy Higgins, I share in the strong feelings and assumptions that the economic climate of the country will improve.  It is too facile to dismiss all of this as one of the new isms or ideologies or the one he spoke about, climatology. I, in my simple way, thought that related to the weather.</P>

      <P>It is all right, Acting Chairman, I will keep them all at bay. I wish to state at the outset that this Government are committed to introducing policy measures and reform in the education sector.  Such measures which my Department will implement with the co-operation of management authorities, teaching interests, parents and other interested bodies will be aimed at making the education system a more effective one by way of quality; a more egalitarian one by providing a more equitable distribution of resources and a more cost effective one.</P>
      <P>At present this country is faced with most serious economic and social problems. There are over 250,000 or over 20 per cent of the labour force out of work and almost one-third of these is under 25.  Unemployment occurs on an unprecedented scale for those who say we did not mention it.  Our total national debt is almost 150 per cent of GNP at over £24 billion.  The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement is in excess of £2,028 million.  This is at a time when the performance of the economy is unsatisfactory &mdash; the economy has shown no growth.</P>
      <P>The difficult position of the public finances, in particular the level of borrowing to sustain the public services and the cost in real terms &mdash; the opportunity cost &mdash; of servicing the national debt must be tackled.  Solutions must be found for the major obstacles to our development as a country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly evident to virtually everyone that in regard to reducing the national debt, GNP ratio requires a substantial reduction in public spending and a reduction in the level of public services that many people have come to expect as of right.  In the recent report of the National Economic and Social Council, November 1986, it has been argued that <Col N="1926" />&ldquo;unless the balances in the public finances are resolved, it can be expected that the evolution of domestic interest rates and of the exchange rate will continue to exert pressures detrimental to the competitiveness of the internationally trading sectors of the economy, and injurious to the prospects for overall output and employment growth in the medium term&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Government recognise that in order to encourage and foster economic growth and recovery it is necessary to take courageous and radical measures.  It is necessary to contain the level of public expenditure and to reduce this country's dependence on borrowing.  As the Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech, we simply cannot afford our present level of services, and measures were then announced which indicate the firm commitment and resolve of this Government to tackle earnestly the task of getting the country out of the present economic crisis.</P>
    <P>In the areas of education-the Government reappraised fully and comprehensively the Education Estimates which were published on 20 January by the previous Government.  As a result of this reappraisal the Government have decided that for non-capital services the total gross provision in the five Educations Votes, plus the youth levy for 1987, will be £1,152 million approximately, 82 per cent of this is required to meet salaries and pensions.  Coming at a time of severe economic difficulties for the country these allocations are a clear indication of the significance and importance that this Fianna Fáil Government place on education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>The Deputy should wait until it is his turn to make a contribution. He is not the spokesman on Education for the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into account the existing financial difficulties which face this country it was possible to identify a number of areas where it would be possible to achieve <Col N="1927" /> some savings without adversely affecting either the quality or the quantity of the services.  None of the measures which the Government have taken in the Education area will in any way restrict entry to education or limit educational opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just 20 years ago since a Fianna Fáil Minister for Education, the late Donogh O'Malley introduced free post-primary education.  Since that time we have witnessed an unprecedented expansion in our education system at all levels which placed heavy demands on educational administration and management.  However, the personnel involved proved worthy of the tasks which confronted them at the time and we continue to prove worthy of the task.</P>
      <P>We now have almost one million young people receiving full-time education in our schools, colleges and universities and these are taught by over 42,000 teachers and lecturers.  In the current year there are at primary level approximately 578,000 pupils.  This is an increase of over 73,000 since 1966 and corresponds to a percentage increase of 14.5 per cent approximately.  The increase in enrolment at post primary in the same period is even more striking &mdash; in 1966 there were about 143,000 pupils enrolled in second level education programmes whereas the current enrolment in these programmes is 345,000 pupils approximately which corresponds to an increase in excess of 145 per cent.  The corresponding figures for enrolment in third level programmes are 20,700 and some 55,000 students respectively which represent an increase of over 165 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of our schools and colleges is now at an all-time record level and the education sector is a large consumer of public funds.  While 20 years ago the public funding of education represented almost 14 per cent of total public <Col N="1928" /> expenditure, this year we will be spending 17.2 per cent of total expenditure on education. On any international comparison this is well above average and is an indication of the importance the Government, and the Irish people, place on education and on the need to ensure that the education system produces well-educated, well-qualified individuals.</P>
    <P>By way of further comparison, I was impressed by some statistics in relation to our second level examinations.  In 1967, a total of 21,800 pupils sat for the intermediate certificate examination whereas in the current year it is expected that some 60,500 pupils will take the examinations. The corresponding data in relation to the leaving certificate examination are even more impressive. Almost 13,600 candidates sat for the leaving certificate examinations in 1967 whereas this year some 57,400 candidates have entered for this examination &mdash; this corresponds to an increase of over 322 per cent.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given clearly indicate that the education system has grown and expanded significantly during the past two decades.  It is unlikely that overall in the coming years there will be more than a very modest increase in total numbers in the education system.  In fact indications are that enrolments at first level will decrease annually from now to the end of the century when enrolments are expected to drop to below 500,000.  This is due to the declining birth rate in recent years.  There will however be continued growth at second and third level for some years to come.  Enrolments at second and third level are still increasing at the rates of 2 per cent and 3 per cent approximately and it is expected that enrolments at second level will reach maximum in 1995-96.</P>
    <P>Due to changing circumstances, on account of demographic factors and the need to contain public expenditure without adversely affecting educational outcomes, it will be necessary in future to make greater efforts to develop managerial and administrative expertise and skills.  Greater attention, too, must be <Col N="1929" /> placed on educational planning than was done in the past when it was largely confined to the identification and setting of goals.  Not enough attention perhaps has been paid to the various means whereby these goals could be achieved, to the development of systematic cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies.</P>
    <P>Reform and development measures taken in the education area must be based on comprehensive economic, social and demographic data and financial constraints as well as on educational and political considerations and must be taken into account.  In addition reform measures in the education system must be soundly based and be supported where possible by research programmes and experimental projects.  Modern management and educational tools need to be fully applied to develop relevant models for reform and to evaluate the outcomes of research and development programmes.</P>
    <P>At a time when financial resources are very limited and are likely to remain so for some time, it must be accepted that, at best, resources for education are likely to be maintained in real terms at the existing level.  It is essential that the very best and most positive use is made of those resources which we have available. Planning the education services assumes greater importance, and it is my intention that even more emphasis then heretofore will be placed on the planning function. I am sure that will appeal to Members on all sides of the House.  I want to see future educational planning take the form of a continuous macro plan.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, that, within its framework, every sector of the education services will be covered &mdash; first level, second level, third level, further education and youth, sport, cultural, scientific and international activities. Provision for co-ordination of educational planning with other sectors of the economy, for example, labour, health, agriculture and so on, will also be planned for.</P>
    <P>At any particular stage, the plans will focus intensively on the immediate period <Col N="1930" /> ahead and review critically the performance in the recent past.  From year to year, the focus will be extended a further year ahead, and adjustments will be made, depending on such factors as the changing needs of the individual, the community and the economy, the resources available and the effectiveness of previous practices.  Particular emphasis will be placed on areas which are seen to require most attention, while ensuring that no area escapes consideration and review.  A feature of educational planning which is not widely recognised is the long lead-in time for the introduction of new initiatives and their realisation, in terms of graduation from a particular level of education, or a particular course.</P>
    <P>Before new initiatives can be introduced, it is necessary to provide the infrastructure to support them &mdash; facilities, equipment and accommodation, textbooks, trained teaching staff, whether by redeployment or by provision of additional facilities.  It may be necessary to initiate a pilot scheme, to discuss new proposals with school managements and staff and when new courses are finally introduced, the first cohort of students must complete the course &mdash; which usually lasts for a number of years &mdash; before its impact can be fully assessed and evaluated.</P>
    <P>In evaluating any project measures of quality other than examination results must be applied, such as, the relevance of the education services to the needs of the individual pupil, to the community and to the economy; the acceptability of educational standards; equity of access to education and equality of opportunity and the cost-effectiveness of the inputs. It is not easy to devise standards for evaluation of these features but we must be continuously attempting to assess them.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we tend to lose sight of this basic time-span and the public perception frequently is that little is being done towards reforming a system, while the reality is that reform is going on, albeit in what might be perceived as a slow fashion.</P>
    <P>To assist in forward planning a group <Col N="1931" /> in my Department are working on a strategic plan for an information technology system.  The first stage of the plan is nearing completion and the planning team has been careful to ensure that the information requirements of all areas will be incorporated into the plan.  I attach great importance to the introduction of the new technologies in my Department as quickly as possible.  With more detailed, accurate and up-to-date information available quickly when required, it will be easier to analyse the effectiveness of the services, assess our arrangements for redeploying our resources, and consider alternative options.</P>
    <P>Research and experimentation in education has been a little unco-ordinated and diffuse in the past.  It is my intention that the research capacity in education should be strengthened and developed. This in turn can contribute to better educational management, to greater educational efficiency and improved educational outcomes by clarifying issues and evaluating results of pilot studies.  A number of research projects conducted in the recent past or currently in progress are particularly interesting and may ultimately have a significant impact on school curricula.  The research project on junior cycle English, recently completed, and the project to investigate the effectiveness of various teaching strategies for teaching Irish in primary schools, both of which were initiated by inspectors in my Department, are examples of research programmes that need to be undertaken. Other worthwhile projects which are funded from the research allocation include studies into the use of the new information technologies in teaching science-based programmes, the development and testing of computer-based courseware for teaching a number of second-level programmes, the evaluation of a number of pilot intervention and EC educational projects and the funding of research activities in the area of adult education and literacy programmes.</P>
    <P>An increased provision over that period in 1986 has been made in order to <Col N="1932" /> promote equality of educational opportunity for girls and boys during the current financial year, Both international and national activities are envisaged.</P>
    <P>On the international front contracts have been signed by my Department with the Commission of the European Communities whereby the Communities will contribute 50 per cent of the cost of implementing two programmes.  The first one is a European Community poster competition &mdash; this is a new initiative of the European Community Action Programme to promote equal opportunities for girls and boys in education and has as its theme &ldquo;Equal Opportunities for Girls and Boys in Education&rdquo;.  Prizes involving travel will be awarded by the European Commission to the four winning entrants from Ireland.  The second programme is an action-research project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies.  This project will involve four schools, representing the main kinds of second level schools in Ireland, secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>At the national level I have agreed to an extension of a pilot project to encourage more girls in senior cycle second level education to study the physical sciences. The Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, speaking in Limerick at the weekend, placed greater emphasis on this project.  Shortly after I went into the Department I asked for the file on this matter and I was struck by the imbalance in regard to girls and young women taking these courses in second level schools.  I hope the project will unearth the reasons for this and point the way towards a remedy.  It is a matter of concern to me that the number of girls participating in the physical sciences, in particular physics, is still relatively low. In view of the growing importance of science and technology and the need to have well qualified personnel in the physical science area, it is important to encourage more boys and girls, but especially girls because so few of them are at present in this area, to take up the sciences.  The scheme which is currently operating in <Col N="1933" /> four regions will be extended to include six regions as from September 1987.  I hope it will then be further extended. The project will be evaluated and steps will be taken based on the results of that evaluation which will have long-term implications for the career opportunities of young women.</P>
    <P>The background report, in preparation for the OECD review of the Irish education system, by a national team which began work in 1986 will be completed towards the end of this year.  It is currently in operation.  The report will identify a number of major issues relating in particular to teacher supply and training. The report will be submitted as a brief to an international team of examiners who will be nominated by the OECD and who will visit this country early in 1988.</P>
    <P>I am indeed pleased that the exercise will focus on the quality of the educational service delivered by our schools, both the present position and the possible strategies for maintaining and improving it in the context of falling rolls and rapidly changing social and technological needs. In addressing itself to the important issue of quality it will complement the other main developments of the past 20 years, that is, the quantitative expansion of the system and the reform of school curricula. We should be very glad that such a report is being compiled.  I look forward to the results of that report and to facing into the challenges which will be presented.</P>

      <P>We must await the report.  It is my expectation that the work currently being done by the national team and the findings of the OECD examiners will provide material for a constructive debate on relevant educational issues and will indicate policy options for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues will need to be <Col N="1934" /> addressed in the near future in the context of the provision for primary education. I will mention some of them briefly here today.</P>
    <P>The declining birthrate of recent years is just now becoming a factor of importance for primary education.  It is intended in the near future to work out guidelines for coping with developments in this connection, so my remarks today will merely refer to selected aspects of what is clear right now.</P>
    <P>Many commentators regard declining enrolments as simply an opportunity to improve the pupil-teacher ratio, an objective which is indeed high on my priorities for primary schools but there are other issues which must also be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Falling enrolments are not to be seen as having a simple arithmetical dimension only; a drop of, say, 10 per cent in numbers has quite different implications for urban as compared with rural areas, for large schools as against small.  Declining enrolment in an individual school reduces the income from capitation and makes difficult the maintenance of the numbers required to support transport services or other schemes that require fixed minimum participation: heating, cleaning and similar costs, per pupil on roll, tend to rise.  From a slightly wider perspective, reducing numbers in urban areas or in large towns results in empty classrooms and even in empty schools, giving rise to a need for careful scrutiny of proposals for new accommodation in adjacent areas.</P>
    <P>I have described some of the problems which are arising from falling numbers. This situation, however, will also present us with new challenges and opportunities. It is widely accepted that the quality of learning experiences at primary level has a profound effect on future success of individual pupils in the education system. The changing circumstances may enable strategies to be developed which will enhance the quality of the teaching-learning process in primary education.</P>
    <P>Within the overall allocation of resources to my Department, I propose to give a particular priority to the needs <Col N="1935" /> of primary education.  I have absolutely no doubt that Members on all sides of the House, no matter what philosophy they profess, will agree with me that the primary focus of any education authority or any education Department must be on the first level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister cut the pupil-teacher ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be necessary to examine areas of special need and to target resources especially to meet those needs.  With regard to pupil-teacher ratios, significant improvements have been made in the past and it might be argued that these improvements have had their most notable and beneficial effect in the smaller schools.  The situation in some of the larger schools is still less than fully satisfactory and it would be my hope to use the phenomenon of falling numbers to alleviate this position.  Even within the larger schools a greater proportion of teaching resources might be directed to the classes catering for the youngest children.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to examine the support services available to schools and to consider diverting some of the resources which will be released by falling numbers into these areas.  I cannot be more specific on these questions just yet as they have to be examined fully in consultation with the various interests involved with primary education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I hoped to work towards them.  I am not a woman of empty promises.  The present curriculum was introduced in 1971.  Since then various sample-scale and medium-scale reviews of certain aspects of its implementation have been held.  These have included work by the Educational Research Centre and work commissioned both by the INTO and the Conference of Teaching Sisters.  The Department's own curriculum unit has <Col N="1936" /> conducted a number of surveys on national samples of children on levels of attainment in various curricular areas and some of these reports have been published.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board has been that a major review should be undertaken of the whole of the primary school curriculum.  Having considered the matter carefully it has been decided that there should be a rolling review of the curriculum having regard to the resources available to the Department and to the curriculum board. It will involve co-operation between the officials of the Department and the Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board.  All research work conducted up to this by the Department's curriculum unit will be studied and drawn together in formulating a detailed strategy for the review.</P>
      <P>As I am discussing activities at primary and second level I turn to the matter of school discipline which has exercised greatly the minds of everyone concerned, particularly teachers within the schools. The recommendations of the Committee on School Discipline have been under consideration in the Department for some time past and extensive consultation has taken place with the managerial bodies and the INTO.  I have grounds for believing that the necessary rule changes can be made in the near future, to the satisfaction of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, however, to keep this problem in its proper perspective.  All the evidence points to the fact that the majority of teachers and pupils in primary schools enjoy harmonious and happy relationships.  The modern world has seen many changes in the patterns of child rearing and particularly in the manner in which children interact with each other and with adults.  This change is reflected in primary schools and it is to the credit of the primary teachers of this country that they have been able to adapt so readily to the changed social environment. The changes to which I refer have implications not only for teachers but for all others who come into contact <Col N="1937" /> with children in schools, including representatives of management, inspectors etc.  I have set aside funds from the allocation for inservice training for special one-day seminars in the autumn of 1987 on the theme of relationships and discipline in primary schools.  As a preparation for these seminars, the members of the primary inspectorate are at present briefing themselves fully on the issues.</P>
    <P>I recognise that certain pupils are causing problems for the teachers and for other pupils in classrooms.  In this regard the importance of parental involvement in school discipline cannot be overestimated. As a general principle, I want to state that parents must in the last analysis consider themselves to have a responsibility for their children's behaviour and be willing to co-operate with school authorities in resolving problems. Any rule revisions which will ultimately be sanctioned will focus especially on the crucial role of parents.</P>
    <P>A very small minority, I stress, of primary school pupils are so disruptive that they seriously interfere with the working of schools and deny other children their right to education.  It will be necessary to devise guidelines for dealing with the special problems created by these children. In formulating the guidelines care will be taken to ensure that such children continue to receive appropriate education, even if they have to be removed temporarily from their present teaching environment which, in the vast majority of cases, can be taken to be the class grouping but in extremely rare cases will be the particular school itself.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that, in any system of education which provides for all pupils, many different levels of attainment will be evident.  The major challenge of the modern primary school is to provide suitable learning experiences for children of differing intellectual endowment and of many diverse backgrounds.  In order fully to benefit from the educational opportunities currently available, minimum standards in literacy and numeracy are required.  The problem of under-achievement in school is not unique to this country; it is a matter of great concern in other <Col N="1938" /> developed countries also.  To some extent the concept of education to meet individual abilities and requirement is diametrically opposed to that of minimum standards.  However, modern independent living requires minimum standards and much of the efforts of our schools are directed towards helping children to reach acceptable levels of literacy and numeracy.</P>
    <P>In any randomly selected sample of children, different levels of ability and attainment are to be expected and it is not unusual to find, in any class, groups of children who are attaining levels far above and far below the average for their class, as Deputy Howlin knows.  The modern primary school with its emphasis on response to individual needs and group teaching strategies, can accommodate many of these differences and does so successfully.  The teaching of reading, in particular, has undergone revolutionary changes in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Since 1964 when standardised tests were first used on samples of Irish school children there has been a steady overall increase in average levels of reading attainments.  However, there are children whose attainments fall so far short of average that they need special help.  For the past 25 years additional posts of remedial teacher have been recognised and there are now some 850 such remedial teaching posts.  Many of the very large schools have been allocated two additional such teachers.  A small additional number of such posts in the current year will be recruited from the panel.  Because of the scarcity of our resources we must ensure that such posts are used to best effect.  In some of the schools which were allocated special posts in the past, the numbers on rolls have decreased, again due to falling birth rate or changes in demographic structures. That is very welcome because again it means that those schools have had very special treatment.  It is reasonable that such schools should now be willing to share their remedial allocation. <Col N="1939" /> I find it highly amusing that Deputy Yates is sitting there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is reasonable that such schools should now be willing to share that additional resource with other schools which have a strong case for such resources but which cannot be funded at present.  I am very pleased to report that my Department are receiving word daily that such schools are willing to share resources with adjoining schools within their area.</P>

      <P>In response to repeated requests from schools, again showing where the teachers and the management structures have taken the initiative, recently my Department prepared a draft set of guidelines on remedial education and these have been submitted to a number of organisations for their observations.  I hope shortly to authorise their dissemination.  These guidelines will focus on the central role of the class teacher and will suggest various alternatives which will increase the effectiveness of remedial teaching in schools. I am very pleased to state that all educational interests are <i>ad idem</i> in this very desirable objective and I feel there will be support from all sectors of the community when this discussion document is released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to continue the work of fostering the position of the Irish language in the educational system and hope that the pace of progress in this area, which was accelerated recently, is maintained. The State is prepared to purchase sites for all-Irish schools and to fully finance their building costs.  An additional teacher, over and above the number warranted by pupil enrolment, is sanctioned for these schools and each member of the staff is paid an allowance for teaching through Irish, which at present amounts <Col N="1940" /> to £430 per annum.  Such schools are awarded an additional 50 per cent of the normal capitation grant.  Free transport is provided, subject to the usual conditions to the nearest all-Irish school for children whose parents wish them to pursue their primary education through Irish.</P>
    <P>A programme of special measures for primary schools in disadvantaged areas has been in operation since 1984.  To date a total of 155 schools, catering for approximately 50,000 pupils, have been assisted through the programme which is to be continued this year.  The special measures from which the schools benefit include special grants for the purchase of books and materials, the sponsorship of particular home-school-community liaison initiatives and special in-service training for teachers in the schools concerned.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, funds have been provided for the relief of school debts in disadvantaged urban areas.  In selecting schools to participate, regard has been had to pupil teacher ratios which seriously hamper effective schooling; poor environment (play space, building); unemployment in the area and vandalism; poor school attendance of children and inter-related disciplinary problems; and lack of community support.</P>
    <P>A new initiative has been taken in connection with the professional development of teachers in these schools with the co-operation of the teachers centres. Again, this is one area to which I have given close attention since I came into the Department and one that I intend to follow up rigorously.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to comment briefly on the school transport service.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment briefly on the school transport area. This very valuable service has served the people of this country very well since its introduction by Donogh O'Malley in the late sixties and has been successful in its main aim of bringing pupils to and from school who, without the service provided, could not have ever got to school, or would suffer undue hardship in doing so.</P>
      <P>There are 156,000 pupils who are eligible for school transport benefit under the school transport scheme.  About 70,000 of these are primary pupils who continue to be carried free.  No hurrahs? Of the 86,000 or so eligible post-primary pupils who are carried, over 39,000 are carried free by virtue of their parents being in possession of a medical card.  The remaining 46,000 post-primary pupils pay charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>About 13,000 pupils who are not eligible for school transport to the school they attend use special school transport services in getting to and from school.  The vast majority of these, over 12,000, are at primary level.  It has been found necessary to impose a modest increase from September next on post-primary pupils who are liable for the charges, far below that which the Coalition Government under Deputy Hussey imposed for the past four years, and remember she was the Minister who brought into this country school transport charges.</P>

      <P>When one considers that the average cost of providing school transport is about £245 per annum for each eligible pupil, as against the transport cost to the parents, the benefit to the parents is enormous.  The total yield from the charges still constitutes less than 10 per cent of the total cost of the service. The school transport system is a complex one involving, as I have already mentioned, about 156,000 eligible pupils each school day.  About 2,500 vehicles are engaged in the system.  They operate over 6,200 routes to 335 post-primary centres and 1,490 primary schools.</P>
      <P>Because of the complexity of the system which involves such a massive outlay by the State, it will be appreciated it is necessary to keep it under constant review to ensure that it is operated as cost-effectively as possible.  It is my intention to take any action which will secure the most economic operation of this very valuable service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not allowed by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to answer the Deputy.  I have already referred to our strategy of organising our educational system in the manner most likely to ensure a maximum return on investment. <Col N="1943" /> In the primary sector, we have long operated a policy of centralising smaller schools into larger units, where feasible. This policy was more than an exercise in reducing costs; very often, it entailed expenditure of considerable proportions by way of capital costs of new buildings and recurring costs of providing transport services, so that any financial savings were never realised except in the long-term. The cornerstone of the amalgamation policy, which counted for more than financial savings, was the improvement in the quality of the education we give our children by the concentration and optimum use of teaching manpower and resources.  That was the <i>raison d'être</i> of the policy and it will continue to be its guiding principle.  Recent developments have provided fresh scope for the operation of the centralisation policy, for example, the merging of separate boys' and girls' schools into co-educational units &mdash; I am sure there is no remorse at that &mdash; and the declining enrolments of schools in urban areas where there are shifts in population.</P>
      <P>In relation to the national schools building programme, a provision in 1987 of £30,010,000 has been made.  Compared to the original 1986 provision of £28,234,000 for national school building it represents an increase of over 6 per cent.  Wait until I come to what Deputy Yates's Government did.</P>
      <P>However, 40 contracts were authorized in January 1987 by the previous Minister of Education to proceed at the earliest possible date this year subject to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;asking that such and such a school be allocated immediately I will continue to emphasise that very important factor.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The national schools building programme is a complex one.  It is concerned in the main with the provision of new schools and extensions in developing urban areas, and the replacement of obsolete and unsuitable buildings in rural areas.  A substantial annual sum must also be reserved out of each yearly allocation for essential works to existing schools &mdash; for example, replacement of <Col N="1945" /> windows, roofs, sanitation, heating systems and similar improvements.  These works do not usually involve the provision of any extra floor space as such, but are nevertheless an important feature of the national schools capital works programme.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that capital allocations to individual national schools will be made with a view to achieving the maximum impact over the widest possible number of schools and in accordance with genuine needs and orders of priority. I am conscious of the fact that with the existing staffing levels in the Primary Buildings Branch of my Department and given the present level of capital provision, it could take perhaps seven to eight years to work through the backlog of projects which are seeking to be funded.  However, some recent initiatives by my Department's Primary Buildings Branch have been directed to improving the situation.  Certain schools which urgently need new classroom accommodation and whose schemes have included major and expensive re-modelling of existing accommodation have been advised that they should first proceed with the new classroom accommodation and follow on at a later stage with their re-modelling plans.  A number of schools are also being asked to consider, where appropriate, the merits of system building where it is not possible to firmly establish their overall long-term accommodation needs but it is sufficiently clear that some extra classrooms are needed in the immediate future.</P>

In this way it will be possible to reduce the waiting time for <Col N="1946" /> the provision of the most urgently needed national school accommodation.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that it was possible for me to reverse the decision to impose further cutbacks on the guidance services in our schools.  This was one of the matters raised by the many parents, pupils and teachers who contacted me in recent months and weeks.  I know something of the contribution which our guidance services have made toward helping schools to adapt and adjust to face challenges brought about by rapid advances in science and technology.  The guidance personnel in our schools have contributed greatly to the process of curriculum change and to the entire process of opening up the school to the community.  I know I can look forward to co-operation from schools and from guidance teachers to ensure that there are effective links between schools and communities, to ensure that those support services we provide for young people are provided in an effective and co-ordinated way.  Here might I thank the Deputies from all sides of the House who, since the general election, came and spoke to me personally about this matter.  I should say that I took their representations very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that guidance and counselling services provided in schools are not concerned solely with purely economic matters.  I know that an important aim of guidance is to help young people toward independence, to use personal initiative and to help them toward maturity in the context of their overall education.  Such an aim is in keeping with the good of the community as a whole. <Col N="1947" /> We must avail of every opportunity to encourage individual initiative and wellbeing.  I hope that my decision to preserve our guidance services will assist schools to continue to co-operate in developing practical programmes and services for their students.</P>
    <P>In seeking to continue to support and, if possible, to improve services I will have special regard to the needs of weaker sections of the community.  I shall have particular regard to the needs of the early leavers from schools, about which Deputy Michael Higgins spoke so movingly in his contribution earlier.  We must give serious consideration to all means of ensuring equality of opportunity and a full education for all.  We owe it to individuals, their families and society to continue to make our best efforts to develop our educational provision for the benefit of all, especially for the benefit of those who need special support and care.  In making these remarks I must re-emphasise that I am not thinking only of economic aims, important though these are.</P>
    <P>It is very important for anybody involved in educational structures and for myself, in this portfolio, that economic aims are not seen to be the be all and end all.  I am thinking of the full personal development of young people.  If we are to do justice to young people and to society then we must think in those terms.  Therefore I shall pay very close attention to programmes of personal development which are becoming such a welcome feature of many of our schools. The potential benefits and worth of such programmes must be realised.  Seen in the context of a sound philosophy of education, implemented wisely in harmony with the curriculum as a whole they can help young people to develop self-confidence, to have respect for themselves and for others, to be sensitive in their relationships with others and to look to the future with hope.  In particular I shall be anxious to ensure that parents are fully informed of such developments, that their primary rights are recognised and <Col N="1948" /> that they are given opportunities to participate with schools in the work of education.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the question of curriculum reform.  I regard the whole question of curriculum reform as a challenging one and central to our developmental policy in education, subject to my overriding tenet, that curriculum reform be allied to the maintenance of standards of excellence. I make absolutely no apology for saying that all of my ideas and developments <i>vis-à-vis</i> curriculum reform will be based on that tenet, that they must be carried out in keeping with the basic standards of education.  For this reason I intend immediately to undertake a study of all initiatives in curriculum changes, pilot schemes and so on, which have taken place over the last 10 to 15 years.  Here I want to pay tribute to all of the units who have been working so steadily over the last 10 to 15 years on curriculum reform, whose efforts all of us are inclined to overlook at times.  One could be forgiven for thinking that the phrase &ldquo;curriculum reform&rdquo; had appeared within the last three to four years, that it was new jargon.  I know from my many years in second level education that there have been many worthwhile initiatives taken in second level schools throughout the country regarding curriculum reform, particularly as a local environment impacts on the educational system.  It is my intention to have all of that information compiled, to study it and to have it published.</P>
    <P>In this area I welcome the work undertaken to date by the Curriculum and Examinations Board, including their most recent initiative, a proposed review of the primary curriculum.</P>

      <P>Indeed I should not. In relation to funding of voluntary secondary schools it was not found possible, <Col N="1949" /> because of budgetary constraints, to sanction an increase in the capitation grant.  Neither did the outgoing Government find that possible.  It was also found necessary to make reductions in the allocation for vocational education committees proposed in the January 1987 Abridged Estimates Volume.  There has been a reduction also in the allocation for non-pay expenditure, proposed by the previous Government, for community and comprehensive schools.  Therefore, let nobody say I am not up front with my proposals.  I realise that secondary, vocational, community and comprehensive schools are operating under tight financial constraints but further economies were unavoidable.  However, I am confident that the achievement of greater efficiency and cost effectiveness &mdash; both of which were strongly advocated at all of Deputy Yates's committee meetings &mdash; will make a major contribution to the smooth running of the education system in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Minister's care for the pupils, though?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The pupils will be cared for very well.  As already indicated, teachers' pay and pensions account for 82 per cent of all expenditure on education this year.  Might I stress that I consider the teachers are well worth it. In general public service terms the actual financial provision for these purposes normally represents approximately one third of the entire pay bill for that sector. In view of the magnitude of that figure it was necessary to look to the area of teachers' costs in order to achieve some savings in education expenditure.</P>
      <P>The previous administration had made certain decisions which would have affected teacher numbers in the post-primary area.  These decisions were that vice-principals and guidance teachers be brought within quota in all schools.  Such measures would have had the effect of reducing the current number of teachers by 850.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office we have reviewed those decisions and have considered <Col N="1950" /> other measures with a view to modifying the 1987 financial requirement for post-primary teachers' pay.  As already announced, we have decided not to proceed with the implementation of the proposal in relation to the quota position of the guidance teacher.</P>
    <P>We have also decided to implement the proposal to having the post of vice-principal within quota in all schools. Since 1983 under Deputy Hussey a previous Minister for Education the post of vice-principal has ceased to be reckoned on an ex-quota basis in schools with enrolments below 250 pupils, that is, in the smaller schools and we have now decided that it will be necessary to extend this restriction to the larger schools for the present.  It is my wish, and perhaps it will be realised, to this year study urgently how the vice principal position could and might be reversed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The new measure will of course only be introduced as the occurrence of vacancies enables it to be done.  It has come to my notice that this decision has been interpreted as somehow reflecting on the position of the vice-principal and some people have even suggested that it entails the abolition of the post.  Such interpretation is of course totally erroneous.  I am hopeful that schools will be able to cope adequately with this measure and in the small number of cases where particular transitional difficulties may occur, the authorities of those schools may rest assured that my Department will deal sympathetically with their problems.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier in this speech to the fact that the numbers of pupils seeking post-primary education continue to grow and this growth will continue for some years yet before the impact of the falling birth rate &mdash; already evident in our primary schools &mdash; begins to be felt. While the needs of the present school-going population must be met, it is incumbent on all concerned to ensure that, in years to come, there will not be a proliferation of empty classrooms.  I am sure that is something to which all would aspire.</P>
    <P>It seems that my script is too long for <Col N="1951" /> the length of time I have at my disposal so I must compress it.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for third level education is proceeding according to plan and the development of regional colleges and third level institutions will proceed with the greatest possible haste.  We have been enabled to keep within the previous Government's budget with regard to the indexing of the third level grants in line with inflation.  I have met with the vested interests and started a round of consultations. I agree that the way to avoid confrontation is by meeting with those who have been helped and those who have been cut back to try to explain the reasons and to ensure that any hardships which could occur can be successfully offset by ameliorative measures.  I hope that greater autonomy can be accorded to the regional colleges and that this can be done within the framework of the existing Act.  I am committed to the idea that these colleges will play an increasing role in the industrial life of their region. That is one of the reasons for which they were set up.</P>
    <P>My Department have practically completed a very important study on admission procedures to third level education. We hope to publish this later in the year and I hope it will provide much food for thought.  I have spoken about the industrial and higher educational links which I hope to expand at a future date. I look forward to many fruitful debates in this House with Members on the opposite side.  Within the financial constraints imposed I have managed with the consultations of my collegues in Cabinet and with the greater participation of the opposing parties to preserve the fabric of education to ensure that education services continue to be openly accessible to all who need them.  I am pleased that we have been able to maintain the existing teacher ratio at post primary level.  I am pleased, too, that we have been able to implement many measures which I had thought we would not have been able to implement.  I am conscious that hard decisions must be taken but I am conscious also of the extreme co-operation <Col N="1952" /> which I have already received from the various interests.  I look forward, during the Easter period when other Deputies will be enjoying the Easter recess, to going to the four major teacher conferences to speak and to listen to views and I will in turn translate their views into my policy in education.  It is a great honour for me to be in the House today for the first time as Minister for Education and I thank the Members for their courtesy.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is starting off with a lot of good intentions, I wish her well.  It has not been recognised by the Government that Fine Gael are <Col N="1953" /> extending far more goodwill to them in one week than they showed in the past four and a half years to the previous Government.  Perhaps this will be a lesson to them in future should they find themselves on these benches.</P>
      <P>It is the Opposition's role to critically scrutinise any budget.  While I have a small sneaking regard for the Minister for Finance in his courageous attempts to rectify the public finances and resolve the difficult problems, this budget will not resolve the major problems of unemployment, stunted growth in the economy, the lack of confidence and the lack of development.  The great tragedy is that in 1980 and 1981 we had Exchequer borrowing requirements which were 20.3 per cent of GNP.  Admittedly the Government succeeded in bringing down substantially in this budget the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a percentage of GNP.  The figure has been reduced to 6.9 per cent.  It is most disappointing that we have had to experience errors in the 1980-1981-1982 period which were responsible for the hardship inflicted on so many people.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's electoral dishonesty is one of the most prominent features of this budget.  I remember canvassing not so long ago and a lot of angry and irritated people were upset by much of what we put forward.  For the past four and a half years I have listened to the likes of Deputy O'Kennedy whining on these benches in terms of the better way they would put forward.  In their programme they promised to bring two thirds of taxpayers down to the standard rate of tax. They derided the DIRT tax and blamed it for the outflow of capital funds of £1.5 billion.  They promised to abolish that tax and to abolish the residential property tax.  They promised 57,000 additional jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember calling to one gentleman's house during the election campaign and being told that the out-patient charge was a tax on cancer.  That was before the in-patient charge was suggested.  Where now is the £200 million for the construction industry?  Where is the VAT reduced to 5 per cent from 10 per cent for <Col N="1954" /> the construction industry?  I remember during the election campaign Fianna Fáil, and in particular the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, refused to discuss the term &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;.  He found the word &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; objectionable. We have now seen a phenomenal somersault.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise the content of the budget in itself to any great degree, although there are some aspects which are badly thought out and hastily cobbled together, but I take grave exception to the fact that my party should have substantially fewer seats in this House because they were honest while that party are in Government because they told the people what they intended to do only after the election.  There was no mention of the witholding tax.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy Haughey standing here and talking about the last Government's cavalier attitude on pay.  I remember specific promises made week after week in Private Members' time.  In my constituency people lay down under buses when school transport charges were introduced.  I remember the Irish Shipping debate and the difficulties those employees were suffering, but they are not heard of now.  I remember seeing the public Gallery filled with teachers who were expecting great things from Fianna Fáil when they got into power.  There was no mention to farmers that anything they gained through the abolition of the land tax would be lost by sleight of hand in terms of a change in the VAT refund system.</P>
    <P>I remember listening to labels of monetarist Thatcher, the new right and other different insults.  I remember that in a television debate Deputy Ray Burke, in the new era of moving forward with confidence in the economy and growth, specifically said one of the things they would not do was to cut back in the marketing area of Bord Fáilte.  Not only in this House and in the media, but at every urban council, county council, local health committee, VEC and county committee of agriculture, members of my party had to listen to a lot of rhetoric over the past four and a half years, a <Col N="1955" /> great deal of which, has proved to be electorally dishonest.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have done a great disservice to Irish politics and not just to themselves but to all politicians for the simple reason that they have set a new standard in public hypocrisy and it will take a long time for us to escape from that.  It could all have been so easily avoided if they had taken up the offer made by the outgoing Government to see the books, scrutinise the figures and then make their real choices and present them to the public, but they were too cute by half.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the economic strategy in the budget which is necessary to restore growth, confidence and investment in the economy.  One of the valid and reasonable criticisms of this budget is that it does not give a direction to the economy. It has a narrow strategy, which is, that if interest rates fall due to decreased Exchequer borrowing requirements, that will ease the pressure on lending and credit, interest rates will fall, people will invest and business will expand.  That is a reasonable strategy but it is not an overall direction to the economy.  In the same way the 1986 budget, introduced by a Government which I supported, gambled to some extent on growth in the economy but that did not come off.  I believe this Government have gambled on interest rates falling.</P>
    <P>If we take a close look at the gilts market we will see that it may be a gamble which will not come off.  In January 1986 the rate of return on gilts was 12 per cent; in April 1986 it was 8½ per cent; then, due to a number of different factors relating to the instability of our currency and notwithstanding some very unhelpful comments from members of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to outflows of money and the DIRT tax, in September 1986 gilts rose to 13.75 per cent.  In March 1987, with the election of a new Government, there was an expectancy that there would be an improvement in the public finances and gilts fell to 10.85 per cent. But today and at the end of last week when we saw the first sign of the U-turns, <Col N="1956" /> and the first sign of wilting under real pressure, the gilt rate rose to 13.8 per cent.  If this strategy does not come off the Government will have inflicted a lot of hardship and misery for very little.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the capital outflow of £1.5 billion.  I have no doubt that that is the single biggest reason Irish interest rates are 4 per cent higher than in the United Kingdom.  There seems to be a great deal of mystery about these outflows.  The single most important factor which will keep Irish currency stable and keep interest rates down would be if Britain went into the EMS.  We should prevail upon the European Economic Community, the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Council of Prime Ministers to ensure that Britain joins the EMS because most of the outflows of currency are, in my view, strictly trade related and speculative <i>vis-à-vis</i> the value of the punt v. sterling.  People feel Irish Governments will come under pressure to devalue, and will devalue, thus allowing a windfall gain to those who speculate in sterling, and that has led to the outflows.  It is very important that this Government should put down a long term clear marker that they will not entertain currency policy other than strict stability, despite trade pressures.</P>
    <P>I hope the trends which took place at the latter end of last week and the beginning of this week in relation to the rate of return on gilts and the wholesale money market which have become exceedingly nervous with the increasing symptoms of agility by this Government, will not evaporate because the country will stand to lose a great deal.</P>
    <P>The best way to attract investment back to this country is to show investors that there is an environment where they will get a return on their investment, that there are investment opportunities and that people will know if they are clever, shrewd and prudent enough to invest in sectors that will give a return, that return will not be taxed out of existence.</P>
    <P>I believe this budget does not provide those investment opportunities and, therefore, it puts at risk the possibility of succeeding in the narrow strategy it has <Col N="1957" /> attempted.  One of the reasons for this failure is that I believe the budget arithmetic is fundamentally flawed and in a number of areas is incorrect.  I should like to spell out a number of areas where I think the outturn for 1987 will be different from that predicted by the Minister for Finance.  I may be one of the youngest Members in this House but I remember 1981 and 1982 when Fianna Fáil were in office and each autumn we were treated to the delight of every Department having a Supplementary Estimate to provide more money for Departments which had been under-provided for because they could not hold the line of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit will be about £138 million higher than that which has been predicted.  I will give some specific details of how I believe the figures are wrong.  First, a detailed estimate of £2,813 million has been made for public sector pay.  That provides a 2 per cent increase from 1 May covering the existing pay round to the end of June.  Every 1 per cent extra in public sector pay in the next round will be equal to £28 million. I remember only too well, as a backbencher supporting the previous Government, that we provided no money in any financial year for the period beyond the expiration of a pay round.  That is a sound and reasonable pay negotiating stance. You should not show your hand as to how much you are going to give.  I have very serious doubts that the Government will be able to hold the line.  I certainly hope they hold the line in terms of the zero pay increase beyond 1 June.  There is under-provision for this area and there is an accepted practice to deal with that.</P>
    <P>The second area where there is a fundamental under-provision is the social welfare area.  The forecast for unemployment for the year is 242,000 taking into account the Jobsearch programme and the people who allegedly are going to be removed from the social welfare system.  Those assumptions are incorrect and social welfare expenditure will be about £12 million higher than expected. There are 7,000 or 8,000 people employed in the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1958" /> and to imagine that an extra 25 people deployed from the Department of the Public Service will collect an extra £10 million is simply fallacious.  If 7,000 or 8,000 people cannot do that work, I do not see what an extra 25 people will do. If you work it out it means that those 25 people will have to collect £1,600 for every working day for this whole year in order to collect the £10 million.  I would be generous in saying that that figure is £5 million on the wrong side: it could be £10 million on the wrong side.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 48-hour travel allowance change.  It is a novel idea and is certainly worth pursuing.  There is a projected saving of £20 million in terms of Border savings but I believe there will be a shortfall of £10 million.  The U-turn on the housing grants will cost an additional £10 million.  The Government will not completely hold the line on the jobs embargo across the board, particularly in the health services.  They will not be able to do so in certain critical services.  A saving of £11 million has been provided for there but that saving will be nearer to £6 million. There will be a £5 million differential there.</P>
    <P>If you look at the first quarter returns in terms of revenue and expenditure, you will see that the position is quite strongly out of kilter.  In the past number of years it has always taken the financial returns for the last quarter for the position to rally.  There is a negative buoyancy factor at work.  If the overall provision of taxes is to rise by 6.4 per cent in this budget there has to be a negative buoyancy.  A change is required there.</P>
    <P>The clouds have started to lift a little and they will lift a little more when the Finance Bill is introduced.  When it is seen that companies who can prove they do not have tax liability for the 35 per cent confiscation that will take place for a year will be entitled to an interim refund, it will very quickly appear that the majority of smaller professional services that are provided will be eligible for that refund, resulting in a substantial shortfall of £10 million of the estimated revenue of £25 million.  In those projections I have not gone into obvious <Col N="1959" /> areas where I recall, as a backbencher, our Government ran into acute difficulties of extra expenditure such as the double Christmas bonus for pensioners and other social welfare recipients.  What will happen when the compensatory payments introduced under the EC equality directive expire on 17 November?  Many people will call to the clinics of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour TDs saying they cannot take this cut of £20 a week. I am not saying the Government should cave in.  My prediction, knowing them of old, is that they are likely to cave in to some of these pressures and, therefore, the budget arithmetic in my view does not hold water.</P>
    <P>There are many other different issues that will arise: I have seen examples such as the PMPA and the ICI, although they are not good examples.  Other matters will arise such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident and so on.  There is a very grave danger that at the end of the day the current budget deficit will be somewhere between £100 million and £150 million on the wrong side of what is predicted.  If I had to pick a specific figure it would be about £130 million.  That will shove the Exchequer borrowing requirement over £2 billion and will set awry the overall financial targets of the Government.</P>
    <P>This budget is unfair in its treatment of a particular section of the community &mdash; the PAYE taxpayers.  These people are very bitter.  I called to many housing estates during the election campaign and met factory workers who earn £130 a week and people next door on social welfare benefits.  The employed people were extremely bitter that they get nothing for nothing and have to pay for everything. That low to middle income group have been savagely hit in this budget.  PAYE receipts are due to rise by 9.5 per cent. The 820,000 people on PAYE comprise many low paid people who are trying to rear families in difficult circumstances, people who are just over the medical card limit and people who are in real hardship. The extra £333 million that will come in from PAYE will come out of their pockets.  They will pay extra PRSI; they <Col N="1960" /> will be directly affected by the in-patient health charges; they will be affected by increased school transport charges; they will be affected by increased local authority charges; those with children in third level education, most notably in RTCs, will be affected by increases in fees; they will lose 10 per cent of their mortgage tax relief; they will have to pay more for their life assurance and, overall, their average household costs will be increased by about £10 a week.  It is very hard to generalise or to pick averages.  If people are in the VHI their fees will undoubtedly rise.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the people I am speaking about desperately require an incentive to work harder. They are the new poor. They are not eligible for anything.  They have to get up earlier in the morning and work harder.  The more overtime they work, which is the only way out of that situation, the harder they will be hit.  In certain cases we could be talking about a 10 per cent cut in their disposable incomes as a result of this budget.  It would have been a lot better to go to town on the black economy, on wasteful State bodies in the industrial and training area where 3,500 people are employed and £400 million a year is spent.  It would have been better to put the boot in there or to deal with the very wealthy rather than to go for the soft target of the easily collectable income of the low to middle income group.  They have every right to be bitter and resentful of the changes that were made between the January presentation of the budget and this budget when they see how their incomes will be hit.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy D. O'Malley on Tuesday, 7 April 1987:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the <Col N="1961" /> Government to take the necessary steps to facilitate the sale of shares in such State Companies as are thought appropriate and feasible, to employees of such Companies, to members of the public, to Irish pension funds and other institutions; to sell such other appropriate State owned assets as are not needed for national strategic purposes, and to apply the proceeds of such sales in the reduction of public debt and the stimulation of economic and employment expansion.</P>

    <P>Reaffirms its support for an efficient and profitable semi-State sector as a major instrument for economic development and the provision of employment, and endorses the policy of the Government in maintaining and developing a viable semi-State sector which will provide an efficient, cost-effective service to the general public and activity pursue opportunities for growth.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment to amendment a1:</P>
    <P>To add to the amendment after &ldquo;growth&rdquo; the words:</P>
    <P>and urges the Government to include, as part of this policy, the selective sales of shares in State Companies to members of the public, Irish pension funds and other institutions on the following basis:</P>
    <P>(a)  where an element of significant public interest is involved, the State would continue to hold a majority of the equity or would adopt such other measures as are necessary to protect the public interest in question,</P>
    <P>(b)  the continued growth of, and employment in, the enterprise and sectors concerned would be a major concern in structuring any sale of shares and in the application of the proceeds,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> (c)  subject to (a) and (b) above, the proceeds would be applied to the reduction of public debt, the reduction in demands for equity that would otherwise be made on the State, and the stimulation of economic and employment expansion generally,</P>
    <P>(d)  a guiding factor would be the need to ensure that public sector enterprise is a dynamic and flexible factor in the economy generally, moving forward in sectors where development needs are greatest, rather than confining itself in sectors in which the State has had a traditional commercial involvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael amendment in this debate differs from the motion put forward by the Progressive Democrats in three respects.</P>
      <P>1.  Our approach makes specific provision to protect the public interest in companies where this arises, either by retaining majority ownership, or by other methods such as holding a &ldquo;golden&rdquo; share which gives specific rights to the State.</P>
      <P>2.  There is also a requirement that any disposal of shares must take account of the jobs of those in the company in question, and in the sector generally.</P>
      <P>3.  The Fine Gael amendment makes it clear that, for us, the sale of certain shares is part of a strategy for making the public sector more dynamic and flexible.  Whether or not the State remains the exclusive owner of a particular productive asset should be a pragmatic business decision, not an ideological one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> This latter point is important.  Ideologists who say that, once the State has bought a company, it can never sell it, are artificially imprisoning State enterprise.  If it can never get out, the State will be reluctant ever to get in.  Rigid ideological opposition to the sale of State productive assets, is, in fact, a policy profoundly hostile to the idea of a dynamic, efficient State sector, generating wealth and creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, of course, agree with the Government that there should be no indiscriminate sales of assets.  We favour selective sales of shares, which is not a policy of Governments of one particular political hue.</P>
    <P>For example, the Socialist Government in Spain is selling off textile companies, travel and tourist companies and the motor manufacturer Seat, all of which had been nationalised under General Franco.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Socialist Government in Sweden is selling electronics and forestry and banks.  Why is the Left in Ireland so conservative that it cannot see the need for similar flexibility in State enterprise here?  The sale of State enterprises is not contrary to the interests of workers or trade unionists.</P>
    <P>For example, the trade unions in Amersham International, British Aerospace, Britoil, and Cable and Wireless &mdash; all companies privatised in Britain &mdash; report improvements in the way these companies consulted unions, and in their general attitudes to unions, after they had been privatised, in contrast with practice while in public ownership.</P>
    <P>The sale of shares in State companies to the general public provides an opportunity to give the workers in the companies shares as well.  Under our present rigid policy, nobody, except the Minister for Finance, may own a share.  This is hostile to the whole idea of individual employee shareholding.</P>
    <P>The sale of shares in State companies to the public is in line with the original concept of Paddy McGilligan and Sean Lemass.  It should be noted that Irish <Col N="1964" /> State enterprises are entitled &ldquo;State-sponsored companies&rdquo;, not &ldquo;nationalised industries&rdquo;.  The original Irish concept was that the State should sponsor the enterprise.  Once initially sponsored, there was no inherent reason why the company should not grow up, and cease to be dependent on the State for further injections of capital, after the initial sponsoring.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the proceeds from the sale of shares in State companies can be used either to reduce the public debt, or to invest in new or expanded activities.  In the National Development Corporation (NADCORP) the State now has a commercially orientated statutorily established vehicle which can use funds realised from sales to create jobs in new enterprises.  Thus the State can get many more jobs for each pound it has employed than if it left the money imprisoned in its original investment.</P>
    <P>Ireland is crippled by high interest rates which are dragging down industries.  They are caused by excess Government debt. If the sale of State enterprises can help to reduce this debt it can give all enterprises &mdash; public as well as private &mdash; a chance to survive.</P>
    <P>One does not have to accept the huge sale values &mdash; £1,000 million for BGE. £800 million for forests, £400-£550 million for Bord Telecom Éireann, £430-£550 million for the ESB, £150 million for Aer Lingus and £40 million for Aer Rianta &mdash; quoted by Professor Converey of UCD &mdash; to know that the intelligent sale of assets can cut the national debt dramatically.</P>
    <P>If this can be done the nation can be liberated from a great burden, and a frustrated dynamic released in Irish society. This would protect the jobs of those in the present public enterprises and create many thousands more as well.</P>
    <P>A word of caution in conclusion.  Privately owned monopolies are as bad as publicly owned ones.  Sales of shares must be accompanied by a competition policy that ensures that no large company can rip off the consumer.  The Fair Trade Bill promoted by the previous Government &mdash; which extended competition rules to <Col N="1965" /> the State monopolies &mdash; must be enacted urgently.  Otherwise the sale of State companies could be a step backwards, not a step forwards.</P>
    <P>The sale of shares, even of a minority holding, will automatically improve the management of public enterprises.  The new private shareholders will demand accountability to commercial, rather than political, considerations.  New private shareholders will insist that the delayed decision making, layers of consultation, restrictions on staff remuneration and vulnerability to nit picking that have characterised State-sponsored companies must be swept away.</P>
    <P>Before the election the Taoiseach categorically opposed privatisation.  Last night's speech by the Minister for Finance contains signs of a change.  The Minister said that he did &ldquo;not rule out the possibility of ... changes including some arrangements with private companies&rdquo;. It was interesting too that his opposition was to &ldquo;indiscriminate&rdquo; sales of shares. Nobody ever suggested indiscriminate sales anyway, so it looks as if the Minister for Finance is getting gently off the hook on which he was needlessly placed by his leader before the election.  I trust that the Government will, therefore, be able to accept the Fine Gael supplement to their amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody but, of course, the truth always hurts.  NET were in serious financial difficulties. Then we had a joint venture in the private and public sectors of which I approved and I have directed that it should be followed through.  Private enterprise did not get involved on a minority stake basis and it is hypocritical to think that hard nosed business people in financial institutions will invest in small minority stakes just for the sake of rescuing the economy.  It will take more than that to sort out our problems.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton rightly said that the biggest issue facing us at present is the level of interest rates.  Since we came to office our first priority has been to take the necessary action and decisions to provide the opportunity and the climate for a reduction in interest rates.  We have just completed this.  I hope the financial markets respond in the interests of the private and public sectors.  If someone asks where we stand at this stage it should be well known that we are sound, sensible and pragmatic people and we always take decisions with a common sense approach.</P>

      <P>We are not hung up on ideological grounds in relation to it.  The Government's amendment to this motion has the very important virtue which is missing in the motion and the other amendments.  Our amendment does not arise from a doctrinaire position on State enterprises.  There is, for example, a very fashionable argument for privatisation for the sake of selling off assets.  I do not believe that this is any more reasonable than the equally doctrinaire view that nationalisation and growth of State ownership are the way to achieve growth and services for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Government motion states, our commitment to the State-sponsored <Col N="1967" /> sector, which was largely created under Fianna Fáil Governments, is no less now than it was before.  We all recall the great days of the late Seán Lemass whose brainchild it was to create many of the semi-State sectors we have today; they had to fill a role in a vacuum that was not being taken up by private enterprise.  This is not to say that 20, 25 or 30 years later we should not evaluate their role and the terms of reference they were given.  If those have to be changed and the directions have to be changed, it is only common sense and a pragmatic approach to do so.  We consider that the country has benefited from State enterprise activities but that does not mean we are not prepared to look again at the performance and role of State enterprises to ensure that they meet the needs of today and give the return to the State which the people have a right to expect.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a few points made in the debate so far, one of which was raised by Deputy Bruton, and is important. It was suggested that bureaucratic control can impair the functioning of State enterprises by tending to slow down decision making because of the need for various layers of Government to be consulted about proposals.  Deputy Bruton implied that valuable opportunities are lost because of this requirement that State enterprises give an account of themselves. I can only reply that, if that situation obtained under the last Government, I too think it was a pity. I accept that it is necessary for State companies to be free to take quick business decisions.  In relation to the day to day business activities and the medium term strategies it is important that they have the necessary flexibility to operate.</P>
    <P>When I look at the record of the last Government in this regard I have to say quite honestly that whatever they say now they did not act in accordance with it when they were in Government because the heavy hand of the State was felt more and more in the State sector. Whatever excuses they used to convince themselves to do it that is the reality of what happened.  We all know what <Col N="1968" /> happens when the heavy hand of the Government is felt to the extent that good business decisions cannot be taken. I have had experience in this regard and I have always believed that State enterprises need the maximum amount of freedom to take business decisions and to take up opportunities which may arise, because opportunity comes by and does not pause.</P>
    <P>There is also a duty on Ministers and their Departments to ensure that State companies' operations and their areas of activity are the best use of resources and talents to satisfy today's needs and to realise today's priorities.  State companies must be accountable for their operations.  For example, it is incumbent on Governments to ensure that State-owned companies do not add to inflation by increasing costs unreasonably to the general public or to other businesses. Also I hope Deputy Bruton would not suggest that State companies should be permitted to develop long term corporate strategies and plans without any requirement that they should give an account of themselves which can meet with the approbation of Government.</P>
    <P>In the past we have seen many examples of State companies who are there to provide services at a competitive cost to the users in the economy, but how many times has the imposition of costs by particular companies not alone contributed to inflation, but, because of their monopoly situation, imposed costs on the private sector and industry in general that could not be recovered in the open and free marketplace?  If industry is to grow we all have to be competitive; the State sector has to be competitive; the private sector has to be competitive; and above all we cannot allow the State sector to impose higher costs than can be recovered in normal situations in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Also in the course of this debate it was suggested that one motivation of Government in maintaining ownership of State enterprises may be due to some quirk of the Irish personality that leaves us, as a people, obsessed with the ownership of assets.  This is true and it can be attributed <Col N="1969" /> to our historic background.  For too long we were the tenants and not the landlords and perhaps even at this stage it still lingers on.  This may be so but I would not put the same weight on it as other speakers in this debate have done.</P>
    <P>I note that the example of this obsession cited by both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Bruton is that of the desire of Irish people to own their own homes and they characterise this as less useful for national development than applying the funds which go into housing to investment in share ownership.  This is an idea which our colleagues on the other side of the House might wish to bring to the notice of all of those people in the country who are trying to or hoping to buy their own homes.  It occurs to me that one question which those people might put to them would be: &ldquo;But, if we invest in business rather than in purchasing houses will the State provide all the houses and will the State do so at a charge that will be less than what we have to pay building societies or other financial institutions so that we will have something left over to invest in industry and business?&rdquo;  I am not sure how they might answer that and, indeed, I am not sure how that policy which they recommend would square with the recommendation by Deputy Colley, in the course of this debate, that there should be increased private ownership of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>There is clear contradiction in the points being put forward in this debate. While I accept that Irish industry is suffering from a very low equity base and that it needs money to be invested in it to allow it to expand, nevertheless the impediments to the investment are stopping it going in; money will flow to where it can get the best return.  While I commend the business expansion scheme, there are too many strictures in it which impede the free flow of money in and out.  Improvements could be made in it but it is not just a question of trying to choose one investment rather than other. Investors and money will always flow to where they will get the best return.</P>
    <P>Whatever answer Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Bruton might give, I think <Col N="1970" /> that it is a little frivolous to suggest that State ownership of companies and businesses in the semi-State sector is the product of some sort of psychological conditioning.  It is the Government's policy to ensure that State-sponsored companies play their role in national economic development.  It is in pursuit of that role that assets can be held.</P>
    <P>It is certainly not the case that the Government are obsessed with the ownership of assets.  The previous Government in a decision on the Estimates for 1987 decided to raise £3 million by bringing forward the sale of the crop in immature non-amenity State forests and that most of the money raised should be used to acquire and plant an additional 1,000 hectares over and above what was planted last year.  The Government are committed to implementing this decision.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to offer stands of around 20 to 25 years of age which have approximately a further 15 to 20 years of their rotation still to run.  The sales will be targeted principally at long term investors such as those investing pension funds who can be expected to manage the crop until maturity.  Can anybody point the finger and accuse us of having idealogical hang-ups in the way in which we approach that matter?</P>
    <P>In these transactions only the standing timber crop will be sold &mdash; the land will remain the property of the State and will be available eventually for further forest development when the current crop is clearfelled by the purchaser.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Government see nothing wrong in this method of financing the further development of forestry in this country.  It has the great merit of achieving expansion and development of the forest resource without recourse to additional State funding.  The advantage of this approach is reflected in a possible national planting target this year, for both State and private planting, of 11,000 hectares &mdash; a target never previously achieved in this country.  The process of selecting stands for sale is in hand and the initial lots will be advertised for sale in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has also asked about <Col N="1971" /> my intentions with respect to bringing, for example, organisations such as the ESB, Telecom and An Post within the ambit of existing competition and consumer protection legislation.  I am examining the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill which was published by the previous Government, with a view to deciding whether the Bill should be reintroduced in the Dail.  I have put it forward to the Government for a decision in that regard.  One of the effects of the Bill, in its present form, would be to move a number of exemptions in relation to such areas as communications, banking and electricity from existing competition legislation, thus bringing such sectors within the scope of restrictive practices and competition legislation for the first time.  I agree with that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the best examples of a highly successful semi-State body, who have served as a major instrument for economic development and the provision of employment, are Aer Lingus.  It is now fifty years since the State decided to set up Aer Lingus &mdash; in 1986 the company, as Deputies will be well aware, celebrated their 50th anniversary &mdash; and in the intervening period the company, who were set up to provide this country with an independent means of access by air to Britain and mainland Europe, have grown and developed and spread their wings far and wide.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus employ over 5,000 people in Ireland and carry the vast bulk of air travel segment of tourists to Ireland.  As Ireland's flag carrier on the North Atlantic, they have over the years provided a year round service between Ireland and the United States which makes a major contribution to the development of trade, commerce and tourism between the two countries.  Notwithstanding the increased participation in recent years by US carriers in the US-Ireland market, Aer Lingus remain the dominant carrier on the North Atlantic routes and continue to play a major role in developing and maintaining Ireland's links with the United States.  They also provide the <Col N="1972" /> necessary links with London and other points in the UK and have successfully pioneered the development of routes to continental Europe.</P>
    <P>Because of the cyclical nature of air transport, it is difficult for an airline to sustain a profitable operation, particularly when providing a year-round service on the North Atlantic.  In those circumstances Aer Lingus decided during the sixties to develop ancillary activities to support their core business by earning surpluses which could be used to cushion losses on the air transport side.  With Government encouragement these activities have grown substantially over the years.  Some of these ancillary activities, such as aircraft overhaul and airline traffic handling, are closely linked to the company's air transport activities.  Other non-airline ancillaries, such as hotels in the United States and PARC, which specialises in personnel recruitment and project management services, were developed as opportunities presented themselves.  The company's policy in this area has been highly successful, with ancillary activities making a major contribution to the excellent results Aer Lingus have produced in recent years.</P>
    <P>In the 20 year period 1960 to 1980 Aer Lingus returned profits on a consistent basis.  A serious downturn occurred in the late seventies, coinciding with the world economic recession and a general slump in the world airline industry.  In 1981-82, the company recorded net losses in excess of £9 million but these losses were converted to a net profit of £4.97 million in 1983-84.  In 1984-85 a net profit of £11.6 million was recorded and the following year, 1985-86, the net profit figure had grown to £16.6 million.  I am sure Deputies will agree that this turnaround in the financial performance of Aer Lingus was a significant and praiseworthy achievement on which the board, management and staff must be complimented.</P>
    <P>Their achievements are a clear example of a commercial semi-State body's approach to the development of a core business, to the development of ancillary business, all linked and making <Col N="1973" /> their contribution towards the maintenance of a national airline.  Would anybody have said that they should not have been allowed to do those things?  Would anybody have said we should not have a national airline or that we should sell off the national airline and depend on others to provide the service for us?  Would our industrial expansion have continued? Would we have found ourselves in bad market positions being cut off from the rest of the world?  Those are the major national questions which have been looked at and which have to be evaluated before we come to a quick off the top of the head decision as to what to do with a national airline.</P>
    <P>There are those who would argue that a drifting into the hotel situation should never have been contemplated.  I have no doubt that successive Ministers for Finance have been told time and again by the Department of Finance that the ancillary services should be got rid of, that the hotels are now worth a lot of money and that they, too, should be got rid of.</P>
    <P>That is a quick fix solution to getting the figures right in a one year budget but it ignores the national requirements and where national development is going.  We cannot over-rely on others.  The commercial market is such that they run when there is profit and when there is no profit, they stop running.  That is the reality of commercial life.</P>
    <P>Over the next ten to 15 years, Aer Lingus will have to face the major problem of fleet replacement.  The cost is enormous.  We are talking of hundreds of millions of pounds.  The question of the financing of this expenditure has now to be addressed.  My colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, informed the House last week, in reply to a parliamentary question, that the Aer Lingus fleet replacement and its financing are currently under examination by an interdepartmental review group.  He indicated also that decisions on the means of financing fleet replacement will not be taken until the review group's report has been considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>There are people who say that the <Col N="1974" /> Government have to provide the money. There are many ways of financing fleet replacement other than looking to the Government for money.  If there are people around who are prepared to put hundreds of millions of pounds into a minority stake in Aer Lingus, I do not know who they are.  Those who say there are such people should realise that that sort of investment does not take place when what is involved is a minority stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government see forestry as an area which offers considerable scope for development, employment, import substitution, domestic and export market expansion.  To achieve this, however, they consider there is a need to give State forestry a structure which will allow it to maximise this potential for the benefit of this country. This is not in any way to decry or ignore the great work done by State forestry to date.  Indeed we are all aware of the valuable contribution it has made to the development of our forests, timber industries and, through its amenities, to the creation of a greater public awareness and appreciation of its many social benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it has now reached a stage where a greater emphasis has to be placed on the adoption of a more commercial approach to its many operations.  For this reason it is both timely and opportune that its present structure within a Government Department be changed to one which will give it the scope and freedom to achieve the Government's aim of <Col N="1976" /> greater commercial flexibility.  The process of examining this is in hand at present.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are many Deputies, if any, who would disagree that the timber business and the development of our forests cannot be developed effectively from a State Department.  The heavy hand of bureaucracy does not allow those sectors to make the necessary decisions.  Timber is a commodity that must respond to the prices in the marketplace. If we continue with the old methods imports of timber will rise and we will be faced with higher prices as the prices on world markets change.  It must be obvious to everybody that we are importing too much timber from Russia and Sweden.  I am not saying we are not making progress and using more home produced timber but we have a long way to go.  I accept that the percentage has increased and that the trend is going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Timber is a commodity that will be in scarce supply in Britain and throughout Europe.  It is predicted that imports into the EC up to the end of the century and beyond will continue at a high level.  I understand that imports to the UK will be in the region of 50 per cent of their requirements.  It is important that we move forward and make our timber and forestry industries viable.  If we do not they will be suffocated by the heavy hand of bureaucracy which attempts to run a business that the system does not allow it to run.  I do not think this is any different from what I faced when, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I agreed to two of the largest businesses in the country, those responsible for the post and telephones, being moved from the State to the semi-State sector.  An Post and Bord Telecom have proved how right I was in that move.  They have given an example of how developments can take place in the semi-State sector.  The two companies have had a marvellous record of success.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have mentioned Irish Life in this debate.  Let me be quite clear in this regard.  No decisions have been taken by Government on the company's future and no commitments have <Col N="1977" /> been made or entered into.  It has been confirmed to the House in answer to questions that exploratory discussions have taken place at official level in recent months and these will continue.  Given the benefits suggested from a sale of State shares in the company it is important that the matter be fully explored.  I can go no further than that.  I cannot, and will not, engage in speculation as to what a sale of the State's interest would raise, should that course be decided on.  There are a number of factors and issues to be decided including changes in legislation before any such evaluation could be attempted with a reasonable degree of certainty.  I agree, certainly, that the dividend return to the State from Irish Life does not reflect the asset worth.</P>
    <P>Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd., (ITI), is a body in whose establishment I had a hand.  I foresaw it then, in 1979 and later, as a useful instrument in sourcing the funding for the planned, orderly development of the telecommunications network.  My own intention was not alone that it should raise loan finance but also that it might develop into an agency for attracting some private capital into the telecommunications area.  I cite this attitude of my own, of some years' standing, to show that the positions which we in this Government take today on issues of private participation in State bodies are not the things of fashion.  Our interests and intentions in this connection arise out of what is needed for development.</P>
    <P>A further example of the Government's will to deal with each State enterprise in the light of their own unique situation and merits is the case of the NET-ICI joint venture.  As Deputies are aware, the previous Government approved the broad outlines of a proposal for such a joint venture before they left office.  I, too, have accepted the concept of the joint venture which is based on a 51 per cent State shareholding and a 49 per cent holding by ICI.  Consequently, I have directed our negotiators that the necessary steps are to be taken to complete arrangements for putting the joint venture in place.  Those are just some <Col N="1978" /> examples that I cite to illustrate the Government intention.</P>
    <P>I do not think there can be any doubt about the views of the Government in regard to the development of the State and semi-State sectors.  We are sensible, commonsense and pragmatic people who will adopt the right approach in the best interests of the country.  Unlike other Members, we do not have ideological hang-ups or hold the view that we cannot do certain things because principles die hard.  We are here to do a job in the best interests of the Irish people and we will pursue development in the State and semi-State sectors.  We will continue to create the environment for more growth in those sectors.  However, there are no easy times ahead for those sectors and the private sector also will have to become more competitive if it is to continue to exist in a cost-competitive environment. Those in that sector should not think they can rely on the State for handouts or additional equity.  We have a job to do in this competitive world and the State sector has to take the challenge on board, like the private sector.  I hope that demonstrates where we stand in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for that well spread, well thought-out, serious and effervescent degree of confusion which he has spread among the parties on this side of the House.  The most positive thing I can say is that we will not have to debate this topic for another six months.  I have heard Members term this the great ideological debate.  One would almost feel ashamed nowadays to have principles about anything when one hears talk about the dead hand of the State, the intervention of the State and so on.  We seem to be reduced to about £3 million worth of immature forestry, an ICI-NET joint venture in a world which is awash with fertilizer and an Irish Life analysis which is of a highly speculative nature.  There has been talk about a national airline which is chronically short of capital funds and continues to make a loss on a service we all praise it for running on the North Atlantic.  That <Col N="1979" /> is not the most fertile ground to open a debate or discussion on the whole concept of privatisation.</P>

      <P>At a time when the country is not setting world headlines with regard to new inventions or new concepts, we are left with the concept of privatisation.  It strikes me as being a relatively new invention in Irish life.  It obviously owes its origin to a mixture of things, including the ideological fixation with the magic of the marketplace and the somewhat less noble idea of delivering the goods to financial backers.  There are pressures from various interested parties to sell the idea that the State should divest itself of all of the profitable enterprises in which it is involved as elements in the private sector seek risk-free ways of investing substantial amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the political parties and personalities who are interested in privatisation, whatever their motivation, were slick enough to realise that they could not come out into the open and identify what exactly they were interested <Col N="1980" /> in.  I am open to correction on this point, but I believe that the word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; does not appear on the motion we are debating or on any of the amendments thereto.  Generally people who are in favour of this concept tend to avoid using the word and have taken to calling their concept &ldquo;public ownership&rdquo; and using grand phrases like &ldquo;the democratisation of ownership&rdquo; or &ldquo;a share-owning democracy&rdquo;.  The purpose of this jargon and propaganda is to disguise the real meaning of privatisation.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to begin any contribution to this debate by defining what privatisation means.  It means taking away from the public the assets which the public already own and selling them to the highest bidder without any guarantee that the public, who own the assets, will see any return whatever.  That concept of privatisation, especially as defined by its propagandists, is an unusual one. They would have us believe that in some way taking what we own from us and selling it to someone else actually enhances our ownership.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We will get to that too.  It is little wonder that all but the most crass of those who favour privatisation have some difficulty with the concept themselves. In the recent general election great play was made of the fact that it was not in the strategic national interest to retain ownership of the Great Southern Hotels.  Speakers for Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats were at pains to point out that selling the hotels would improve their efficiency and profitability and would provide some much-needed cash for the State's other purposes.  That was the view expressed all over the country, except in the counties where jobs depend on those hotels, the same jobs which were threatened the last time there was talk of selling off the hotels.  When the right-wing parties got into Kerry, Wexford or Galway the talk was somewhat modified from the usual concepts <Col N="1981" /> which were spoken of here in the metropolis and it was about how wonderful it would be if workers in the hotels had a chance to buy some shares and about how much better and more secure those workers would feel if they owned their own enterprises.</P>
      <P>This is not the only inconsistency that has emerged in the public as opposed to the private campaign in favour of privatisation. It quickly became clear during the election that Fine Gael were not prepared to say publicly that they were in favour of privatisation.  They were in favour instead of &ldquo;attracting private investment into publicly owned companies to enhance the development possibilities of those companies&rdquo;.  Even when the absurdity of this proposition was pointed out in relation to Aer Lingus, for example, the proposal was maintained as a useful cover for the real thing.</P>
      <P>It has never been shown that privatisation would enhance the potential of any of our existing State companies. Taking the example of Aer Lingus, it has been argued that private sector money investing in up to 49 per cent of the company would provide the capital base Aer Lingus will need for fleet replacement and other purposes in the next few years. But 49 per cent of Aer Lignus would realise only a fraction of the £1 billion it has been estimated would be needed for those purposes.  Hundreds of millions would still need to be borrowed.  Would the private interests controlling the 49 per cent be prepared to guarantee those borrowings?  Would they seek no conditions in return?  Would such guarantees be acceptable if the 49 per cent was spread over thousands of small shareholders, or would it be necessary to concentrate control of that 49 per cent in a small number of hands in order for it to be effective?  The answers to these questions are well known to the people who are proposing this concept; yet they propose the concept as if it were the simplest thing in the world, a sort of workers' paradise where bus drivers and air hostesses would dip into their savings to cough up £100 million here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> On a more serious note, one needs to look in some detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Seriousness befits the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the assets we are talking about.  What are they?  Why are some enterprises already owned by the public and why is it better that they should remain in public ownership?</P>
      <P>It is possible to divide the State's assets into several different categories.  Many of them are in the form of productive enterprises, some of them profitable, others with a potential for profit.  Of course we have to ensure, through more effective management and a high degree of motivation and co-operation, that all of the State's enterprises are making a contribution, not only to their shareholders, the people of this country, but also to general economic growth.  But we have already shown that can be done in small companies like the Great Southern Hotels and in great companies like Aer Lingus, and we have shown that it can be done in a public sector context, which is so maligned nowadays.</P>
      <P>Other companies run by the State provide essential services, many of them of a strategic nature, such as transport. There is no doubt that there are elements of these companies which would be attractive to the private sector, but selling them would have the inevitable consequence that the social element of the service provided would quickly be lost sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still other State companies, or companies in which the State has a significant shareholding, are involved in the development of natural resources.  I believe as a matter of fundamental principle that the development of our natural resources, whether we are talking about gas, turf, wood, or food, must be carried out in the interests of the people as a whole.  This can only be done by maintaining a very high level of public sector involvement.  Selling any of these enterprises in return for a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; of cash is selling out the longer term interests of the people.  It might well generate short <Col N="1983" /> term popularity for whoever proposes it, but it is not what I or the Labour Party are in politics to do.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I have a very strong recollection of the Taoiseach, when he was Leader of the Opposition, lecturing me in this House about the need to develop our natural resources in oil, while warning me against taking any action that might speed that development. I take this opportunity to return the compliment &mdash; and it is timely, considering the publicity in recent days about the start of a new drilling campaign.  The changes I made to the oil licensing terms, with the approval of the Government, are bearing fruit in this new work.  They provide the right balance between the interests of all the people, on the one hand, and the need to provide incentives in difficult times.  If and when oil comes ashore, I trust the Taoiseach will have the grace to remember where the incentive came from.  No doubt he will be reminded.  In the meantime the Labour Party will be watching developments closely to ensure that the balance of advantage remains with the Irish people and is not disturbed by any unnecessary concessions on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I must refer to one more category of public enterprise.  At present there are a number of enterprises in public hands because, and only because, the private sector made a total mess of them when they owned them.  These are not instances of the State stepping into a gap. People had to be rescued from the consequences of private sector incompetence, consequences which include very considerable losses and inconvenience.  I do not believe it is necessary for me to remind the House of some of the more recent examples with which we are all too familiar where the situation could have been totally catastrophic had the State not stepped in, in most cases at the request of the private sector.  As I mention these enterprises I am reminded there are, in addition, hundreds of enterprises in the private sector which needed at one time or another great injections of <Col N="1984" /> cash from the taxpayer through the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and other State agencies. The involvement of the State in boosting, or supporting, or rescuing private enterprise is taken almost as a matter of course, even though it can be said that the taxpayer gets little or no thanks for it.</P>
    <P>If these are the categories of State enterprise the next question that must be asked is: who wants to buy them?  Where has this sudden interest in buying State companies come from?  For many months now we have heard about the difficulties facing Irish investors.  High interest rates, small markets, difficulties in borrowing capital &mdash; these are some of the reasons frequently given for the failure of our entrepreneurs to create jobs.</P>
    <P>If one wanted to define a project which was anathema to the private sector, it would have the following characteristics: it would need large investment; it would have a high risk element; and profits would be small or slow to develop. Because a great many public enterprises have these characteristics, all over the world the State has a major input, usually with exclusive control of all the key utilities and natural resource areas, posts, telecommunications, electricity, gas and public transport.  The private sector has not interested itself a great deal in any of these areas in the past.</P>
    <P>All of these are areas which require an enormous amount of investment, and a certain degree of risk.  In the case of some of these areas, because there is a substantial and necessary social content to the service provided, sustained profitability is difficult.  Given these characteristics, and what I said a moment ago about projects which are anathema to the private sector why, then, would the private sector suddenly begin to show an interest in enterprises of this sort?  The reason is obvious.  In the public enterprises concerned, the investment has been made already; the market has been captured; so the risk is minimised and the profit potential is known.  But the investment has been made by the State on behalf of the people, and the people are entitled to see that that investment is <Col N="1985" /> fully protected.  It cannot be protected if the private sector is allowed to take a share of the action.</P>
    <P>In every single case of privatisation so far in Britain, the people who bought shares in public enterprises were able to trade them at a profit within 24 hours. The reason is that the Government allowed those shares to be sold in the first place for substantially less than their real value in order to make a success of the policy.  It would not do if you were to offer a public company for sale and the offer was under-subscribed.  But the net result was that the people who really owned those companies, the people of Britain, have so far lost billions on the sale of the companies concerned.  Is there an alternative approach, a more positive way for those with money to invest and to contribute to the economy?  I believe there is, and there is ample opportunity.</P>
    <P>One of the major achievements of the last Government was the passage into law of the Act establishing the National Development Corporation.  I must say in passing, that I am glad the present Government have decided to retain the NDC, despite their oft made earlier threats and the derision with which they have always treated it in the past.  It was gratifying to hear, in the Fianna Fáil Party political broadcast in the wake of the budget, the belief expressed that the NDC could make a major contribution to job creation and investment.  It was rather unfortunate that they could not have said that in the debate in the House at that time.</P>
    <P>The Irish people in both the public and private sectors could have taken the initiative and responded to a positive political initiative.  But when the opportunity presented itself Fianna Fáil took the soft option for the sake of providing opposition. I believe that is regrettable.  Each issue has to be analysed on its merits. That was one opportunity to do so.  Many people who believed in the concept and wanted to subscribe and contribute to it are now quite reluctant and reticent about it because they feel there has been a major political divide on the NDC since their establishment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> The creation of a body such as the NDC has been an important priority for the Labour Party for many years.  We have argued that there is every reason why the State should get itself involved in the creation of viable, self-sustaining jobs in each and every sector of the economy where scope can be found.  The principal reason why this is necessary is that, despite all the subsidies and incentives &mdash; and there are many &mdash; despite all the effort made to produce a climate as beneficial as possible, the private sector has not succeeded in creating the tens of thousands of jobs which are badly needed.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, many private sector companies are unwilling to take the risks that are sometimes necessary.  Others are unwilling to tie up capital for a long period of time before seeing a return. Others stipulate a very high level of potential profit before expressing a willingness to invest, and do not always measure profit in terms of the social contribution made through job creation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the NDC will enable us to bring a different equation into play.  While the NDC will &mdash; and should &mdash; operate to the highest and best commercial standards in selecting investments and in making management decisions, they will have at the forefront of their priorities the need to respond to our unemployment problem.  They will have the power to do so on their own or in co-operation with the other sectors of the economy: the agricultural sector, private manufacturing or service industries, or the co-operative sector itself.  In the role they can and should play there is enormous scope for the private sector to get involved both in joint ventures, and in projects of its own, assisted by the NDC.</P>
    <P>There is something of a myth about the attitude of those of us on the left to cooperate with the private sector.  It is worth reiterating a point I have made in this connection before.  There seem to be some who believe that we lack enthusiasm for productive, efficient effort leading to adequate profit.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  No one could <Col N="1987" /> be more supportive than I of a genuine partnership between the public and private sectors.  But regrettably it has been my experience that, when others talk about partnership, they frequently mean a sharing where the public sector is guaranteed to lose out.  In too many cases the public sector is invited to share the risk, while the private sector is invited to share the profit.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that the private sector is less interested in genuine joint ventures, the kind where risk, as well as profit, is shared.  If they were interested in such joint ventures, there are plenty of openings presenting themselves. As I have said, the NDC have within their terms of reference the capacity to accommodate any entrepreneurial instincts of that kind.  But it has been said, perhaps unkindly, that privatisation is more attractive because it represents an opportunity &ldquo;to put private hands into public tills&rdquo;.  What would be the result of all this?  To be more specific, in what way would the introduction of privatisation enhance the development of our economy?</P>
    <P>Let us assume for a moment that some large and expensive national asset is to be sold off to Irish interests and let us assume also &mdash; although it is a more unlikely proposition &mdash; that the State gets a fair price in return.  How should the State use that price?  By paying off a tiny portion of our national debt?  By setting up new enterprises?  By giving taxpayers a little bonus?  All of these options presumably would be there, so let us examine them.  I believe they are worthy of examination.</P>
    <P>Before doing so let me make one small point.  The resources used by the purchaser or purchasers of the assets are resources which will not be available for any other purpose or investment within the economy.  Therefore the act of purchasing a State enterprise cannot contribute any net new development of itself and the tying up of huge amounts of resources in purchases of this sort may well hinder investment and development in other areas of the economy.</P>
    <Col N="1988" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not apply to the State as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine the options.  Let us assume that the State enterprise we are talking about is BGE, and that they would fetch about £500 million on the open market.  That sum could be used to reduce the national debt and it would reduce it by about 4 per cent.  Most interesting, it would reduce the cost of servicing that debt by a sum in the region of £50 million to £70 million per annum.  However, BGE historically have produced annual profits of more than that, so that the State in the case under examination would be worse off and the deficit would have to be made up in increased taxation.  More than that, the State would lose control over a range of other essential things of which the ability to contribute to economic development through energy pricing would be one example.</P>
      <P>Suppose instead of taking that foolish approach the State were to use that money in setting up new enterprises in competition with the private sector and take the risks that the private sector will take.  I am not sure that is the approach the Right support in this House but we can only presume from what has been said to date that it is.  Presumably they support it on the basis that if it is a new enterprise and successful there will be another plum to pick at the end of the day.  While I believe in the right of the State to establish an enterprise in any area it seems fit, I fail to see the logic of privatising State industry in order to establish new ones that can be privatised in their turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third option is to spend the money on tax reduction.  In the present climate this would be the height of foolishness since in the first instance it is generally accepted that lumps of money given in tax relief tend to be spent on imports, which is hardly a way to encourage development in this country.  Secondly, tax reductions financed in this way would be of a once-off character since the sale of assets is always accompanied by the <Col N="1989" /> loss of the revenue flowing from the proper management of those assets.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past few months in particular privatisation has become a sort of &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; word of the New Right as the divide takes place in Irish politics.  It has been put forward as a panacea for our problems.  The fact that it has not solved problems elsewhere does not seem to matter in this debate.  It would be infinitely preferable if the ideology which informs this motion were put to one side and if the economists and thinkers on that side of the economic divide were to analyse what has been happening in those economies where growth has been achieved and where unemployment has been successfully tackled.  Ideological preoccupation with denigrating the public sector will not effectively tackle either of those problems, and that is why the Labour Party will be opposing this motion.</P>
    <P>We will also be opposing the Government amendment which on the surface may seem surprising because the amendment itself is fairly non-contentious. The contribution made last evening by the Minister for Finance when he was moving the amendment was illuminating. If one can judge by the Minister's speech, this Government are going to pay lip service to the notion of a vital public sector on the one hand but are prepared to weaken that same public sector to the point of collapse on the other.  The Minister has not ruled out the possibility of seeking private cash for semi-State enterprises.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to take seriouly the sentiments expressed in the amendment when one contrasts it with the lukewarm support for the semi-State sector espoused by the Minister last night and the <i>laissez faire</i> attitude in regard to selling some of the companies that he attempts to disguise as pragmatism.</P>
    <P>The semi-State sector can make an enormous contribution to Irish economic recovery.  That sector has served this country well since the foundation of the State at times when there were many gaps in our economic programmes and when <Col N="1990" /> there was a dearth of private sector investors coming forward to make contributions. Rather than attacking the semi-State companies and trying to apply new economic theories which have not worked elsewhere, we should be revitalising the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about bringing confidence back into this country that would be an ideal area in which to start.  We as politicians and Members of this House should start by supporting the workers and the management in the semi-State area and not at every opportunity take swipes at them.  Many of their problems down through our history have been caused by political interference in the management and decision-making processes of their companies.  The time is long overdue when we should support and fund adequately the semi-State sector and not starve it of the necessary cash.  The actions of the Minister for Finance last night, coupled with the ideology expressed in the motions from the other right-wing parties in this House, give little ground for confidence for the semi-State area in the time ahead.  The Labour Party will be making their contribution to defending, as in the past, the contribution made by the semi-State sector, which I believe they can continue to make to our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mác Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, The Workers' Party are totally opposed to the privatisation of semi-State companies. Despite the massive hand-outs to private enterprise and private companies in recent years &mdash; over £1,000 million in 1986 &mdash; the private sector has failed to deliver jobs or to expand what it has already.  In fact, jobs are closing down daily.  The same private sector now wants to get its hands on the profitable operations in the public sector.  To auction off our public sector companies in order to satisfy the avaricious appetite of private enterprise would be the kiss of death for State industry and for industry generally which is dependent on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Starved of share capital by successive Governments favouring private enterprise, our State companies are being <Col N="1991" /> forced to borrow from private banks at exorbitant interest rates.  Despite the obstacles placed in the way of our State companies and the restrictions placed on their operations in order to prevent them from competing with private enterprise, these companies have played a crucial role in the social and economic development of the State.  Contrary to the daily propaganda about loss makers, last year our 17 main public enterprises had trading profits of £447 million and after payment of financial charges they had net profits of £85 million.  The Workers' Party in declaring our outright opposition to privatisation of any of our State enterprises reiterate our longstanding policy that our State enterprises should be used as the engine for economic growth and recovery.  There is no time to waste if the full potential of our State companies is to be utilised to tackle the massive jobs crisis which is the legacy of decades of reliance on private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party demand that substantial amounts of State funds at present being swallowed up by private companies be redirected.  If they want the State off their backs take the State off their backs and redirect this money for investment into the development and expansion of State industry.  Some initiatives are needed to lift the heavy burden of under-capitalisation in our public enterprises. An efficient and dynamic State sector generating wealth and creating jobs is the cornerstone of The Workers' Party's plan for economic development and job creation. The party will fight inside and outside Dáil Éireann to oppose and expose those who would hijack the State resources in the interests of private profit.</P>
    <P>The statement is constantly made that private enterprise is efficient and State enterprises are inefficient.  The right-wing <i>Financial Times</i> in a major review of privatisation in Europe, quoting an Amex Bank review of the subject said:</P>
    <P>While there is widespread feeling that privately owned companies are <Col N="1992" /> more efficient than government enterprises, it is harder to prove than might be expected.</P>
    <P>That is from <i>The Financial Times</i> of 10 December 1986, page 24.  In a review of privatisation in the <i>Economic Journal</i>, John Kay and D.J. Thompson found that the empirical evidence does not show that UK privatisation has led to improved performance of enterprise.  The Office of Telecommunications in the UK found that the domestic telephone service of British Telecom has not improved since privatisation and most people believe that it made no difference to the service. That was stated in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 4 December 1986.</P>
    <P>Another article in the <i>Financial Times</i>&mdash; a journal of interest to Fine Gael and the PDs &mdash; stated that privatisation has financial rewards for those at the top.  I quote from the issue of that publication of 18 December, 1986:</P>
    <P>What is beyond doubt is the benefit to those who run the organisations privatised. For example, the boss of BT gave himself a rise of £60,000 in 1985-86. The boss of Cable and Wireless was paid £11,291 when in public ownership, and this increased by five times this amount a year later.  But by 1986 his salary had soared to £238,893.  Britoil's boss pushed his salary up from £65,000 in 1982, prior to privatisation, to £106,000 in 1985.  Jaguar Car's boss got £86,366 in 1984, and a year later it increased to £172,959.</P>
    <P>On top of this, the company bosses get shares in the companies.  It is no wonder that David Kingston of Irish Life and some of the other less than public-spirited State company bosses want our State companies privatised.</P>

      <P>We are discussing privatisation.  One company who are under much pressure to privatise is Irish Life and one of the persons leading the campaign to privatise the company is David Kingston.  I think I am correct in quoting him, and in referring to him, and I have quoted who benefits from private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private sector in Ireland has proved incapable of running any of our State companies.  In the past few years we have nationalised two private enterprise companies with the full agreement of all parties in the House because private enterprise collapsed.  The Dublin Gas Company should be quoted as an example of the dangers of letting private enterprise loose on essential services. The record has been disastrous both from an economic and a safety point of view. The legacy of bungling private enterprise can be seen in 1,000 holes all over the <Col N="1994" /> streets of this city.  If this had been a State company there would have been howls from the PD and Fine Gael benches to have it privatised.  There is gross inefficiency and mismanagement in private enterprise.  In relation to mismanagement private enterprise cannot even run their own Irish Management Institute, the State has to run it for them. They are totally incapable of running their own tiny enterprises and have no hope of running the large State companies, the biggest employers in the State, such as Telecom Éireann, CIE, ESB, An Post, Aer Lingus and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the amount of tax incentives received by private enterprise in 1985 &mdash; export sales relief costs the taxpayer £423 million, Shannon relief costs the taxpayer £57 million, reduced rate of tax on manufacturing profits costs the taxpayer £113 million, stock relief costs the taxpayers £11 million, reduced rate of corporation tax costs the taxpayer £7.6 million, relief on capital allowances costs the taxpayer £114 million and section 84 loans costs the taxpayer £110 million.  This information was received from the Minister for Finance, yesterday.</P>
    <P>This is a total of £836 million featherbedding for private enterprise, provided in one year, not taking into account the various grants and other financial supports and without any reference to support for agriculture.  I should like to wind up by saying that the State companies are unable to avail of the various State grants given to private enterprise although they are forced to bear uneconomic enterprises for social reasons.  For example, the Sugar Company must maintain the Tuam factory for social and political reasons, CIE must maintain uneconomic lines, the ESB must burn turf in their stations for social and political reasons but they are not given any special grants for this.  In fact they must beg for subsidies when they are pushed to the wall and as soon as they do the howls come from the privateers, whom we have in full strength among us, about inefficiency in public enterprise.  I have proved my <Col N="1995" /> case that private enterprise in this country, whatever about other countries, is totally inefficient and incapable of running any State company.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Members of the House who have contributed to this debate and to indicate at the outset how appalled I was at the remarks made by Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to Mr. David Kingston, the chief executive of Irish Life.  If we have reached the stage where a chief executive of a public company cannot speak out about what he considers to be in the best long term interests of his company without exposing himself to vilification and attribution of base motives of self-profit, we are surely on course for creating a class of servile useless chief executives in all our State bodies.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;people are coming into this House pretending to be one thing when in fact they are the other. This attitude does not stop there.  Even from the Government benches there appears to be a new spirit of realism <Col N="1996" /> born since they assumed the powers of Government in relation to the question of whether they should dispose of State assets.  It is remarkable that the Taoiseach, while he was Leader of the then Opposition, is quoted in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 22 February 1987 as assuring Mr. Peter Cassells, an assistant secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that Fianna Fáil have no intention of privatising established State bodies such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, CIE or any other commercial semi-State body.  It seems evident today that there is the beginning of a backsliding on that issue.</P>
      <P>During the course of the general election campaign I was privileged to appear on RTE television in the company of Deputy Michael Noonan who was there as a representative of the Fine Gael Party.  He told the people of Ireland, through the medium of television, that Fine Gael's policy had been in favour of privatisation since 1969 and he said that I as a member of the party ought to have known that.  All I can say is that I was a member of the party during all the period when he described it as their policy and I never once heard the word spoken at a Fine Gael Ard Fheis, or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>If there was any room for doubt on the issue, I would refer both Deputy Bruton and Deputy Noonan to what they put before their own members at their Ard Fheis in October of last year. On the question of State enterprise they asked four questions and these were seeking guidance from their membership on the issue.  One question was: Should State enterprises with the capacity for expansion or diversification be encouraged to seek minority participation by the public or by private interests with a view to increasing their activities and employment? There is no doubt that some members of the Fine Gael Party have secretly been in favour of privatisation, but the fangs that they are showing now on the issue were, if I may use the phrase, <Col N="1997" /> dentures which were removed for comfort while they were in office.  It turns out that although, as soon as he was returned as Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, on the quiet, sought various studies to be made and made various approaches to English merchant bankers with a view to seeking how privatisation was done, as soon as he poked his head above the ideological parapet which divided him from Labour in the then Cabinet, he was shot down in flames by Deputy Spring. His first and only essay in privatisation was immediately withdrawn and was consigned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

So impressed was he by his speech that he sent it to the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  If one goes to the passage in that speech, which is a little difficult to put together here, which deals with privatisation, the young tiger's stripes appear to have recently emerged.  He had this to say &mdash; and I quote from page 4 of the text that he gave to the committee:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Privatisation: Since 1978 various politicians, economists, the Stock Exchange and the Confederation of Irish Industry have all promoted this concept.  However, the response of <Col N="1998" /> successive governments has been uniformly negative.  It can therefore be reasonably assumed that due to certain political objections this option is not feasible.</P>
    <P>These are the people who claim that the Progressive Democrats, by urging that there should be an openness to privatisation, had stolen their political clothes.  If they are standing naked and clothes-less if I may put it that way, they are standing at the counter of the pawn shop where they handed in their political clothes and their policy clothes in order to participate in Government.  If they are now trying to redeem what they regard as their political clothes, so be it, but do not let anybody in this House say that this idea has been stolen from them.  The record shows that the Fine Gael Party in 1986 were still confused in collectively asking themselves questions on the issue. The record shows that Deputy Bruton's efforts in this regard were being shot down in Cabinet and the record shows that Deputy Yates, who was an avid proponent of the private sector at that time, was not prepared to regard privatisation as a political runner.</P>

      <P>In relation to the motion which the Progressive Democrats have put before this House, it is not an extreme motion and is not ideologically motivated.  It is not one which calls for the mass privatisation of every asset that there is in Irish society.  It is not a motion which calls for an indiscriminate divestment by the State of all its assets.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a resolution which is indifferent to the difficulties which any programme of privatisation poses.  What it most certainly is is a resolution calling on this House to ask the Government to examine every State asset with a view to deciding, on certain political and economic criteria, whether it should remain in public ownership, or whether the public would be better served by divesting it and giving it into different hands.  We propose this, not simply as an isolated resolution but as part of a general, overall view of Irish society.  The view that we have of Irish society is one where the forces of competition are released, one where the forces which stifle enterprise and investment are combated and are reduced wherever possible, one where social justice will be obtained by guaranteeing to the largest group possible of Irish people the right to economically participate in the life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that social justice depends on economic participation and that every wall and obstacle that is put in the face of economic participation, which is work, which is employing other people, which is running businesses, should be tackled and systematically removed in order to bring people into the economic life of the country.  We emphatically reject the policies of marginalisation of sections of Irish society, the young and the weak, putting them out of the economic life of the country, away from the marketplace and on to the dole.  We believe that unless this House addresses in a radical manner the obstacles to economic participation and economic growth, then there will be no economic progress.  There is no <Col N="2000" /> demand here, as I have said before, for mass handing over of assets to the private sector.  For instance, in relation to the Gas Board it is not the Progressive Democrats's view that An Bord Gáis should be handed over to the private sector.  That is a company which is at the moment enjoying considerable income from a depleting asset and there is no economically sound reason for handing it over to the private sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a plenitude of enterprises ranging from Irish Life &mdash; whose chief executive has been vilified here by Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; to the various other commercial bodies run by this State; there are other matters, too, which can be the subject of privatisation. There are services which at the moment are carried out by local authorities and central Government which could be more efficiently and cheaply carried out by private enterprise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other and easily thought of assets in the hands of the State now which are yielding a very small return which, if converted into liquid money, could either reduce our indebtedness and the interest burden on the Irish economy or, alternatively, could be reinvested in a more productive way. The State has huge amounts of assets on its hands.  It has barracks that it does not need, lands that it does not need, forests which could just as well be cultivated in the national interests by private investment groups or pension funds.  All these are possibilities which must remain open. What the Progressive Democrats say is that this resolution calls on the Government to approach the question of privatising or divesting any of the State assets in an open minded and rational way, using rational political and economic criteria and not approaching the matter with a closed mind such as that which is suggested by the left or the <Col N="2001" /> absurd mealy-mouthed way suggested by some of the people to my left in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>There is no point, as the Minister pointed out in his contribution, in offering anybody a 49 per cent interest in Aer Lingus.  Nobody is going to be so foolish as to make an investment of that kind. The Minister was right and Deputy John Bruton wrong on that issue.  Eventually the record will show who was right and who was wrong on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the motion wholeheartedly <Col N="2002" /> to the House.  I ask the House to reject the amendments to it because they are mealy-mouthed, unclear, not thought out.  They constitute a recipe for doing precisely what we have been doing for the last 20 years, which is fiddling while the economy burns.</P>

      <P>The first well of our 1987 drilling programme was, in fact, spudded in Block 57-2 on Sunday morning last, 5 April. Last week, the rig which will drill our second well this season started its journey to the drilling location in Block 49-9 and that well, 49-9-4 should be spudded today or in the next few days.  Our third well will be spudded when the second well has been completed.  I expect to see another commitment well spudded later in the year and, assuming encouraging results <Col N="1826" /> from the early wells, I would expect further wells this year which will bring this year's drilling activity to much the same level as 1986 when six wells were spudded. I might add that our second well this year will be of crucial significance and its results could bring forward the prospect of our first commercial development of an oil field.</P>
      <P>Overall, therefore, 1987 will have a particular importance for us.  I regard the level of drilling this year as reasonably satisfactory, taking into account the current low price of oil.  For the future, however, I believe that there is a need to push the pace of exploration along more rapidly than heretofore.  With that in mind, my Department recently completed a special study of five unallocated blocks in the Celtic Sea and applications have been invited from oil companies interested in licensing these blocks.</P>
      <P>The study is available as a package for purchase by suitable exploration companies and presentations of the integrated geological and geophysical interpretation of the blocks have been made to a number of such companies by my officials.  The response has so far been encouraging and I look forward to some positive decisions being taken by companies before the closing date for licence applications on 1 July 1987.</P>
      <P>While I am at this stage satisfied that our licensing terms are competitive with those prevailing in western Europe I am also keeping them under close review to ensure that they do not represent an obstacle to exploration in our offshore.</P>
      <P>With regard to our onshore acreage under licence, the only drilling activity planned for this year is an exploration well in the Castlecomer Basin.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Nuclear Energy Board was established under the Nuclear Energy Act, 1971, particularly to advise Ministers and the Government on nuclear energy matters such as the acquisition of nuclear reactors for research purposes and the construction, operation and supervision of nuclear power stations.  Since then, successive Governments have abandoned nuclear power as an energy option in this country.  In the circumstances I consider that it is timely to replace the Nuclear Energy Board with a National Radiological Protection Institute.  The functions of the new institute will be <Col N="1829" /> established within a legislative framework which will more appropriately reflect the present needs of the country in the field of radiation safety, radiation protection and monitoring.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering what legislative measures would be most appropriate. It would be premature to make further comment at this stage except to say that I propose to introduce at an early date the necessary legislation.  The grant-in-aid of £895,000 allocated to the Nuclear Energy Board for 1987 will be re-allocated to the new institute when established.  On a year-to-year basis manpower and financial resources will reflect the needs of the new institute subject to any budgetary or other financial constraints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three main factors which influence decisions by exploration companies to explore for hydrocarbons in a given area.  These are</P>
      <P>&mdash;the perceived geology of the areas,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the state of the market for oil and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the licensing terms and taxation regime which govern the exploration.</P>
      <P>Only in the case of the third factor can the Government move to create conditions which encourage the exploration companies to invest in Irish exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation issues are obviously, a matter for the Minister for Finance but I can assure the House that, in so far as it is open to me to do so and taking account of the national interest, I will ensure that no obstacle is left in the way of exploration in our offshore.  At times such as this, when oil prices are low and exploration money is scarce, Governments must look closely at the main factor <Col N="1830" /> affecting exploration over which they have control, namely, the national licensing terms under which exploration takes place.  In that regard, our licensing terms are in general, competitive with those prevailing in western Europe.  I am, however, having a review of the situation carried out in my Department and when that is completed I will take whatever additional steps I deem necessary to accelerate exploration activity, in our designated offshore areas.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) For a number of years past it has not been the general policy to build official houses for members of the Garda Síochána.  Policy has been to build official Garda houses only at locations where a new Garda station is being provided and where it is seen that the provision of official accommodation is necessary because of the particular difficulty members of the force would experience in securing their own accommodation in the locality.</P>
      <P>(ii) A claim that members of the force should be allowed to purchase official Garda houses is at present being considered by the Conciliation Council set up under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  As the proceedings of the council are confidential it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter at this stage.</P>

    <P>(iii) The number of official houses at present rented by members of the Garda Síochána is 931.  All of these houses are vested in the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1835" /> Works and are not the property of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>(iv) The number of houses converted for use as additional Garda station accommodation is as stated below for each year since 1982, when this type of conversion commenced: 1982 &mdash; 1; 1983 &mdash; 1; 1984 &mdash; 4; 1985 &mdash; 1; 1986 &mdash; 4.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, as emphasised in replies to previous parliamentary questions of this nature on 19 November 1985 and 1 July and 6 November 1986, is that the radio equipment and transmission channels being used by the Garda meet with the approval of the appropriate licensing authority.

      <P>Regulations made under Community legislation provide for controls on the marketing and use of pesticides. These controls cover maximum permissible residue levels in and on fruit and vegetables and prohibit the sale or use of certain specified pesticides which may involve risks for persons or the environment. Further regulations provide that the classification, packaging and labelling of approved pesticides being marketed must indicate the risks involved and give suitable advice on safety procedures. Pesticides which may be regarded as constituting a danger to health or environmental safety may be banned or have special conditions which must be complied with attached to their labelling.  In addition, regulations implementing recent Community legislation on maximum permissible residue levels in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin are due to be introduced by June 1988.</P>

      <P>The person concerned received approvals on 28 January 1987 for on-farm development under the farm improvement programme.  Grant-aid under the programme is payable only where an applicant's permanent milk quota is respected.  Payment of grants to the person concerned can be considered, therefore, only on receipt of evidence that his milk production for the year ended 31 March 1987 was within the permanent milk quota allocated to him.</P>
      <P>In drawing up farm plans on which grant applications are based ACOT ensure that each participant in the farm improvement programme is made fully aware of the necessity not to exceed the allocated permanent milk quota.  The plan for the applicant in question was drawn up in July 1986.</P>

Payment of benefit has now been authorised from 12 November 1986, at the weekly rate of £120.65 being the rate appropriate to a man with a dependent wife and six children. When the claim was first made, payment was authorised at the weekly rate of £41.10, the rate appropriate to a single person, as his claim did not give particulars regarding the circumstances of his wife and children.  His claim was also put into payment from 22 November due to a clerical error in not linking the claim with his earlier claim to unemployment assistance.</P>

    <P>The person concerned claimed supplementary welfare allowance which was advanced to him by the health board.

      <P>Benefit was reduced after that date to the weekly rate of £42.70, because he was no longer entitled to an increase in benefit in respect of his wife, as she is in receipt of unemployment assistance in her own right.  He is also only entitled to half the rate payable in respect of their child. His wife is also receiving half the child dependant allowance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to any alleviation payments.  These payments are only due to the claimants whose benefit was reduced on 17 November 1986, as a result of the implementation of equality legislation.  All benefit payable to the person concerned has been issued to 24 March 1987, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <P>The growth in the number of unemployed claimants has undoubtedly placed considerable pressure on both the accommodation and the staff of all the Department's local offices.  The situation at each office is kept under constant review and improvements made where resources allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> While the accommodation in the Wexford employment exchange cannot be regarded as completely satisfactory, nevertheless it should be of adequate capacity to cater for the number of unemployed persons signing there if they adhere to their designated signing times. Each claimant attends once a week on an appointed day and time to sign the unemployed register and collect payment. Claimants are allotted specific signing time but some claimants arrive prior to the official opening times and queue outside.  Queuing in these circumstances could be avoided if claimants attended at the designated signing times.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that Irish exporters are encountering any significant level of difficulty due to a lack of adequate bonding facilities.  A bonding support service is provided by the banks and financial institutions as part of their normal commercial activity.  In addition, under the export credit insurance scheme, which is operated by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland on my behalf, insurance cover against unfair or unreasonable calling of performance bonds may be obtained as an extension to the standard export credit policy.</P>
      <P>The scheme does not, however, extend to the provision of unconditional guarantees to banks in support of bond issues. Such an approach would expose the State to very high risk and would necessitate the provision of considerable additional resources and expertise for its effective operation.  I am not aware of any significant level of demand for such a service.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of particular cases of difficulty, perhaps he could bring these to the attention of my Department so that the matter can be investigated further.</P>

      <P>The Blue Book includes tables setting out revenue accounts for each class of insurance business.  The premium volumes in these tables reflect a number of factors, including alterations in underlying premium rates.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible to publish statistical information on premium rate increases because in most classes of insurance, other than for example motor, household and other personal lines, risks are individually merit rated as opposed to being book rated.  Even in motor and other personal lines business, insurers employ different rating structures which do not enable valid comparisons to be made on a general level.</P>

      <P>Following the allocation of a grant of £350 to the Irish Trampoline <Col N="1878" /> Association in 1985 it came to the attention of my Department that the association did not fulfil all my Department's criteria for receipt of a grant.  Accordingly, the payment was not made.  The question of grant-aid being paid to the Irish Trampoline Association in the future will be considered when my Department is satisfied that the association has complied with all the requirements necessary to qualify for a grant.</P>

      <P>In general the bulk of the representations received in my Department about student financial support under the higher education grant and VEC scholarship schemes relate to questions of eligibility and the rate of grant payable (i.e. full or partial) in individual cases.  Eligibility and the rate of grant payable are determined in accordance with the income eligibility limits set out in the relevant schemes each year.</P>
      <P>For the 1986-87 academic year the maintenance elements of grants were increased by 4.6 per cent (e.g. the maximum grant was increased from £1,166 to £1,213 and the income eligibility limit was increased from £16,540 to £17,300).</P>
      <P>The lecture fee element of grants was increased in line with the increases in third-level colleges for the 1986-87 academic year.  It is proposed to increase the maintenance grant and income eligibility limits for the 1987-88 academic year in line with inflation.  The fees grant will increase in line with college fees.</P>
