      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach if he would confirm this morning that the formula of words used by the Minister for Education in the House last night was intended to convey, in the same form that the Taoiseach conveyed it to me, that the pupil-teacher ratio in 1988 will remain the same as the pupil-teacher ratio in 1987?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important for the order of the House because you know as well as I do, as well as the Taoiseach does, and as well as the rest of the House does, that for the proper ordering of the business of the House there has to be a certain relationship of mutual confidence between the Whips of the parties.  If the Taoiseach is now deliberately going to adopt the procedure of disavowing messages he sends through his Chief Whip it will be very difficult for the other parties <Col N="1660" /> to pay any attention whatever to the Government Chief Whip.  If is a matter of importance for the order of the House and, therefore, appropriate, I submit, for the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii) are satisfied with the composition of a committee appointed to consider the justification for conducting the proposed clinical trial and the circumstances under which the proposed trial is to be conducted, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussion on Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, the Minister undertook to re-examine section 2 as drafted.  He referred to the need to bear in mind that the protection of the interests of participants in trials was of the utmost importance.  To this end it is <Col N="1666" /> now proposed in relation to trials specified in subsection 2 of section 2 to include an additional safeguard to the extent that the National Drugs Advisory Board satisfy themselves with the composition of a committee appointed to consider the justification for conducting the proposed clinical trial and the circumstances under which the trial is to be conducted.  The committee would in effect be an ethics committee but not one to which the statutory requirements for ethics committees specified in the Bill would apply.</P>
    <P>The need to build into the Bill a requirement that a third party would have a vetting role in relation to clinical trials using medicinal products which have a product authorisation has been mentioned by a number of competent organisations and persons and indeed by Deputy Flaherty on a number of occasions.  I am happy, therefore, to propose this amendment which will strengthen section 2 (2) further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gábhail don tAire as oth na leasanna atá molta aige.  I thank the Minister for the amendments he put forward on Report Stage which meet many of the issues raised on Committee Stage.  This amendment is welcomed because it will increase the safeguards in relation to trials where the exceptions under section 2 apply.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a person proposes to arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial or to conduct a clinical trial, and</P>
      <P>(a) there is in force in respect of the substance or preparation concerned a product authorisation granted under the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the purpose of the clinical trial <Col N="1667" /> is to determine the effect of a new use for the substance or preparation concerned.</P>
    <P>then the provisions of section 3 to 6 and sections 8 to 11 shall not apply where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the National Drugs Advisory Board have been notified in writing of the proposal and have, not later than 6 weeks after being so notified, made a recommendation to the Minister on the proposal, and</P>
    <P>(i)  the Minister has granted permission for the proposed trial to be undertaken, and</P>
    <P>(iii) in respect of the substance or preparation concerned, the conditions relating to dosage form contained in the product authorisation so granted are complied with when the clinical trial is being conducted and the dosage administered in each case does not exceed that specified in the said authorisation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While discussing the provisions of section 2 of the Bill during Committee Stage, the Minister gave an undertaking to Deputy Flaherty to look again at section 2 with a view to safeguarding the interests of participants in trials while at the same time ensuring against unduly impeding legitimate trials on products which have been authorised.</P>
    <P>The trials in question are carried out to determine new uses for products which have a product authorisation and which are in extensive use in medical practice.  These types of trials are generally undertaken by hospital consultants and are of considerable benefit in determining new and beneficial uses for widely used products, determined on the basis of experience in using the product clinically, In considering how best to develop an appropriate mechanism for clinical trials under section 2 of the Bill, I find it necessary to restrict any deviation from the full requirements of the Bill to certain trials for new uses only.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to exempt, subject to certain conditions, from the <Col N="1668" /> requirements set out in sections 3 to 6 and 8 to 11 of the Bill, trials involving a preparation which has a product authorisation where the purpose of the trial is to determine a new use for the preparation.</P>
    <P>The amendment governing the exemption include the following stipulations: where the National Drugs Advisory Board have been notified in writing of the proposal and have not later than six weeks after being so notified, made a recommendation to the Minister on the proposal; the Minister has granted permission for the proposed trial to be undertaken; and in respect of the substance or preparation concerned, the conditions relating to dosage form contained in the product authorisation so granted are complied with when the clinical trial is being conducted and the dosage administered in each case does not exceed that specified in the said authorisation.</P>
    <P>When assessing the application for the trial, the National Drugs Advisory Board would have to be satisfied with the arrangements made by the applicant. These would include an independent committee to vet the trial.  I feel that this amendment will go a long way towards meeting the legitimate demands of individual researchers conducting clinical trials while, at the same time, protecting those participants in such trials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his efforts in this area.  This amendment goes a long way towards dealing with some of the problems outlined by many doctors and consultants working in our hospitals.  The amendment is sufficiently tight to ensure maximum safeguards but allows the two major practices, to which the doctors referred, which are commonly used at present in clinical practice. Perhaps the utilisation, in consultation with the National Drugs Advisory Board, of a medicine for a new medical purpose and trials with lower doses of the medicine are to be welcomed.  I also welcome the fact that the question of exceeding the dosage has been dealt with very clearly, and that it will not be possible to <Col N="1669" /> exceed the dosage.  The fact that slow release doses may now be possible is also to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>This amendment successfuly balances the need to protect participants, particularly in the context of amendment No. 1 which has just been passed, and will allow current clinical practices in hospitals, which might have been interfered with by the Bill as originally drafted, to continue.  We are happy to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 41, after &ldquo;committee&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;which shall have regard to regulations governing composition of ethics committee made under section 17 (1) of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has gone a long way in dealing with the major issues raised on Committee Stage, I am still unhappy &mdash; and I am sure this unhappiness is shared by others &mdash; that there have been no changes in relation to the way in which ethics committees are appointed.  The only safeguard in relation to ethics committees are the broad terms of reference and the fact that they will need ministerial approval.  Given that ethics committees are central to the success of the Bill in terms of protecting the participants and supervising the trials, the requirements within the Bill are inadequate to achieve that to public satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have every reason to have confidence in the assessment of Departmental officials and that of the Minister but it would be desirable to have some further elements of public accountability. My three amendments seek to achieve that and on Committee Stage I referred to the possibility of requiring that statutory <Col N="1670" /> regulations should be made in relation to the composition of ethics committees. Such informal guidelines are currently available from the National Drugs Advisory Board for persons conducting trials and these could set down at least minimum regulations which would have to be observed.  If there was any query in future that would be the yardstick by which the performance of their duty by the Minister and the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to the requirements under the various sections was met.</P>
    <P>As it stands, in section 3 the person proposing the trial names the committee and I have been unhappy with that provision from the beginning.  Perhaps we must accept that but if there was a requirement to publish regulations and guidelines for the composition of this committee, minimum requirements could be set down.  Section 17 gives the Minister power to make regulations in relation to what he may consider expedient for the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  The power is there but I am anxious that this should not depend on any one Minister.  It should be contained in the Bill as well as the minimum requirements which the Minister expects from any person naming the committee before the Minister, his Department or the National Drugs Advisory Board would be happy with the ethics committee.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. It is not a major change but it ties in with a series of amendments on Committee Stage, none of which was successful in relation to having the appointment of the ethics committee being made in a more publicly accountable fashion. This aspect of the Bill is not satisfactory and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment which would meet, to some degree at least, the concerns expressed by many people on Committee Stage.  It is the only remaining area of concern as far as Fine Gael are concerned in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for her contribution on this amendment.  During the course of the <Col N="1671" /> Committee Stage debate on the Bill, the question of the need for statutory regulations in relation to the composition of ethics committees and the matters to be considered by such ethics committees under section 8 of the Bill was raised by Deputy Flaherty.</P>
      <P>Following further consideration of the issue, I am still of the view that all interests are best served in this matter by means of guidelines as opposed to statutory regulations.  Statutory regulations require to be precise and definite and, for those reasons, lack the necessary flexibility which is possible under guidelines. Because we are breaking new ground with this Bill, it would not be prudent to set down rules which could prove so rigid as to render the provisions of the Bill ineffective.  For this reason, it might prove beneficial to proceed on the basis of guidelines and, should it prove necessary in the light of experience, to consider the need for statutory regulations at some future date.  I appreciate Deputy Flaherty's concern and her request to have the amendment included. We have examined it very carefully in the Department and, because of the fact that this is a new Bill and that many trials will be arising in the future, it would strengthen the Bill to have flexibility to appoint special ethics committees for particular trials.  In the circumstances, and after very careful consideration, we cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa cúpla focal a rá faoin cheist seo.  I also spoke on Committee Stage in relation to the question of ethics committees and I am still not satisfied that the method of having ethics committees appointed by the institution or the individual carrying out the trial is the correct and proper way of doing it.  However, that proposition was defeated on Committee Stage.  In the circumstances, the Minister should accept Deputy Flaherty's amendments because the House should err on the side of caution in relation to the protection of individuals undergoing these trials rather than erring on the side of flexibility in <Col N="1672" /> relation to ethics committees.  Therefore, I strongly support Deputy Flaherty's amendments and I urge the Minister to accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he is anxious to have maximum flexibility in the Bill.  I accept that different trials may require different types of committees and different supervision. The people in the Bills Office altered it slightly but I had a reference to &ldquo;minimum regulations&rdquo;.  It should be possible to frame the Bill in such a way that the Minister and his Department would have sufficient wisdom and experience to frame minimum regulations which would not prevent the specialist knowledge required in relation to any particular trial but would ensure that certain minimum requirements are met.  Obviously, I would anticipate requirements such as having a representative of lay groups whose main interest would be in the trial and an independent medical person.</P>
      <P>Based on some of the guidelines laid down by the National Drugs Advisory Board for persons proposing to conduct trials, it is possible to have minimum requirements. As Deputy De Rossa said, we have erred on the side of flexibility by leaving the nomination of the ethics committee in the hands of the trialist. This is a very strong power to give to the trialist without any supervision other than ministerial approval.  The Bill does not specify on what basis approval would be given.  The Bill does not refer to the composition of the committees at all.  Given that the committee are nominated by the trialist and that the question of whether the committee are acceptable is considered in the realms of the Department of Health on the basis of rules and regulations which the Minister indicated on Committee Stage but which are not written into the Bill, the Bill is too open ended.  I would ask the Minister to consider these relatively minor amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Department up to this were not statutorily responsible for clinical trials they have been involved in the voluntary <Col N="1673" /> control of clinical trials for a long time through the National Drugs Advisory Board.  I find it strange that the Minister is not willing to give some statutory basis to the guidelines used by the National Drugs Advisory Board over the years.  The National Drugs Advisory Board are committed to providing protection and to ensuring that research goes on.  The Minister should reconsider these amendments given that this is the one area in which there was substantial concern on Committee Stage and that that concern has not been met in any of the Minister's amendments.  If an amendment such as that proposed on section 2 was proposed in relation to a relevant section of the Bill it would have met our concern.  It is important to have some further safeguard, some further element of public judgment on ethics committees which are central to this Bill, the aim of which is to give greater protection to volunteers and to ensure the proper conduct of clinical trials so as not to put future research at risk.  Both of these aims will be seriously affected if there are further serious incidents similar to that which gave impetus to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 (1) of the Bill really covers Deputy Flaherty's amendment because it gives the Minister full powers to make such regulations as appear to him to be necessary or expedient to implement the provisions of the Bill.  Initially it would be appropriate to have guidelines which would enable the Minister and the National Drugs Advisory Board to tailor the composition of the ethics committee to suit the trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the powers of the trialist to appoint an ethics committee, the Minister has power to disapprove of the trial if he is not happy with the composition of the ethics committee.  Because Deputy Flaherty's amendment is already covered by the Bill I request her to withdraw it.  We are very anxious to encompass Deputy Flaherty's requirements in this section as well as the point made by Deputy De Rossa and under section 17 (1) the Minister has the powers to make regulations when required.  The Bill gives <Col N="1674" /> the Minister adequate power to safeguard those participating in the trials. The officials in my Department who were familiar with the guidelines prior to the introduction of the Bill feel that the provisions are adequate and the Minister and I agree that adequate protection is in the Bill to provide for the proper composition of ethics committees to supervise trials.</P>
    <P>As we have facilitated the Opposition by way of amendments and as there are adequate safeguards, this amendment should not be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>This is the first time I have been through a Bill in such detail so I was not really aware of what was allowed on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the Opposition should be grateful.  The Minister is not doing the Opposition a favour.  We are working on legislation and trying to produce the best legislation possible. Gratitude because the Minister accepted certain valid points should not prevent us from pursuing other points a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he had the option to make regulations under the Bill.  The Minister has also indicated to the House that he intends to operate from guidelines rather than regulations in the initial stages.  The National Drugs Advisory Board have outlined what they consider to be a minimum desirable requirement. The Minister indicated during Committee Stage that this is the line he will follow in relation to the guidelines. Because ethics committees are so central, it is desirable for Members of this House, before this Bill comes into operation, to have an opportunity to look at the kind <Col N="1675" /> of regulations the Minister proposes to make in relation to the composition of ethics committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to make guidelines available and he will have to explain them so that from the passing of this Bill people will know what is or is not acceptable.  Before a trial can take place the Minister will have to approve of an ethics committee, so he will have to make his position clear.  I do not see why the Minister could not give statutory basis to minimal requirements for the makeup of these committees.  While I welcome the genuine improvements made on Report <Col N="1676" /> Stage, this is an issue that will have to be pressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete line 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 10 of the Bill a policy of insurance is required to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of a trial.  Before a person can conduct a clinical trial under section 8 (4) (a) the ethics committee must have regard to the insurance arrangements entered into.  The requirement of a policy of insurance does not reflect the <i>de facto</i> position as regards the availability of various forms of financial compensation and security which are currently available to compensate persons who suffer injury or loss as a result of a clinical trial.  Persons who conduct clinical trials at present have available to them arrangements which vary from policies of insurance to bonds and other financial guarantees from <Col N="1679" /> financial institutions and insurance companies. It is necessary to recognise in the Bill that these arrangements exist and it would not be appropriate to include a restriction provision in the Bill which has as one of its objectives the facilities of legitimate research projects.</P>
    <P>I propose therefore that section 10 be amended to require that a person conducting a clinical trial must establish to the satisfaction of the ethics committee that he can provide sufficient security to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide appropriate compensation for each participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of the trial.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (4) (e) would be redundant as a result and I propose that it be deleted.  I might add that it is my intention to include in guidelines for ethics committees the need for the availability of expertise in the areas of compensation for personal injuries to the ethics committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would like to welcome the changes the Minister has here in that they do deal with the problems raised on Committee Stage and should allow for research to go on, covered by the various forms of security that would be available.  I am satisfied that they adequately protect the individual participants in trials and allow the variety of arrangements that the Minister has referred to to be acknowledged in this Bill and hence to allow the maximum amount of research possible to continue. There was a danger that as it was narrowly defined before the ultimate effect of the Bill would have been to confine research to the large commercial companies who could affored a limited amount of international insurance which is available in this area.  The wider drafting of this section allows the other forms of <Col N="1680" /> security to be acknowledged and accepted by an ethics committee as providing security for the participants.</P>
      <P>I would just like to ask the Minister, given that he has now drafted this section in such a way that it would allow for it in the future, to consider the system that operates in England allowing research to continue within hospitals by providing a fund for which <i>ex gratia</i> payments might be made arising out of claims within the hospitals.  This would ensure that desirable research which might still not be able to be covered under any of the other available methods of insurance to continue. Will the Minister indicate if he is willing, in terms of reviewing the impact of this Act, to at least keep this proposal in mind and perhaps next year seek funds from the Minister for Finance to allow such a fund to exist.  I welcome this amendment and hope that the Minister might keep this other matter in mind, given that the wider drafting here would make such a fund operable and relevant under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is well aware, this Bill will make it a criminal offence to sell goods below cost.  There is <Col N="1682" /> a particular problem at this time of year in that a lot of companies in the retail trade, small and large, have bought in stock for Christmas.  They have to do that not knowing how much of the goods they will sell and these goods are not much use to them after Christmas.  Even if they are not perishable goods the idea, for example, of retaining a large stock of unsold Christmas cards until next Christmas and, in the meanwhile, paying the interest on the money borrowed to buy them and a lot of other similar goods, is not practical.  To avoid that, what people did in the past if they had stock that they wanted to get rid of and could not keep for the following 12 months, was to sell them off below cost to get rid of them before they were no longer relevant for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledges this problem in the order and says that seasonal goods are exempt, but seasonal goods are so narrowly defined as to exclude virtually all the actual seasonal goods. The only seasonal goods that it will not be an offence to sell off below cost are Christmas cakes, Easter eggs and Hallowe'en bracks.  Excluded are any other form of confectionery which is seasonal, for instance, Christmas puddings which are not included as Christmas cakes, I presume, or Easter chocolate goods which are not in the form of eggs and/or all the other mass of non-food seasonal stock which could represent at this time of year up to two-thirds of the stock of some shops&mdash;in fact, a great part of the stock of some shops at present could be seasonal.  The overwhelming majority of those goods cannot now be sold below cost before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this order comes into effect before Christmas it will cause a particular problem for people who might have stocked up in anticipation of selling off at below cost if they were to find between the time of purchase and the time of sale or otherwise that the Minister had introduced a new change in the rules in regard to how they can dispose of these goods below cost.  We have the problem of principle that the definition is too narrow and also the transitional problem of this year <Col N="1683" /> in that the rules will be different from the time the goods were bought to the time that they would normally be sold if this order comes into effect before Christmas. That is my first problem on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the explanation on the last occasion that he felt that if seasonal goods were too widely defined that could lead to a loophole in the legislation through which a coach and four could be driven.  Perhaps that is so, but it is possible to adopt the process which the Minister is doing, by naming goods but having a considerably larger list than just three items.  If that is done, there is not the possibility of the abuse feared by the Minister.  If he goes for an abstract definition of seasonal goods relating to stocking levels, for example, at different times of the year, then clearly there are possibilities for clever lawyers to prove that almost everything is seasonal.  If that is the point which the Minister is going to make I can concede it to him in advance, but it is possible by simply using the Minister's own method but with a longer and more comprehensive list of genuine seasonal goods to avoid the difficulty about which we are talking here.</P>
    <P>I tried to introduce a new definition of seasonal goods in the form of an amendment to the Bill and the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order.  I take it that if the Minister wanted to introduce an amendment to draw up a slightly larger definition of seasonal goods and to include words such as &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything that is contained in this order, seasonal goods shall be interpreted for the purposes of this Act as including&rdquo; and then give a longer list than the three given here, the Ceann Comhairle would find it possible to rule such an amendment in order.  I hope he would, anyway.  I am not asking him to give me an interpretation now.  I would ask the Minister to look at this matter because it will cause a number of problems for retailers and it is important if we are to have this legislation, that it be workable and fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  Is it in <Col N="1684" /> order, in the interest of expedition, to make some queries in relation to the order, most of them relevant to what Deputy Bruton has been talking about? The Bill itself, as we know, is a very slim measure but the order is the matter which will give effect to this whole process.  I share Deputy Bruton's concern with areas of definition.  One clearly is the question of seasonal goods.  It is very strictly defined in the order as Christmas cakes, Easter eggs and Hallowe'en bracks.  Clearly, there are many other seasonal goods which could fall within the range of this order.  Is there any device whereby the Minister can retain unto himself some type of ongoing monitoring of what could reasonably be called seasonal goods, without absolutely defining that?  I suspect that if one wanted to get into a definition which was accurate to the nth degree there would be a list as long as one's arm.  Would it be possible for the Minister to say that seasonal goods shall include the following or such other goods as might be deemed to be so at a particular time?  It is very hard, with the vagaries of modern marketing, to be absolutely certain about being able to circumscribe clearly in words the last, ultimate elements of seasonality.  The whole point is to curb abuse.  There is no point to doing that if one introduces a definition or states in an order a definition that clearly is inadequate.</P>
      <P>Secondly, with regard to paragraph 2 of the order relating to the price of the goods, that is the cost of the goods and how the Department and the Minister under the Act will assess that, it is stated:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Order the net invoice price of grocery goods supplied by a supplier or a wholesaler to a retailer or by a supplier to a wholesaler shall be calculated having regard to an invoice relating to the delivery of like goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental point of concern for me is the very difficult, if not impossible, task of trying to ascertain the cost price, not just because of the complexity of the manner in which it is set out in the order which includes, for example, the reference <Col N="1685" /> that such price shall be calculated net of any allowance or refund that is allowable on the return of the goods container and no account shall be taken of discounts, rebates or other deductions which are not entered on the invoice in cash terms as deductions from the sum due to the supplier or wholesaler.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a very convoluted but perhaps necessary device, not just because of the concerns of working it out in normal terms, but also because many invoices in our small, open economy will arise outside the jurisdiction.  How will it be possible for a Department, hard-pressed as they are, realistically and diplomatically to monitor in a serious and genuine way the true cost, particularly for goods coming into the country where the invoices arise outside?  I want to make that point very clearly.  We are all doing a disservice to the public and to this House if we introduce a measure which in our hearts we do not believe will be either policed or effective.  Much as some of us would wish this order to be successful, I do not see how it can be if there is that kind of problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how the Minister is, first, going to define absolutely the question of cost price, secondly, whether there is some deployment of staff to deal with this and how many and, thirdly, particularly the question of dealing with invoices which arise from outside the country.  Some people in the industry have been slightly irked at the suggestion that they might be engaged in some kind of profiteering or sleight-of-hand.  It is not the intention to point the finger at anybody in that respect.  It is simply underlining a difficulty which this Government and Department have in terms of coming to the facts.  It does not necessarily follow that there are not bigger sharks and bigger crooks on the domestic scene.  One is simply saying that if we are going to introduce a measure, let us see if we can block the loopholes. If a customer goes into a supermarket or shop and seeks to buy goods and they are being sold in an environment which has this regulation in force but it is not able to be monitored properly, particularly in <Col N="1686" /> respect of the larger multiples who would be those predominantly importing, obviously it is not just inoperable but it may even be unjust in terms of its effect on the marketplace.  The domestic manufacturer and supplier can be monitored because one can insist on access to his data and make an assessment of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not possible to do that if it comes from outside the jurisdiction, be it from Northern Ireland, Britain or further afield, and that is a fundamental problem with the measure.</P>
      <P>A definition of cost and price is fundamental if we are to get this order right. That is the main point I wish to raise even though there are a couple of minor points which I will raise later on.  The definition of goods and the question of obtaining and monitoring the true cost price, particularly in terms of the grocery industry where many goods are imported, leaves many opportunities not so much for abuse but inherent weaknesses, deficiencies and injustice to people who are manufacturing and supplying goods within the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, I visited all the major supermarkets and major retail distributors.  The purpose of this series of meetings which were sponsored by the Irish Goods Council was to get them to stock more Irish made goods.  They were an outstanding success because I know from a number of suppliers that the combined effect of the persuasion and the moral pressure involved in a Minister actually visiting individual stores and being seen to take an interest in what they had on their shelves led to groups, particularlly those who are not Irish owned, taking a much more positive attitude towards stocking Irish goods than previously had been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My major worry about this order is that the good which that did which I know had support and followed on other efforts made by other Ministers &mdash; I am not claiming it was the only efforts made in <Col N="1687" /> this regard although it was particularly successful &mdash; will be reversed by this order in that, all that any supermarket which wishes to sell goods below cost needs to do is buy imported goods because the costs cannot be checked in regard to imported goods.  If they have a foreign affiliate they can buy goods through that foreign affiliate and import them here.  The invoice would be supplied from an affiliate of their own organisation rather than from the original manufacturer overseas.</P>
    <P>The effect of this regulation will be, I fear, to divert stocks towards imported goods rather than Irish goods on the part of any retailer who wants to avoid the ban on below cost selling.  There is no doubt that if a competitive advantage is to be obtained people will use any means to evade this order.  We cannot expect goodwill and kind words to suffice.  The order has to be one which will be able to stick and that is my biggest worry.  I started off by referring to seasonal goods because they come earlier in the order. That is a relatively minor matter by comparison with my fears in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy Bruton has just said, undoubtedly the efforts which he and others have made in regard to getting the supermarkets and the multiples to buy more Irish goods have been very successful and they are being continued.  While in past years there were various campaigns to get people to buy Irish, a more effective way was to tackle the problem from the other side.  If the goods are not on the shelves for customers to see and buy and if they do not get the prominent places which other imported goods get, undoubtedly it will follow that fewer and fewer Irish goods will be sold.  Those efforts have been successful and are being followed up by the Irish Goods Council. Some chains have gone out of their way to liaise with the suppliers in an efforts to help them to identify goods and products which could be import substituted.  That is an excellent development and we are <Col N="1688" /> giving it all the support we can.</P>
      <P>When we look at the penetration of the Irish market over the years, we can see that there is a lot of ground to be made up and many products which are being imported, especially in the food area and in many other areas, could be import substituted.  I am giving the Irish Goods Council a more definitive role in the area of linkage.  Their approach is more a market led one which is different from the way in which the linkage programme has been developed up to now. Some small firms seem to have the idea that if they know what a firm wants all they have to do is to supply them, but they will have to understand the ethos and the corporate strategy of the large multinationals.  They have to make sure that they will get the product on time and in the quantity and quality which they require.  There are significant opportunities there and the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, is tackling that area very vigorously.</P>
      <P>To return to the order itself and in relation to the points which were raised on the definition of seasonal goods, I am strongly advised that if I were to widen that definition I would create more loopholes. The idea was to come to grips with the main problems which exist in the marketplace at present and, apart from the recommendation made by the Restrictive Practices Commission, independent grocers, those who represent them and anybody else who would be affected by this order have been long clamouring for it.  It is very difficult to ensure when making an order such as this that you close every possible loophole but you certainly take every opportunity you get to ensure that where you see possible loopholes you do not leave them open for people to find their way through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the outset that the order will be reviewed every 12 months.  Let us wait and see what loopholes appear.  In relation to the question raised by Deputy Bruton about seasonal goods I can tell him that Christmas cakes are excluded. He also raised other items such as Christmas puddings.  I have often eaten a <Col N="1689" /> Christmas pudding half way through the year and it was delightful.  I believe and I often see the kids at home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No. Occasionally, I have seen my wife buy them.  They can be a lot more tasty a couple of months after Christmas than if you eat them at Christmas time when people are fed up with Christmas food.  However, that is a matter of choice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Christmas puddings are not an item which go out of fashion or deteriorate.  In fact, the flavour improves in time as I understand it.  If you eat one 12 months after you originally bought it, the flavour will have improved so I would not be particularly worried about them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We raised the issue of Christmas cards the last time and we all know that Christmas cards can be put away.  That is what happens in the trade. I think I suggested here the last day that if the Deputy was worried about someone with an over supply of Christmas cards there are many Deputies in this House who go looking for bargains in Christmas cards coming up to Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in sending out Christmas cards at Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if the price was right they could afford to sell them at cost.  Not all Deputies in this House like sending Christmas cards and I do not send any.  Perhaps the Deputy does not <Col N="1690" /> send any either.  I have not sent any since I came into this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that last Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there are Deputies who go in for this in a very big way.  However, as I have said, I do not think anyone should worry too much about Christmas cards.  What is important is to exclude the items which are reasonable to exclude and we should not exclude a wide range of items.  I want to make the order as effective as I can and I recognise that people will be looking for loopholes.  We have closed all the loopholes that we can foresee at this stage and if the House would bear with me in leaving the definition as tight as possible we can see after the Christmas trade if any major problems arose.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies that if we do not get this order through this House and the Seanad and get the President to sign it very soon, we may not have it in operation for Christmas.  The Bill comprises only two sections and normally the House discusses this Bill on the basis that it cannot be amended.  It is a short two section Bill which confirms the order made on 25 May.  I hope the House will bear with me because this is the third day we have dealt with this Bill.  This is not to say that Deputies are not entitled to point to any possible loopholes, or improvements which can be made.  I will take them on board and when I review the order 12 months after it has been in operation I will look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating raised the question of cost.  I explained on Second Stage that the order spells out clearly that cost is to be regarded as the net invoice price of the goods concerned including VAT.  Net invoice price is further defined as the price at which grocery goods are supplied having regard to the invoice relating to the delivery which is the same date as the sale of goods or with the relevant advertisement or, where no such invoice exists, such net invoice price shall be calculated having regard to the invoice <Col N="1691" /> which relates to such delivery and which is that issued most recently prior to the sale of goods or the advertisement's publication.</P>
    <P>The order further specifies in article 11 that where charges in respect of carriage, insurance or other costs not included in the relevant invoice have to be paid by the retailer to the supplier to obtain delivery, these can be added to the net invoice price and where a sale takes place more than four weeks after the supplier's list price changes and no invoice delivery has taken place in the meantime the best list price will be substituted for net invoice price.  That is the clear definition of net invoice price and any LTAs and so on must be taken into consideration in relation to it.  Deputy Keating raised some other problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The examiner has power to go to importers just as to anybody else.  It is possible that invoices could be rigged and we will have to wait and see about that.  He can call on the relevant authorities in another jurisdiction to help him.  It is not unusual for authorities operating in this area to co-operate with one another.  However, there is a change since the last time those orders were made in that an invoice supplied to the examiner by an importer will be taken by the court as showing the invoice price and the onus will be on the importer, or whoever, to prove that it does not.  The onus was on the Restrictive Practices Commissioner up to now.  Suppliers in their own interest can play a vital part in this.  They are in the trade and they have every opportunity to know what is going on.  Anybody in his own line of business knows whether people are engaging in this sort of carry on.  If the people who want this order brought in <Col N="1692" /> and want to restore the opportunity for some level pitch playing for the multiples and the small grocers know from their own business what is going on, they can be of significant help by advancing information which can be checked out, examined and investigated.</P>
      <P>The change is that the invoice produced by the Commissioner of Restrictive Practices, or the director of consumer affairs as he will be known, will be taken by the court and the onus will be on the other person to prove to the contrary.  That is as far as they can go. Already I have been giving examples of information and how people are setting themselves up in an effort to defeat this order through an importer.  The information that has come forward will be extremely helpful.  I hope that when this order has passed through both Houses the director will be able to get to work on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to pursue the seasonal goods issue any more. However, let me say that the definition is far too narrow and there will be practical difficulties, but we will wait to see what happens.  It is not adequate.  We could go on talking about seasonal goods all day without much advance.  I remain completely unconvinced by the Minister's explanation that this Bill will not lead to a large transfer of imported rather than Irish produced goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain.  Two large retail chains in this State have branches on the other side of the Border; and both of them have shops on this and the other side of the Border.  Take a company in this jurisdiction producing biscuits and another company in Northern Ireland also producing biscuits.  Both retailers want the freedom to sell biscuits below cost without being prosecuted.  Any sensible retailer, even if he does not intend at the time he is buying the goods to sell them off below cost, would like to know that if he had to he would be able to do so with impunity.  What do these two large multinational &mdash; in the sense they are on both sides of the Border &mdash; retailers do to avoid the purposes of this order?  They <Col N="1693" /> get their outlet in Northern Ireland to buy all their biscuits for sale as own brand biscuits from the Northern Ireland manufacturer, not the Southern Ireland manufacturer. The Southern Ireland manufacturer is scrubbed out.  Having bought the biscuits at a price which is privately arranged between their Northern Ireland branch, their Northern Ireland purchasing manager and the Northern Ireland manufacturer, they concoct another invoice at a lower price and the Northern Ireland part of the retail chain sells them to the Southern Irish part of the retail chain, a perfectly legitimate transaction except that the price is different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>And you could not eat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are then imported in the South and all Irish biscuits are taken off the shelves of these two large outlets because they want at least the freedom to sell them below cost if they wish.  The director of consumer affairs says this is terrible and must stop, that we have information, suggestions, rumours that this is happening.  What can he do about it?  Absolutely nothing.  He goes along to supermarket chain D or Q and says: &ldquo;What about this?  These biscuits are being sold at a price well below the price at which Irish Biscuits in Tallaght can supply them.  Surely you must be selling these below cost.&rdquo;  He is told: &ldquo;Not at all.  These were supplied by the Northern Ireland branch to us and we have an invoice here which shows that the price at which we are retailing them is above the invoice price in accordance with the order.&rdquo;  The director of consumer affairs says that he does not believe a word of it, that that is a fraudulent invoice and that is not the real price.  The purchasing manager of supermarket D or Q says that is an outrangeous statement, that the director has absolutely no right to make it and that he must prove it in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The director of consumer affairs then decides to go and ask the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce if they will help him to see if this is the true <Col N="1694" /> price.  The Minister, being very friendly with his colleague in Northern Ireland, will get a friendly reaction to this.  That having happened the Northern Ireland Secretary of State for Commerce will have a good laugh up his sleeve at this naive request from the Minister for information so that he can ensure that the biscuit manufacturer in his jurisdication would lose business and the Minister could get it for a manufacturer down in the South, the Northern Ireland biscuit manufacturer having captured his market as a direct result of this order.  That is my fear.</P>
    <P>It is naive of the Minister to say, as he said, that we can get co-operation from people in other jurisdications.  People and administrations in other jurisdications will certainly co-operate with you when it is in their interest and yours to do so as is the case in regard to security under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  There will be no shortage of co-operation in matters where there is an interest on both sides of the Border that there should be co-operation. If, as a result of this order a Northern Ireland biscuit manufacturer is creating more jobs in Northern Irelands because he is able to put his produce in here and the people here are able to sell them below cost and if that were rectified jobs would be lost in Northern Ireland which might recently have been created by virtue of this order.  You will get no co-operation from anybody in an enforcement process of that kind.  The only thing you will have is the invoice and you will be totally unable to go behind that invoice by virtue of the fact that this order does not confer, and cannot confer, extra-territorial jurisdication on the examiner or the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Essentially may worry is that this will lead to a diversion of supplies in terms of imports.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Industry and Commerce have been totally opposed for years to the idea of interfering with the market in this area.  I know that that Department have believed down through the years that once you got into this area you were straight into a quagmire and you would end up remedying loophole after loophole.  The Department, in their <Col N="1695" /> wisdom, foresaw exactly the sort of difficulty I am now adverting to, wherein there is the possibility of imports being substituted for domestically produced goods where one cannot force the below cost ban on imports but can enforce it on domestically produced goods.  I do not think that the Confederation of Irish Industry and all those other people who have been clamouring for this have throught out this aspect of the matter at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few observations to make.  If we take the biscuit manufacturers which Deputy Bruton mentioned, Jacobs have 1,000 people employed and their annual turnover would be in excess of £50 million.  Dunnes Stores, one of our major stores, would account for a quarter of the sales of the biscuits produced in that factory.  My information is that they do not account for it and that what Deputy Bruton has referred to is happening and has happened right across the country.  With regard to seasonal goods anybody in business could tell us that the mark up is such as to allow for over supply.  The norm in the retail business is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The markup will have to be higher now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not.  Quick sale goods have a low markup and seasonal goods have a very high markup.  That is the reason that if there is an after Christmas sale on any of those goods, excluding Christmas cards which are normally stacked away because they are well covered in the profits from those Christmas cards that have been sold, they could be given away for little or nothing. These would include toys and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 May 1985 in the Seanad I called on the then Minister, who was Deputy Bruton, to implement this legislation.  We have a duty and an obligation to cater for the small business people of this country. I have witnessed over the years the whole sector being eradicated and eroded by the malpractices of the supermarkets, the <Col N="1696" /> chain stores and their buyers.  I realise now why my request was not adhered to at that time or indeed the request of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses. It was very obvious to me that Deputy Bruton did an indepth study of this but why did he not go ahead and do it?  The legislation is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

It is our job and our obligation to examine legislation carefully, not just to accept some form of &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; assurance about matters.

First, in relation to <Col N="1697" /> the staffing arrangements, what is the structure for monitoring this order?  Secondly, how are invoices arising outside the jurisdiction dealt with in Europe?  I have looked at the literature and there are devices of one kind or another, according to my information, in a range of countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, it is on below cost selling.  They may call it different things in different places.  In those countries they talk about loss leader offers and so on and I wonder how it is handled there. I have glanced at the Restrictive Commission report of Review of Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981 where that point is also raised.  They also made the point that the invoice is the basis for assessment of true cost.  Of course we all know that an invoice is a human creation and in itself does not necessarily tell the true cost but we are accepting for the purposes of this order that it is a true cost.  Paragraph 9.10 of that document which deals with the question of restrictive practices in the grocery industry, under the heading of &ldquo;Net Invoice Price&rdquo; states:</P>
      <P>The invoice does not, in many cases, reflect the real net price of the goods. In some cases, for example, suppliers pay &ldquo;long term allowances&rdquo; which are not reflected in the invoice price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on but there is no need for me to dwell on the point.  Even with the best will in the world the invoice can mask true cost and where there is not the best will in the world &mdash; as inevitably will be the case when human greed enters the picture &mdash; the Minister's order will find itself faced with, as indicated in his opening remarks, an immediate rush to contrivance by people who want to get their way around any order.  It is compounded by the fact that the invoices, even if it <Col N="1698" /> was to accept them on face value, are for a large supply of goods.</P>
    <P>No matter how much we might regret and deplore it, the facts are that a large supply of goods originate outside the jurisdication and those invoices are not open to scrutiny here.  I wondern whether the Minister should consider going beyond those invoices, make some assumptions about the costs and shift the onus of responsibility by saying, &ldquo;we assume this is the cost and you must disprove it.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is too harsh. What I am saying is that there is a problem and there is no point in pretending that there is not.  Ironically, and most unfortunately and I am sure nobody would want this, it could actually result in doing specific damage to Irish manufacturers and suppliers <i>vis-à-vis</i> those who are selling into the country.  That would be an outcome which none of us would want and was probably undreamed of when this order was conceived but it is a possibility.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister if he would be good enough to comment on those three points.  First, what precisely are the structures of staffing in place to monitor the order?  Secondly, what do other European countries do in terms of access to the raw data needed to make an adjudication on true costs, and, thirdly &mdash; the question which has remained unanswered &mdash; the question of invoices which arise outside the jurisdication and in respect of which there is not any serious facility for us in terms of examining them.  Should we implement something stronger and compel people on the basis of assumptions that we should make in our jurisdiction that they come forward and disprove what we assume, on the basis of economic criteria, are likely to be the true costs?</P>

      <P>I will refer to the Deputy's last point first.  I am sure the House is well aware of the keen competition which exists between various multiples in the trade.  Clearly even when this Bill is signed into law, the multiples are going to try to continue as much competition <Col N="1699" /> between themselves as is possible.  Problems arose in this area because the multiples used every device they could think of to gain a larger market share.  Below cost selling was held out to consumers as being a benefit to them.  As I said in the House before, the only way consumers could get any benefit from below cost selling would be to take the number of loss leaders in each multiple and drive from one multiple to the other.  That is the only way consumers will get any benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about below cost selling.  That is what this legislation is all about.  Below cost selling is being held out as a benefit to consumers when in effect the opposite is the case. Housewives who look at the number of items that are sold below cost in any particular store will find that no more than a handful of items are sold below cost even though the store might sell 300 or 400 items.  If she monitors prices from one week to the next, she will find that when one item is reduced in price, another is increased.  It is a total misrepresentation to say to consumers that below cost selling is to their benefit.  It is not and never has been.  I took part in a radio debate with a representative from one of the multiples and in the final analysis he had to admit that below cost selling was about market share and not about selling for the benefit of consumers.  That is one part of the exercise this legislation deals with.  The other part of the exercise deals with &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;.  Nobody in this House could convince me that &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; is a practice which should be allowed continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy keeps quiet I will come to the other points and deal with them individually.  Deputies should not lose sight of the reason this legislation was brought in.  If Deputies are native enough to assume that CII, RGDATA, the consumers association and everybody else do not know what the business is all about, they are living in cloud cuckooland.  I know what that trade is all about and I know what malpractices exist.  I am not going to renege on my responsibility and let small suppliers be put out of business one after another as has happened during the past number of years.  Regardless of what efforts may be made by way of imports to replace them, I will keep the independent grocers in business and restore a level pitch between them and the multiples.  The independent grocery trade accounts for 40,000 jobs approximately and this House has a responsibility to those people.  All I can do is restore a level playing pitch so that each of them will have the same opportunities as the multiples.</P>
      <P>When this Bill has been put through this House multiples will still want to try to gain market share.  They will try to do so by having the LTAs that Deputy Keating referred to and all discounts shown on the invoice price so that they can keep the invoice cost as low as possible. When this legislation is passed the multiples will look for all discounts and LTAs to be shown on the invoice so that they continue to sell at cost and not below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spoken about what we can and cannot do in relation to those outside the jurisdiction.  I cannot subscribe to the view of Deputy Bruton, or anybody else who may be naive enough to think that we cannot get at those people.  I have had experience in business of markets which have been rigged.  Before I came into this House I had the experience of buying certain quantities of packaging in this country and packaging from another jurisdiction.  Anybody who is involved in the business knows that there is a double <Col N="1701" /> pricing structure between the UK and Ireland.  If a person wants goods to be delivered ex-factory to an English address he will get one price and if he gives a Republic of Ireland address he will get a different cost structure and a different price.</P>

He can do it in the very same way I did it.  All he will need is one invoice which he can get quite easily.  I am not going to disclose my hand to the House but I will be able to give him a few tips on where he will be able to find a true invoice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>He will then be able to go to the importer and say that it was a true invoice at a certain date.  When he goes to court on a prosecution the one invoice he produces will be taken as the true invoice and the responsibility will be on the importer to produce evidence to the contrary.  That is the change that is being brought in by this order.  The onus will now be on the importer or the supplier to prove that the information supplied by the Director of Consumer Affairs, which will be taken in court as a proven fact, is wrong.  There will be seven inspectors monitoring this.  The Deputies may not accept what I have said but I am giving the House the benefit of all the information I have.</P>

      <P>There will be seven inspectors involved in this operation.  CII have had many seminars and conferences about this.  It is a matter for suppliers to run their own businesses.  I cannot run their businesses for them.  I am sure Deputy Bruton subscribes to that as much as everybody else does.  Suppliers can see the benefit of what is being done in this House to assist them to run their businesses more properly but at the end of the day they run them and the consumer has to watchful.  We can only do so much.  We are trying to eliminate the malpractice of below cost selling because it is not to the benefit of consumers but to the benefit of large multiples who are trying to gain more and more market share.  They will admit that when they are put up against the wall in a sound argument.  The Bill also deals with the problem of &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think the House should unduly hold up the Bill any longer.  We want to try to get it through this House and the Seanad and into law before Christmas so that it will give people an opportunity of earning a living the same as are the few big people who are trying to expand their share of the market all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I found it rather difficult to have to listen to the Minister making a Second Stage speech in favour of the principle of this order.  We are not involved in that.  We are talking about the way in which particular aspects of the wording of the order will work.  I hope that I will at least stay within that constraint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to concentrate further on the way in which the use of the invoice price could assist imports.  The Minister says he has ways of finding out the true invoice price.  I am talking about invoices which are not supplied by the manufacturer but by another part of the same organisation which, in turn, bought from the manufacturer. How will one obtain the true invoice, reflecting the price at which the manufacturer sold the goods to the supplier? <Col N="1703" /> Not easily.  It is not sufficient to obtain the invoice at which that manufacturer sold it to another supplier because, as we all know, prices vary, depending on volume, convenience and so on.  It is quite clear that the manufacturer or the multi-national retailer will not leave stray invoices lying around in respect of their transactions.  The invoice prices will not be obtained because the invoices will be known to the manufacturer in Northern Ireland and the retailer at his branch in Northern Ireland. It is quite possible that this will be rigged and I do not believe the methods which the Minister referred to could work in this case.</P>
    <P>In practice it is different because there is not the intervention of the third party, that is, the company operating in the State that has a branch in Northern Ireland which is buying from the manufacturer in the first place.  I believe that in practice this order will lead to a diversion to imports.  Its enforcement will be haphazard given its complexity and the fact that there are only seven staff involved.  There is a severe risk of a diversion to imported goods in order to avoid the possibility of a prosecution for below cost selling.  It would be much easier to conceal the true cost of imports than the cost of domestic goods.  Even the Minister admitted that to pursue below cost selling, one would have to go to much greater lengths and use all the methods one has learned in the trade to prove cost in respect of imports.</P>
    <P>Even assuming &mdash; and I do not agree &mdash; that you could find the true information, the extra effort involved in getting the information on imports would tend to effect a diversion in favour of imports.  That is my fundamental worry about the Bill.  I do not want to delay the Bill at all, although the Minister may think this is the purpose of my remarks. The Minister keeps repeating that he wants to get the legislation through the House quickly.  We all want to do so.  The Government could have ordered the time if they wanted to.</P>

Bearing in mind the expression and acceptance of the need to expedite the proceedings I venture to put that point to the House.

      <P>I want to move to the provisions of paragraph 15 of the order which I am concerned about.  I wish to read the provisions of paragraph 15 into the record:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Examiner is satisfied that the operation by a supplier of the terms and conditions contained in the statement prepared by him pursuant to Article 13 of this Order constitutes <Col N="1705" /> unfair discrimination in favour of or against any wholesaler or retailer or any section of the grocery trade comprising the business carried on by wholesalers and retailers, the supplier shall, at the request of the Examiner, make such amendments of the terms and conditions aforesaid as may be specified by the Examiner being amendments calculated to eliminate the alleged unfair discrimination.</P>
    <P>That provision gives the examiner <i>carte blanche</i> to insist on any changes he likes in the terms of a contract between two private individuals on the grounds that he, the examiner, in his own right, without review by this House, and without any legislative guidance, has decided that these are &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  I do not believe any functionary has the right to decide that something should be stopped because he says it is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  Unfairness is the ultimate subjective matter.  We in this House, should not give unlimited powers to the examiner to stop any particular contract on the basis that the examiner, in his own right, thinks it is unfair.  Clearly this order attempts to eliminate practices which the order specifies as unfair.  That is fine because it is a deliberate decision of the House.  However we are not, or at least, we should not be creating a whole new area of power for an examiner to add on all sorts of additional provisions.</P>

      <P>A provision giving open ended power to a functionary to decide that particular things are unfair, unfairness being such a subjective matter, is essentially something which should not be in an order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bearing in mind your earlier exhortation.  Let us hope we will all be out of here within the next three quarters of an hour or so.  I asked earlier about staffing, about invoices arising from outside the country and about international practice.  The Minister handled the question of invoices arising from outside the country by saying that in the context of his professional extra-political <Col N="1707" /> experience there are things one can do.  I accept that, but it is an imponderable and a basic difficulty.  It is a weakness in the nature of things that one cannot force compliance when one is depending on material supplied from outside. I am also perturbed about the principle of accepting the invoice as the bedrock of true cost.  There is much creative accountancy and fanciful writing and sometimes an invoice might not be worth the paper it is printed on in terms of its relevance to the truth.</P>
      <P>On the question of staffing, the Minister said there were seven inspectors.  Are these seven new members of staff or have they been redeployed?  Whatever chance the order has of being successful, it has none if it is not meant seriously.  I am not optimistic about the impact of seven people working in an industry of this size.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that. The report of the Restrictive Practices Commission for 1986 quotes the examiner as saying that in 1981 his office had a staff of 14 plus a full time examiner, but that in 1986 there were only seven staff plus a full time examiner.  Are these the same people the Minister is talking about?  Are we introducing a complex order with international implications and not seriously applying the resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also referred to international practice and it was suggested that perhaps no other country bothered about this.  That is not true.  In accordance with Belgian law it is prohibited for any retailer to offer for sale or to sell any product to a consumer at a loss.  In Germany there is no specific recognition of the concept of a loss leader but the law against unfair competition in effect covers what could be described as loss leader offers.  In France, on the basis of the Finance Act, the resale of any unchanged goods below an actual wholesale price, plus a sales tax arising from the resale, is prohibited. There are international precedents. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, <Col N="1708" /> every time we try to do something, we should consider how these countries handle the question.  Once in Luxembourg I saw fish being beautifully packaged and sold and I realised that they do not even have a coastline.  Luxembourg must sell produce which is largely imported and I wonder how they tackle the matter of below-cost selling.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this matter would be reviewed in a year.  I assure him that there is no intention to obstruct or be difficult. This Bill has been around in one form or another since the beginning of the year and both the discussions we had on it in recent weeks were brief, truncated by the Order of Business and other matters that arose.  I do not believe we have spent two hours on the Bill.</P>

Anyone who thinks otherwise is being extremely naive.  When we try to persuade people to buy our modest wares, we use every reasonable device.  It is simply business practice and it is our job to give reasonable standards of protection and to put resources in place which will afford the consumer that protection. They have done it abroad and I wonder how they handle some of the problems we might now have to confront. I also wonder if we are serious enough in our approach to make the necessary resources available.</P>

      <P>Regarding the review which it is proposed to carry out, how formal will this review be?  I should like this order to apply for a limited period. There is a reasonable case for what is called &ldquo;sunset legislation&rdquo; which applies only for a period and must fall to be renewed or dropped at that stage.  Would it not be reasonable that this legislation should apply for, say, three or five years rather than indefinitely so that the review would be given some legal teeth?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I can assure the Deputy that the means at their disposal are such that they will not have any problem in this area. When the Minister is reviewing this order he might also look at the situation of the multiples.  Multiples control the largest percentage of the grocery trade here and that is not the position in other European countries.  In my view the practices of the multiples have resulted in the Minister having to introduce the order under discussion. In reviewing this legislation the Minister should look at the banks and their charges and the legal profession and <Col N="1711" /> the fees they charge.  Government action alone will redress the position in those areas.</P>

      <P>When one looks at the Bill and the terms of the order one cannot help wondering why it is necessary to have such Bills or discussions.  I would have thought that in a normal civilised society a Minister for Industry and Commerce, or an appropriate Minister, should have the power to intervene without having to get the approval of Parliament for everything he does in carrying out his work.  In my view this amounts to defining a trading practice.  I accept that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to come to the House regularly with Bills to increase borrowing and so on but they are about detail and not about principles.  As far as I am concerned I would be in favour of some way of getting out of that and permitting the Minister to get on with his job.</P>

I fear that the ultimate result of legislation promoted by everybody, including the Minister, with a good intention of assisting Irish manufacturers will be to the detriment of Irish manufacturers in practice.

      <P>The amendment was introduced originally in order to facilitate the Hyster project in Limerick which is an all-makes parts project.  They wanted to avoid being sued for producing parts for products produced by other people on the grounds that the spare parts were based on drawings of those parts.  They wanted to avoid a claim being made against them by the original manufacturers of those products that they were in breach of copyright by using those drawings as a basis for producing spare parts.  As the House knows, that project, which in my opinion was not a good one because the explosure of the State and the taxpayer was far too great relative to the risks taken by the company promoters, Hyster Ltd, is not going ahead.  Therefore, I am a bit puzzled as to why we need the amendment, given that that was the original purpose of it.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister's amendment may be moving in a direction similar to the direction of the recently published Copyright Bill in the UK where copyrights protection which previously was for the life of the author plus a number of years &mdash; I cannot remember the number of years but it was for a very long period &mdash; is now being restricted to about 20 years. That British legislation was only published last week.  I should like to ask the Minister why it is considered necessary to go ahead with the amendment in the light of the Hyster project not going ahead.  Why is the Minister not waiting to see whether we should follow the more comprehensive legislative approach in Britain rather than introducing a piecemeal measure of this type?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this amendment was inserted at the request of the IDA. We have had further consultations with the IDA and they confirmed the view that this amendment should remain because they feel it would increase competitiveness and the level of technology in indigenous companies.  Any legislation that would restrict copying would not be beneficial.  It is their conviction that under the R and D grants scheme a substantial number of applications from indigenous companies are in respect of projects which are copy related.  Any legislation which is inhibiting in this respect would considerably reduce the level of R and D in Irish companies.  They are also of the conviction that legislative restrictions on copying would have an adverse effect on their links programme as a number of small industries produce overseas products which are copied from internationally available products.  They also believe it would give them a desirable leverage in attracting to Ireland manufacturers of components who would, as our present law stands, face serious legal difficulties.  That is the view they expressed to us.  For that reason we feel the amendment should stand.</P>
      <P>As regards the United Kingdom's Copyright Bill, we have examined it and it seems to be going in the same direction as we are.  We feel that, at this stage, we should not follow in a slavish fashion everything that happens in another jurisdiction. We are happy that what we have is appropriate for this country.</P>

There is a move towards a uniform European copyright law.  Is that not so?  It is wise that we should try to have our law as much in tune with others so that we are not radically out of line, unless there is a very good reason.  There may be a very good reason in this case for going ahead, and the Minister has made a good cause <Col N="1715" /> for it, but I would like to ask him about the consistency of this proposal with any proposals that are on the table for a European standard in regard to copyright protection.</P>

      <P>Originally a person could be liable on summary conviction of a criminal offence to a fine not exceeding £1,000 in the case of a first conviction of an offence under this section and in any other case to such a fine or, at the discreation of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  After much debate in the Seanad, we sent the Bill back with our amendments.  I believe <Col N="1719" /> our amendment was limited because we should have included background music. I ask the Minister to amend this section to cover background music.  I am referring only to records, cassettes or tapes, provided they are played in a cafe, bar or lounge.  We could have a very serious problem when we take into account marching bands on St. Patrick's Day or festivals and so on.  The Bill brings into question this entire area of live performances. Once given the franchise the Performing Rights Society to which I referred earlier will explore every avenue to get money.  This Bill should be withdrawn and there should be a review of the activities of the Performing Rights Society in relation to their methods of assessment and their extortion of money collected.  Where does that money go? Over 90 per cent of it leaves the country. I know of cases where publicans have been assessed and threatened with bankruptcy unless they coughed up.</P>
      <P>Where traditional music is played the methods used by the Performing Rights Society bring the whole operation into serious question.  Traditional music should not be copyright but money has been extorted from people who perform in premises.  The method used is that a representative of the Performing Rights Society goes into a premises, assesses the seating capacity and then levies an annual charge.  However, the levy should be based on the number of customers and this is a fierce bone of contention around the country.  People have enough commitments to meet without handing out money which they feel is not due.  The society have already got their cut from performances on radio and television. Pending investigation by the Department of the Performing Rights Society and their activities, the manner of their assessment and extortion; I do not applogise for using the word &mdash; the Bill should be shelved.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that the Bill should be shelved but I agree with the other point made by Deputy Lynch in <Col N="1720" /> regard to traditional music.  By definition, copyright cannot exist in regard to traditional music because it is traditional and distinct from something composed by a particular author.  There is considerable injustice in levying a charge in respect of a premises where traditional music is the only music performed and in respect of which there is no copyright.  If this extends to background music it may be going a bit too far because background music is essentially provided as a means of preventing others from hearing conversations which people do not wish them to hear.  It is not provided for an intrinsic entertainment purpose.  There is a danger in conveying a right to fees in respect of background music.  The Minister should look at these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the problem referred to by Deputy Lynch.  He queried the charges levied by the Performing Rights Society but that has nothing to do with the amendment.  In relation to amendment No. 6, the Deputy is aware that this was introduced in the Seanad where it was represented that the same penalties under the 1963 Act were being applied for the more minor offence of allowing music to be played on radio and television in public.  This is distinct from the more serious copyright offence such as illicit copying and infringement of tapes.  That was accepted as inequitable and, as a consequence, the amendment provides for maintaining the fine at its present level of £100 and abolishing the alternative penalty of a prison sentence.</P>
      <P>We are aware that many Deputies, including Deputy Lynch, have had concerted pressure on them to extend this to the playing of background music in certain situations.  The amendment goes as far as it can and to include background music would be totally contrary to the whole principle of copyright.</P>

I put these amendments down, not for the purpose of pursuing them in any detail, but for the Minister to look at their content to see if there is something of merit in them.  They are largely drafting amendments which might strengthen the Bill.  The Minister may say that he accepts the spirit of the amendments and will look at the detail to see if they add anything to the Bill and I would be happy if he did so.

      <P>The purpose behind amendments Nos. 1 to 4 is to provide that the courts may consider the report by Professors Evrigenis and Kerameus on the accession of Greece to the 1968 Convention as amended by the 1978 Accession Convention in interpreting the Conventions. Section 4 (2) already provides for the consideration by the courts of the report by Mr. Jenard on the original 1968 Convention and 1971 Protocol and the report by Professor Schlosser on the 1978 Accession Convention.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in my opening remarks on Second Stage that the report dealing with the 1982 Convention on the accession of Greece has only recently come to hand and that I would be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for its inclusion in section 4. Although the publication date of the relevant Official Journal is given as 24 November 1986, I understand that there were difficulties in translating the report and that is the reason for the delay in its becoming available.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for the insertion of the reference to the Greek report while amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are merely consequential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not entirely related but it would be convenient to discuss them together and I have no objection.  This amendment seeks to amend section 6 to include &ldquo;or a judgment arising from an industrial dispute and requiring the sequestration or seizure of goods or assets of trade unions&rdquo;.  Section 6 is the general section for the application of judgments of European courts to be enforced within our courts jurisdiction.  Section 6 says that this shall apply to all judgments except orders of maintenance.  We are proposing to include as an exclusion a judgment arising from an industrial dispute and requiring the sequestration or seizure of goods or assets of trade unions.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is the experience of the National Union of Miners who were persecuted and pursued to the degree of seizure if possible of all their assets in the course of the very long, protracted and acrimonious dispute some years ago when Mrs. Thatcher determinedly sought to try to smash the union and put it out of existence.  We are concerned that our courts and our jurisdiction would not be employed or sought to be employed as a weapon in such a campaign, or as a device to be employed in an effort to defeat a trade union involved in a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are particularly concerned that our courts and our jurisdiction could not be used as a means of seeking to sequester, pursue or seize assets or goods, should a trade union locked in such a battle seek <Col N="1725" /> to have their assets or goods transferred out of the jurisdiction of their own country in an effort to try to maintain payment to their union members involved in a dispute.  It is very easy and all too common that in many trade union issues and problems the employer or adversary of the union in the dispute will seek recourse to the courts for orders of restraint, restriction of picketing or any other allied or similar type orders.  The reality is that the trade unions are finding their efforts thwarted in pursuing their legitimate objectives under the 1906 Trade Disputes Act, here and under similar provisions elsewhere, by applications to courts to restrain them, with the result that because of the many issues involved workers will often be then sought to be attached to court for contempt or a union taking a decision at national level can be ordered to appear before the court for the purposes of answering contempt or else they can be fined.  Huge fines were imposed in Britain on the National Union of Miners and in time there were orders for the sequestration of their assets in view of the continuing dispute that ran over many months during the miners dispute.</P>
    <P>This is a very important exception that should be written into the Bill.  There is nothing that disallows us from making this exception.  In view of the importance we as a country place on the notion of the trade unions and their recognition in our jurisdiction as being a social partner, this is very important.  There is a high degree of trade unionism here.  It contributes to good order in the running and management of business so it is important to set an example in this regard.  I commend amendment No. 5 to the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is a similar amendment which should be seriously considered. The point is whether we want to or could be obliged under the Bill, if a judgment or order from another jurisdiction for committal for non-payment of debt is transferred to our jurisdiction and is sought to be enforced before our courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Tá liosta fada de thograí ó Údarás na Gaeltachta ceadaithe ag mo Roinnse ó thús na bliana agus ní bheadh sé ceart ó thaobh rúndachta de sonraí ina leith a fhoilsiú.  Ar ndóigh, foilsítear eolas faoi dheontais a ceadaíonn agus a íocann an tÚdarás le tionscail i dtuarascálacha agus i gcuntais na heagraíochta sin.  Táim sásta nach mbíonn aon mhoill do-sheachanta ann maidir le tograí a chuirtear faoi bhráid mo Roinne.  Ar ndóigh, iarrtar ar an Údarás sonraí breise a chur ar fáil i gcásanna áirithe agus freisin bíonn comhairle le glacadh le Ranna eile Stáit i <Col N="1731" /> dtaobh roinnt de na tograí nó meabhráin le cur faoi bhráid an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an dhá cheist déag ón Teachta faoi thograí sonracha, tá an cinneadh curtha in iúl don Údarás faoi seacht gcinn díobh agus déanfar cinneadh faoin bhfuílleach sa ghnáthbhealach a luaithe is féidir.</P>

      <P>Is cuimhin liom ócáidí inar iarr Aire na Gaeltachta ar Theachtaí Dála anseo ceisteanna a chur síos i nGaeilge.  Cuireann sé díomá ormsa anois nuair a chuirtear ceisteanna síos i nGaeilge, nach bhfuil an tAire sásta aon fhreagra a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna sin, agus tá sé le feiceáil inniu go bhfuil sé tar éis na ceisteanna ar fad atá thíos ar chlár agam a chur le chéile san aon fhreagra amháin agus gan aon eolas a thabhairt san fhreagra sin ar na nithe a bhí sna ceisteanna.  Mar sin, ní ghlacaimse leis go bhfuil an tAire dáiríre faoi go mba chóir dúinn níos mó ceisteanna a chur i nGaeilge nuair nach bhfuil sé sásta aon fhreagra a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna sin.  Tar éis é sin a rá, an bhféadfadh mé ceist a chur air?  Is dócha nach bhfaighidh mé freagra, fiú amháin, ar an gceist uaidh anois: Cén fáth a bhfuil sé ag iarraidh na nithe seo a choinneáil faoi rún?  Is airgead poiblí atá i gceist agus bhí sé de nós i gcónaí nuair a bheadh cead tugtha le haghaidh deontas go dtabharfaí amach eolas faoi sin don phobal, agus tá an t-eolas sin tuillte ag an bpobal.  Tá sé ag dul dóibh, agus ní ghlacaim leis go raibh sé de nós riamh an sórt sin eolais a choinneáil ón bpobal.  Sin ceist amháin.  An cheist eile, cén fáth, ar aon nós, an bhfuil sé riachtanach do Údarás na Gaeltachta cead a fháil ón Aire do gach aon togra a thagann os a gcomhair.  An nglacfaidh sé leis go gcuireann sé sin isteach ar obair an Údaráis agus nach bhfuil an tÚdarás in ann feidhmiú i gceart leis an sórt sin sriain orthu?</P>

Na ceisteanna atá curtha os comhair na Dála, bhain siad le clár a bhí os comhair an Údaráis ar an 25ú lá.  Anois, fuair an Teachta Dála é sin faoi rún ó bhall éigin atá ag obair san Údarás.  Tá a fhios aige go rí-mhaith go bhfuil an duine a thug an t-eolas sin dó ag briseadh an dlí, agus déanfaidh mo Roinnse gach iarracht a fháil amach cén chaoi ar tharla sé sin.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment with regard to applicants for the £5,000 new house grant scheme who were originally sanctioned for same and subsequently disallowed because the house they purchased was not the one originally specified, if he will agree to reconsider this situation with a view to allowing the grant in those cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisional approval issued <Col N="1735" /> to applicants in respect of the £5,000 surrender grant relates to the building or purchase of a particular house.  Where the purchase or construction of that house is not being proceeded with, an application for the grant in respect of a different house can be considered only where the applicants satisfy the relevant local authority that, at the time of abolition of the scheme, they had, on foot of a legitimate expectation of receiving the grant, entered into a legally binding and irrevocable commitment in respect of the second house.  A grant cannot be allowed for a house in respect of the purchase of which provisional approval had not issued or a binding commitment had not existed when the grants scheme was terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if an applicant who had applied before the closing date merely decided by choice or circumstance to change from the house to which he intended buying to another house, that ought not to be regarded as altering the validity of his application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Deputy's concern in the matter but approval was issued in respect of a specific house only and it cannot be transferred to another house.  That was the arrangement that was entered into when the grant approval issued in the first instance. It would not be possible to allow grants to persons who had no qualifying commitment at the time of the abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister perhaps misunderstands the purpose of the grant scheme.  Indeed that is somewhat apparent in the manner in which he abolished it.  Is the Minister not aware that the grant scheme was designed primarily to encourage people to return their local authority houses to the housing stock on the basis that they were purchasing a replacement dwelling from the private sector and that once the applicant was fulfilling that primary purpose was it not reasonable that if the applicant choose to purchase a different private sector house and had qualified for the grant in the <Col N="1736" /> first instance that this qualification should pass on to his second choice of house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands full well what was intended by way of the £5,000 surrender grant and it is because it was serving no further useful purpose that the Minister abolished it.  It must be understood by everybody that when somebody applied for that £5,000 surrender grant they did so on the understanding that they were surrendering a house that was in good repair or that had been put in good repair and that they had obtained agreement and approval in respect of the house they proposed to purchase before the approval went out from the local authority.  So there can be no question of anybody having been under any misapprehension about what they were entitled to.  Two houses were in question, their own and the one they proposed to buy and it was on foot of that application with details of those houses that the grant approval issued. Accordingly, all those applications that have been approved and concluded will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister adopt a more lenient approach in a matter such as this where, surely, the former tenant in the local authority house who is surrendering was acting in good faith and could not be expected to anticipate the major change the Government introduced? In view of the circumstances in which the announcement of the change was made I would appeal to the Minister to deal leniently with the people who were caught in the intervening period. The circumstances in this case would clearly be crying out for a sympathetic response from a person in the Minister's position.  I accept that regulations are made by the Minister and that, therefore, only the Minister would be in a position to adjudicate or make alterations to allow exceptional cases such as this to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in the reply that if there was legitimate expectation by an applicant of a grant and if they had <Col N="1737" /> entered into that kind of irrevocable commitment, I would be happy to look at any particular case the Deputy might send forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the planning compensation code is under way at present in my Department with a view to seeing what amendments are desirable and possible but it is not yet completed. As I indicated in my reply to Deputy McCartan of Tuesday, 28 April 1987, this whole area of compensation is a very complex one with major constitutional issues involved.  Clearly all of the issues involved will have to be teased out before any amendments to the law can be brought forward.  At this stage, I cannot be specific on the timescale needed to conclude the review but proposals for new legislation are unlikely to be introduced in the current Dáil term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, is he aware that he told this House on the occasion of the introduction of a Private Members' Bill by the Labour Party, and I quote him, &ldquo;that proper constitutional legislation will be <Col N="1738" /> introduced shortly&rdquo; and if he is further aware that since the time of the introduction of that Bill a number of statements on this issue of compensation that could be regarded as clear hints have been made by members of the Judiciary? How can he square up the answer he has given this afternoon with the very clear commitment he made in his reply to the Labour Party Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment is still clear and unequivocal.  I would still like to do this in the immediate future if I could but because of the complexities in the constitutional area we must be very careful.  In regard to things one would like to do and send forward for an opinion, one often finds subsequently that that is not recommended for constitutional reasons.  Rather than introduce legislation that is going to be struck down subsequently, I prefer to get it right even if that takes some extra time.  I think the Deputy should appreciate that more than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I am anxious to operate constitutionally.  Following the discussion we had on the occasion of the Coolattin Woods matter when it was before the Dáil, it was pointed out to the Minister that we felt the Bill before him was within the Constitution.  If he feels there is a constitutional impediment, can he now say that he is seeking clearance from Government to bring in a referendum that would remove such a constitutional impediment?  Finally would the Minister like to comment on the statements made by members of the Judiciary that the interpretation of the common good in modern terms does not need a constitutional referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Any matter that would be the subject of a constitutional referendum would have to be decided some place other than this.  It is not intended at this time to have a constitutional referendum along the lines suggested by the Deputy but it would be of interest to the Deputy to know that a special interdepartmental working group has been <Col N="1739" /> established to consider and make recommendations in the area of trees and woodlands about possible legislation that would help in the better preservation and protection of our woodlands.  As the Deputy knows, to date the company involved in the felling of timber at Coolattin have not applied to the Department of Energy for the felling licence necessary to fell the trees at Tomnafinnogue Wood. That is not to say that they might not do it in the immediate future, but at the same time I have to say that the working group dealing with this are very conscious of the urgency.  But they are also conscious of the need to get it right and I hope the Deputy will support that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With specific reference to the constitutional complexities relating to the drafting of legislation, would the Minister not agree that any advice he is likely to get in this area from the legal adviser of his Department, or indeed from the Attorney General, will be that legislation that would interfere with the traditional interpretation of compensation is likely to be unconstitutional and that that collective view is in marked contrast to the public statements of respected and eminent members of the Supreme Court?  Would the Minister therefore not consider, as a predecessor of his saw fit to do, introducing a Bill in this House where the balance of doubt may be open to interpretation, and signal in the convention that is appropriate to this House that the President, on receipt of the Bill, if passed by this House and the other House, would refer the matter to the Supreme Court for a definitive interpretation?  The precedent to which I refer is the private rented dwellings legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair comment and I can see what the Deputy is getting at.  I do not share his view on the type of advice received from my own law agent department or from the Attorney General. They have been reasonably liberal in their attitude on many occasions.  But <Col N="1740" /> they are particularly anxious to move slowly in this area.  It is one thing to talk about what would seem to the individual as fair and reasonable; it also has to be equitable.  It is not just a matter of the individuals who are concerned but also there are the rights of property and the rights and interests of the community at large.  In an area that has that kind of complexity and longstanding law attached to it we would be foolish to rush in legislation and suggest that if it is found by some other authority to be unconstitutional it could be referred onwards. Let us try to get it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  I think the advice given by the legal department in the Department of the Environment has stood up to the test over the years.  It is a busy office dealing with a whole range of things as the Deputy knows very well himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not actually my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying is that the advice received on the area of compensation might not be the thing. Anything that is advised upon in the Department in that area is moved over to the Attorney General's office as well and there is a pretty fair bit of expertise in the law there.  Some of the pieces we have been talking about here in the past are over there and advice has been received and the advice necessitated a rethink on certain aspects of it.  I would rather be involved in that rethink in the Department and in consultation with the Attorney General's office than pass something here that was subsequently struck down and might lead to a lot of litigation in the courts.  Finally, I recognise the anxiety of people in this regard. I share that anxiety and I think we should try to do something about it as soon as possible.  This is a priority as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>It is useful to hear the Minister saying he shares our concern on this issue.  Question No. 57, which is being taken with this question, has wider implications than just the question of the protection of woodlands.  It concerns the whole question of developers seeking permission and then being able to claim compensation from the authorities involved.  Would the Minister indicate that his review of the situation includes that area of concern?  While he has said he does not expect legislation in this session, could he give a guarantee that it will be early in the next session at the latest?</P>

      <P>It cannot be achieved in the time scale of this session.  I should like to think we might get one of the pieces before the House for next term and I do not see why not.  In regard to the advice tendered by Deputy Quinn to let the House have a say in the matter and get an opinion on it, perhaps that is something worth considering.  I shall take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but would the Minister not agree that there is an impasse with regard to this House? If, on the one hand, Opposition parties bring forward legislation in this area which the Minister is advised in the view of the legal department is unconstitutional, that effectively blocks it from one side.  On the other hand, if his own or any Department are proscribed in an <Col N="1742" /> earlier Article of the Constitution from knowingly promoting legislation which they consider might perhaps be unconstitutional until such time as the other place, the Supreme Court, is brought into play, this ongoing saga will continue indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that point.  Let me be as forthcoming as I can on this. There has been quite a number of court cases and judgments on compensation and so forth and many commitments have been given as well.  I should like to think we might introduce legislation in this area and even if it is not possible to get a clear indication of constitutionality I shall not be swayed by that.  However, I have to take the advice that is tendered; that is the least I should do so that when I come to make a contribution on the matter I shall be able to say that the good advice has been such and such.  It may not stand up, but they are a concerned Department and they like to feel that they give the best advice to the Minister.  This matter of compensation is not a political matter in the strict sense of the word; it is a question of justice and equity for all sections of the community.  The legislation will not be controversial in that sense.  It will be a question of its legality or constitutionality.  I should like to think that we could ease the constitutionality matter before bringing it forward, but I take notice of what the Deputies have in mind.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the view of the construction industry regarding the effects which the reduction of 10 per cent this year in mortgage interest relief for tax purposes has had on house sales; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of tax relief on mortgage interest is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I am aware of views expressed by representatives of the construction industry on this measure, but I am not aware of any particular statement about the effect it has had on house sales.  However, I would point out that the level of house sales is affected by a wide range of influences including demographic factors, changes in income levels, trends in house prices, mortgage interest rates and taxation.</P>
      <P>It would be very difficult to attribute any changes which have occurred in the level of house sales to any one particular factor.  The cut in mortgage tax relief was an integral part of the 1987 budget and it may be said that any negative effect on house sales has been more than offset by that Budget's positive impact on mortgage interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, then, the Minister could explain how that offset which he suggests ought to have occurred has resulted in the registered new house starts as recorded by his Department falling in the period from April to October of this year as compared with a figure for the equivalent period for last year, from 4,242 to 3,201, a fall of 25 per cent since the beginning of April?</P>

      <P>Yes, some of them, and other locations, too.  Nobody will deny that the emigration figures are there or that they concern a certain age group more particularly than any other group. It does lead to less demand for certain types of construction and there seems to be a bigger take-up on secondhand houses in recent times.  However, what we are talking about in this question is the mortgage interest relief and, as the Deputies will know, that is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  It appears that new and existing houses sold with mortgage loans fell to about 25,000 this year.  The figure was 27,632 in 1986, so there certainly has been a drop.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that in the same submission, in relation to mortgage interest relief specifically, the association <Col N="1745" /> say that this was &ldquo;a most damaging policy measure which has undermined the confidence of both the builder and the prospective purchaser&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The designated area in Castlebar is roughly the same size as the areas designated in the other eight towns recently announced.  It comprises just 15 acres of the 980 acres in the urban district. The purpose of the urban renewal incentives is to encourage development and redevelopment of inner urban areas.  The areas designated were deliberately limited in size to avoid dissipating the benefits of designation over too wide an area.</P>

I am surprised that the Deputy would try to suggest that the designated area there is not going to be a success.

      <P>In relation to a number of the Minister's replies to supplementary questions asked by Deputy McGahon, am I right in understanding in the first instance that local authorities submitted proposals for areas to be incorporated in the designation order?  If that is so can the Minister confirm that the area originally nominated by Castlebar was the area of 15 acres which is contained in the designation order and whether the area nominated by the local authority in Dundalk is also the area confirmed in the designation order or did the Minister reduce or in any way alter the submission received from Dundalk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas which were designated were selected following consultation with the officials of the local authorities involved.  They were designated following consideration of the development plan of the planning authority for each of those areas.  Finally, an inspection was carried out by some senior planners in the Department on site in the areas.  I cannot be positive as far as Dundalk is concerned but certainly the area which Castlebar Urban District Council would like to have designated was substantially reduced by me in that I felt it incorporated too big a portion of the town.  Finally, after consultation between the Department's planners and the urban council we settled on the most derelict side of the town and the least developed area &mdash; it is fair to say that which was suffering greatly from the recession.  Deputy Kenny would be gracious to acknowledge that.</P>

To date 20 such county bulletins have been published but those relating to the larger areas, Dublin, Cork and Galway, are not yet available.  It would be a waste of time and administrative effort to do anything in this regard until the bulletins are there. When they are there it is incumbent on me and on the Government to do something about the revision of constituencies and, if necessary, following that examination to bring the matter here to the Dáil because it is a matter for the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas only &mdash; the Constitution provides that &mdash; to revise constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of permitting &ldquo;left turn on red&rdquo; in appropriate circumstances is at present being considered by my Department in consultation with the main statutory bodies concerned.  The views made available to me so far indicate that the introduction of such a measure <Col N="1758" /> could reduce traffic delays, fuel consumption and vehicle exhaust emissions. On the other hand, concerns have been voiced as to the effect of such a measure on road safety generally but particularly that of pedestrians.  In this context, the introduction of a measure which would alter the basic prohibitory status of a red light must be weighed carefully against any benefits.  International experience and views on this matter are mixed.  I will make a decision on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of essential research and related services provided until now by An Foras Forbartha and for winding up the company are receiving detailed consideration.  While I am not yet in a position to indicate what the detailed arrangements may be, I am satisfied that significant savings can be achieved while at the same time keeping essential services going.  Decisions on these matters will take account of the report prepared by the directors of the institute and of all other relevant considerations. It would not be appropriate, in these circumstances, to publish the board's report.  I will ensure, however, that full details of the alternative arrangements decided on will be made available as soon as possible after the Government have decided these.  Detailed proposals for redeployment cannot be drawn up pending decision on the functions to be retained, relocated or discontinued and the relevant staffing requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that he at least conveyed the impression that he would be prepared to make public or to make available the recommendations of the interim board at the time when they were submitted to him so that the staff of the foras and other interested parties could perhaps make helpful suggestions as to how a re-organised or refurbished foras might operate? Would the Minister not consider that this might be helpful in what is presumably his commitment to see the type of work being carried out by the foras continued in the best possible and most cost-effective way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not indicate on 21 October that I would publish the recommendations but I did say that the details <Col N="1760" /> concerning the rearrangements would have to be made public.  This is only fair so far as the employees are concerned. The interim board have submitted a report to me which is being considered. It is a fairly hefty report.  I understand that discussions went on between the board and the interested parties, including the trade unions.  The trade unions involved have also come to see me and they made a submission, asking that I should take it into consideration before making any announcement.  I promised I would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the very peremptory way in which the staff of the foras and the general public heard the announcement of its intended abolition, the staff there have endeavoured to operate in a very constructive manner in relation to this extraordinary decision.  It would obviously be beneficial if they had available to them, or even to their staff representative on a quasi-confidential basis, the main thrust of the report and recommendations so as to see whether they could make suggestions which would help the foras to live within a reduced budget and still provide optimum services. Would the Minister consider at least doing that?</P>

When consideration of the board's report and other matters has been completed the board could let the staff know what is proposed and how it is proposed to relocate and redeploy or retain.  An announcement by me might not be the best way to handle it.  The job will be done efficiently and there will be fair play for all concerned.  Big savings have to be made.  Nobody likes abolishing anything but I am satisfied that there are more cost-effective ways of doing it.  Judging by the report I have received from the interim board, those savings can be effected.  Certain consultations have to take place with other agencies regarding redeployment and so on.  I should like these to be completed before going to <Col N="1761" /> the employees and telling them precisely what is intended for them.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that one of the greatest difficulties for a Government once they have announced their decision to do something is to announce a change in that intention or decision, even if they might be disposed to make that change subsequently. In that context would it not be difficult if the Minister announced his intentions, based on the recommendations, when other suggestions might be made by the staff following his announcement which might be more beneficial?  The Minister would have the difficulty, which has obviously been experienced by some of his colleagues of late, of opposing changes when other Members of the Cabinet might be disposed to accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 44 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I announced on 27 October, that the banks and building societies have agreed to provide up to £70 million in 1988 to meet some of the demands for house purchase loans from persons who would normally have recourse to a local authority. Where a lending agency makes a loan under these arrangements it will, of course, take a mortgage on the property in line with standard practice.  The agencies involved will administer their own loans and there is no question of the payment of fees by them to the local authority.  Under the arrangements made, the lending agencies will not apply prior deposit or savings requirements to loan applicants and have agreed to lend up to 90 per cent of the house value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that there is a transfer of demand from local authorities to the banks and building societies, all applicants seeking a local authority loan after 28 October must apply in the first place to a building society and/or a bank and produce evidence of refusal of a suitable loan by both a society and a bank before the application can be considered by the local authority.  Applications already approved by local authorities at that date will be processed and paid in the normal way.  Others who had lodged applications with local authorities which had not been approved, will, in general, be required to <Col N="1764" /> approach a bank or building society; in this connection a reasonable approach will be adopted by local authorities, where an applicant who is eligible for a local authority loan has failed to obtain a loan suitable to his needs from a building society or a bank, his application for a loan will be considered in the normal way by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in these initial stages difficulties have been experienced by some persons seeking loans from individual branches of the lending agencies. Steps have been taken by the Department and the agencies to overcome these teething problems and I am satisfied that the new arrangements will work well once the transitional difficulties have been resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present these arrangements are causing chaos to people who otherwise would have applied for SDA loans?  Is the Minister aware that many people who approach the addresses given for branches or agencies of these financial institutions are being refused a hearing and a letter of refusal on the basis that they are not clients, or customers or have money invested with those institutions?  Is the Minister aware that as a result those people are unable to return to local authorities to apply for an SDA loan?  What does the Minister intend to do about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in so far as there were some teething troubles attached to the administration of the scheme.  Consultations have taken place with building societies and the banks because of the problems the Deputy has referred to.  In my view, it was a problem of communication and, in some instances, of interpretation.  The problem largely has been put right at this stage and arrangements have been made with the branch managers of building societies and circulars have been sent to the banks to give them a full briefing as to how they should approach the scheme.  I have suggested to local authorities that they should liaise directly with the lending agencies in their respective areas.  That <Col N="1765" /> has taken place in some areas and there is a working arrangement between the banks and local authorities.  Where that has been put in place it has worked extremely well.  I have received very good reports from those seeking loans and the institutions.  I agree that the problem has not been fully sorted out but I am satisfied it will work well when the teething troubles have been overcome.  Any inconvenience that has been suffered by applicants I regret but one way or another those entitled to a loan and those who are in a position to meet repayments on a loan will not be denied it because of this scheme.  In fact, the scheme has advantages for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

That person might have been an important witness in the defense of those six people whose appeal is drawing to a close.  I asked permission for the House to consider this by way of Private Notice Question to the Minister for Justice so that he could make representations to the court to the effect that it was the fault of people under his control that the witness was not present.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (1) (a), line 30, after &ldquo;order&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or a judgement arising from an industrial dispute and requiring the sequestration or seizure of goods or assets of trade unions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy McCartan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of the four members of The Workers' Party seeks to exclude the enforcement of a judgement from a European court in our jurisdiction that will amount to an arrest for committal for non-payment of debt.  Some of the facts in regard to committal for debt in relation to our prison service are worth outlining very briefly here.  In answer to a question from me on 18 June 1987 the Minister gave some details.  He indicated that in 1986 some 222 people were committed to prison for non-payment of debt in our own jurisdiction.  The average period of time any one of those persons spent in prison was 37 days and the average amount of money due to be paid by any one of those persons was £1,450.  Let us <Col N="1811" /> place that against the cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In answer to a question on 5 November 1987 the Minister put the weekly figure at £575 as the cost of detaining a person for one week in our prison service.  I would say that figure is probably a little conservative but it is a workable figure from the point of view of my argument. What this means is that under our current system on average the State spends more money keeping a person locked up for non-payment of debt than it was ever hoped to recover from the person locked up.  The State spends more money keeping a person in prison for non-payment of a debt than we could ever hope to recover from that person in the first place.  These people are incarcerated for an average of 37 days &mdash; in excess of five weeks &mdash; at a cost of £575 a week.  We are talking about a sum in excess of £2,500 to recover a maximum of £1,450 from any one of these committed debtors.</P>
      <P>The person who ultimately suffers imprisonment for the non-payment of debt is invariably the person who does not have the money &mdash; working people and the unemployed who have run into substantial debt through hire purchase, loan shark arrangements and so on. Anyone who goes to prison for non-payment of debt invariably goes because of poverty and the inability to pay.  That reality will no doubt apply to persons who might be the subject matter of a committal order for debt coming from outside our jurisdiction as well.</P>
      <P>The question we have to ask ourselves is this: will the Irish taxpayers be asked to commit themselves to the extent they currently are to chasing our domestic debtors without having to deal with the problem of those who might come under our concern by reason of the provisions of this Bill?  Allied to the whole problem not just of poverty and the pursuit of those afflicted with poverty is the question of prison overcrowding and whether we have room to accommodate any extra prisoners wherever they might come from or for whatever reasons they are imprisoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> On 5 November in reply to a question the Minister told us that 203 prison cells which are designed for single person occupancy were then accommodating two offenders.  That is a small indication of the degree of overcrowding that exists in our prisons.  In earlier replies he told us that landing space, governors' offices and other non-cell accommodation, in Mountjoy for example, is used on a daily basis to accommodate people who sleep on mattresses because there is no room in cells on a double-up basis or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We propose amendment No. 6 for the following reasons: it is wrong in principle, that because of poverty a person should be sent to prison because he cannot pay his debt, irrespective of where he comes from; at the moment our prison system is not capable of accommodating even the numbers which are sought to be committed from our own jurisdiction without taking on the responsibility of persons from abroad; and the fact that we spend far more money in pursuit of this sanction than we would ever hope to raise by way of the debt.  I commend these Amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the intention behind these amendments is to prevent the enforcement in Ireland under the convention of foreign orders for committal for non-payment of debt or for the sequestration of goods or assets of trade unions.  The amendments, as I will show, do not in fact have this effect.</P>
      <P>First, I want to say that the types of foreign orders in question do not come within the scope of the convention and, even if the amendments were technically correct, which they are not, they are completely unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Convention is set out in Article 1.  It applies to civil and commercial matters only.  I think it would be useful if I quoted from the Schlosser Report &mdash; paragraph 29, page 84 of the Official Journal, reference C59 March 1979 &mdash; on the 1978 Accession Convention. He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Working Party considered it <Col N="1813" /> obvious that criminal proceedings and criminal judgements of all kinds are excluded from the scope of the 1968 Convention and that this matter needed, therefore, no clarification in the revised text.  This applies not only to criminal proceedings in the strict sense.  Other proceedings imposing sanctions for breaches of orders or prohibitions intended to safeguard the public interest also fall outside the scope of civil law.</P>
    <P>The exclusion is based on the principle of private international law that courts of no country will execute the penal laws of another.  As is clear from the 1985 decision of Barrington J in the High Court in Larkins and others <i>v.</i> National Union of Mineworkers, civil contempt and sequestration are an exercise of State power &mdash; the former involves the imprisonment of the contemner's person and the latter the imprisonment of his assets &mdash; and are essentially penal in effect. Both, therefore, are clearly outside the scope of the convention.</P>
    <P>Now I will return to the amendments. Section 6 of the Bill deals only with the technical details of how a judgement may be enforced in practice once it has been declared enforceable.  It does not deal with whether the judgement is enforceable <i>per se</i>.  It could not in fact do so since whether a judgement is enforceable or not is determined by the Convention.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendments would be that the types of judgements listed in the amendments would not automatically be deemed to be of the same force and effect as High Court judgements but the implication would be that they would be enforceable in some other manner.  This would be tantamount to our saying in the Bill that we believed such judgements would be enforceable under the Convention but of course we do not say that. The insertion of these amendments which are unnecessary, could have the opposite effect to that intended by Deputy McCartan and, therefore, they must be opposed.</P>

      <P>These two matters were raised on Second Stage of this debate and at that time the position was not as clear as the Minister's explanation today.  I accept his bona fides in this regard but I am anxious not to lose the position I want to pursue in relation to these two amendments.  Therefore, I propose to withdraw these two amendments in favour of considering further the Minister's views as outlined.  Perhaps they can be reconsidered on Report Stage.  I understand the application of law at private international law level applies to the domestic definition when considering matters of inter-party dispute and, consequently, their construction of a civil or commercial matter is something that would lie within the jurisdiction of our High Court or other courts in determining that definition.  I am not absolutely convinced of the Minister's reply that the effect of the interpretation given by the author of the article to which he referred &mdash; whose name I did not note &mdash; would reflect the position of our courts in dealing with the definition of what is a civil and commercial matter.  Both of the proposed amendments deal with what I consider to be &mdash; and what I understand our courts consider to be &mdash; utterly and eminently civil matters.  The question of sequestration or seizure of goods in support of an action taken against the party is entirely a civil matter and, in certain circumstances, could also be considered commercial.  In addition, the commital to prison for the non-payment of debt, while it is a sanction, is a sanction that arises from a civil matter and is a feature that in our domestic law would be so constructed, either civil or commercial.  My understanding of the application of the norms of international private law in the construction given to it by the domestic court, that is the operative construction. However, I do not wish to pursue a matter which ultimately may not achieve the effect about which we are concerned. I propose to withdraw the amendments to undertake further consideration of the matter.  Perhaps I will re-enter them on Report Stage if necessary.</P>

Deputy McCartan, other Deputies and I dealt with the differing concepts of domicile in our law in the context of this Convention.  The Minister correctly explained the reasons for the concept of domicile in this Bill but I made the point that the Law Reform Commission produced very detailed recommendations on replacing the concept of domicile with the concept of habitual residence.  Will the Minister say whether in 1988 there will be legislation reforming generally the law in regard to domicile, either by its replacement by the concept of habitual residence or by retaining a reformed version of domicile, removing some of the more artificial notions attached to it such as the concept of domicile of origin reviving when you try to move out of a domicile of choice without having determined where your future domicile should be? There are also difficulties in throwing off a domicile of origin and acquiring a domicile of choice.  Will some of the proposals of the Law Reform Commission be implemented?  I should also like to make the point that I do not agree with certain aspects of the report produced by the Law Reform Commission, nevertheless, in so far as they deal with the artificiality of the modern concept of domicile, there is merit in some of their proposals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct, a report on this subject is available from the Law Reform Commission.

We hope to do so within the timescale outlined by Deputy Shatter.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to address the implications, particularly because it relates to the lower courts of jurisdiction, of legal aid.  He will remember that we drew attention to the observation in the Explanatory Memorandum that there would be no implications for the Exchequer in terms of providing legal aid and that the best service would be made available to litigants coming from other countries who wanted to pursue their judgements or maintenance orders in this jurisdiction.  On Second Stage I also referred to this matter and I had hoped that the Minister would consider it in the intervening period and give us an explanation as to how this could be stood over.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 68 of the Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
      <P>Article 44 of the 1968 Convention provides that an applicant for the enforcement of a judgement, who has been granted legal aid in the state of origin, shall, in relation to the initial enforcement proceedings, provided for in Articles 32 to 35 (i.e. up to and including the decision authorising or refusing enforcement), be entitled to the most favourable legal aid available in the state addressed.  Since the initial proceedings will be <i>ex parte</i> the cost to the Exchequer of providing legal aid for these purposes is likely to be insignificant. The Bill has no staffing implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> Has the Minister had an opportunity in the interim period to consider that afresh?  Could he give some indication as to how he considers the impact will be insignificant?  What does he consider to be the best legal aid facilities, given the fact that currently there are virtually none by reason of the overload of our full time law centres and the fact that funding has now been withdrawn by the Combat Poverty Agency to the voluntary organisation FLAC?  How does he consider that the Bill would have no staffing implications?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 44 of the Convention relates only to the case where it is sought to enforce a foreign judgement in Ireland.  It provides that, where an applicant for enforcement has benefited from legal aid in the judgement granting country, in the procedures provided for in Articles 32 to 35 that is the <i>ex parte</i> application for the enforcement of a foreign judgment in the judgment enforcing country, that applicant will be entitled to the most favourable legal aid available in the country.  It can be seen therefore that the Convention provides for legal aid only in relation to the <i>ex parte</i> enforcement stage.  In all other cases the normal rules governing the availability of legal aid in this country will apply.</P>
      <P>Insofar as the scheme of civil legal aid and advice is concerned generally, I have already stated that the Convention imposes an obligation on us in that regard.  No one knows better that I the constraints under which the Legal Aid Board has to operate, both in relation to staff and financial resources.  Nevertheless, I am confident that our obligation under the Convention will be fully discharged. Ratification by Ireland of the European Agreement on the transmission of Application for Legal Aid would be of assistance to the board in this regard, and I am hopeful that we will be in a position to sign that Agreement in the near future.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister drawn the implications of this Bill to the attention of the Legal Aid Board and to <Col N="1818" /> those officers who give so heroically of their energy working in the law centres around the country?  Are they happy with the position?  Are they happy that there will be no staffing implications in the implementation of this Bill?  Are they happy that they will be required with their present staff levels to provide the best available legal aid to foreign litigants coming here who are entitled to legal aid in their home country?  It is important to understand that it will not be a question of means testing here or a question of considering the range of areas covered under our law.  We have a very limited area of legal aid cover but that is not the criteria on which a decision will be made. A decision will be made on the availability to the litigant of legal aid in his own country.  The Minister is looking at this problem through the wrong set of glasses.  The implications are wider than he believes they might be.  I wonder if the Minister has even reconciled the operations of our legal aid scheme and its restrictions both in income and subject matter to the legal aid provisions available in all other European countries whose litigants will be coming here looking for redress.</P>

      <P>In the context of the procedures that operate under this Bill we will be seeking to have Irish orders <Col N="1819" /> enforced in other jurisdictions.  The area in which this will arise most often in practice will be in the context of maintenance orders being enforced in other European countries.  Arising from the issues Deputy McCartan raised, is the Minister satisfied that where our legal aid centres are providing free legal assistance to wives seeking to enforce maintenance orders in Ireland, the necessary legal assistance will be afforded in other Convention countries to Irish wives where such assistance is necessary with regard to the enforcement of orders outside of this country where such orders have originally been made by our courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Convention does not provide for any special procedures for an application to recognise and enforce a maintenance order.</P>
      <P>The normal procedure for an applicant who is not eligible for civil legal aid would be to make arrangements through a solicitor in Ireland to have an appropriate member of the legal profession of that country bring an application for enforcement there.  The costs involved in a successful application for enforcement would normally be recoverable from the maintenance debtor.</P>
      <P>In the case of a maintenance creditor who is eligible for civil legal aid, she will have obtained legal assistance in Ireland when bringing her action for maintenance and therefore under Article 44 of the Convention she will be eligible for legal aid from the authorities of the country in which she is seeking enforcement.  I will be asking the Legal Aid Board to make arrangements where appropriate to ensure a smooth transfer of such cases to their counterparts in other contracting states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the United Kingdom, special arrangements already exist whereby the maintenance creditor makes an application to the registrar or clerk of the court in Ireland which made the maintenance order.  The clerk then prepares the necessary documentation and transmits it via the Master of the High Court to the appropriate authority in the <Col N="1820" /> United Kingdom which arranges for its enforcement.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulties in extending this type of arrangement to other contracting states as all states do not have a central receiving authority for the enforcement of maintenance orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Convention in the maintenance area is of assistance in so far as wives have maintenance orders made in Ireland where husbands have deserted or disappeared to some other part of Europe.  In real terms the wife has gone to one of the Government law centres initially for a maintenance order and if the husband does not obey the maintenance order, she will not have fees available to pay the foreign lawyer to undertake enforcement measures. Because we will now be operating reciprocal arrangements with the various members of the EC who are parties to this Convention, it would be of assistance to wives in these circumstances and to solicitors who are understaffed and overworked in the law centres if the Legal Aid Board put together a small booklet for the solicitors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Otherwise, a lot of time will be spent by law centre solicitors in unravelling the legal aid provisions in other jurisdictions.  We are familiar with the British Isles position but we are not so familiar with the position in Germany and elsewhere.  As someone who has some experience in dealing with the German legal aid system, I know it would ensure that this Convention will work efficiently in this area.  It will ensure that wives seeking to enforce support payments outside of Ireland and the UK will have faster access to lawyers outside of Ireland and the UK when they need to do so and it will facilitate the workings of the law centres.  That should be implemented as a practical measure to ensure that when <Col N="1821" /> this Bill is passed it will work smoothly in this area and will be seen to provide help to many wives who currently cannot get that type of help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental aim of this Bill is to meet the need for a comprehensive and uniform set of national quality standards for meat for the home market.</P>
      <P>Since taking on responsibility for food, I have repeatedly stressed the need to build on our reputation as a country which produces, processes and markets top quality food products in a wholesome environment.  The Bill now before the House should be seen as an important element in this strategy.  My reason for introducing it is not only to enhance the good reputation we already have but also to push us along to even greater standards of quality and wholesomeness.</P>
      <P>Local abattoirs are supervised by veterinary inspectors employed by the sanitary authorities and/or environmental health officers from health boards.  The lack of proper and uniform standards is due partly to this diffusion of control and also to the fact that outside the major centres of population the veterinary inspectors are, for the most part, employed on a part-time basis only.  Of the 160 veterinary inspectors employed in the local authority veterinary service only 24 are full-time employees.  These full-time officers are concentrated in only nine local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards knackeries, it must be acknowledged that a valuable and practical <Col N="1823" /> service is rendered to the farming community by the majority of these premises.  However, I am not satisfied that the activities of all correspond with the best interests of both public and animal health.  This is the reason for tightening up the controls applicable to knackeries as provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation, some of it dating from the mid-19th century, places responsibility for the control of local abattoirs and knackeries on 87 sanitary authorities.  In addition, there is the separate existence of 11 Local Improvement Acts each of which contains provisions relating to abattoirs within the area of the sanitary authority concerned.  It could be said that the present unsatisfactory position regarding local slaughtering premises is at least partly due to both the number and the antiquated nature of the laws themselves just as much as it is to the discretionary powers they give to sanitary authorities to administer them.  Some authorities have not adopted meat inspection by-laws and only about 70 per cent of abattoirs are licensed.  Add to that the predominantly part-time veterinary control exercised over these premises and it is easy to understand the variations in standards and practices as applied from county to county.  Moreover, the penalties for breaches of the existing legislation are so small as to render prosecutions largely ineffective.</P>
    <P>These divergent standards are also manifested in the trading area and nowhere more so than in the pigmeat sector.  The House is aware that the pigmeat industry has gone through some difficult times.  Increased competition on the home and export markets has presented the licensed bacon plants with serious problems.  The Government and the industry have seen the need to tackle these problems and rationalisation of the processing sector, which is so vital to the survival of the whole industry, is now in progress.  The Government, through the IDA, along with FEOGA, are providing substantial capital investment for the sector.  However, rationalisation and <Col N="1824" /> investment will not be enough by themselves. Currently just 30 per cent of pigs slaughtered are exported.  The bulk of the kill, therefore, is chasing a domestic market in which significant inroads have been made by local pork butchers in the last five years.  Pig slaughterings by pork butchers have increased by 70 per cent during this period.  The licensed bacon plants are thus being placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> their unlicensed competitors owing to the cost of observing stringent hygiene standards and payment of veterinary inspection fees.  It would be nothing short of farcical if those who seek to adhere to the highest standards are penalised costwise compared to those who are producing at lesser standards.  Unless competitive equality can be restored to the home market I can see prices paid to pig producers suffering in the long term. Through the extension of veterinary controls and inspection fees to all local slaughterings this Bill should also provide useful assistance to the pigmeat industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>The butchers' trade itself has been undergoing change.  The development of slaughtering facilities by wholesale establishments has cut the number of private abattoirs by about 350 since the early seventies.  Slaughtering for their own businesses would appear to have become unattractive for many small butchers particularly at a time when labour and other costs are continually increasing. Consumer preferences and concerns have also pushed the trade into change. Other challenges to be met include meat substitutes, the prospect of increased imports of fresh meat and meat products and new EC controls on domestic meat supplies.  Clearly, now more than ever the trade needs to be flexible and adaptive. To their credit, most people in the trade recognise the need for fresh ground rules on the preparation of meat and also the need to root out the cowboy operators who can give the trade a bad name.  Most of our abattoirs are owned by family butchers, many of whom have been in the trade for generations.  Their names and good reputations underpin the quality of <Col N="1825" /> their meat.  I am sure this Bill will greatly assist them in making the transition from the old to the new while securing an enhanced reputation for the meat they produce.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes two major divisions of responsibility aimed at improving standards. These are: licensing of premises by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the vesting in the 27 county councils and the five county borough corporations of veterinary control of premises, including supervision of all slaughterings.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, because licensing of premises is lax in many areas and given the Bill's objective of establishing a national domestic standard on a par with export standards, there is a need for a central licensing body, at least in the short term.  In the initial stages therefore, my Department, which for long have been closely involved with the export meat plants and have the necessary expertise to do this job, will control licensing.  The enforcement of the new veterinary controls will continue to be exercised at local level.  Each of the major local authorities, or where warranted a combination of not more than two authorities, will be obliged to employ at least one full time officer.  All slaughterings will be subject to veterinary examination by way of ante and post-mortem inspection and all meat found fit for human consumption will be stamped with a health mark.  There will also be regular inspections of knackeries.  Veterinary inspection fees will be introduced on slaughterings at local abattoirs at the same levels as those applicable at the export plants.</P>
    <P>At present, full supervision of slaughterings is conducted by a very small minority of local authorities, notably in Dublin and Cork where all meat for human consumption carries a health mark.  It is not good enough that full slaughtering controls should be confined to a handful of areas.  As I mentioned earlier, this Bill will provide a national standard at the highest level and one which can be readily identified by consumers. <Col N="1826" /> It will provide an assurance to the Irish housewife that meat being sold on the home market has been prepared under hygienic conditions and is fresh, wholesome and in every way fit for human consumption.  In this way also it should provide a major fillip to the trade in its efforts to increase consumption of red meat.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of the Bill there has been considerable consultation with the various interests concerned including the domestic meat trade, local authorities and the veterinary associations.  My approach and that of my officials has been open and flexible while not losing sight of the basic aim of creating the framework for top quality production, processing and hygiene standards in the domestic meat sector.  We have taken on board many suggestions made in the course of these consultations and we have also incorporated some amendments put forward during the Seanad debate on the Bill.  I will refer to these in dealing with the detailed provisions of the Bill which I now move on to.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains definitions of the terms used in the Bill.  In the course of the Bill's passage in the Seanad, the home slaughtering concession provided for under the definition of &ldquo;abattoir&rdquo; was restricted to the killing of a pig or of an injured animal to prevent suffering.  This restriction was prompted by the trade's concern that any wider concession would lead to wholesale abuse.  Some Senators had sought that farmers should also be allowed slaughter a lamb without being subject to the Bill's controls.  The facility to kill a pig on the farm reflects a longstanding farming tradition in this country. However, to allow for the slaughter of lambs on farms would offer far greater scope for abuse to unscrupulous individuals. Already, my Department have had reports of sheep carcases of dubious origin reaching city markets.  There will be nothing in the Bill to prevent farmers, who so wish, from having a sheep or bovine professionally slaughtered in a licensed abattoir.</P>
    <P>Poultry is excluded from the definition of animal because I am satisfied that <Col N="1827" /> slaughterings at non-export poultry plants are adequately covered under the food hygiene regulations.  Similarly, deer and rabbits are excluded from the definition as commercial slaughterings of such species are, in the main, aimed at export markets and as such are already subject to controls.  Should the situation arise where such species are slaughtered in significant numbers for the home market at our local abattoirs they can be brought within the scope of the Bill under subsection (3) of this section.  However, to cater for poultry slaughterings leading up to Christmas time especially, and also for the occasional deer found in local abattoirs, provision is being made under section 39 (3) for such slaughterings to be subjected to veterinary examination.</P>
    <P>Section 8 to 16 deal with abattoir licences and make it unlawful for a person to use any premises as an abattoir unless he holds a licence issued by my Department. A licence will be valid for 12 months from the date of issue.  An annual licence fee at the following rates will be payable:</P>

    <P>Section 13 was amended in the Seanad to provide that on the death of a licence-holder the licence will continue in effect for the benefit of the personal representative of the deceased for two months or until its normal expiry whichever is the longer.</P>
    <P>As the licensing authority it would be inappropriate for me to sit in judgment on an appeal against refusal or revocation of a licence.  Accordingly, section 16 allows for appeals to lie to the Circuit Court.  In the Seanad the request was made for the establishment of individual county appeals bodies to obviate, where possible, the necessity for recourse to the Circuit Court.  I could not agree to such a request because I believe that, apart altogether from compositional difficulties, such an intermediate appeals <Col N="1828" /> system would prove to be largely redundant. My Department's basic approach to licensing of premises will be that all premises which are up to licensing standard will get a licence and any premises which is not up to licensing standard but which can, through improvements reach that standard, will get a permit as provided for under section 17.</P>
    <P>A premises would need to be in a very poor state not to qualify for a permit and so I envisage that the number of cases arising which would not qualify for either a licence or a permit should be very few indeed.  As public health will be the overriding consideration in cases of outright refusal or revocation I feel that recourse to the Circuit Court is the proper way to cater for appeals.</P>
    <P>Arising from the 1982 survey of premises, which I mentioned earlier, it is evident that a number of premises will require modifications, in varying degree, to achieve the required standard.  To meet this situation I am providing under section 17 for a permit system, somewhat like a provisional licence, for a transitional period of five years.  A permit will be issued for a specified duration and will be renewable, if necessary, to allow proprietors time to bring their premises up to standard.  It will have the same validity as a licence for all purposes under this Bill.  I propose to have the permit indicate the improvements required, be they structural or in relation to equipment or otherwise.  This permit system will only apply to abattoirs currently in existence and which are capable of being brought up to standard.  The control of operations within slaughtering premises will be set out by me in regulations to be made under section 20.  These regulations will embrace such matters as lairaging, core times during which slaughterings may take place, meat preparation and processing, the hygiene of staff, premises and equipment and the storage and disposal of animal wastes.  As to the actual times of slaughter, these will be fixed by the local authorities in consultation with the trade.  Sufficient flexibility will be provided for in the regulations to satisfy most <Col N="1829" /> needs and I would expect that local authorities will, in fixing times, have regard to business practice in their particular areas.  However, the primary consideration will be that the arranged times must facilitate the veterinary examination of all slaughtered animals.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains similar provisions in relation to knackeries.  Two sections in this part of the Bill, however, warrant particular mention.  In view of the activities of a number of rogue operators on the meat supply scene, section 22 places an absolute prohibition on the sale for human consumption of any meat which has originated in a knackery.  From both the public health and animal health points of view, section 34 is important. Knackeries owe their existance in large measure to the diseases and accidents which beset livestock.  They operate on the periphery of the agricultural sector without adequate controls on their activities. As I mentioned earlier, they perform a very necessary service to local farmers and butchers in collecting and disposing of dead animals and animal wastes.  For hunt and greyhound kennels involved in the business it is a very practical and economic undertaking.  The sad fact is, however, that the owners of some knackeries are less than scrupulous in their activities and other just careless when it comes to animal health or environmental matters.  Section 34 will bring these premises under strict control. It will enable me to make regulations controlling sales from these premises such as meat at greyhound tracks, supplies to cats and dogs homes, etc.  Advertising for dead or casualty animals will be regulated and the maintenance of specified records of animals handled in such premises will be obligatory.  Hopefully, in this way also we should be able to get a better picture of animal losses and the causes of these losses.</P>
    <P>Section 35 requires each local authority to employ sufficient veterinary inspectors, at least one of which must be full-time, to enforce the Bill's veterinary control provisions.  Apart from supervision of the domestic meat trade the local authority veterinary service has a <Col N="1830" /> range of other functions.  These include supervision of dairies and the liquid milk trade, organisation of the sheep dipping programme and attending to sheep scab outbreaks and other scheduled animal diseases.  As the Minister responsible for the local authority veterinary service I am only too well aware that, in the absence of a full-time presence, attention to all such duties cannot but be less than satisfactory. As I mentioned earlier, veterinary control and inspection of meat and milk for the home market in over two-thirds of the country is done solely on a part time basis,.  The provisions of section 35 will redress this situation through the establishment of a corps of permanent official veterinarians throughout the country.  Subsection (4) of this section will allow any two local authorities, subject to my consent, to pool together for the purpose of making the full time veterinary appointment required.  This facility is being provided to cater for a small number of local authority areas where it makes more sense, either logistically or on financial grounds, to combine for the purpose of providing a full time veterinary service.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide a guarantee that the meat leaving our abattoirs is in all respects fit for human consumption.  It is important therefore that consumers can readily recognise that the meat they are buying has undergone and passed veterinary inspection.  The application of a health mark to such meat will provide this assurance.  Equally important, having particular regard to meat wholesaling, will be the control and tracing facility inherent in such marking.  The health marking arrangements are set out in sections 40 to 42.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 to 46 deal with the payment of veterinary inspection fees which will be payable on each animal slaughtered at the following rates per head: cattle £3.25, pigs £0.75 and sheep £0.55. These fees will be payable by the licence holder to the local authority.  The fees are intended to provide a self-financing basis for the local authority veterinary service to be provided and are derived from an analysis of anticipated costs conducted <Col N="1831" /> by my Department.  Provision is also being made to allow for the fees to be altered by way of regulations which will require prior Dáil and Seanad approval.  In the Seanad I had to oppose an amendment seeking to link any variations in the fees with changes to the Consumer Price Index as such linkage could have no regard to actual cost. Moreover, the proposed rates are the same as those currently applicable at the export plants where inspection fees are not linked to the Consumer Price Index. Separately linking the fees for domestic abattoirs alone to annual changes in the CPI could give rise to an anomalous situation between the home and export trades.  It could also work to the disadvantage of the domestic trade in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to update a number of relevant provisions in other legislation as set out in Part VI.  The amendments being made concern mainly the bringing of fees and fines into line with those proposed for abattoirs under this Bill.  In relation to fines, the existing penalties for failure to license an abattoir or for violation of slaughtering by-laws are no more than £5 under the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847.  This minimal penalty has given rise to situations whereby it was no impediment to the slaughterer to continue in breach of the rules.  Section 56 increases the penalties considerably with maximum fines of £1,000 or six months imprisonment or both on summary conviction and £10,000 or three years imprisonment or both on indictment.  The level of these penalties should present a real deterrent to any would-be offender.  As standards of public health and hygiene are the primary considerations I make no excuses for raising the fines to these levels.  Should it be found necessary to do so at some future stage, I am also making provision to enable these fines to be increased by way of regulations which again would be subject to prior Dáil and Seanad approval.</P>
    <P>Section 60 will allow me to monitor the application of the Bill's provisions in each <Col N="1832" /> area through returns to be made by the local authorities.  These returns will be important also from a statistical point of view in that they will give an accurate picture of slaughterings for the home trade.  They will also help to identify, to a greater extent, diseases affecting stock and to indicate whether they are cyclical or localised disease outbreaks.  Section 61 will enable me to make regulations prescribing the requirements in relation to the construction, lay-out, siting, water supply and equipment of abattoirs and knackeries.  It also provides that these requirements may be modified in relation to existing premises.  These standards will be reasonable and realistic and should be attainable by the majority of butchers. The emphasis will be on hygiene which is a basic requirement in any food premises.</P>
    <P>Local authority by-laws relating to abattoirs and knackeries and the inspection of meat will no longer be necessary as regulations to be made under this Bill will lay down the standards to be observed.  Section 62 therefore has the effect of cancelling any such by-laws once the corresponding provisions of the Bill come into operation.  Similarly, any by-laws relating to meat transport will be superseded by amended food hygiene regulations in relation to the transport of food.  As regulations to be made under this Bill will, in future, set out the standards to be met in abattoirs and knackeries, section 67 excludes the provisions of the food hygiene regulations from applying to such premises.  The food hygiene regulations will, however, continue to apply to the transport and retail sides of the meat trade.</P>
    <P>These are the salient features of the Bill which I commend to the House and in so doing I would like to thank my predecessor in office and all the bodies who have contributed to its preparation. The trade particularly are to be complimented for the way they encouraged and sometimes pressed the Department to get on with this legislation.  Some of them are the second and third generation of people in the trade and have tremendous pride in their profession and in the standard and quality of their product.  I <Col N="1833" /> would like to acknowledge the contribution they made in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I acknowledge the welcome and support for the general thrust of the Bill from people from all parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue. In relation to both human and animal health there has been longstanding and growing concern about conditions and standards at many of the 856 slaughterhouses in the country.  The need for action was further highlighted by the survey of slaughterhouses carried out by the last Government to which the Minister of State referred.  This survey yielded the following conclusions: suitable premises, 162 or 18.9 per cent; suitable with minor modifications, 181 or 21.1 per cent; suitable with medium modifications, 193 or 22.6 per cent; suitable with major modifications, 184 or 21.5 per cent; unsuitable, 136 or 15.9 per cent.  They were the figures of the total of 856.  The survey clearly confirmed that there was a basis for criticism of standards.  For this reason the last Government authorised the drafting of a Bill to provide for standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughtering premises catering solely for the home market on a par with those already existing at export meat plants.</P>
      <P>The heads of the Bill were duly prepared and approved and I am now glad that at this stage the present Government have brought the Bill before the House for approval.  I am also glad that the responsibility lies with my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh.  This enforces my confidence that on this issue at least the matter will be brought to be a sensible conclusion on a coherent and planned basis, as opposed to the muddle that has characterised many of the other ministerial decisions, or more correctly indecisions, emanating from Agriculture House.  However, discussion on those can wait for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the Bill, apart from the slaughterhouses, it is important that the Bill should cover knackeries.  The survey <Col N="1834" /> to which I referred covered 112 of these. Most of them were found to be small and, in many cases, old and ill-equipped. Accordingly, it is right and proper that the Bill should provide control over domestic slaughterings for non-human consumption as, at present, little or no supervision takes place at those 112 knackeries.  Indeed, among concerns expressed about their operations are allegations that some of these premises are supplying meat for human consumption. Furthermore, almost a quarter of them are reported to constitute a hazard to either public or animal health.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the present situation is entirely unsatisfactory.  Antiquated laws dating back to 1847 contribute to this situation, as do the discretionary powers they give to the sanitary authorities to administer them.  Some local authorities have not even adopted meat inspection by-laws and licensing of premises is lax in quite a number of areas with only two-thirds of existing slaughterhouses so licensed.  Thus, varying standards apply to the trade throughout the country and the penalties for breaches of the existing legislation are totally out of date.  I think the Minister of State referred to a figure of £5: it is quite clear that in the context of presentday commerce that is not a deterrent to anybody who is operating outside the law, or wants to do so.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, this Bill deserves the full support of the House, but there are a number of points arising thereunder to which I want to refer and which I want to put before the Minister for consideration. The first concerns what appears to be a duplication of control in that the licensing of premises is to be carried out by the Minister whereas the veterinary control of the premises and the charging and collection of inspection fees are to be carried out by the major local authorities. I accept that there is a facility in the Bill to enable the Minister to delegate licensing to local authorities, but I question whether this duplication arrangement is wise.  It seems that local authorities are to be the main implementing bodies and in that situation is this duplication of responsibility sensible?  We <Col N="1835" /> are now very much in an era in which the efficient use of all public service staff should be at a premium and that puts the onus on somebody proposing what is, in effect, a duplicate system to fully justify the need for same.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on this when he spoke of the lack of proper and uniform standards being partly due to diffusion of control and also to the fact that outside the major centres of population the veterinary inspectors are for the most part employed on a part time basis only.  Of course, under the Bill the latter part is to be changed and we are now going to have a series of full time veterinary inspectors throughout the country, employed by the local authorities.  That removes any argument that one might raise with regard to part time veterinary inspectors.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the other question, diffusion of control.  Rather than having a battalion of Department vets visiting premises drawing, presumably, substantial travelling expenses and subsistence allowances while so doing and, at the same time, having local authority veterinary officers going in there on a daily or, if not, a weekly basis would it not be wiser to establish the standards and if necessary call together for an occasional meeting the local authority veterinary officers and allow the licensing to be done on foot of their inspections? I am not making a huge point about it, but it seems that at a time when, from the point of view of the public finances, we should be watching every shilling there certainly is a case to be met when any question of duplication arises in the administrative arrangements.  I am asking the Minister to examine that.  Also, apart from the cost, surely there is the question of effectiveness.  The veterinary officer from the local authority, or one of his team, will be in regular contact with the premises in question.  Surely that is the officer who would be far more capable of giving a decision on the question of the granting or continuation of licences or permits?</P>
    <P>The second major point concerns current policies on granting of State aid to <Col N="1836" /> the meat industry on the home market. The IDA provide grants for undertakings which manufacture products for sale on export markets or for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to significant international competition.  It is, however, a fact that grant-aided companies are competing on the home market.  Fees will be payable at all abattoirs at the same level as those applicable at export plants and, to a degree, justification for this Bill presented by the Minister is that the playing pitch is being levelled from that point of view.  Fair enough, I accept that point.  However, if there is to be an equalisation of arrangements in regard to fees, surely that strengthens the case for the provision of grant-aid towards the improvement of abattoirs solely supplying the domestic market?  Again, this is not just any old plea for more money. There are certain funds available for the improvement of meat slaughtering facilities. These at present are concentrated on those supplying the export market. There is justification there; one can see that.  However, here there certainly is, to use a current vogue phrase, a <i>prima facie</i> case for extending that grant aid to abattoirs that are solely concentrating on the home market.</P>
    <P>A very good case is made for this in the <i>Master Butcher</i> of November 1987. My comments at this stage relate to an article by the President of the Master Butchers' Federation, Mr. Eugene Kearns.  He brings up a number of points which at the very minimum need to be dealt with and replied to.  He raises a very reasonable case along the lines that I am making.  He points out in this article that the retail butchering trade provides employment for 6,000 people.  He says this is done without any fuss, without any major announcements of factory expansions providing new jobs.  That is a fair enough point.  He goes on to say that he does not seek to malign the export meat plants or begrudge them grant aid.  He refers to the EC having a market of 310 million people and as far as the Irish Meat Butchers' Federation are concerned they applaud the meat factories for going out and getting a better share of that market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> In relation to the question of grant aid, he says their position is quite clear.  They do not mind competition provided it is fair competition.  He says that when others get grant aid and use that money to deprive them of their market share, they must ask, is that fair?  He answers the question himself by saying no.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>If we have to compete with &ldquo;export&rdquo; meat factories leaking very large volumes of meat onto the home market then, from our viewpoint, the pitch is not level, the referee is not impartial and the goal posts are being moved. All we want on the home market is the same market opportunity for all.</P>
    <P>I rest the case on that point.  It is made very adequately by the President of the Master Butchers' Federation.  I would ask the Minister to deal with those points in his reply.  I should add, in the light of figures that are produced in the survey that clearly there will have to be a fair amount of expenditure on slaughtering premises around the country and that again highlights the need for some form of support to ensure that that expenditure is incurred as quickly as possible so that the job is done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The third major point concerns standards which will be required under the Bill.  I cannot understand the reluctance to specify these standards.  There is concern in some quarters that impossible standards may be set.  The Minister is a very reasonable man but it is all very well for him to reiterate, as I expect he will, that the standards will be reasonable and realistic and that they should be attainable by the majority of butchers.  I could write the Minister's reply to this point but a question does remain.  Why not spell out the details at this stage?  It is very clear that the standards should not solely be related to structures.  Work practices, hygiene, supervision and so on will have to be included.  The standards should be spelled out now.  It would be fairer to everybody if that were done and it would <Col N="1838" /> remove a certain degree of concern in the trade.</P>
    <P>Another point which causes concern and which deserves to be raised here relates to the health mark which would be applied to meat by a veterinary inspector under section 40.  Regulations are to be made under this section but it is important that the details be clarified at this stage.  A number of practical questions arise here and I am very interested in hearing the answers to them.  How many stamps are to be applied to the carcase which has been cut into sections?  I am told that a relatively small lamb carcase could be cut into 24 different sections.  In fact, I was given an outline of all the various parts and told their technical names.  I will not go into such detail but I think the Minister will get the point I am aiming at.</P>
    <P>Is a mark to be applied to each section? If we take the section from which we get our chops is a health mark to be put on each chop?  That is the kind of practical issue which should be clarified.  Another sensible point which should be raised here and which was made to me by someone involved in the trade is that the mark in certain circumstances could be unsightly.  This raises the question as to whether there is a case for using an ultra-violet stamp which would not be visible to the naked eye.  In the old days when people attended a premises in large numbers &mdash; I have gone a bit beyond my dancing days now &mdash; they used to get a pass out but I gather that nowadays a stamp is put on the back of a person's hand which is not visible to the naked eye but which does show up under an ultra-violet light.  As there is this concern about unsightly visible marks on meat is there not a case for using something similar to this ultra-violet light?  I think the Minister knows enough about it to take the point I am making and perhaps when he is replying he will deal with it.</P>
    <P>The veterinary officers produced a report in 1984 and I take it that the Minister is aware of the various recommendations they made under the heading &ldquo;Supervision of the home market meat trade&rdquo;.  The Bill covers a number of the <Col N="1839" /> recommendations contained in that report but it is worth noting that the veterinary officers felt it was important that a system of grant aid should be introduced to encourage the building and reconstruction of slaughter houses.  This further reinforces the point made by the President of the Master Butchers' Federation.</P>
    <P>I was also interested in the reference to the system for the retrieval of information and I would like some more information on this from the Minister.  The veterinary officers felt that this would be very useful and would provide for more effective control in the animal health area, including tuberculosis in cattle.  The Minister is aware of my interest on that point.  Returns will have to be made by the local authorities but one of the problems, if I may take bovine TB as an example, is that there is a mass of information available while there is no proper procedure for analysing the information and statistics and for drawing the appropriate conclusions from them.  Again, another practical question arises.  Is the assembly of this information to be on a modern basis or is there just to be heaps and heaps of paper, laboriously hand written and then carefully filed away to gather dust for decades to come?  I would like to see this system used effectively and I believe it can only be used effectively if it is computerised.  If it were computerised it would be relatively easy to analyse the information.</P>
    <P>The other points raised in the veterinary officers' report have been touched on either in the Bill or by the Minister.  They also raised the issue of a detailed directive covering the correct handling of slaughtered animals, slaughtering technique etc. and they suggested that compliance with the guidelines should be a condition of suitability for renewal of a licence.  That goes back to the earlier point I made in regard to standards and the sooner we have them the better.</P>
    <P>By coincidence I received a letter this morning from a young lady who is studying to become an environmental health <Col N="1840" /> officer.  While making it clear, that, like everybody else, she welcomed the Bill she raised the question of whether there should be a role for environmental health officers in the implementation of the Bill. She thought there was a serious discrepancy in that no reference was made to this question.  It is a fair point from someone who engages in such study and to be consistent, having raised the question earlier of duplication as between the Department and the local authority, I now find myself pressing for the establishment, from a statutory point of view, of separate offices but in the larger local authorities a role could be found for environmental health officers.  Perhaps, they could be included among the staff of the veterinary officer in charge of inspections.  I am not sure whether the Minister would agree with me on that point.  A case has been made by this young lady and it seems that a solution might be found in that area.</P>
    <P>The final point I wanted to raise with the Minister relates to the progress or lack of it since the survey was carried out a few years ago.  I quoted statistics from that survey and I am very keen to know what progress has been made pending the introduction of the Bill.  I am aware that the last Minister for Agriculture did issue instructions that the county managers in the various local authorities were to be given the overall details and in particular the details within their area.  They were also asked to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure an improvement.</P>
    <P>Finally, they were asked to furnish the Department with reports on progress on this matter.  Therefore, pending the introduction of the legislation the previous Government were quite concerned that that survey would seek to have improvements carried out as quickly as possible. I hope that the progress reports that were sought at the time were not lost or stacked away in files and not used as I feel the retrievable information under the present Bill will be unless it is computerised. Will the Minister confirm that progress has been made in the meantime and give a outline of the level of that progress?  Have the county managers in <Col N="1841" /> the various local authorities reacted to pressure from the Minister and the Department following that survey?  Have they taken steps to improve matters in the areas where the statistics were appalling? I can speak freely in that I am glad to say the survey shows that Cork had at the time of the survey a relatively good record; it was not perfect, but some other counties were in need of a major shakeup. In this reply, will the Minister let us know what kind of progress has been made to date?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party welcome this Bill. We are glad it is at this Stage before the House.  I have listed a number of points which the Minister might deal with. Deputy Durkan, who has a major interest in this area, has some important points to raise with the Minister.  However, the Minister can take it that he will receive co-operation from this side of the House in having this Bill put through in a reasonable way, subject to clarification of the points raised and perhaps a few points on Committee Stage.  I hope this legislation will be in place very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparatory work for this Bill was undertaken by the previous Administration and its presentation before the House this evening is very welcome.  Nobody in the House can dispute that this type of legislation is well overdue.  To date abattoirs and knackeries operate under a variety of legislative and regulatory controls many of which date back to the 19th century.  Needless to say, many abattoirs were unhygienic, insanitary and in need of supervision by officials and inspectors.  Conditions in these premises contrast with those in premises and factories which slaughter meat for export.  The export market has strict regulations with regard to slaughtering techniques, ante and post-slaughtering examination of animals, grading and so on.  EC regulations are to be imposed to ensure that consumers overseas are guaranteed the best possible products in the Irish market.  I am not criticising this approach.  This is the way we should be working but it is somewhat ironic that we go to great lengths to <Col N="1842" /> ensure that consumers abroad are catered for while we adopt an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to the community and the consumer at home.  This Bill proposes to change all that.  It is an attempt to put an end to those double standards and I hope it will do so.</P>
      <P>However, I have some reservations about aspects of the implementation of the legislation and the impending regulations. The Minister on Second Stage in the Seanad outlined the statistical background of the area concerned.  He pointed out that there are currently 854 abattoirs in operation and together these premises handle an annual slaughtering throughput of 230,000 cattle, 790,000 sheep and 320,000 pigs.  For the most part the premises are hygienic and working conditions are sanitary, but almost every Senator who participated in the debate acknowledged that there are a significant number of insanitary premises, and those are the concern of the legislation.  At present, these abattoirs are served by only 24 full-time veterinary inspectors and the rest of the staff are part-time. The Bill before the House seeks to improve this position by providing that every county area will engage one full-time inspector with back-up ancillary staff.  Where two adjoining counties cover a reasonable area there may be a joint operation with a full-time inspector servicing abattoirs in both counties.  All staff will be employed under local authorities.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill to engage full-time staff under local authorities is welcome and an enormous improvement on the current <i>ad hoc</i> system, but I have doubts as to whether this can be done effectively.  Finance may not be made available to ensure that individual local authorities will be able to employ full-time staff on an ongoing basis.  The present climate of staff cutbacks in the public service may affect the implementation of the provisions of the Bill thereby making it inoperable.  It is important that the staff envisaged under this legislation be at least provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this point because we are aware of the financial crisis in local authorities <Col N="1843" /> which is not improving; it appears to get worse with every new development.  The figures made available to me recently by my county manager indicate that 203 principal statutes lay a financial burden on local authorities and 61 other statutes affect them financially also.  This Bill is another such measure.  The provisions in the Bill will place another financial burden on local authorities.  I am opposed to the method of funding.  It is a system of taxation at the point of delivery of services that seems to be used more and more throughout our financial system.  It is replacing taxation on income and other systems of equitable taxation.  It must be the most regressive form of taxation that could be devised.  It has no reference to ability to pay the tax or use of the service and usually will end up being passed directly to the consumer and not paid by the person who is getting the service.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a measure of finance to the local authority in the form of licence fees slaughtering charges etc., which will be maximised at £1.4 million in the current year.  Out of this amount it is proposed to engage 27 full time inspectors to serve the counties and five inspectors to serve the county boroughs.  There is to be an increase in part time and back-up staff if the legislation and regulations are to be effective.  I would like some assurance from the Minister that he is satisfied this funding is adequate, and if not that the Government will not attempt to put further pressure on the local authorities or back on the farmers in the form of further charges.  At a time of financial stringency and in this climate of cuts Members have legitimate concerns about any further burden on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Regarding finance, I should like to make another point which is quite relevant to my earlier remarks about double standards.  I note that the Bill proposes to give abattoirs and knackeries a transitional period in which they must bring their operations up to the required standard. However, there is no mention of fund aid for any of the going concerns. A number of slaughtering factories which supply the export market are grant-aided <Col N="1844" /> by the IDA.  Perhaps the Minister will explain the difference in approach and tell us whether his Department have undertaken research on the resources of the abattoirs and the small family butchers and if it is reasonably expected that the majority of them can comply with the new legislation.  I am particularly concerned about jobs in the home industry. If jobs are to be lost as a result of the new legislation the Minister should seek financial help for some of the concerns. In addition it is important that any new legislation should not drive even more operators under ground.  We are aware that there is already an unacceptable level of meat products on the Irish market which come from unlicensed knackeries and abattoirs.  It is important that the legislation should prohibit this and not serve to make matters worse.</P>
    <P>Since the primary purpose of this legislation is to protect the Irish consumer, it must ensure that any meat that reaches the table is fit for human consumption. Regrettably, that has not been the situation to date.  Meat which is unfit for consumption has been off-loaded on Irish consumers, particularly those on low incomes who have been conned into buying parcels of meat at reduced rates from salespersons around the country. These merchants sell at low prices to retailers who are willing to pass on the meat to consumers or alternatively they visit large housing estates where the poor are glad to get a parcel of meat at such low prices.  These people depend on the law and the vigilance of inspectors to protect them and they buy these products on trust.  It is up to us as legislators to ensure that this legislation does what it is proposed to do and does not fail because of insufficient funding or insufficient staff to implement its proposals.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Bill goes far enough to protect the consumer in this regard.  For example, the Bill indicates that all animals must be inspected before and after slaughtering.  If conditions have been approved, the meat will receive a health stamp but the Bill does not go into detail as to what part of the carcase will be stamped.  What of the rest of the carcase? <Col N="1845" /> Surely the Bill is relying far to heavily on the goodwill of the retail outlet.  There is really no way of guaranteeing even after the passage of this legislation that what we purchase as beefburgers, hamburgers, sausages and so on is meat which has been given a health stamp.  The only person who is certain of the origin of the product is the retailer and the customer is dependent on his or her goodwill.  I would remind the House that it is largely because the abattoirs and the retail outlets cannot be trusted to think of the customer first that this legislation is before us and it is up to us to ensure in this Bill that no stone is left unturned when it comes to the health of the home consumer.</P>
    <P>I should like to see provision in the Bill dealing with control at the point of sale and I would ask the Minister to address himself to that area.  There is a basic flaw between the point where the carcase is examined after slaughter and the point of sale to the consumer.  Some method must be devised whereby inspection can take place at the point of sale to ensure that only meats that have been the subject of examination and certification are being sold in butchers' outlets.  There was some discussion on this point in the Seanad.  The Minister said he was in touch with the Department of Health and that legislation was pending to ensure that the consumer would be protected at the point of purchase.  The Minister promised this legislation within a few months and I should appreciate an indication of progress in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am equally concerned about the slaughter of animals on private farms.  I take the Minister's point that there will be accidents on farms and animals will have to be put down, especially if they are in pain, but I am not satisfied that the Bill gives sufficient protection to the consumer.  If legislation makes provision for exceptions, there is very little to stop dishonourable farmers or butchers killing more than one animal under the guise of an accident or indeed causing an accident to ensure that they can legally slaughter the animals in the farmyard.  I should like more control in the form of veterinary <Col N="1846" /> inspectors having to report on all accidents where they occur.  This would involve more work for the inspectors and possibly more staff, but if the intention of the Bill is to ensure good standards for the business and the public, we must ensure that there are no loopholes.</P>
    <P>In attempting to eliminate some of the worst excesses and abuses the Bill should ensure uniformity in regulations, ante-and post-mortem examination of animals, supervision of slaughtering, inspection of abattoirs and knackeries, enforcement of hygiene, pollution control, health marking of meat and inspection of licences.  These are certainly mammoth tasks and we should be under no illusion about the level of funding and staffing required to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue. My party will be supporting it but I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to the points I have raised.  If I am not satisfied with the response I will table amendments at a later stage.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol duit, is é inniu Lá na Gaeilge agus mar sin ba mhaith liom, as Gaeilge, fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>I should like at the outset to pay tribute to Deputy Joe Walsh for his contribution in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I have always maintained the importance of having such a ministry and Deputy Walsh has made a major contribution to date.  Not alone does he know his brief but he also knows his beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have stated that one of their main objectives is to make Ireland a major producer of pure food. The Minister and the junior Minister have been successfully promoting this policy since taking office.  The introduction of this Bill is a major element of this strategy.  One of the first questions I placed before this Dáil on my election as a Deputy related to the subject matter of a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on RTE dealing with the illegal slaughtering of cattle and the illegal sale of meat.  No <Col N="1847" /> doubt many Members recall that programme. The Minister for Health indicated in response that he had made a closure order under the food hygiene regulations in respect of the premises featured prominently in that programme.  I hope that as a result of this Bill we will never see a repeat of this scandalous practice of illegal slaughtering of cattle and illegal sale of meat.  I commend RTE on the investigative journalism which led to that and many other programmes.  They have a major role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for several reasons but primarily because it will introduce higher standards and a centralised, uniform system for the slaughter of cattle and the sale of meat.  Up to now there have been different standards for our meat exports than those applied to meat sold on the domestic market.  The people of Ireland deserve and should have by right the same standards applying to the meats they consume as the standards that are applied to the meat we export.  It is deplorable, indeed, insulting, to the people of Ireland that the law has allowed double standards exist for so long.  What we have been saying is that for the home market anything will do and for that reason I am delighted that we have finally faced up to this problem.</P>
    <P>With the passage of the Bill there is no doubt that there will be an improvement in overall health standards, particularly on the domestic scene.  Apart from the obvious need to protect the home consumer Ireland cannot be truly described as a quality food producer unless we demand high standards of cleanliness and hygiene in our abattoirs.  This will indirectly benefit our exports.  Our image as a pure food producer will be enhanced and there will be an end to the double standards.  Quite frankly, the legislation is long overdue.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to cast a shadow over an industry that has in the main maintained very high standards.  In a consumer orientated market low standards are no longer tolerated, and rightly so. The Bill is in the interests of those working legally in the industry.  It will improve <Col N="1848" /> their position and enable the authorities to weed out illegal back street operators who I understand have quite a hold on the market at present.  The Bill represents a strong deterrent by proposing stricter fines and penalties.  The Minister will have power to regulate them accordingly and that should go a long way towards eliminating further problems.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increase in fines and penalties there is a requirement to keep records.  Section 59 obliges licence holders to keep records in regard to a number of matters ranging from the place where the animal is bought to identifying the owner.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will have leeway to include other areas of record keeping.  Violators will be subject to prosecution and I hope that acts as a deterrent to illegal activities. Licence issuing powers will be given to the Minister for a number of reasons. The Bill will repeal older Acts pertaining to abattoirs and will update old laws with a new national central approach to abattoirs. It is only fitting that the Minister should be involved at this stage.</P>
    <P>Up to now the issuing of some licences by sanitary authorities has been less than satisfactory.  The Bill will give the Minister power to return at the appropriate time the licensing powers to those authorities. In other words, the Minister will not be taking on that power permanently. He will establish the new system, get the required standards in place, monitor their operation and then re-involve local authorities. That is the correct approach and it shows how concerned the Government are about long term improvement of standards. I have been assured also that the lax controls that exist at present will be tightened up.  There has been an absence of full time inspection officers at local authority level for many years.  There are 32 local authorities but only 24 full time officers who operate in only nine areas. The Bill will clear up that anomaly by assigning a full time officer to each local authority.  At a time of cutbacks the Government are employing more inspectors and that is an indication of their commitment to improving standards.  It is proposed that each full time officer <Col N="1849" /> should have a number of part time officials to assist in covering all bases. Those officers will have the power to shut down or halt any slaughtering of food preparation in any abattoir that constitutes a serious health hazard.  The owner who refuses to obey an order will be guilty of an offence.  The powers, and the number of inspectors, will be increased by the Bill and they alone are good enough reasons to support it.</P>
    <P>Several trade associations have come out in support of the measure.  The Irish Domestic Meat Association, the Irish Master Butchers Federation and the Irish Meat Wholesalers Association have come out in support of the Bill.  They are pleased that the Bill will bring order to domestic trade and improve standards. The provisions are important and we should endeavour to place them on the Statute Book as soon as possible.  As a matter of urgency we should update our old laws that have shown themselves to be too lax and without proper structure or form.</P>
    <P>The meat and food industry is under threat from meat substitutes, food additives and the worrying process of irradiation which, in effect, can artificially prolong the shelf life of meat.  In such a climate the meat industry and the Government, must work vigorously to establish fresh ground rules on the preparation of the meat and in rooting out illegal traders who can seriously damage our image at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a survey of slaughter houses carried out by the Department of Agriculture in 1982.  That survey, which was referred to by the Minister, painted a very disturbing picture. Of 856 slaughter houses surveyed 136 were found to be unsuitable; 184 required major modifications; 193 required medium modifications and 181 required minor modifications.  It appears that in 1982 16 per cent of our slaughter houses were regarded as unsuitable and upwards of another 21 per cent would require major modifications if they were to be brought up to acceptable standards. In other words, 37 per cent of the slaughter houses in Ireland in 1982 were more <Col N="1850" /> or less unsuitable.  The inherent human and health hazards resulting from that are obvious.  One must wonder how we survived as a race under such conditions. It is said that the Irish have a habit of over cooking their food but perhaps this practice of cooking meat, originating from having unsuitable slaughter houses, has in the past saved the lives of Irish consumers.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to sound alarmist but it is important that I should give details of that official survey.  At the time in ten counties none of the slaughter houses was found to be suitable.  The presence of a full time veterinary inspector in a county had an obvious positive effect on standards of meat production.  For example, that 1982 survey shows that out of 84 slaughter houses in Mayo none was found to be suitable but there was no full time veterinary inspector in that county.  In Kerry where there was a full time veterinary inspector 30 of the 49 slaughter houses surveyed were found to be suitable. Those figures speak for themselves. We should ensure that we do not have a repetition of that.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill ante and post mortem inspections will take place in our slaughter houses.  That is crucial if we are to ensure high standards.  An animal must be rested and well treated before slaughtering, but, unfortunately, that is not always the case here.  French and German housewives demand an ante mortem inspection and we should do likewise.  I have no doubt that Irish consumers will be reassured when they read in this legislation that meat being sold on the home market will be prepared under hygenic conditions, will be fresh and fit for human consumption.  The 1982 survey I referred to reflected primitive and substandard conditions.  I have no doubt that conditions and standards since then have improved and I am convinced that the legislation before us will lead to the highest possible standards and that will be in the interests of the meat industry and consumers alike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill which sets out to improve the practice and operation of <Col N="1851" /> food or meat processing in general is to be welcomed.  My comments on the Bill will be constructive and they will be based on a lifetime working in the meat business. I agree with virtually everything Deputy Kitt has said but I should like to remind him that the view is not always held that one should overcook meat to kill off bugs.  I should like to remind the Deputy of the practice of the gentry of hanging up a pheasant by the neck and leaving it until the body fell off before eating it.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill and the Explanatory Memorandum.  It is difficult to find fault with the thrust of the Bill but there are a few areas where there could be a rethink. I propose to outline those areas as I see them.  The Progressive Democrats subscribe to a wholesome food industry, a climate for wholesome food based on natural production methods because to do otherwise would be an error for our food industry.  I do not want to go back over ground covered by Deputy Kitt but it is true that in 1982 of the 850 premises surveyed by the veterinary inspectors only 19 per cent were found to be suitable, about 66 per cent were found to be capable of improvement and 16 per cent were found to be totally unsuitable.  At the same time there were a number of local authorities which had not implemented the by-laws in relation to the inspection of such premises.  That is a frightening admission in this day and age when there is such an emphasis on quality products.  I am sure the thrust and the spirit of this Bill will address such anomalies and put matters to right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been justifiable public doubt about the quality of many premises, some of which not alone were not inspected by local authorities but were unknown to the local authorities.  The Minister proposes to license these premises using the county councils to administer the operation of veterinary control.  There must have been an opportunity here to bring together the export plants and the local abattoirs under the one licensing authority and to have no duplication whatsoever.  In most local authority areas there are abattoirs <Col N="1852" /> or boning halls which are being operated at a very high level of hygiene under the direct control, by way of inspection, of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Minister now proposes to put the abattoirs killing for home consumption on a different footing.  He is to give this control to local authorities.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are seeking to take bureaucracy out of the system, I would have thought this an opportunity to put the entire meat operation under the one standard, which the Minister is proposing, and under one authority, which I would like to see.  I make this suggestion with the best of intentions.  The Minister may view what I am saying differently but if we are talking about wholesomeness and producing goods of a highest quality we cannot have a separation of standards or a separation of the implementation of those standards. If meat plants killing for export operate in the local authority and under the direct veterinary control of the Department of Agriculture, and if local abattoirs operate under the direction of local authorities, there will be a certain amount of duplication and a certain divergence of standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to bring knackeries under his control by means of licence and regular inspections.  Many speakers this evening expressed reservations about the operations of knackeries and the cowboy slaughtering plants which may pass as knackeries.  There is a disturbing feeling among certain sections of the trade.  The master butchers and many of those in the meat trade say that their legitimate interests are in no way served by the loose licence under which many of these knackeries seem to operate. It is not enough to say they will be inspected regularly, that they will have to apply for a licence every year and that they will have to have premises which meet certain structural and hygienic conditions. Much more control is required over their day-to-day operations.  They should be made say where they are getting their raw materials for the goods they process &mdash; be they for greyhounds, bone meat plants and so on.  I should like to <Col N="1853" /> see them having a stamp of their own with their licence number.  I would like a different licence number given to each knackery which would be an integral part of their stamp and the documentation which would cover the movement of the output of such plants.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is sufficient to say there would be regular inspections of such plants because we all know that on the day the inspector is coming everything will be in order.  There must be more absolute control over these places if for nothing else than to assuage the fears of consumer organisations that there is nothing irregular about the wholesomeness of the products which they are offering, especially on the fresh meat counters on most of our supermarkets.</P>
    <P>To finance the additional local authority staff needed to implement the new veterinary controls the Minister is proposing, the Bill proposes the introduction of veterinary inspectors and fees.  Deputy Stagg alluded to this.  While we believe there must be a self-financing aspect to this suggestion and self-regulation within the industry, nevertheless there is a layer of cost being introduced which ultimately will be met by the consumers.  Part of these fees &mdash; £3.25 per bovine, 75p per pig and 55p per sheep &mdash; will pay for back-up services.  I want to ask the Minister the following questions: do we not already have these back-up services in place in the disease eradication laboratories of the bovine tuberculosis section of the Department?  Must we not also have a back-up service already in place for the EC plants which are licensed and spread widely throughout the country?  Are we looking for a duplication of back-up services for abattoirs in terms of the inspection authority and the same in terms of having a repetition of the EC plants?</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to Part II (2) of the Bill which sets out the conditions which an applicant must satisfy before an abattoir licence shall be granted or renewed.  It also provides that the Minister shall consult with the relevant local authorities before granting or renewing the licence.  It provides that the licence <Col N="1854" /> may limit the class and number of animals which may be slaughtered in the abattoir to which it relates.  A five year transition period is allowed for in transferring from an unsuitable premises to one which is fully up to EC standards.  In making the local authority the controlling body for abattoirs, will improvements be made? Obviously planning by-laws will have to be complied with and will also be the subject of the same authority controlling the veterinary inspection of such premises. While I have no objection to the thrust of the suggestion, control of effluent and the discharges which are now allowed into municipal and town sewerage schemes must also be considered.</P>
    <P>In future abattoirs of a small and family type nature will find it very hard to comply with the present regulations in relation to a new application for a new operation.  One cannot overstress that and if the law in relation to planning which would have to be involved in updating such an abattoir is to be followed to the letter, the necessary improvements in terms of effluent disposal as well as the structural position in relation to such abattoirs will be virtually impossible financially for a number of independent butchers to comply with. We are asking these people over a period of time to comply with regulations to which I fully subscribe and, as I said at the outset, my remarks are meant to be helpful to the Minister.  We are asking people in the home trade to comply with high standards of hygiene, effluent disposal and all the other things involved in the EC Directive controlling the operation of such plants.</P>
    <P>We are quite prepared to aid exporters very generously, by way of IDA and FEOGA grants, to achieve these standards but there is no reference in the Bill of grant aiding people to encourage them to update their premises, so that they operate at the same levels and standards to the satisfaction generally of the public and at the same time to have the same kind of help to which they are entitled if they are to produce a product of the quality demanded by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that an abattoir <Col N="1855" /> licence shall not be transferred.  When the licence holder dies the licence shall continue in full force and effect for the benefit of the licence holder's personal representative or, as the case may be, his spouse or any other member of his family, for the period of two months.  This means that the licence is not vested in the premises where a person may have spent an awful lot of money on improvements.  It is vested in the ownership and it is like saying that the licence which attaches to a public house should only last for two months after the owner dies.  Surely the licence should relate to the standard of the premises and to its operation rather than to the ownership?  There is a slightly sinister overtone in this suggestion in that it may seek, by various methods, to limit over a period of time the number of small abattoirs in the ownership of private butchers. This would be a retrograde step and is against privatisation of businesses. It is also contrary to the Constitution whereby the ownership of property is sacred.  It is hard to understand why the licence is to be vested in the owner of the abattoir and shall cease to be vested in him or his agents two months after he dies rather than in the premises which qualifies by way of its standards and operation. Perhaps there is an explanation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 also states that where a licence has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation or where there is any contravention of the Act or any regulation made thereunder and if the licence holder has not, within a reasonable time, complied with the requirements of the notice served under section 18 to cease operations on the grounds of public health, he may appeal to the Circuit Court within 21 days of the refusal or revocation of the abattoir licence.  Subject to there being no danger to public health the premises may continue to be used as an abattoir until the appeal is mentioned in the Circuit Court.  This must be considered against the background where a person has had five years to improve their premises to bring them up to the standards now required to provide a wholesome product and also in <Col N="1856" /> the interests of public health.  After five years, if a person has made no effort to comply with the regulations as stated in the Bill, they can then go to the Circuit Court and, depending on delays, they can continue to operate.  After five years, they should be closed and should then have to appeal to the Circuit Court for a licence to reopen.  If this is not incorporated in the Bill, it will not be taken seriously in terms of the five years transition period.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for a transitional period of five years during which the Minister may issue permits, in lieu of licences, for abattoirs which were in existence at the time of commencement of the Act and which are capable of being brought up to licensing standard.  When he is replying would the Minister explain the position of the person with an abattoir deemed to be unsuitable who is prepared to proceed with the building of a new abattoir?  If a person is prepared to continue in a building which is not up to the standard he will get every latitude to make improvements over five years and then he can appeal to the Circuit Court which may be adjourned and he may eventually win his case.  A responsible person may be prepared to build a new abattoir but in undertaking that he will have no latitude, he will be open to the full rigours of the planning law.  This does not encourage people to go down the right road.  We should encourage those who now have abattoirs which are unsuitable to improve them by way of an aid package.</P>
    <P>Section 19 empowers local authorities to provide public abattoirs.  Is it the intention of this Bill to do away with privately owned abattoirs?  Section 13 suggests that licences should expire with the death of the owner.  This will force private abattoir operators out of business and people will have to use the abattoirs operated by the local authority.  That was the situation years ago in my part of the country. People moved away from that situation because they could not afford the costs of operating such an abattoir.  Family businesses found the overheads too <Col N="1857" /> expensive.  If we are serious about trying to keep these people in business we should help them to control their own businesses.</P>
    <P>Section 22 makes it an offence for a person to sell, offer or expose for sale for human consumption any part of an animal or meat which has been slaughtered in or which has originated in a knackery.  We should have records of the comings and goings of such products.  We should have a certificate of wholesomeness for meat coming from these plants.  We should have records to show that meat came from licensed premises where there was veterinary inspection and to show that the product did not include any parts of animals which are being condemned.  We should have records showing which plants are supplying pet food factories.  It is important that the entire chain of events should be controlled so as to close off the loopholes that have been there for the sale of diseased and reactor animals and for obstructing the TB eradication schemes. There are loopholes in the operations of knackeries.</P>
    <P>The veterinary control and hygiene section provides for the first fulltime appointment of a veterinary inspector to be made within six months.  It is assumed that fees and levies will only commence when inspections are done and that fees will not commence with the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 36 requires each local authority to allocate a veterinary inspector to each abattoir.  Currently there are as many as 60 abattoirs in some local authorities.  Is it proposed to have an inspector for each abattoir?  Some of these abattoirs have very low slaughterings and I cannot see how they can be self-financing in terms of providing a veterinary inspector for each abattoir.  A local authority will also be required to make arrangements for the inspection of knackeries.  That is a very loose arrangement.  I am worried that the section dealing with knackeries is not decisive enough in terms of movement.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 and 40 provide for the making of regulations by the Minister <Col N="1858" /> in relation to the ante and post-mortem examination of animals and meat, respectively, by a veterinary inspector, the marking and disposal of meat found to be unfit for human consumption, the health mark to be applied to meat found fit for human consumption, and the labelling requirements for meat being consigned in packages from abattoirs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health mark and the labelling requirements for consignments of meat, veterinary certificates of the inspecting vet should be available and boxes should be sealed with a veterinary seal such as that which is now in operation in the EC export plants.  The box cannot be opened without breaking the seal and the contents are registered as coming from a licensed plant with the veterinary inspector's authority.  Other speakers referred to dubious origins of meat for sausages, burgers and other such products. People who buy those products should be only able to buy them on the basis of veterinary certificates and certificates of origin.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fees and in relation to amendments of sections 51 and 52 of the Bovine Diseases Levies Act, 1979, it now appears that the bovine TB eradication levy will now apply to all cattle slaughtered for human consumption in the Republic, that is, about 250,000 animals per year which would give an additional £1.625 million by way of additional funding from the farming community to the bovine disease eradication scheme.  I do not see any allowance for this in the 1988 Estimates.  It appears to me to be a type of secret funding.  I should like to see the budget figure &mdash; which is lower by way of Exchequer contribution this year &mdash; being suitably amended. There is also accruing to CBF £250,000 based on a calculation of £1 per head.  If one adds the levies, the registration of the premises, the registration licence, the inspection fee, the licence fee, the CBF contribution and the disease eradication inspection levy one will readily see that one is adding approximately £12 per animal to the purchase cost of all animals to be processed under the new regulations. I believe that is a cost which <Col N="1859" /> will have to be borne by the consumer. However, it would not constitute such a high cost if the proposals are properly implemented.  I believe there is room for rationalisation of inspection.  I cannot understand why all cannot be included under the one heading.</P>
    <P>In section 61 there is provision for the making of regulations by the Minister covering siting, lay-out, accommodation and construction, water supply and sanitary facilities and equipment and applicances for premises which are, or are to be, used as abattoirs or knackeries.  Local authorities will have to comply with the provisions of this section, they being the veterinary control authorities of such abattoirs in the future.  Even though it will be the Department who will be the licensing authority initially the intention would be to transfer that power to local authorities in the future.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate what I said in terms of the cost involved for some abattoirs to meet the standards required and which, in respect of those involved in the export trade, have been funded by way of EC and FEOGA grants.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether there is provision within the terms of FEOGA grants for the upgrading of local abattoirs.</P>
    <P>It is disconcerting to note that at present there is no control of the certification of meat as being free of hormones and antibiotics.  That is alarming. I would hope there would be no halfway house in terms of consumer demands that meat be free of hormones and antibiotics. There is no such provision in the Bill. This factor is uppermost in the minds of most housewives when buying meat today.  If the provisions of the Bill propose to arrest the fall in red meat consumption those are among the problems that must be seen to be tackled.  I would ask the Minister to consider those matters, perhaps introducing a number of amendments to incorporate the points I have made.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions of the Bill are in the best interests of wholesome food for consumption here but there are a number of matters that could be rectified. <Col N="1860" /> I have pointed them out to the Minister in an objective fashion.  I hope he can see his way to introducing amendments along those lines.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome this Bill.  It is particularly welcome by those of us who have been pressing for years to have this type of licensing and supervision introduced.  It is necessary and long overdue.  The provisions of the Bill are particularly essential to ensure that the highest possible quality obtains in relation to pork and other meats.  It is essential also that there be proper supervision of standards prevailing at abattoirs and knackeries.  The fact that some pork plants did not have to pay veterinary fees left others in a less competitive position.  The delay in introducing this Bill has caused serious trading problems for some pig slaughtering plants who had to compete on the home market with others who did not have to pay the appropriate fee.  It is essential that we increase our pig production for export, something the Minister and Minister of State have made a commendable effort to ensure in recent months.  Over the years there were not proper facilities at our slaughtering plants to enable our producers complete on the United States market.  That fact has now been generally recognised.  Not alone is this Bill being introduced but our producers are recommending that substantial grant aid be made available to them by way of the <Col N="1862" /> IDA and FEOGA assistance to ensure that they can compete on those markets.</P>
      <P>In Monaghan two such plants are closed at present.  In this respect I might quote from a circular issued by Samuel Graham Limited of Coolshannagh, Monaghan, front runners in the exportation of pigmeat.  At one stage they exported about 90 per cent of their kill.  That circular which was sent to public representatives states:</P>
      <P>A company operating within our catchment area slaughtering 3,500 pigs per week and not paying a veterinary fee the net result of this is that this company is approximately... £300,000 per year better off.</P>
      <P>That factory was closed down and 100 of the best butchers in the Twenty-six Counties are on the dole.  In that circular it is claimed there is poor organisation as far as the pigmeat market in that area is concerned.  Two companies, Samuel Graham Limited and Irish Pigmeat Exports Limited, an associated company, were situated in Monaghan town and they slaughtered roughly 4,000 pigs per week. Prior to the merging of Hanleys, Castlebar and Claremorris, the Castlebar Bacon Company had a slaughtering plant in Monaghan where well in excess of 100,000 pigs per year or over 2,000 pigs per week were slaughtered.  When those companies merged the Castlebar Bacon Company in Monaghan town was closed down as was Samuel Graham Limited. Many people have made strenuous efforts to try to get those companies operating again but we are finding it very difficult.</P>
      <P>A few years ago County Monaghan was the third highest producer of pigs. When new slaughtering plants are being set up they should be set up in areas where there is the highest pig production. It is important that the pigs are reared close to the slaughtering plants.  The pig industry in Monaghan is in a bad state at present and that has stemmed partly from an unfair system where some people paid veterinary fees and some did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that currently 30 per cent of pigs slaughtered <Col N="1863" /> are exported and the bulk of the kill, therefore, is chasing a domestic market in which significant inroads have been made by local pork butchers in the past five years.  He said that pig slaughterings by pork butchers have increased by 70 per cent during this period.  That gives an indication of the real problems of licensed premises in competing for pigs.  They had to pay slaughtering fees and they had to abide by the rigid hygiene regulations, unlike other operators.  The Minister went on to say that the licensed bacon plants are thus being placed at a competitive disadvantaged, <i>vis-á-vis</i> their unlicensed competitors owing to the cost of observing stringent hygiene standards and the payment of veterinary inspection fees.  That type of competition existed in an area which provided many much needed jobs.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard that £160 million was provided to develop the pig industry. Broilers and turkeys are produced in my area and value added products are processed from poultry and turkey meat. Pork has not been developed in the same way.  Many people say it is an ideal base for foods which could compete with imported foods.</P>
    <P>One of my criticisms of the IDA, and I raised this matter in my discussions with them regarding the closure of plants, is that they are based in Dublin.  Poultry is a specialised line of production and matters concerning it are dealt with from Dublin rather than from a regional office. A regional manager would be in a better position to negotiate with potential takers of factories and would know the people in a particular area.  As I have said, slaughtering plants should be situated where there is most pig production.  I am concerned about large operators having too much of a grip on the market.  We have proved we should not let the multiple stores and the slaughtering plants get too big.</P>
    <P>We should not allow large multiples to operate at the expense of the tried and trusted plants that are facing difficulties which they could overcome if they got <Col N="1864" /> the assistance they deserve from the Government agencies and the Department. As a public representative I have fought this battle for years and I will continue to do so.  I have spent many years as a member of a small co-op.  I have fears about large co-ops which have been developed over the years and about many other large structures which need much financing.  At the end of the day areas such as mine will be the real sufferes by way of job losses.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will also have a part to play in this market and it is important that they receive the necessary finance. Unless other local authorities receive more funding than the one of which I am a member, they will not be in a position to do much by way of providing veterinary supervisors and so on.</P>
    <P>This is very necessary legislation.  It is only part of the package which is required to put the pigmeat industry in a position where they can compete on the world market.  We must remember we are weak in production in many areas.  In this country our stance lies in our production, in our piggeries and our sow units.  They are developed as well as, and in some cases better than, those in any other country in Europe but we have failed as far as hygiene slaughtering plants is concerned. The factory that I mentioned moved into the Japanese market very effectively.  It is deplorable that now they may not even open again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill and support its general provisions.  It is long overdue and it is regrettable that previous Governments did not move on the matter earlier.  The fact is that while the vast majority of those involved in the meat business are decent and honest people, many butchers and meat traders have involved themselves in appalling practices which amounted to not just a defrauding of the general public but also constituted a threat to public health.  As an agricultural country and major food <Col N="1865" /> exporter we have a vested interest in ensuring that all our food products, whether produced for export or for the home market, are of the highest possible standards and produced in accordance with the highest possible safety and hygiene standards.  Unfortunately, this has not been the case.  This Bill will go a long way to ensuring at least a major improvement in standards.</P>
      <P>The poor standards in our meat industry have been highlighted time and time again in newspaper articles, on television programmes and in public statements by those in a position to know.  For instance, in testimony to the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure in 1986, Professor Collins of the UCD veterinary school pointed out that thousands of tons of beef rejected for export because of disease were being offered for sale to domestic consumers.  He pointed out that only a small proportion of the 300,000 animals killed for the home market were given any inspection for disease.  Mr. Peter Dargan of the Irish Veterinary Union said in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 4 December 1984 that some of the slaughter-houses would turn one's stomach; it would put one off meat to see the conditions cattle were killed in and he would be loath to eat meat from many of the abattoirs he visited.  In the same article, Mr. Dargan said that meat of pet food standard was getting in the food chain in hospitals and other institutions and that buyers were unaware of what was going on.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the standards in some of the abattoirs have been little better than those one would expect to find in a third world country.  I suppose it is fair to say that some of the blame should rest with the consumers who have been prepared to accept standards that are second best and are reluctant to complain.  If more people complained we would have better standards everywhere although, in fairness to the consumer, it must be said that most are unaware of how low the standards are and would be shocked if they found out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the spin-off effects of the recession has been that more and more <Col N="1866" /> people, particularly the unemployed and others on social welfare, have had to buy meat at the lower end of the market when indeed they can afford to buy it at all.  In these circumstances, it is vitally important that such consumers should be given the greatest protection possible both in terms of ensuring that they get good value for money and that what they buy is safe and hygienically prepared.</P>
    <P>Another matter which requires attention, although it is not covered by this Bill, is the whole question of the use of parts of animals that most people would consider unacceptable as constituent meat products in pies <i>et cetera.</i> I understand that brains, feet, intestines and other parts of animals can be used as constituents in meat products and that with modern technology they can be dressed up to look like normal meat.  This is at best a deception of the public and regulations should be introduced to ensure that it is stated clearly on the labels the products that are used.</P>
    <P>Another area of major public concern which I hope the Bill will deal with is the whole question of the use by farmers of hormones and growth promoters.  While steps have been taken to control these practices, it is common knowledge that these products can be illegally obtained, and that unscrupulous farmers are prepared to use them to try to make a quick buck irrespective of the effects they might have on the health of the people who buy meat.  I hope that the veterinary surgeons involved in the inspection procedures under this Bill will be instructed to make a particular check for the illegal use of hormones and growth promoters and that every effort will be made to trace and prosecute those involved in the practice.</P>
    <P>We have almost 850 local abattoirs serving a population of 3 million.  In Britain they have found 1,200 abattoirs serving a population of around 57 million. The fact that only five or six local authorities have employed veterinary officers to inspect abattoirs speaks for itself.  It is likely that the implementation of the Bill will lead to a major reduction in the number of smaller abattoirs and this is no bad thing.  In the long term, larger <Col N="1867" /> modern abattoirs are in everybody's interest.  These would be premises capable of coming up to export standard and should be able to receive export licences and qualify for FEOGA grants.  Many of the smaller abattoirs are attached to butcher shops very often in cities on the main street and lead to major environmental pollution and health problems.  It is not really acceptable, in this day and age, that abattoirs should be located at the back of shops.  Many of them do not have suitable facilties for disposing of waste or blood.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points arising from specific details in the Bill on which I would like to comment.  Section 2 of the Bill seems to allow for the on-farm slaughtering of certain animals.  I wonder would it not be better to totally discourage this activity.  Permitting on-farm slaughter of animals provides the potential for abuse.  In addition, the captive bolt pistol used in abattoirs for stunning animals prior to slaughter costs around £400.  Not many farmers will have one of these; yet any other way of killing an animal will inflict severe pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>I note that the definition of animal excludes both deer and rabbits.  Deer farming is still in its infancy here but all the indications are that it is growing. Some deer are shot on farms but others are slaughtered in abattoirs.  It seems to make sense that the premises in which they are slaughtered should come within the definition of abattoir as this would ensure proper hygiene standards, proper veterinary inspection <i>et cetera.</i> I believe that the first rabbit abattoir was recently opened in County Monaghan and I wonder again why deer and rabbits have been excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  I thought that Deputy Leonard might refer to that and I was anxious to hear his speech before commenting.</P>
    <P>Section 17 enables the Minister to issue a permit to an unsatisfactory premises to allow it to continue in operation.  That permit can be used initially for five years and can then be extended.  This seems an <Col N="1868" /> exceptionally long period.  A shorter term of perhaps two years might be better.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of section 2 dealing with the restriction on the sales and supply of meat without a health mark contains an &ldquo;out&rdquo; which effectively could allow abattoirs off the hook with the oldest excuse in the book.  Ignorance is normally no defence in law and there does not seem any reason that it should be included here.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset to the fact that beef that had been proved unsuitable for export was being sold on the domestic market.  This beef came mainly from TB reactors which when slaughtered were found to have new lesions.  If the beef is deemed fit for human consumption, at least it should be clearly identified as being the meat of TB reactors and should be sold at a discount to consumers.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will end the abuse of fraud in relation to forged meat stamps.  In the past few years a number of such cases have come to light as unscrupulous dealers have taken full advantage of county boundaries and the multitude of local authorities involved. This Bill should make it more difficult to get away with these abuses.  The argument has been advanced that the work to be done by vets under this Bill should be undertaken by environmental health inspectors.  I do not know if this would be the right approach.  Environmental health inspectors certainly have knowledge and training with regard to domestic animals, the drugs currently in use for domestic animals, animal welfare, diseases of animals and so forth.  I do not want to become involved in a dispute between two professional groups.  It is probably a matter that should be brought under review as the Bill is implemented. In any case, it is important that there should be a continuing professional development course for vets engaged in the area of meat hygiene.</P>
    <P>To summarise, we are generally happy with the provisions of the Bill.  It may not totally remove the abuses that exist in the meat trade but it should make it much more difficult for those involved to get away with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to compliment the Minister on so swiftly bringing this Bill before the House.  It has been sought for a very long time.  I compliment all concerned with its production, it does not matter when or in what form.  We have it now before the House and it will make a great deal of difference in the running of local abattoirs.  The very fact that we have so few full time veterinary inspectors employed in inspecting local abattoirs &mdash; I think there is a total of nine &mdash; is an indictment of the present system of examinations.  This Bill will ensure that there are no longer dual standards so far as the processing of meat for home and export is concerned.  That would be welcomed by everybody.</P>
      <P>There has been much concern in recent times, particularly arising out of a number of reports on television and in newspapers, highlighting the operation of local abattoirs.  If people had an opportunity to visit some of these unauthorised premises they would take a very dim view of the various practices undertaken and might also vary their own approach to the consumption of meat and meat products. It is for that reason that this Bill attempts to address itself to regularising the situation and ensuring that there is opportunity to enforce proper licensing procedures.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that the local authorities and the sanitary authorities will have a major role to play in policing this legislation.  In some local authorities this work is being carried on to a very high standard and I am speaking with some knowledge of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation who have been involved very closely with monitoring abattoirs within their areas.  However, there has been concern particularly when meat which has not the required stamp becomes available in certain areas.  The way in which inspection is done in many areas, haphazard and often only by part-time veterinary staff, will be regularised and subsequently updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through licensing and charging of fees, local authorities will have some recompense for the work and the cost which <Col N="1870" /> will be involved in operating the legislation. The financial implications are very important.  The Minister has addressed them in very good detail in so far as the fee to be charged by the Minister for Agriculture and Food for the conducting of annual licences inspection will be in the order of £10 to £100 per abattoir, depending on the level of slaughtering and £10 in the case of the knackeries. These fees are expected to amount to £40,000 annually for the Department and will cover their costs.  It is only right that this should be the case and that the Department should not be put in a position where they are expected to fund, in part or in whole, the issue of the licences.</P>
    <P>In support of local authorities, they, too, will be in a position to make charges per head as was outlined, in so far as cattle are concerned, £3.25; pigs, £0.75; and sheep, 55p.  These fees will be payable by the abattoir licensee to the local authority and a yield is expected of £1.4 million annually.  This is, of course, a costly business in terms of the employment of veterinary staff, both full-time and part-time, and also supporting staff in order that local authorities discharge properly and fully their functions under the legislation.  Local authorities in these times should not be expected to incur additional costs in support of an industry that can, if properly run, be highly profitable.  They should not be expected to fund in part or in whole the discharge of their responsibilities and functions under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The aspect of offences is dealt with and is extremely important.  It is right that the fines and penalties imposed for failing to operate abattoirs under the new system should be substantial.  The Minister has made very satisfactory arrangements in this regard.  I have had occasion to mention this in relation to other legislation.</P>
    <P>One area on which I should like to touch very briefly relates to the charging and collection of fees.  In section 44 fees are set out; in section 45 reference is made to the fact that the fees will have to be remitted by the licence holder to the local authority within 28 days after <Col N="1871" /> each calendar month slaughtering and according to section 46 the fees are due to the local authority as a simple contract debt.  I can see a real problem for local authorities here.  If the situation arises that the licensee fails to discharge his indebtedness to the local authority, that puts the local authority in a very difficult position where they have to incur additional expenses, sometimes very substantial legal costs, in trying to collect outstanding moneys.  I would have hoped that the Minister could have made this aspect of the proposed legislation tighter. Perhaps he has and I have not understood it clearly.  I hope he will be able to find a way in which he can ensure that the local authority would not have to spend additional finance in trying to collect outstanding debts while at the same time allowing the licensee to continue in operation even if the licensee has not discharged his financial indebtedness to the local authorities properly and completely under the terms of the legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we always come across when dealing with licensing arrangements is where a licence holder is allowed to continue to trade having failed to remit the fees due to the statutory authority, which in this case is the local authority.  This is a problem which I hope the Minister will be able to address and perhaps at some stage he may be able to tighten up this area.  I would not like to see costs accruing to the local authority and especially in present circumstances these are costs they could do without.</P>
    <P>In the major metropolitan areas there is a full-time veterinary staff employed to inspect local abattoirs and this has led to confidence in people that casualty meat would not be sold for human consumption. In the major built up areas concerns were expressed on this issue and the ability of the local authorities, certainly the one I am familar with, to deal with this issue fairly quickly was welcomed by local communities who are familiar with the complaints as they have arisen and are reported.  It is important that the public be reassured that abattoirs will be run properly, that the meat will <Col N="1872" /> be properly processed and packed and that the supervision which the consumer is entitled to expect is adequate.  The expanded role of the local authorities under this legislation is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>People are becoming much more discriminating in their consumption of food and the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, has been very conscious of this fact and has continuously alluded to it since becoming Minister of State.  He regards as very important in the production and processing of food that the highest possible standards of hygiene and marketing are attained.  Initially, that will be of benefit to the consumer but it will also be of great benefit in the market place in terms of its operation both here and abroad. That is very important particularly at a time when the importation of prepared foods and meat products are causing difficulties for the industry in this country. This aspect has already been referred to by my colleague, Deputy Leonard.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the penalties which may be imposed under this legislation. They are very substantial and any operator who decides to flout the legislation which is now before us will do so at his peril.  The penalties include a maximum fine of £10,000 or imprisonment for up to three years and those who decide to infringe the legislation and not conduct the running of their abattoir in a proper manner will be expected to pay the penalty.  That is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>Section 60 provides for returns by local authorities to the Minister in relation to slaughterings, meat condemnations, casualty and diseased animals and the general operation of the provisions of the Act.  I am delighted to see this section included because it will allow for a certain amount of national monitoring particularly in regard to meat condemnations, casualty and diseased animals.  There is not a national register which would allow us to see what is going on and the difficulties which have been experienced in individual areas is not available.  As I have said, this problem has been referred to in recent times in investigative reports, in the news media and in television programmes <Col N="1873" /> in which were spelled out the dangers to the consumer if an abattoir has not been properly supervised.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister and his staff for the excellent work which has been done and for bringing the Bill before the House.  As the Minister has indicated, the lack of proper and uniform standards will now be a thing of the past and in the future the consumer can expect to purchase a product which has been properly processed in all its stages and we can be satisfied that the complaints which have arisen in the past need not arise in the future.  The location of abattoirs was also referred to by Deputy Leonard.  He made the point that the Minister in licensing abattoirs should be conscious of the proposed location.  Their location does have a bearing on the poultry and pigmeat industries and that should be taken into account in the issuing of licences.</P>
    <P>It might amaze some of my rural colleagues when I say that in urban areas we do have abattoirs some of which unfortunately have in recent years been the subject of a large number of complaints. These premises have been in existence for a long number of years and probably were established when the areas began to get built up.  In some cases they have been able to flout the legislation, weak and all that it was, that was in place.  This is more dangerous in an urban area than people realise.  In rural areas there is sometimes a tradition and a pattern.  I would be very wary of the product coming out of one particular abattoir.  This abattoir received some media attention and as far as I am aware it is still in operation in spite of the fact that it came in for some very severe criticism regarding the manner in which it operated for a while. Following presure from the local authority it closed down but then started up again and found itself in a position of being able to continue operating for quite some time.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a vicious circle in that the operators seem to know the problems they are going to face.  They are able to cope with them and are able <Col N="1874" /> to deal with the various supervisory visits and investigations which take place.  They then start the procedure all over again even though it will be quite clear to them that the manner in which they are operating is completely outside basic standards of law.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes that the range of services provided by the National Social Service Board is managed by a total staff of 20, operating with a budget of £475,000.  Dáil Éireann considers that continued operation of the NSSB would be the most cost effective and efficient way of providing the essential community services involved.  Dáil Éireann also believes, that it would be counter productive to disperse the experience accumulated within the NSSB, and that it would be disastrous to attempt to distribute the services provided among different sections of the Department of Health, Health agencies and other Departments.  Accordingly, Dáil Éireann instructs the Government to rescind its decision to abolish the NSSB; and further, to provide sufficient resources to enable the NSSB to continue to function as efficiently as heretofore.</P>

      <P>In moving this resolution in the name of the Labour Party and other Deputies and other political parties I should note that it is an unusual one. <Col N="1875" /> Although we are using Labour Party Private Members' time the resolution has attracted cross-party support of other parties and Deputies in Opposition.  I thank the PDs, The Workers' Party and Deputies Gregory and Kemmy for appending their names to the motion. This cross-party support is a recognition throughout the Dáil that the decision to abolish the National Social Service Board is a mean, narrowminded attempt to stifle independent information and comment on social service issues.  There can be no other explanation for the extraordinary decision of the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>By any objective analysis the NSSB do a cost effective and efficient job and provide vital information, backup and training to voluntary workers throughout the State.  The provision last week of £1 million for community information and development from the proceeds of the national lottery undermines completely any financial argument that the Minister might put forward in justification for this action.  Why then was the decision made to abolish this independent agency and replace them with a structure within the Civil Service at twice the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this debate in context and to outline for the House what exactly is at issue.  In October 1971 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Erskine Childers, established the National Social Service Council.  This council was a focal point for voluntary social service activity. Its services included providing comprehensive and up to date information about a range of voluntary work in the social field.  It supported the development of new voluntary social service organisations and provided encouragement, assistance and advice to voluntary agencies already in existence.  In February 1974 the national conference on the right to know information for citizens sponsored by the NSSC led to the setting up of a nationwide network of voluntary community information centres.  The NSSC were given responsibility for promoting, supporting and registering community <Col N="1876" /> information centres.  The philosophy behind the community information centres was to enable citizens to have access to accurate and clear information about their entitlements so that they could make their own decisions and be in charge of their own lives.</P>
    <P>In June 1981 the NSSC were replaced by the NSSB who were to have responsibility for (1) support and development of community information centres; (2) operation of a national resource centre to help health boards and voluntary organisations in the development of voluntary social services; (3) supporting the work of the National Council for the Aged, a body set up to advise the Minister on all aspects of welfare of the aged.  In July 1984 the NSSB was properly established. The functions of the then board were to advise the Minister and keep him informed of developments in the social services area and whenever he requested to advise him and keep him informed of such aspects or branches thereof of particular social services as he might specify. It was to promote greater activity, co-ordination and public awareness of social services, to promote, develop, encourage and assist, by provision of financial or material aid, personnel services or otherwise, the development of services and schemes in the community and to disseminate information and advice in relation to social services.  A range of other functions was written into the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>To date the NSSB has performed the functions assigned to it with enthusiasm to extraordinary effect.  The community information services established since then now come to some 80 and cover the country, a blanket of information centres from Ardee and Arklow right down to Wexford and Waterford.  Each of these centres provides trained and skilled personnel who give information on an open basis to any caller, any member of the general public or any citizen.  In 1979 the centres dealt with 39,000 queries.  By 1986 that number had risen to 110,000. The NSSB provides the training for volunteers who man these centres.  It is responsible for the maintenance of basic <Col N="1877" /> standards.  It provides updating at regular intervals and provides grants towards the running costs of these information centres.</P>
    <P>Other activities include the training schemes operated by the board.  It began a training programme for volunteers and 850 people from the voluntary and statutory sectors attended courses organised by the NSSB in 1986.  The courses included effective instructional skills, effective and confident use of radio and many other matters for voluntary organisations. The service provided an audiovisual library.  One problem experienced by voluntary organisations is the cost of insurance cover.  In 1982 a group scheme was organised by the NSSB for voluntary agencies and now almost 200 organisations participate in that scheme.  The NSSB provides a range of publications and information packs to the centres and a monthly journal <i>Relate,</i> an information bulletin with a circulation of over 7,000. The board has a voice independent of any Government Department on matters of social services.  It covers by Statute the National Council for the Aged.  Three staff of the National Council for the Aged are employed under contract in the NSSB.  All this is done with a staff of 20 people and a budget of approximately £500,000.</P>
    <P>The question again arises as to why the Minister and the Government now want to stifle this independent voice.  I have been searching for an answer to that question and can find none.  I know that the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, has in the past taken issue with the NSSB and with their journal, <i>Relate</i>.  In December 1983 <i>Relate</i> contained an article on Dáil Questions on social welfare which certainly annoyed the Minister, then in Opposition. It was a fair and balanced article but it obviously caused so much irritation that Deputy O'Hanlon put down a Dáil Question on 23 February 1984.  I quote from column 650 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Hanlon asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to an article in a publication (details supplied) to the effect that <Col N="1878" /> Members of the Oireachtas are abusing the system of parliamentary questions by virtue of the number of those being asked on social welfare problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>During the course of the reply and the supplementaries we were given an indication of Deputy O'Hanlon's attitude at that time to the role of the NSSB and its publication.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked the Minister to agree that it was totally misleading of the magazine to publish such an article. Deputy O'Hanlon went on to say that the magazine was being circulated through community offices around the country who are expected to give correct information to claimants who find themselves in difficulty with regard to their applications to the Department of Social Welfare. He asked the Minister to write to the National Social Service Board and ask them to publish a correction.  The debate went on and the irritation obviously lasted a long time.  Surely this irritation is not the basis for this unwarranted attack on the NSSB?</P>
    <P>We come now to the actual announcement of the Government's intention to abolish the board.  Following many rumours the Minister issued a Press statement on 15 October last which stated:</P>
    <P>Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, TD, Minister for Health wishes to clarify the position in relation to the future of the services now provided by the National Social Service Board, in order to correct inaccurate statements made since his announcement earlier this week.  As the Minister pointed out, these services will not be terminated.  Alternative arrangements for their provision, as appropriate, are being put in place.</P>
    <P>The community information centres throughout the country will continue to operate as heretofore, with the support of the health boards and other public authorities.  The Minister believes that these centres are of considerable value to the public, giving as they do information and advice on a <Col N="1879" /> comprehensive range of services and entitlements.</P>
    <P>There were three other paragraphs in the announcement but that was the only particular issue mentioned.  This was the only one of the many services I have listed to which the Minister alluded, guaranteeing that it would be maintained. The information centres which he said would continue to operate as heretofore are run by independent local voluntary workers and it is not for the Minister to say whether they will continue or not.  It is to be decided by those who give of their own time and effort to provide those services.  They get assistance from the NSSB in the form of grants, training, materials, information and so on.  Without this assistance they will have to make up their own minds as to whether they will continue to operate as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The staff of the NSSB responded to the statement and outlined several points.  The first is that the integrity and usefulness of the information service depends on the independence of that service as perceived by the voluntary community information centres and by the 100,000 people who use that service.  Secondly, the staff stated that there was no justification for the decision to close.  The Minister said that staff would be redeployed but that will mean that 52 per cent of the budget will continue to be paid.  If attempts are made to continue the service through the health boards and other Government Departments it will be necessary to continue to provide the funding.  So, where is the saving?  The staff also pointed out that the Government had said the backup service to the community information centres was to be rationalised by putting funding under the health boards and under the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  That is great rationalisation, taking an organisation efficiently and effectively run by one body and giving it to ten &mdash; eight health boards, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health. All these points were unanswerable and the Minister has yet to attempt to answer them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> Now we come to the reaction since the Minister made his dramatic announcement. The NSSB support group has been established and to date up to 300 separate organisations have pledged themselves to support the continued existence of the NSSB in its present form and under its present management.  The organisations supporting the NSSB make very interesting reading.  They include the Catholic Social Services Conference, AOSTA, the Council for the Status of Women, the ISPCC, Lifetime, the Rape Crisis Centre, the Irish Association of Social Workers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Practically every organisation involved in the social services sector has pledged support.</P>
    <P>What has been the reaction from the general public and the media?  It has been said that no other decision in the social service area has had as dramatic an impact as the decision to abolish the NSSB.  What has been the Minister's reaction to the press, the public and all those voluntary organisations across the country who give of their own time and provide the services which otherwise would not be in place?</P>
    <P>The Minister's response has been the statement I mentioned and another announcement last week.  It appears that the Minister will provide £1 million from the proceeds of the lottery for an alternate service but no information has been given to the House about alternate plans. I should like to quote what was published in yesterday's issue of the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>A new community information unit to replace the National Social Services Board will be announced this week by Health Minister Rory O'Hanlon (I look forward to that with interest). And more cash is being provided for the new service than the cost to run the old one.</P>
    <P>The Minister will announce the new unit &mdash; which will function within the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; in advance of a Dáil motion for the retention of the NSSB on which the Government faces possible defeat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> The plain fact is that the Minister has made a dreadful mistake.  For some unknown reason &mdash; he has not given a proper reason either by way of press statement or in response to parliamentary questions &mdash; he has not replied to the simple question, &ldquo;why are you going to abolish the NSSB&rdquo;?  It appears that like so many other issues, whether it is the Health Education Bureau or other agencies, he wants to stifle any independent voice that might possibly criticise the drastic actions of his Department and the Government.  The Minister has made a nonsense of any economic argument by providing double the amount of money to run a new unit that will be subsumed within the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister has made a dreadful mistake, for whatever reason I do not know.  However, this time the Minister can learn from recent events.  He can learn from the happenings of last night and change his mind on this matter before he is forced to do so by the combined weight of opposition that stretches not only across Opposition benches in the Dáil but across the nation and among those who have any concern for the provision of adequate social services.</P>
    <P>An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 October last, under the heading, Unkindest Cuts, stated:</P>
    <P>Many cuts in public expenditure are painful but necessary.  Some may even help in a roundabout way to improve the quality of the services affected.  A few are simply and inexplicably mean.</P>
    <P>The editorial went on to include the abolition of the NSSB among those it describes as &ldquo;simply and inexplicably mean&rdquo;.  The support for the retention of the NSSB has motivated people to write to national and local papers.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to help the Minister make up his mind on the issue by reminding him of some of the statements made by him, and his colleagues, on the NSSB in the past.  On 22 July 1982 in the Seanad debate on the National Community Development <Col N="1882" /> Agency Bill the Minister's colleague, Dr. Woods, said, as reported at column 1321 of the Seanad Official Report:</P>
    <P>How will the local voluntary bodies become involved with the agency? Here we would hope that the voluntary bodies will be built into the work of the agency through the projects they are undertaking.  Of course the agency will be empowered to grant funds to local voluntary bodies for activities which relate to their functions and priorities as they see them at the time. We have emphasised in the Bill that the areas and communities of high social deprivation must be the first priority. That is spelled out particularly in the Bill as it stands.  On this basis they will be empowered to give both capital and current expenditure type grants to voluntary bodies.  This is what these voluntary bodies are starved of.  They are doing their work and additional resources are needed to get them under way.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the Minister with other quotations of the statements by his colleagues at that time.</P>
    <P>Today the Fine Gael Party tabled an amendment to the Labour Party motion, supported as it was by all other Opposition parties.  After consultations with the Fine Gael spokesman on Health I am happy to accept their amendment.  We now have a united front of opposition. All Opposition parties, and Independents, will vote in favour of this resolution to insist that the decision to abolish the NSSB is rescinded, described by me and others as a mean and narrow decision.  I invite the Minister to accept the inevitability of that defeat and rescind his outrageous decision to abolish the NSSB before the vote is called next week. There was an unseemly debacle last night when the Government's proposals on education did not stand the test in the House.  No justification has been offered in any forum so far for the proposal in regard to the NSSB.  The Minister should withdraw it this evening and announce that he is content to permit the NSSB continue their efficient, cost-effective <Col N="1883" /> and good work on behalf of communities throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion reflects the outcome of the prevailing facile and appalling political fashion that we must abolish State bodies, be they economic, environmental or social, so that we will grow in employment, in social consciousness, in the care of our people and as a society.  That myth is fostered by the two parties who are joining with us tonight in opposition to the Government. I welcome the conversion of the Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats parties to the Labour Party position.  We have seen that development on many fronts. In agriculture we have been told that we have to abolish AFT and ACOT to get a much better system.  The prevailing mythology in regard to the environment is that An Foras Forbartha must go, and, of course, the Department of Health have a hit list drawn up by a very senior official in the Department of Finance. With a smile on his face in the middle of 1986 he got involved in the cutting exercise.  He listed the HEB and it was abolished.  There are now only seven of the 26 staff remaining.  Staff numbers are being decimated and, for practical purposes, public health education information is gone.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board were to go but we got in early on that. They are still in existence.  I do not think the Minister will try to abolish that board, not this year at any rate.  But he turned to the National Social Service Board.  Let us examine this from the point of view, strictly, of the Department of Finance &mdash; because the Minister for Finance runs Fianna Fáil now just as he ran Education last night.  He nearly ran the Minister for Education out of the House with apoplexy while the Taoiseach was elsewhere, being &lsquo;person of the year&rsquo; because he wanted her to change her tack on the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, through his officials, said the National Social Service Board has to go because they were not performing their functions.  The Department <Col N="1884" /> of Health did not say the board were not performing their functions and therefore the Minister could not prove it. That argument was dropped.  It was said that the National Social Service Board are a duplication of the social body politick, but that could not be proved and so the argument was dropped.  It is said the argument was financial and that this board should be cut out of the subhead.</P>
    <P>You should see them in Finance.  They said that if we get rid of the subheads, Ireland will grow but of course there is no shortage of money for the National Social Service Board.  In fact the Minister says twice as much money is available for this board.  The arguments do not exist. The Minister for Health, unfortunately dominated by the Minister for Finance did not tell his colleague in polite political terms to get knotted.  He accepted the cuts.  He lay down, acquiesced, and eventually got the Secretary of the Department to make a phone call to the Director of the National Social Service Board telling him the board was being abolished but, because there was no reason he could not tell them why.</P>
    <P>That philosophy, embroidered and developed by some of my Fine Gael colleagues when in Government, was whipped up into a beautiful Christmas cake and adopted holus bolus by the Progressive Democrats.  Then the disease was transmitted across the Floor like AIDS to the Fianna Fáil Party, and they are now in a terminal condition as they begin to unravel in this House the various health and other Estimates.  What does the Minister do?  He is landed with this predicament so he begins to think.  He decides to put the National Social Service Board in with the health boards, and sends letters of allocation to the health boards.  The health boards are not very enthusiastic and the letters were withdrawn last week.  This means the health boards will no longer have a subhead dealing with the community information sector.  That is all gone.  They are back to the drawing board again.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us tonight that they will give the National Social Service Board to the <Col N="1885" /> Department of Social Welfare.  Now the Department of Social Welfare will have a non-statutory, quasi advisory body, established under the aegis of that Department, dealing with about two-thirds of the functions of the National Social Service Board.  There is decentralisation for you.  There is rationalisation for you.  The other portion of the functions of the National Social Service Board may be devolved into a section of the Department of Health which has no staff, which is unnamed, which is losing its budget and does not even have the touch of a lottery ticket about it at this stage because it has not been allocated any money.</P>
    <P>What will be done with the developmental functions of the National Social Service Board?  They are thinking about giving them to the IPA.  Tom Barrington, former director of the IPA, could write a book on the exercise of the abolition of the National Social Service Board.  To make matters worse &mdash; and this is an appalling feature &mdash; on 19 July 1984 &mdash; this House set up the National Social Service Board under an Act of the Oireachtas, but the Minister said he will not repeal the Act.  He will leave it there. It will be in a vacuum without a budget. It will be like a ticket that cannot win in the lottery.  Meanwhile there are staff employed by the National Social Service Board, but the board have gone out of existence since July 1986.  They have no chairman.  They are in a kind of Fianna Fáil limbo.  The staff cannot be transferred because they have contracts with the National Social Service Board, yet the board do not exist.  The Act is not repealed.  Fianna Fáil will tell us tonight that they have rationalised this matter for the sake of £480,000 or 0.04 per cent of the Health budget.  There is health administration for you.  That is Fianna Fáil control of the health system.  It would be an Irish reaction to an Irish budgetary problem if it were not so serious.</P>
    <P>We have an appalling situation: the National Social Service Board were to be transferred first to the health boards, then to the Department of Social Welfare, and now they will be an advisory body, but <Col N="1886" /> the statutory body will be left languishing in a statutory framework.  This House is being treated with contempt by Fianna Fáil.  If they want to abolish the National Social Service Board they should at least have the legislative courtesy of coming into this House and proposing the abolition by repealing the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister was told by his senior departmental officials &mdash; and lest he think I have some entrée to departmental thinking at this point, let me assure him that I do not, but I know he was advised &mdash; not to go down this road.  He was told in no uncertain terms that the repeal of the Act would pose substantial political problems for him.  He was given solid advice but he was railroaded by the Minister for Finance.  Yet another notch was chalked up on the old hurley of the Department of Finance, another goal to be scored, another quango to be abolished and fiscal rectitude was to reign once again.  The reaction throughout the country to the abolition of the National Social Service Board has been a salutory lesson to the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to think very seriously tonight about the predicament he is in.  No Minister for Health wants to ignominiously lose a vote in this House but I am very pleased to say that next Wednesday night the Opposition parties will combine to reject the Minister's decision.  When the Minister has not repealed the Act and when he is defeated in the Dáil in Private Members' Time, surely this will give rise to reconsideration of this ludicrous decision to abolish this board.  All the Minister has to do is appoint a new board and let them continue to carry out the functions which the old board have been performing with great competence.</P>
    <P>The Director of the National Social Service Board, Mr. John Curry, a distinguished chairperson of the Commission on Social Welfare, reported to this House and the Department of Social Welfare.  This board have done marvellous work since they were established and there is no need for this precipitous outrageous decision on the part of the <Col N="1887" /> Government, because no matter what criterion one adopts, be it rationalisation, functional performance or the role of the agency, there is no justification for the abolition of the National Social Service Board other then perhaps political pique &mdash; and I would not attribute that to the Minister &mdash; or simply that he was badly caught in budget negotiations.</P>
    <P>He should now do what the Taoiseach did at his parliamentary party meeting this morning.  He had a rethink on the pupil/teacher ratio and on the question of extradition &mdash; it was a very bad rethink, I do not believe he was thinking at all &mdash; when he shoved extradition on to the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman who made a complete mess of it.  But let us not continue the mess by abolishing the National Social Service Board.  I urge the Minister to consult with the staff of the Department, to take their advice and to tell the officials in the Department of Finance that the abolition of this board will not save any money. That might save their face in terms of a very bad budgetary decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, where it first appears and substitute &ldquo;endorses the decision of the Government to provide £1 million from funds made available by the national lottery for the further development of the services provided by the community information centres and for the support and development of voluntary community effort&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should first of all ask the House to let me put the Government's decision in relation to the National Social Service Board in perspective.  In the first place it is the board of the NSSB which is going, not the services which were provided under their auspices.  Secondly, all the services which were provided by the board will be expanded and enhanced. The services provided by the community <Col N="1888" /> information centres will be maintained and added to.  Expanded training programmes will be provided for the volunteers who man them.  An enhanced fostering of community voluntary effort will be developed and specialist training will be made available through health boards by the Institute of Public Administration in, for example, regional technical colleges.  Indeed it was very unfair on Deputy Desmond to ask him to speak in advance of my speech as there were many inaccuracies in his contribution which reflected poorly on the few things he said for which he was entitled to get credit.</P>
    <P>Support for the community information centres, including training arrangements for the volunteers staffing these centres, will be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  The development and training function and the expansion of voluntary community work will come under the Department of Health and the health boards.  The National Council for the Aged will continue their work as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there are jobs on offer for those of their staff who wish to avail themselves of them or they may opt for the voluntary redundancy package if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the decision taken by the Government is entirely consistent with their policy to date in reviewing the appropriateness of all administrative boards for the development of services in which they are involved.  The limited scope of the NSSB has tended to obscure the fundamental role of the health boards in promoting their partnership with the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the Departments of Social Welfare and Health and the health boards, will in a co-ordinated way be charged with the responsibility for the development and enhancement of their information services.  Similarly they will have responsibility for the fostering of voluntary effort within the community, particularly in areas of social deprivation to fill gaps in the social services provided country wide.</P>
    <P>Sixthly the Government's decision to <Col N="1889" /> allot a sum of £1 million from the national lottery funds for community information and development services is a comprehensive answer to the criticism that their decision on the NSSB represented indifference to the role of the voluntary social service bodies.</P>
    <P>The £1 million will be apportioned as follows:</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that a concerted campaign has continued so much misleading comment regarding the effects of the Government decision on the services of the NSSB.  I am especially worried about the effect that these harmful allegations could have on the community information centres throughout the country.  While constructive criticism of public policy is a necessary part of the democratic process, there should be proper care to avoid unnecessary distress or anxiety to the very people we profess to help.  I have pointed out on a number of public occasions, in press statements, in my speech on the Health Estimate and in replies to parliamentary questions, that none of these allegations are true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather unusual situation for me to have to defend the allocation of additional resources for a service rather than to explain the reasons for a pruning of spending.  It appears that Deputy Howlin is opposed to the provision of £1 <Col N="1890" /> million for the development of community services.</P>

      <P>We will come to that in a moment.  The motion is misguided in its suggestion that the decision about the NSSB was designed purely to save on the grant to that body and that the dispersal of their functions would lead to inefficiency. It might be helpful to the debate if I trace in broad outline the background to the development of the services in question.  It will be seen that these services have operated under a number of different umbrellas down the years.</P>
      <P>In 1971, the National Social Service Council were established as an unincorporated body under the aegis of the Minister for Health.  They were set up in order to stimulate and encourage the formation of new voluntary social service councils, the expansion of existing councils and to provide an advisory and information service for them.</P>
      <P>This kind of activity was, of course, complementary to the operations of the health boards themselves who have always operated in partnership with voluntary agencies in the provision of a wide range of community services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, health boards have the power to finance other agencies for the provision of services which they may not deem it appropriate for them to operate directly. This arrangement has many advantages. It encourages an interest by local groups in the welfare of disadvantaged people in their area and it is generally agreed that <Col N="1891" /> it gives scope for a quality of service which in many respects is more acceptable than that available through an official agency.  It continues to be Government policy to encourage this approach to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>I have always valued and acknowledged the work of the independent voluntary movement.  As Minister for Health, I see it as a special duty and opportunity to protect and foster this vital spirit of independence.</P>

      <P>An analysis of these terms of reference make it abundantly clear that the existence of the National Social Service Board was superfluous to the main statutory agencies, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health and health boards.  It raised the question in the Government's mind as to what precisely the role of these agencies was in relation to the functions which I have outlined, and the Government came to the conclusion that working directly or through the relevant Departments and the health boards with the various voluntary agencies concerned was for the future the more efficient way of serving the community needs in information and services.  Incidentally, the Government when recognising the need for a wider approach to the promotion of health arrived at much the same conclusion about the need to transfer the functions of the Health Education Bureau to a health promotion unit within the Department of Health.  In order to develop a comprehensive health promotion strategy I am putting in place a structure which will centralise a health promotion unit in the Department of Health, an advisory council on health promotion representative of the interests involved in the health status of the community and a committee under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health which will include the Ministers for the Environment, Agriculture, <Col N="1892" /> Education, Labour and Energy and will co-ordinate the health promotion policy.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements a wider approach to the promotion of health will be undertaken in a co-ordinated manner to address the broad environmental issues which determine the health status of the community.</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion &mdash; and I want to emphasise this strongly &mdash; that any of the functions prescribed for the NSSB is redundant nor, indeed, that the discharge of them has been defective.</P>
      <P>The decision to discontinue funding of the NSSB after the close of this year was taken by the Government in the context of a review of the functions and activities of all bodies funded by the State.  As Members know, each time a board comes up for renewal of its membership, the Government look at the board to see if there can be rationalisation and to eliminate duplication if there is any.  Members of the House have been crying out for this for years.</P>

      <P>Contrary to what has been said elsewhere, this review was not concerned exclusively with the economic aspects.  Indeed, the real virtue of a streamlining and rationalisation of services is that the services themselves are thereby made more effective and become better co-ordinated.  The size of the provision made by the Government for the new and expanded framework of social services demonstrates quite clearly that we are not engaged simply on a penny-pinching exercise.  While there will be some savings in the area of administration, the Government, at the same time, are making available money which has come from the national lottery to sponsor a substantial development in community work services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed it is relevant to emphasise the point I made earlier of a narrowness of remit by pointing to the fact that £1 million allocation to this particular activity is part of a total sum of £6 million which has been allocated to the following broad sectors of health services activities: mental and physical handicap has been allocated £2,262,000, and services for the aged have been allocated £888,000. Within the next few months we will be producing comprehensive reports on the future development of the services for the mentally and physically handicapped and on the services for the aged.  A sum of £700,000 has been allocated for the development of psychiatric services.  A sum of £1 million has been allocated for services formerly provided by the <Col N="1894" /> National Social Service Board.  A sum of £450,000 has been provided for the AIDS prevention programme and a sum of £700,000 has been allocated for child services including the management of cases of child abuse and alleged child abuse. That is a total of £6 million.</P>
    <P>The bulk of these funds will go to community services and to voluntary effort in the community and it is therefore obviously necessary that there should be available countrywide an organisation of voluntary effort to ensure the use of these allocations to maximum effect.  Everybody will agree that £6 million is a sizeable sum.  Most of this will go to develop community based services mainly through voluntary organisations.  It is important to have appropriate structures in place to ensure that we get the maximum benefit from this money.</P>
    <P>In the course of recent discussions about the allocation of lottery funds for health services, the health boards have been very prominent in promoting the case of voluntary bodies providing services in their areas for a share in this money.  This should be heartening news for people who may have believed that the health boards are heavily orientated towards provision directly of services for the sick to the exclusion of encouragement for community welfare in a broader sense.  It is interesting that a number of the applications for funds from the lottery on behalf of voluntary organisations came through the local area health boards.  It is wrong to suggest that it is something new to involve the area health boards in promoting voluntary effort in the community or in supporting voluntary effort in the community.  In that area there is duplication between what the health boards are doing and what the National Social Service Board did, too.</P>
    <P>Where the NSSB services were concerned, there was a clear logic in the separation of the central information-giving function from that of development and training for local voluntary organisations. There was a strong case for the development of prime responsibility for the latter function to the health boards. <Col N="1895" /> Once this case had been accepted, the arguments for associating the headquarters information service with the Department of Social Welfare rather than with my own Department were compelling. A substantial amount of the inquiries dealt with in the community information centres relate to social welfare entitlements.  In some cases well over half of the inquiries deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Department of Social Welfare should have a particular interest in the survival and development of the community information centres. As Members know, over half of the work of the community information centres related to queries on social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is duplication there.  The Department of Social Welfare operate an information service throughout the country.  However, the nature of this service is of a somewhat different character to that provided through the community information centres.  The departmental offices are the authoritative voice on the legal interpretation of rules about eligibility.  It is also only fair to say, notwithstanding the criticisms frequently levelled at bureaucratic sources, that that Department's Information Service makes every effort to see that the clients who come to them with inquiries are fully informed of their rights under the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, the Social Welfare Information Service itself is fully appreciative of the particular role of the voluntary community information centres.  For one thing, there is a wide network of up to 80 of these centres.  They provide a bridge between the official agencies and the client which is of considerable mutual advantage.  It is important to say that these community information centres will be maintained independently as heretofore. Much expensive official time is saved by persons being directed immediately <Col N="1896" /> towards the service appropriate to their circumstances and assisted in completing forms etc.</P>
    <P>As the CICs are closely associated with the community, operated by persons who are known as neighbours and respected locally, they enjoy the confidence of the people they serve, who may have some hesitation about presenting their problems to an official in the first instance.  I may say, from my personal knowledge of the commitment and sense of service of the people manning these centres that this public trust is fully merited.</P>
    <P>The delivery of public information will be substantially improved with the transfer of responsibility for supporting the centres to the Department of Social Welfare. The centres will continue to be fully serviced along the present lines and will be reviewed with a view to the strengthening of their function both as regards physical lay-out and content of service and as regards their number and location.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare will carry out all the functions in relation to the community information centres which are currently carried out by the National Social Service Board, including training of volunteers, up-dating information sources, publication of relevant information bulletins, payment of grants towards overhead costs of the centres and supporting the development of these centres and new centres.  I hope that the staff of the National Social Service Board which had been working on these duties will appreciate and respond to the opportunity which is now presented by the new arrangements and the additional resources which I have made available for this work.  However, as I have said earlier, to the extent that relocation is not acceptable to any of the staff they will of course be able to avail of the special voluntary redundancy terms for public servants generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had numerous letters from and on behalf of community information centres all around the country expressing concern about their future. I hope these concerns have been dispelled by the details of the new arrangements now announced and I am confident that the centres will grow in strength and importance.</P>
      <P>An important new decision of special interest to the community information centres is the proposal for establishment of an advisory committee representative of relevant interested groups which is to be set up by the Minister for Social Welfare in order to give relevant advice to the Department.  This new committee will be strongly representative of the community information centres themselves.  The centres will thus be directly represented at central level for the first time and will be in a special position, based on their first hand knowledge, to influence the development of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the plans for sustaining and extending the networks of community information centres, there will also be a review of the present arrangements about public information services generally in consultation with other relevant public bodies.  It is the Government's concern to ensure that all areas of the country should be adequately and comprehensively serviced.  Some research in relation to this has already been carried out.  The Department will be expected to take this work up and <Col N="1898" /> prepare proposals and costings for submission and subsequent decision by the Government.  I should make it clear that this exercise, although related to the functions of the community information centres, will be a separate undertaking. The normal running of the community information centres will not be disturbed when the National Social Service Board ceases to function on 31 December.</P>
    <P>The development and training function of the NSSB, viz., the encouragement of the formation and growth of local voluntary effort is already a responsibility of the health boards for the support of this type of activity.  This activity will be co-ordinated and developed from a special unit to be set up within the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Organised voluntary provision has long been a feature of Irish social services and the growth of this movement over the past couple of decades has been rapid. This growth has largely paralleled the development of the community care structure of the health boards.  A central feature has been the formation of social service councils to co-ordinate voluntary and statutory services at local level.</P>
    <P>It is timely in these days of scarce resources for services to consider how this co-operation may be further strengthened and developed.  Responsibility for this must be clearly focused on the health boards.  The new emphasis on the role of the health board will take place within the context of a review of policy in relation to the development of community-based social services supported by the health boards.  Particular emphasis has been laid in the consultative statement on health policy <i>Health &mdash; The Wider Dimensions</i> on the development of community-based services.</P>
    <P>Health boards have responsibility for a wide range of needs of the elderly, child care, the handicapped and problems arising from social disadvantage.  The encouragement of local voluntary effort and the strengthening of neighbourhood networks are essential to the arrangements envisaged in the consultative statement. The implementation of this policy requires the development of programmes <Col N="1899" /> which respond to local needs.  The health boards, which are directly in touch with local opinion, are best suited to promote such programmes.  The development of support systems in the community to facilitate the process of a shift from institutional to community care is a crucial element of health policy and one to which top priority will have to be given in the coming years.  This fresh impetus to local development is guaranteed by the establishment of a special development fund to finance fresh initiatives for the organisation of voluntary personal services.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that health boards will develop formal local training programmes in consultation with educational establishments such as the regional technical colleges.  There is a considerable reservoir of potential voluntary resources available within the community which can benefit hugely from such a facility.  The Institute of Public Administration is being asked to undertake a central specialist training role, in association with its reorganised Health Services Unit.  This will function as a resource for the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I should also like to reaffirm that the National Council for the Aged will continue to operate and to be fully financed as heretofore.  This body operated quite independently of the NSSB.  Its association with the NSSB was solely for administrative convenience.  The council's function is to advise the Minister on all aspects of the welfare of the elderly.  It has also carried out extensive research on issues affecting the elderly and has published a number of reports on problems affecting the aged.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should also refer to the arrangements for insurance for voluntary organisations which has been sponsored by the National Social Service Board. This was a relatively minor part of the National Social Service Board services but an important one and this facility should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to some points made by Deputies Howlin and Desmond.  I want to assure Deputy <Col N="1900" /> Howlin that the community information centres will still prevail.  Indeed I have no doubt but that the numbers attending them will continue to increase.  They will be serviced by a unit within the Department of Social Welfare who will provide similar, if not an enhanced, service in terms of information.  Training will be available to volunteers to man these services. Training for the development of organisations generally will be my responsibility as Minister for Health.  We will fill that role by involving the health boards more than they are already involved.  I am sure every Member of this House would agree that the health boards should be more involved in promoting community development through voluntary organisations, at all times respecting the independence of the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The National Council for the Aged is unaffected.  The National Social Service Board was only a middle man who paid the cheque.  The National Council for the Aged have their own advisory council and are not subject to the National Service Board.  I hope the outline I have given will satisfy the House and the public at large that there will be no deterioration in the quality of the services heretofore operating under the National Social Service Board and that the generous resources now provided by the Government will ensure a substantial basis for their further development.</P>

      <P>I am glad the amendment we have tabled will have the support of all Opposition Deputies so that we can ensure the continuation of the National Social Service Board as an independent &mdash; I stress independent &mdash; community information service.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister for Health has made many half-hearted decisions since he took office but one of the harshest decisions of all was the one to eliminate the budget of the NSSB.  In 1987 this board had a budget of £580,000, £478,000 of which was for the board itself and the remaining £102,000 for the National Council for the Aged.  If one breaks down this budget one can see that just under £250,000 went towards salaries &mdash; that was 52 per cent of the overall budget; £80,000 went towards administration; £19,000 went towards rent and rates and there were a number of other subheads but £114,000 went towards programmes, publications and other services for the 11 county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Social Service Board have a lease on a premises until 1995 and no matter what happens they are legally bound to stay with that lease until that year.  The rent and rates on the lease <Col N="1902" /> amount to £28,000 per year.  Much has been said this evening about the NSSB. The Minister has a responsibility not only to that board but also to all the parties in this House to review his position in relation to the board.</P>
    <P>My party have already stated that they support the level of spending in the health services but this support obliges the Minister to listen and to be reasonable and flexible when constructive proposals are put forward by parties in Opposition.  The decision to abolish the National Social Service Board was one of the most socially regressive decisions made by any Minister for Health in this country.  I made that comment during the Estimates speech earlier in the year and I have not changed my mind on the matter in any way since.</P>
    <P>This decision proves that the Minister is an instrument for the officials in his Department and in the Department of Finance.  The National Social Service Board and the Health Education Bureau have been abolished.  Both of these services were independent of Department of Health officials and I believe that is the reason they were abolished.  Departmental officials do not like organisations which are independent.  Most people in the House will recall that when the present Taoiseach was Minister for Health there was great tension between the director of the National Social Service Council, as it was then named, and himself because of published figures in relation to social welfare payments.  This created much embarrassment for the Government at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin also recalled your comments, Minister, about <i>Relate</i> magazine, the publication of the NSSB.  He went into some detail on that matter and I will not repeat it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from what was said that not only are the Minister's officials against the existence of the board but that the Taoiseach and the Minister seem to have their own reasons for axing it.  The Minister's stance with regard to this board must be reviewed for the following reasons.  First, the integrity and usefulness of the information service depends on the independence of that service as perceived by the voluntary community information centres throughout the country.  About 100,000 people avail of these services every year.  I have been told by officials within the organisation that the number availing of these services has increased dramatically since the controversy about the future of the board erupted some time ago.  Many more people are now availing of the services as a result of the publicity it got because of the threat to its existence.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there is no economic justification for the decision to abolish the board.  Redeployment of staff will mean that 52 per cent of the present cost of the service will continue to be paid.  If attempts are made to continue the service through the health boards and Government Departments it will be necessary to provide funding and, as we have already heard tonight, this will be even more expensive than the service that existed. It is obvious that it will be more expensive as the Minister is now allocating £1 million from the national lottery to continue the service.  This amount is being dispersed through the health boards, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  Surely it is the utmost fallacy, even bordering on lunacy, to take the service from one efficient body and diffuse it to ten alternative agencies.  Surely it is rationalisation which is irrational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government state that the backup service for the community information centres is to be rationalised by putting the funding under the health boards and <Col N="1904" /> the advisory backup either under the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare or both.  This means that there will be ten agencies dealing with one service.  I repeat that it is sheer madness to carry on an exercise such as this.</P>
    <P>The other services such as publications and the development of voluntary organisations were not mentioned by the Government until this evening.  Everything that is now planned can be done by the NSSB in an independent way.  I seriously question the Minister's policy as announced this evening.  The axing of the board means that everything the Minister has already said about the elderly and about community services was just lip service since he is now even abolishing the Council for the Aged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They will lose their independence. They will be controlled by the health boards which are at the moment the most inefficient units in health.  A number of insensitive and anti-social decisions have been made by this Government since taking office.  The elimination of the NSSB, along with the reduction in the role of the Office of Ombudsman, are definitely anti-social as these two organisations represented the voice of the voiceless.  The closure of this board is one of the most cynical acts performed by a Government who, prior to the last election, assured us that the less well off, the handicapped and the elderly would not suffer because of cuts in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now obvious that the Minister's concern is partly about saving and partly about taking independence from the NSSB.  The Minister said it was a decision not about cost cutting but about reorganisation. <Col N="1905" /> Since £1 million has now been made available from the national lottery for community information and development services there is no reason not to agree with the amendment put down here tonight by my party.  Since 1987 the poor have become poorer, the disadvantaged more disadvantaged and the privileged more privileged.  The NSSB gives a service to the people who cannot help themselves and do not have access to the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>The number of families in the Cork area depending on the St. Vincent de Paul has increased by a massive 80 per cent this year.  An organisation like the NSSB is a lifeline for such people.  Poverty is not entirely about lack of money; it is about lack of opportunity and lack of access to State agencies and State services, educational or otherwise.  There is now serious poverty all over the country and bodies like the NSSB and the Office of the Ombudsman are links between disadvantaged sections of the community and the State.  These links, because of recent decisions, are becoming more and more fragile.  There is an ever-widening division between the rich and poor.  Irish society is in great danger if we do not realise that because of the ever-increasing poverty gap many people are being alienated from the structures of the State. There are organisations who will, for their own political reasons, exploit the poverty gap.  The NSSB represent an independent lifeline to State services and this is now threatened.  If the activities of the community information services offices are limited in any way or if their independence is threatened these services will be supplied by organisations that appear to have the resources to exploit the gap and they will exploit the frustrations and anxieties of the people who are suffering because of cutbacks.</P>
    <P>A recent opinion poll showed that a substantial majority of Irish people who are not living in poverty are satisfied with what they have and that there is a wealth of goodwill towards any Government that set about the task of eliminating poverty in a genuine way in this country. <Col N="1906" /> Inaccessibility to State services is the fundamental basis of poverty.  The Minister is creating a greater divide between the haves and the have nots.  Poverty is where people are denied access to what is regarded as a reasonable quality of life, a reasonable standard of education, health etc.  The Minister's decision to eliminate the board is a denial of people's rights.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I must refer to the recent publication <i>The Widening Poverty Gap</i> by the Conference of Major Religious Orders which gives a frightening statistic. I refer also to the publication today by the Combat Poverty Agency.  The main conclusion of this body which was published today in a study entitled, <i>A Case for An Independent Community Service</i>, is that there is a need for greater public access to information on the operation of the social welfare services not only at the point of application but throughout the process of the claim.  The Commission on Social Welfare has also endorsed the need for greater public information on an independent basis.  That same report which we received today says, in the concluding paragraph, that the implications of abolishing the NSSB will be particularly serious for the poor and is of great concern to the Combat Poverty Agency, that without the services provided by the NSSB, local information centres and the necessary central back-up, access to State services is made more difficult for all.  For the poor for whom State services are a lifeline, curtailment of the information services has serious consequences.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision before the vote is taken next Wednesday night because certainly his proposal will be defeated by all the Opposition parties here if he does not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I have the opportunity of contributing and I thank Deputy Allen for sharing his time with me.  Tonight I have heard the most extraordinary dressing up of what in retrospect was clearly a daft decision in the first place, to abolish the National Social Service Board.  The Minister has now couched it in terms of being the most <Col N="1907" /> extraordinary initiative in the support and development of community services.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it was Erskine Childers, a former Minister of his own Party, who in 1971 set up the NSSB &mdash; a council at the time &mdash; for the purpose of developing and strengthening voluntary organisations.  If the Minister is serious in his commitment to the development of community services, I suggest there is a great deal he could do in the direct services, which are the responsibility of his Department, by developing community nursing and day care centres instead of closing them down as has been the pattern, without starting to interfere in the whole voluntary area which was developing quite nicely under the aegis of the NSSB.</P>
      <P>This decision is being justified in retrospect in the most extraordinary fashion. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that this is a major response, that £1 million out of the £1.2 billion which we spent on health is a serious contribution towards altering the balance of our health services? I say it is not.  I say it is dressing up a decision that is indefensible without going to these extraordinary lengths.  If it was so well planned and so well thought out, why was it only this week that the Minister was able to indicate that the community information services would be run from the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

I suggest that at this stage alone, and certainly by the time the Minister has gone through dealing with the board and making all the changes that are necessary and initiating contacts with health boards, he will have spent the other half million pounds in the valuable time of his officials and health board officials.  Those people who have been developing this service could well use that extra half million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision has two features that <Col N="1908" /> seem to be appearing in an awful lot of the decisions of this Government.  I have no doubt, despite how the Minister dresses it up, that what actually happened was the Minister needed another half million off his budget and it was slashed to satisfy the Department of Finance.  It was only when the Minister looked at the detail and had to commit himself to maintaining the staff and the services that it became clear the net saving was so small and he adopted a new policy that it was not economic but reorganisational and developmental.  I do not accept that. It has two features common to many decisions.  On paper it had an economic benefit in cost cutting terms.  Also this agency is independent and accessible to people.  It is now going the same way as the Ombudsman's office, support for which is being withdrawn, An Foras Forbartha which is being axed and the advisory agricultural agencies to which the ordinary farmer has access.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the escape of methane gas from a flat complex in Howth.  Deputy Cosgrave has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for granting me this opportunity to raise a serious matter of public safety.  This block of flats was erected approximately four years ago and it is on the main Howth Road between Sutton and Howth.  There are 43 apartments in the complex and I must mention at this stage that they are of excellent design and of the highest standard of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that complaints concerning the presence of gas were made by the residents some six to eight weeks ago.  Dublin County Council acted promptly on these reports and have carried <Col N="1909" /> out daily checks since, in order to monitor the situation.  The apartment block complex has Dublin gas supply.</P>
    <P>The Gas UNI report carried out by the Dutch consultants pointed out that part of the Dublin gas grid could not be identified on maps.  Can the Minister assure me tonight that the gas grid does not extend to Sutton or is not in this complex? Is this the problem with regard to the presence of gas there?</P>
    <P>Legislation has been promised on building by-law regulations.  This legislation should insist that domestic dwellings cannot be constructed without stringent regulations for gas safety.  I call here for proper investigation of the site and foundations before any building commences, especially where houses and blocks of flats are being constructed, to ensure that there are no gas risks.  This legislation should also cover methane gas.  The Cremer and Warner report after the Raglan House explosion specifically called for this legislation.  Could the Minister inform me when it is expected that it will be before the House?</P>
    <P>I must point out that Dublin Gas engineers have carried out extensive tests on the buildings and on the ground surrounding this complex and say that natural gas is not the cause of the present consistent explosive readings which were found on the site yesterday and led to the evacuation of the apartment block last evening.  Reports indicate that the origin of this gas is marsh gas, or methane gas. The apartments are erected over a disused quarry and reports suggest that decomposition of vegetation in the quarry has caused the build up of methane gas.  I therefore call on the Minister to have the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards sample the gas and ascertain its origin.  When the origin of this gas is discovered, I call on the Minister to take all the necessary steps to have the source of the gas sealed and rendered harmless, thus allowing the residents to reoccupy their apartments.  I am sure that the Minister is aware that the residents are anxious to have the apartments declared safe and to reoccupy them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> I take this opportunity to compliment Mr. George Redmond, the Dublin Assistant City and County Manager, and his staff for their prompt attention to this emergency.  I also thank the Garda Síochána and the members of the Dublin Fire Brigade for their excellent attention to the emergency.  We are aware that the area has been monitored daily since last September.  Surely a three minute warning in such circumstances, as reported in this evening's papers, is not good enough. I ask the Minister to investigate that matter.</P>
    <P>In the Baldoyle, Sutton, Howth and Raheny areas quite a number of such complexes have been erected in the last few years.  One can see them dotted from Fairview out.  They are excellent buildings. I should like the Minister to have all of these, especially those in my own constituency, inspected to ensure that there is none of this unidentified piping from the Dublin gas grid present in any of the buildings and to give me an assurance that he will carry out that inspection as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister assure me that all necessary investigations and work will be carried out on the Sutton complex to render the apartments absolutely safe for the residents?  Would he consider compensation for the tenants who had to leave their homes last evening and get accommodation locally in hotels?  I understand that the residents may not be in their apartments this evening.  Someone must be responsible.  Surely compensation should be arranged for them, either by the Minister's Department, Dublin County Council or the people who own this complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your assistance, but shall not take the full amount of time.  I want to come in in support of my colleague.  As you know, I have had an interest in gas in the Dublin region for a considerable time, long <Col N="1911" /> before it became popular to take an interest in this area and long before the explosion in Raglan House.  Recently, as my party's spokesman on urban renewal, I visited the Liverpool docks complex. They had very serious problems there with methane gas from poor piling practice. I suspect that the same problem arises in Sutton, that the foundations have not been properly laid.  When this matter is investigated it will most likely be found that the foundations when being laid were not properly piled or packed, and that this is the source of the methane gas problem.</P>
      <P>I want to call tonight for the creation of a Dublin gas safety board to deal, not just with the distribution of natural gas but also with emergencies arising from gas problems.  It is a serious matter when tenants in Sutton or any other part of the city have to leave their homes in such circumstances.  It happened in Dophin House in my own constituency and in Nicholas Street, literally on the borderline of my constituency.  It is a serious matter when people have to be evacuated from their homes because of gas, whether it be methane, natural gas, or any other form of gas.  Unfortunately, these occurrences have been far too frequent and far too easily accepted by both the Department of Energy and the Department of the Environment during this Minister's time and, indeed, in the past also.  It is time that we looked into the need for the creation of a State agency for the safe distribution of gas and for gas safety generally in the capital and perhaps on a national basis, but specifically in the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention of the House should be drawn to the fact that recent allegations coming from within the New Dublin Gas Company state that there are 900 cases of arrears of gas emergency calls in that company.  Despite the fact that time and again I have raised this matter in the House, and there has been an informal <i>ad hoc</i> committee of Dublin Deputies interested in the matter, it seems difficult to get all the agencies necessary interested in the safe distribution of gas <Col N="1912" /> in this city and to concentrate their minds on that.  Coming into the cold weather, whether the gas be methane or New Dublin gas, we have to know if Dublin is safe for gas distribution.  With my colleague, Deputy Cosgrave, I have been pressing in this House, almost on a daily basis for the implementation of by-law legislation which the Minister has been promising me on a regular basis as being imminent, coming, will be here shortly, will be here in this session.  That legislation will be intended to deal with the build-up of gas within the cavities of domestic dwellings and, in regard to the recommendations contained in the report of Cremer and Warner, dwellings of the kind in Sutton and high rise domestic dwellings such as Raglan House.  By-law legislation is supposed to deal with those and related matters.</P>
    <P>That legislation is urgently required and I have been pressing for it on a weekly basis as the Minister will acknowledge. There could be a build-up of methane gas within these cavities just as easily as there could be a build-up of New Dublin Gas and in any event we do not even know whether if there were to be a gas explosion caused by the build-up of methane gas, other gas pipes would be affected because in some cases New Dublin Gas do not even know where the pipes are.  This is a very serious matter and the seriousness of the potential dangers from the build up of gas is not being taken into account as it might be either by the Government or by this House.  It is about time that we though about the creation of a New Dublin Gas safety board which would be concerned about the safe distribution of all gas in the city. I hope the Minister of State will give some attention to that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to say that I share the concern expressed by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Michell in relation to the recent developments which have taken place at Offington Manor in Howth.  We are all aware of the potentially serious or even fatal consequences of gas leaks <Col N="1913" /> which are allowed to build up to explosive levels and I would point out that marsh gas or methane is no less dangerous than commercial gas from the distribution system.</P>
      <P>The House may be interested to know the background to the present situation. Both New Dublin Gas and Dublin County Council have been monitoring the area around Offington Manor for the presence of gas leaks.  Leak samples were analysed by New Dublin Gas last August and also by an independent laboratory abroad.  Each analysis confirmed that the gas detected did not originate from the distribution system and this information was conveyed to Dublin County Council. The council have been carrying out their own monitoring programme and, as a consequence, detected a recent rapid rise of gas in the vicinity of Offington Manor. A sample of this gas has been sent to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards by the council to establish whether it is marsh gas.  While these results are not yet available, I understand that a corresponding sample has been analysed by New Dublin Gas who are fully satisfied that it did not come from their distribution system.</P>
      <P>The gas grid is the responsibility of New Dublin Gas and the Minister for Energy.  I am not shirking my responsibility as this is a very serious matter.  I can assure the Deputy that the Building Control Bill which was referred to will shortly come before the House.  The IIRS are testing gas samples at the request of New Dublin Gas and excavation procedures have been carried out under the emergency plan of the Garda Síochána and the local authority.  I appreciate the position of the residents and the owners and I understand that this is a very serious matter.  I have asked Dublin County Council to give me a report as soon as possible and if action had to be taken I can assure the Deputy I will refer the matter to the appropriate authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be glad to know that I have been informed this evening that gas concentrations have declined to nil and that the fire authority have lifted the ban on occupation of the apartments.  This is <Col N="1914" /> not the end of the story however.  The council will continue to monitor the presence of gas in the area and keep the position generally under review.  They will also consider what action is open to them including their powers under the Fire Services Act.  It goes without saying that my Department have asked the local authority to let us have a report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A further matter which will require attention is the conclusive identification of the origin and nature of the gas concerned. Remedial measures will require to be taken including such measures as are necessary to stop the gas emissions altogether or to ensure that any emissions which occur are safely vented to the open air or otherwise dealt with.  This is something for consideration by the owners of the apartments in question in the first instance.  In saying this, I am conscious of the report of the Task Force on Multi-Storey Buildings which recommends that, where remedial or other measures may need to be taken in relation to buildings coming within their remit, these should be set in train by the owners of the buildings concerned.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to emphasise again the importance of the building regulations.  I want to assure the House that these regulations will be brought before the House as soon as possible for debate.  I also want to assure the Deputies and the House that all the necessary measures to deal with this will now be taken.  I understand the seriousness of it and we will keep this matter under constant monitoring.  I want to assure the Deputy that whatever action has to be taken once we have received the report will be taken.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the tribunal are wide ranging and constitute a significant input to the ongoing development of Government policy concerning fire safety and the fire services generally. Many of the recommendations have been implemented.  Others, of their nature, <Col N="1770" /> require implementation on an on-going basis and this is being done.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in the development of the fire service and in fire safety generally in this decade. Areas in which progress has been made are the legislative and regulatory framework; capital investment in modern fire stations, appliances and equipment; staff structure, training and training facilities; and emergency planning.</P>

      <P>Because of the complexity of the issues involved progress in some matters has not been as rapid as one would like.  I can, however, assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment and my own to assist fire authorities in the development of the service, and of fire safety generally as quickly and as comprehensively as possible.  An indication of that commitment is the fact that, despite the current financial constraints on public expenditure, the capital provision for the fire service in 1988 is, in fact, being increased over the present year's provision by almost 40 per cent. This will ensure that the necessary progress in the provision of modern fire stations, training facilities, appliances and ancillary equipment will continue.</P>

      <P>A layout and cost plan for a ten house local authority housing scheme at Cullairbaun, Athenry, County Galway, is the only proposal from Galway County Council before my Department at present.  The capital provided this year for the local authority housing construction programme has already been <Col N="1771" /> fully allocated and it is not possible to issue sanction in 1987 for this scheme.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to indicate for next year what funds will be made available to individual housing authorities and consequently what schemes may be approved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 76 together.  Deputies will be aware of the Government's proposals for distribution of the national lottery surplus. A sum of £6 million has been made available to my Department from the surplus for allocation to amenity projects proposed by local authorities and voluntary bodies.  Projects to be assisted will include the provision and development of open spaces and amenity and landscaping works designed to enhance the local environment.  The provision of recreational facilities such as parks, outdoor playing areas, community centres and youth clubs will also be assisted.  The schemes will be administered through the local authorities and all counties and county boroughs will benefit.  In allocating grants, account will also be taken of the need to enhance the historical, recreational and amenity value of designated urban renewal areas, thereby contributing to the general effort to secure the renewal of the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>Seven bathing areas have been monitored in accordance with the requirements of EC Directive 75/160 on the quality of bathing water.  The beaches involved are Portmarnock, Dollymount, Courtown, Tramore, Fountainstown, Salthill and Cappa Pier (Kilrush).  Compliance has been achieved for all the bathing waters monitored except for Dollymount beach in 1986 and 1987 when the level of compliance with the standards for total coliforms and faecal coliforms was just below that required by the directive.  I intend that the requirements of the directive will be formally extended to a substantial number of additional bathing places with effect from the 1988 bathing season.</P>

      <P>To put matters in perspective, the rates support grant reduction announced for next year amounts to less than 3 per cent of the estimated revenue accruing to local authorities in 1987.  The rates support grant is only one of a number of factors which have an influence on staffing levels in local authorities.  Other factors would include the level of income from other sources and the potential for savings on manpower costs from measures such as non-filling of vacancies arising through natural wastage; redeployment: career breaks and other economies.  Local authority managers are preparing, in the context of the 1988 Estimates process, targets for the number of voluntary redundancies to be achieved. Full information on the overall reduction in staffing levels envisaged will not be available pending the completion of this process.</P>

This took account of an ecological impact study and a study of the consequences for agriculture. It is for Clare County Council to ensure compliance with the Moneypoint planning permission.

However, the imposition of an absolute time limit on An Bord Pleanála without safeguards to deal with extreme cases could give rise to a challenge in the courts on constitutional grounds.  I am at present examining all the options open to me including new legislation with a view to having all but the most exceptional cases dealt with in four months.

    <P>The decision to designate areas for the purpose of urban renewal incentives in nine new urban centres was taken by the Government following careful consideration of all relevant factors.  The towns involved were chosen on the basis of their size and status, geographical distribution, need for urban renewal and <Col N="1783" /> prospects for redevelopment.  There are, of course, many other towns that could benefit from designation but it was considered that the incentives should be extended to a limited number of urban centres at this stage.  The benefit of the whole urban renewal scheme could be dissipated by its application on too widespread a basis.  The operation of the scheme including the terms of the financial incentives is being monitored constantly and consideration will be given to future extensions or modifications as circumstances warrant.</P>

      <P>The law already provides substantial sanctions for the offences referred to by the Deputy.  So far as road traffic law is concerned section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended, makes it an offence to drive a vehicle, whether stolen or not, in a public place in such a manner as to be a danger to the public.  Where dangerous driving causes death or serious bodily harm, the offender is liable, on conviction on indictment, to a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and/or a £3,000 fine.  The provision for an indictable offence in this form was introduced because of the difficulty which had been experienced in securing convictions for manslaughter in dangerous driving cases which resulted in death.</P>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions can, at his discretion and depending on the circumstances of the case, opt to take proceedings for manslaughter where somebody is killed as a result of dangerous driving or some other offence such as drunken driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the driver and any passenger can be convicted of the taking of a vehicle <Col N="1790" /> without authority under section 112 of the 1961 Act and the same maximum penalties apply to both.  The maximum penalties were substantially increased as recently as 1984.  On summary conviction, they are a fine of £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or both the fine and imprisonment.  The 1984 legislation also introduced the possibility of conviction on indictment with a maximum fine of £2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.  As to whether the legislation should be further strengthened, I am prepared to consider any views which interested parties may have as part of my current review of road traffic legislation.</P>

      <P>5,315 local authority houses were started in 1985 and in 1986 the number was 2,599.  While final figures are not yet available for 1987 it is expected that there will have been about 1,000 new starts during the year.  In relation to 1988, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 47 on 21 October in which I outlined the procedures involved in determining and allocating the funds for new capital projects in 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative basis for the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes is contained in section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended.  This section was last amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 which provided for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> Prior to the implementation of the equal treatment provisions allowance was made for rent or mortgage payments where the wife of an unemployment assistance claimant was employed under a contract of service.  The allowance, which was deducted from the net earnings of the claimant's wife, was made as a household expense when assessing the value to the husband as &ldquo;head of the household&rdquo; of his wife's income from employment.  No such allowance was made in respect of unmarried claimants.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1985, which came into operation in November 1986, provided for the deletion of the reference to the &ldquo;head of the household&rdquo; because the concept was incompatible with the principle of equal treatment.  The amended legislation provides that the value to the household of all income earned by the claimant's spouse must be assessed as means.  As rent and mortgage payments are of value to the household, they are not disregarded in assessing the spouse's income as means.  Allowance is made, however, in respect of employment related expenses incurred by a spouse.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Preservation of Rights) (No. 2) Regulations 1986 provide for transitional arrangements for certain persons who were adversely affected by the equal treatment provisions.  These regulations, which pending review have been extended until the end of this year, include provision for the continuation of allowances made in respect of rent or mortgage payments in assessing the value to a person as head of the household of his spouse's income from employment in cases where the claimant had been in receipt of unemployment assistance in November 1986.</P>

      <P>The size of the areas designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986 in each of the five county boroughs is 162 acres in Dublin (in addition to the Custom House Docks area), 99 acres in Cork, 39 acres in Limerick and 14 acres in each of Galway and Waterford.  The information being sought by the Deputy in relation to development projects is primarily a matter between the individual developers and the local authorities concerned. I am responsible for the policy underlying the urban renewal initiative but I have no function in relation to individual projects.  My Department have, however, been keeping in touch with the progress being achieved and I am willing to let the Deputy have details of the projects that have commenced or are expected to commence shortly.  I will communicate with the Deputy in the next few days.</P>

      <P>The average cost per family of serviced sites for travellers will vary from one location <Col N="1802" /> to another depending on local circumstances &mdash; for example the number of family pitches to be provided, the distance from existing roads and sanitary services, the topography of the site itself and the amount of screening which must be provided.  In these circumstances it is not possible to provide a guide price in terms of cost per family for the provision of sites.  The objective is to ensure that sites are provided in the most cost-effective way possible.  To date there has been no case of any serviced sites for travellers being provided at double or treble the cost of conventional local authority housing.</P>
